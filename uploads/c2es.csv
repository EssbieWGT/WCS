With cash abruptly stripped away, local governments and organizations have been scrambling for other ways to fund these projects.
And while some groups have sued over the reneged grants, some federal courts are siding with the Trump administration, taking the lead of the Supreme Court.

“I am not looking into any federal grants.","President Donald Trump’s efforts to stamp out his predecessor’s climate legacy are making some nonprofits and local governments wary of relying on Uncle Sam.

Since Trump took office, his administration has clawed back billions of dollars in federal grants, leaving climate and resiliency projects in the lurch and casting doubt on whether promises of funding from the federal government are as dependable as they once were, writes my colleague Alex Guillén.

The tiny village of Kipnuk, Alaska, for example, suddenly lost a $20 million grant to build a rock wall and take other steps to stop homes from falling into a river. In Mississippi, a nonprofit saw two grants terminated: $500,000 to turn dilapidated housing lots into community parks and $20 million for a solar-powered hurricane shelter.

With cash abruptly stripped away, local governments and organizations have been scrambling for other ways to fund these projects. The experience has left them feeling dismayed at federal agencies that had long been a reliable source of support.

“My mind was like, how could they terminate the grant, even when we did not do anything wrong?” Rayna Paul, Kipnuk’s environmental director, told Alex.

Federal agencies have long been critical in supporting resiliency projects in small communities across the country, but former President Joe Biden’s 2022 climate law opened the door for larger projects to be funded wholly by the U.S. government. That meant less cobbling together of funding from various donors or benefactors.

But now that money is gone. And while some groups have sued over the reneged grants, some federal courts are siding with the Trump administration, taking the lead of the Supreme Court.

Applying for federal awards can be both tedious and time consuming. If federal grants are now also unreliable, some recipients doubt they will seek support from Washington in the future.

“I am not looking into any federal grants. The risk is way too high, and the effort is way too large,” said Dominika Parry, with the nonprofit 2°C Mississippi, which spent 10 months working with the Environmental Protection Agency on its grant application to make microparks out of home lots.

For larger nonprofits, grant cuts have been major disappointments but not dire.

GRID Alternatives, a California nonprofit with a staff of roughly 500, will likely scale back its ambitions after it lost more than $300 million in federal grants to expand its work funding solar projects on low-income housing and tribal lands.

At smaller groups, the cuts have been more damaging. Parry has started to work without pay to cut costs. She said The Hartford, the Connecticut-based insurance company that provides 2°C with basic general liability coverage, also told her recently that it will not renew the nonprofit’s policy. The reason: insuring environmental groups is too risky.

Sierra Club gets new leader

The Sierra Club has a new boss after years of internal turbulence and leadership drama, writes Robin Bravender.

The environmental group’s board unanimously voted Saturday to hire Loren Blackford as executive director. Blackford has been a leader at the Sierra Club for nearly two decades, including serving as deputy executive director, as president and as the Sierra Club Foundation board chair.

The move comes after the board fired Ben Jealous from the executive director position in August “for cause” following “extensive evaluation of his conduct.”

Jealous was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint earlier this year, a person familiar with the details of the complaint told POLITICO’s E&E News. Jealous, the former head of the NAACP and the Sierra Club’s first Black leader, said he faced discrimination and a campaign against him during his time leading the group.

Hurricanes, with a side of measles?

Florida’s plans to scrap its vaccine requirements could increase the risk of disease outbreaks during future hurricane seasons, writes Ariel Wittenberg.

The state’s surgeon general announced this month that Florida’s Department of Health would begin the process of allowing people to opt out of vaccine mandates for “personal health benefits.” Public health experts worry that the policy could make matters worse during future hurricane seasons, as climate change fuels stronger storms in the Atlantic.

“Something like measles is so infectious, it would go through a hurricane shelter like wildfire,” said Katie Huffling, executive director for the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

Long road ahead for Alaska LNG

The lead developer of Alaska LNG touted new deals last week, but the mammoth liquefied natural gas project remains far from the finish line, writes Carlos Anchondo.

The project aims to build a natural gas pipeline across the state, along with an export terminal. Majority owner Glenfarne Group unveiled two new partnerships last week — one with JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company, and another with POSCO International, a South Korean trading and investment company.

The project also has the support of the Trump administration, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright calling it “one of the greatest energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history.” But Alaska has been trying to build a gas pipeline for decades, and it’s no small feat.

“It’s a tall order and it’s an expensive order,” said Brigham McCown, a senior fellow and director of the Initiative on American Energy Security at the Hudson Institute.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Electric-Grid.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:49.209081

(Erie News Now) — Solar energy advocates are warning Americans could see higher electricity bills, in part, due to clean energy rollbacks they say are squeezing supply as demand surges.

Advocates say the fight isn’t just about clean energy — it’s about pocketbook issues for families and businesses.

With electricity demand climbing, the industry warns that rolling back solar could leave Americans paying more while losing the upper hand in the clean-tech and AI race to global rivals.

The U.S. solar industry is on the rise, adding 18 gigawatts of new power in just the first half of 2025. That’s more than half of all new capacity to the grid—but momentum may be dimming.

“Demand is rising at a time when the federal government is trying to constrict supply,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

She says in most markets, solar is the most affordable form of energy — and that putting more affordable supply on the grid drives down costs for everybody.

But a new report by the SEIA found that Americans are on track to face higher energy bills. The potential cost increase comes after big changes to phase out Biden-era clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act. The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, phases out many of the clean energy tax credits.

“Since the passage of the Big, Beautiful Bill, we have seen a number of things happen,” said Ross Hopper. “The federal government has begun to use all the tools at its disposal to make it harder to build solar and storage projects across the country.”

Ross Hopper says the changes and other federal cuts threaten up to 55 gigawatts of solar by 2030, a 25% drop.

“You don’t have to have a policy in economics to know what happens then. Electricity prices are rising. We’ve already seen a 10% year-over-year increase in electricity prices. That’s going to continue if we continue to limit supply,” said Ross Hopper.

Solar supporters argue fast, affordable projects are key to meeting skyrocketing demand from data centers, EVs and other emerging tech. But not everyone supports using taxpayer dollars to meet that demand.

“There’s an old saying, if it’s market ready, you don’t have to subsidize it,” said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). “I am not against solar, I’m not against wind, I’m not against any of it. But I like sustainable power, sustainable energy sources. And while that may be important right now, should we be subsidizing it? We’ve got to be careful what we’re spending money on and what we’re subsidizing.”

Solar advocates stress it's not just a blue-state issue. 77% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states won by President Trump, including eight of the top 10 solar-leading states.

“The political backlash against solar and storage is impacting the very constituents that voted for President Trump,” said Ross Hopper.",https://WICU.images.worldnow.com/images/26602107_G.jpeg,N,,2025-09-15 18:00:13.049569

A bipartisan House proposal to “modernize” the National Environmental Policy Act has support from electric utilities who say it would help them build generation and transmission capacity they need to maintain the reliability of the nation’s electric grid.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act would shorten permitting timelines, simplify the analysis NEPA requires, establish judicial review limitations and limit the use of procedural efforts to block projects, according to bill sponsors.

“The problems with the NEPA process are energy-neutral,” Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said Wednesday at a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing. “They can be detrimental to both fossil fuel and renewable energy projects. … These problems with NEPA can cut both ways, and so, too, should the solutions. This is a pro-energy bill that takes an all-of-the-above, technology-neutral approach.”

Dive Insight:

Permitting reform has drawn bipartisan efforts in recent years, but previous proposals failed to yield results. With the nation’s electric grid facing rapid demand growth, renewed efforts have focused on the need add resources and maintain reliability.

Golden and Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, introduced the SPEED Act in July.

“We need robust power production and transmission to achieve energy dominance and lower costs. ... But NEPA has been warped over time to become a law that allows endless lawsuits and bureaucracy,” Golden said.

According to a summary of the legislation Golden provided, the SPEED Act will

Focus environmental reviews on “direct, significant impacts rather than hypothetical or tenuously connected effects.”

Create “reasonable timelines” for agency decisionmaking.

Streamline judicial reviews.

Clarify when a NEPA review is triggered by refining the definition of major federal action.

The MFA category “has grown so broad that nearly any federal action or funding can trigger a lengthy, complex review,” Golden’s statement said.

At Wednesday’s hearing, ClearPath Action CEO Jeremy Harrell said the broken permitting system is “the single largest barrier to deploying new clean energy in this country,” with solar energy projects facing the highest rate of NEPA litigation of all energy sources. “There’s a major challenge here.”

Electric utilities are supporting the legislation.

“Streamlining outdated permitting processes will help America’s electric companies better serve our customers and help our nation achieve energy dominance,” Edison Electric Institute President and CEO Drew Maloney said in a statement. “We ... urge Congress to advance this common-sense legislation that meaningfully removes roadblocks and supports the infrastructure that powers communities across America.” The group represents investor-owned utilities.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association is also backing the SPEED Act. The group said the legislation will streamline NEPA requirements on electric cooperatives applying for federal permits to build new generation, transmission and distribution capacity.

“One of the big changes in the bill is that receiving federal grants or other types of funding would no longer automatically trigger NEPA, meaning co-ops wouldn’t have to go through the review process every time they get federal money for an improvement project,” the group said.

However, Robert Glicksman, a professor of environmental law at the George Washington University Law School, cautioned against passing the SPEED Act now.

“Even if Congress is intent on revising NEPA, this is the wrong time to do it,” he said. Congress made changes to NEPA in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, and the Supreme Court has recently shifted judicial review toward greater deference to agencies in their NEPA preparations, he noted.

“It would make more sense to step back and evaluate the impacts of these developments, before rewriting the statute again,” Glicksman said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5DoSHcBkdNB-Fffs8w41xsdSu1BjEsFh0Gxva_MmWGg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ORVBBcGFuZWwucG5n.webp,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:36.106658

India has emerged as a leader in clean energy within the G20. In fact, India became the first G20 country to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, and it has set an ambitious target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2030. To reach this goal, India’s renewable power fleet has grown dramatically. Installed renewables (including large hydro) topped 203 GW by late 2024, up from roughly 75 GW a decade earlier. (Excluding large hydro, capacity jumped from about 39 GW in 2015 to 137 GW by early 2024.) This rapid expansion – often cited as roughly a 135% increase over FY15–FY24 – reflects strong policy support and investment. Such growth puts India on track to meet its 500 GW by 2030 goal, about 200 GW of which has already been built and underpins its clean-energy commitments on the world stage.

The role of energy storage in the renewable ecosystem

Energy storage is critical to make this renewable build-out reliable and sustainable. By buffering supply and demand, storage smooths the variability of solar and wind, improving grid stability and power quality. Storage systems also enable “time-shifting” of energy – charging when the sun is shining or wind is blowing and discharging during peak demand – which allows much higher penetration of renewables and deferral of costly grid upgrades. These services not only stabilize the grid, but they also boost energy access (by firming up intermittent power) and reduce emissions (by displacing fossil peakers).

The impact is already visible, today nearly half of India’s generation capacity is non-fossil. Renewables alone accounted for about 46% of total installed capacity by late 2024. Energy storage will be key to maintaining and growing this share of clean energy as India expands its solar and wind fleets.

Current energy storage landscape in India

India’s energy storage sector is still emerging, but growth and planning are rapid. Today, pumped hydro storage provides most bulk storage (existing projects total only a few gigawatts and hundreds of megawatt-hours), while grid-scale batteries are just beginning to roll out. Looking ahead, analyses see a big surge in storage needs. For example, the Central Electricity Authority projects 32 GW/160 GWh of battery storage will be needed by 2030 to support the 500 GW renewables target which consistent with industry estimates of ~160 Gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030.

To meet this demand, the government is focusing on key areas:

Electric vehicles and battery manufacturing are high priorities: India has pushed EV adoption (with targets like 30% electric vehicle sales by 2030) and launched Production-Linked Incentive schemes to scale up local battery production. This will not only decarbonize transport but also build out battery supply for the grid.

At the same time, policy and infrastructure efforts are integrating storage with solar parks and hybrid projects. For instance, new solar parks increasingly include co-located battery storage, and large hybrid wind-solar parks (with storage) are being planned to balance output.

Experts note that innovations like vehicle-to-grid integration and hybrid renewable-plus-storage projects will further enhance grid reliability and security. In short, the ESS industry in India is gearing up – backed by government targets and new policies – to play a central role in the country’s clean-energy transition.

Combined, these PSUs have earmarked over Rs. 25,000 crore (US$ 3 billion) for clean energy initiatives involving storage over the next 5–7 years. The public sector's entry gives confidence to private players, ensuring that storage is not just an add-on, but a core asset in India's power ecosystem.

Types of energy storage technologies

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)

Lithium-ion BESS is the most widely deployed technology due to high energy density, modularity, and cost decline. For example, Tata Power commissioned a 10 MWh BESS in Delhi, while JSW Energy is building a 500 MWh project under SECI’s standalone BESS tender. BESS is crucial for peak load shaving and renewable firming.

Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)

India’s 4.8 GW of installed PHS includes projects like Tehri (Uttarakhand) and Purulia (West Bengal). These systems pump water to a higher elevation during surplus and release it to generate electricity during peak demand. NHPC and SJVN are exploring over 15 GW of new PHS capacity, particularly in hilly states.

Thermal Energy Storage

Used in industrial and CSP applications, thermal storage involves heat retention in media like molten salt. The NTPC Dadri plant evaluated a thermal energy storage pilot with phase change materials. L&T is also involved in developing CSP-based hybrid thermal storage solutions, aimed at supporting industrial load balancing and process heat needs.

Flow Batteries and Hydrogen Storage

Flow batteries, like vanadium redox, offer scalable long-duration storage with better safety. IIT Madras and IOCL are piloting flow battery prototypes. On the hydrogen front, NTPC is developing a green hydrogen project in Leh, integrating BESS and electrolysers to store energy as hydrogen, enabling seasonal storage and grid decarbonisation.

Policy and regulatory support

Recognising the strategic importance of energy storage, the Indian government has rolled out several initiatives:

Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Batteries: Allocated Rs. 18,100 crore (US$ 2.14 billion) to support domestic manufacturing.

Draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill: Proposed inclusion of energy storage as a distinct asset class.

Energy Storage Roadmap by MNRE and NITI Aayog: Outlines capacity needs, technology preferences, and investment frameworks.

Additionally, states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are formulating storage policies in-line with their renewable energy goals.

Energy storage is the missing puzzle from India's clean energy journey. It promises to carry the load of ambition and action by making renewable energy dispatchable, reliable, and sustainable. Consequently, with technology costs being reduced, policy support growing, and innovations being accelerated, India is very well positioned to becoming an international leader in energy storage solutions.

Unlocking this potential will ensure energy security and climate resilience along with job creation, import dependency reduction, and enabling a sustainable future.",,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:20.648211

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report.
Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity.
Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.
Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles.","Imagine pulling into your work parking spot and leaving your vehicle in a shaded carport topped by solar panels that generate electricity for the lights and equipment inside the building.

Since 2023, that’s what workers at a First Solar Inc. production facility in Ohio have done. As such, they’ve followed in the footsteps—or tire tracks—of First Solar facilities in Germany, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Why should other companies follow First Solar’s lead? Helena Jochberger, global industry lead for information technology and business consultant firm CGI Inc., Montreal, outlined the strategic benefits for using use renewable energy.

“It not only reduces their carbon footprint and aligns them closer with ESG (environmental, social and governance) commitments and regulations, distributed energy resources (DERs)—like solar panels, wind-generation units and battery storage—empower companies to boost energy independence and resilience over a long period of time,” she explains. “By harnessing DERs to become their own energy producers, manufacturers take a more active role in their energy future in a market that is constantly changing. This makes achieving sustainability from an ESG and economic standpoint far more attainable.”

But implementing renewables is just the first step, according to Jochberger. Next is collecting data to demonstrate sustainability efforts and achievements. She cautions that when building a sustainability road map, companies need to collect accurate data about every step of their production process, from raw materials to a finished product.

“Leveraging digital tools like Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy monitoring and digital twins to help manufacturers deploy and monitor their renewable energy strategies can create even more value,” she says. “By tracking their progress and identifying inefficiencies in real time, manufacturers can not only generate their own power and reach net zero—they can do so efficiently and at scale.”

CGI client LKAB Minerals Ltd., a public iron ore mining company in Sweden, is in a joint effort to use hydrogen in its operations to reduce CO2 emissions, with the goal of fossil-free steel by 2035. Although solar power is not in its arsenal, LKAB does use alternative energy from wind and hydropower.

“If you have started that transition (to alternative energy), speed up,” Stefan Savonen, LKAB’s vice president of energy, advised in a recent podcast. “If you haven’t started, it’s time to start. Climate is a driving force, but a large part is also business. There is this huge business opportunity for the company, for yourself and for your well-being to start now … no time to lose.”

As a solar panel manufacturer, it’s no surprise that First Solar would have taken Savonen’s advice as well as the extra step of installing shaded photovoltaic (PV) carports. But the company’s solar efforts go beyond this.

Globally, First Solar’s PV arrays generated 7.5 million kWh in 2023, according to the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report. At an average yearly use of 10,800 kWh in an American home, that’s enough energy to power nearly 700 homes.

In 2021, First Solar set a goal of using 30% less energy per watt produced by 2028, compared with its 2020 usage. By 2023, it was halfway to that metric. And by 2026, First Solar set a target of powering 100% of its U.S. operations with renewable energy. It set a similar goal—100% renewable energy—for global operations by 2028.

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report. “Since 2009, we have successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low-carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, manufacturing yield and capacity utilization.”

Let the Sun Shine

By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total solar capacity of 139 gigawatts (GW)— an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022, according to Climate Central’s report, “A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power.” Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the report says U.S. installations produced 238,121 GWh (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023—more than eight times the amount generated in 2014.

Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity. In 2023, utility-scale solar comprised around 8% of the nation’s total electricity capacity from all utility-scale sources (renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels), compared to about 1% in 2014, Climate Central says. And most of the nation’s new energy capacity is expected to come from renewable sources such solar and wind— shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) that produce carbon pollution, EIA forecasts.

Much of the capacity is being used by the manufacturing industry--and such efforts are becoming increasingly visible. Drivers on northbound Interstate I-75 in Saginaw, Mich., for example, can’t help but be struck by some 17,000 solar panels that help power Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd.’s facility, which supplies motion-control technology to domestic and international automakers. Developed in partnership with NorthStar Clean Energy, a subsidiary of CMS Energy Corp. that is the parent company of Michigan utility Consumers Energy, the prominent array started providing renewable energy to the 25-acre site in May 2024.

In addition to reducing operational costs, Nexteer expects the following results from its Saginaw solar array:

Lowering GHG emissions by 7,000 metric tons annually, which is equivalent to saving about 788,000 gallons of gasoline per year, based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s conversion calculator

Preparing Nexteer for growing expectations of its OEM customers for a sustainable supply chain

Supporting progress toward global clean-energy transition via enablers such as renewables, energy efficiency and electrification—as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as: Affordable and Clean Energy (No. 7); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (No. 9); and Climate Action (No. 13)

One-fifth of Nexteer’s global energy comes from renewable sources, according to its 2024 Sustainability Report. “We continue to advance our climate road map strategy across global operations based on a portfolio of energy-efficiency measures, solar projects and power purchase agreement (PPA) initiatives (see sidebar p. XX). Additionally, efforts like our PPA in Mexico are supporting regional and community goals to green the electric grid,” according to the report.

Power Sharing

Three General Motors Co. assembly plants get their electricity from NorthStar’s 410,000-mWh Newport Solar project in Newport, Ark., through a 15-year PPA. Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.

The PPA is the automotive company’s largest one yet, and a milestone in GM becoming carbon-neutral by 2040.

In 2022, GM finalized agreements to secure 100% of the electricity needed to power all of its U.S. sites with renewables by the end of 2025, according to an August 2024 article in GM News. However, the company’s 2023 sustainability report “Journey to Zero” reported it achieved just 39% of its goal of “sourcing 100% renewable electricity globally by 2035.”

While Nexteer and GM use huge solar arrays that occupy acreage to power their operations, others in the manufacturing sector plan to use rooftop solar to source their electricity, depending on the level of their energy use and their geographic location, according to a 2023 study by a group of engineers at Northeastern University.

“Our findings show that light manufacturing sectors such as furniture and apparel can cover their average net annual electricity demand by utilizing their own rooftop potential in locations across the country, while several other sectors can achieve electricity self-sufficiency but in a smaller subset of U.S. locations,” the authors wrote in “Technical Feasibility of Powering U.S. Manufacturing with Rooftop Solar PV.”

In spring and summer, nearly 40% of three-digit manufacturing sectors (i.e., specific subsectors in the North American Industry Classification System) could utilize solar PV for their electricity needs in the U.S. Southwest, according to the study.

“Regions like the Southeast that have a large concentration of low-electricity-intensity furniture and textile product operations will have greater opportunities to convert to full on-site generation,” according to the study. “In contrast, high-electricity-intensity food processing operations in the Southwest will struggle to generate enough electricity on-site to cover demand, despite a favorable solar resource.”

Results Start on the Roof

Two companies using rooftop solar include a Midwest-based furniture manufacturer and a solar-car startup in California.

In 2019, Ashley Furniture Industries Inc., Arcadia, Wisc., embarked on a multiphase project to install solar panels on 10 of its largest U.S. facilities, including its advanced manufacturing headquarters in Arcadia.

Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles. Ashley’s solar panel installations are expected to generate about 25 million kWh annually, according to an update in the company’s 2024 Corporate Social Responsibility report.

At Aptera Motors Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., the vehicle maker’s product-design goal meshes with that of its building’s owner. Aptera’s solar-powered vehicle’s battery, frame and body are produced in a two-story facility topped by 892 Silfab solar panels. “The system’s estimated annual output of 703,284 kWh provides nearly all the energy that Aptera will use each year,” according to a Silfab Solar case study.

“The fusion generator in the sky, the sun, is a renewable energy source that we will continue to utilize in every shape and form,” Aptera Co-CEO Chris Anthony said in another case study.

“Our mission is clear: move towards a sustainable future that empowers people around the world to get where they need to go with less impact on the planet and little need to pull from an external power source,” Anthony continues. “We hope to inspire other companies to do the same, and we could not be prouder of the brighter future we are building.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/advancedmanufacturing.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/8c/68c2606d-de01-4fce-9d91-01eef0be7af4/68c8643926ab9.image.jpg?crop=844%2C443%2C115%2C0,N,,2025-09-15 17:01:22.742180

At DP World storage locations, staff must be certified to manage hazardous goods by way of ensuring compliant handling and storage.
DP World is also looking at the circular economy when it comes to aftermarket battery management.
That is exactly what we do.” Beyond operational changes, DP World has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, with interim targets for 2030, aligning with global climate frameworks.
DP World supports battery makers in the development of new gigafactories, alongside aftermarket contract logistics services.","Electrification is now a primary driver of complexity in automotive supply chains. The transition from internal-combustion to battery electric powertrains is advancing at different speeds across regions. China leads on the back of decades of investment from critical minerals to new energy vehicles (NEV) manufacturing and distribution, while Europe and the US are accelerating from a lower base with uneven momentum. Across markets, OEMs are prioritising battery logistics, hazardous-goods-ready infrastructure, proximity to production, compliant data and circular aftermarket flows – to de-risk operations and scale.

“If you are an OEM now you have to provide multiple powertrains because that shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is somewhere in transition depending on where in the world you are,” says David D’Annunzio, global vice-president and vertical head for Automotive at DP World. “While an EV has fewer parts and is easier to assemble, there are multiple variants of internal combustion and EVs, often being made in the same factory, increasing the complexity of assembly.”

The need to meet demand for both internal combustion (ICE) and EV variants also impacts the provision of service parts, the volume of which has increased by roughly a third because of the need to stock parts for both types of vehicles. For EVs, aftermarket battery services have their own very specific requirements and include regulation on recycling.

Bringing home the battery

OEMs face a strategic choice: one based on whether they purchase batteries from suppliers or vertically integrate into production. Ownership of battery production, independently or via joint ventures, requires significant capital but increases an OEMs control over cost, quality, resilience and the ability to navigate restrictions on trade. Recent examples include Toyota, which started its own battery production in the US this year at a $14 billion factory in North Carolina – its first in-house plant outside Japan, supplying hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure EVs. In Europe Stellantis is establishing a joint venture with CATL to make a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery plant in Zaragoza, Spain.

Vertical integration is a lesson Henry Ford learned back in the early days of car production and vehicle makers are returning to that original strategy in relation to battery production, according to D’Annunzio.

“One of the things that happened to Henry Ford was that the Dodge brothers originally provided full chassis to his company but then turned around and started their own business,” says D’Annunzio. “That irritated Henry Ford. He set up his own manufacturing and was 100% vertically integrated so no one could ever do that to him again.”

Careful handling

Crucially, lithium battery production and movement demand specialised, hazardous good logistics. EV batteries are categorised as hazardous goods under UN international dangerous goods regulations for road and air transport. Temperature, humidity and state of charge must be tightly controlled, and safeguards need to be in place to avoid any thermal runaway risks, which are difficult to extinguish.

DP World is providing battery logistics support, including deliveries both to assembly plants and to the EV dealer/service centre networks.

D’Annunzio notes most movements are simple, short-haul deliveries because battery manufacturing is deliberately located close to assembly plants and the centre of gravity for dealer distribution to try to minimise the hazards of moving batteries. “As long as they have been stored properly and they have the right state of charge, moving them from a storage location to either a manufacturing plant or to a service parts distribution location is an easy thing to do,” he says.

However, the right equipment and training is essential. At DP World storage locations, staff must be certified to manage hazardous goods by way of ensuring compliant handling and storage. Lithium batteries are segregated in dedicated zones, equipped with appropriate fire suppression systems and specialised lifting and charging equipment. With a decade of experience moving EVs and their batteries, we maintain an unblemished safety record.

DP World is also looking at the circular economy when it comes to aftermarket battery management. “The way the automotive aftermarket is set up for EV batteries is very simple,” says D’Annunzio. “If you take a battery and deliver it to the dealership you have to pick up the old battery and bring it back and recycle the black mass for somebody else. That is exactly what we do.”

Beyond operational changes, DP World has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, with interim targets for 2030, aligning with global climate frameworks. These commitments are driving investments such as electrified trucking fleets, modal shifts from road to rail, and the deployment of electric and autonomous vehicles at ports and terminals – ensuring that battery logistics is managed sustainably end-to-end.

Passport to power

In Europe, the battery passport (EU Battery Pass) will be mandatory from 2027 – a digital certificate which will enable consumers to verify the sustainability and environmental credentials of batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs). It will provide a document of data along a battery’s entire lifecycle. Today, we are seeing industry leaders collaborating to drive and advance the development of the first, trusted industry wide passport. For example, Path.Era, a collaboration between carmakers BMW and VW Group and suppliers BASF, Henkel, Siemens, working with consultant Deloitte, are currently working on the first industry-wide, trusted battery passport. China is currently working on a battery passport initiative to align with and facilitate trade with the EU’s battery regulations. However, outside of Europe, the situation is less consistent and is down to logistics providers to adhere with local and regional legislation.

Alongside regulatory compliance, DP World applies digital monitoring to the batteries in its care. This includes real-time checks on temperature, humidity and state of charge to ensure stability during storage and movement. These measures provide early-warning safeguards that reduce the risk of incidents and support transparent, auditable supply chains.

D’Annunzio indicated that when solid state batteries become less expensive to produce, regulations will be less complex given the greater stability afforded by that battery chemistry and the concern will be focused on those lithium-ion batteries still out in the marketplace.

Keep your options open

Powertrain transition and the localisation of battery production are amplifying supply-chain complexity amid broader trade upheaval, challenging OEMs, suppliers and logistics providers alike.

“We are all grappling with that,” notes D’Annunzio. “What we are telling our customers is that the best that you can do today is have flexibility, or as Jim Tompkins [CEO Tomkins Ventures] calls it, ‘optionality in your supply chain’.”

Building in optionality means being able to react faster to whatever the market throws your way. What is important for traditional carmakers to understand, according to D’Annnunzio, is that having options ready doesn’t always mean aiming for the one with the lowest cost anymore. “You need that little bit of extra insurance as things are changing rapidly,” he says. “That is a very difficult message to get across to OEMs in general and more importantly, OEMs that are in financial distress because of everything else that is going on.”

China in charge

While EV growth in Europe and the United States is progressing unevenly, China remains a global leader. Chinese OEMs produce 60% of all NEVs and 70% of all batteries, with capacity outstripping local demand. This surplus is driving assertive export strategies.

China’s BYD has rapidly scaled exports from hundreds of thousands to close to a million vehicles annually, while localising NEV assembly in key overseas markets to mitigate tariffs. As BYD and others have indicated, nearshoring combined with vertical integration simplifies a carmaker’s supply chain at a time of complexity. China’s NEV makers are smashing the traditional five-year vehicle development cycle – designing, producing and testing a vehicle ready for release in 18 months.

Intensifying competitive pressure from China is forcing traditional American and European OEMs to articulate clear strategic responses.

DP World is positioning itself to manage the complex needs of Chinese NEV customers making electric vehicles, including comprehensive services for battery handling and storage.

“As Chinese carmakers expand around the world, we want to be there to help them with their destination logistics, whether that be for the NEVs that they are exporting or in local manufacturing assistance and service parts distribution among other services,” says D’Annunzio.

DP World supports battery makers in the development of new gigafactories, alongside aftermarket contract logistics services. More specifically, for Foton, DP World is blending contract logistics and tailored market-entry and expansion services on a unified platform, managing the legal entity for Foton.

“Foton stocks inventory in our warehouse; when an order for a part comes by, we buy it from Foton, deliver and remit the funds,” says D’Annunzio. “Rather than being a pure logistics service provider we are also their trading partner in South Africa. Those are the type of innovative solutions that we are trying to come up with for our Chinese clients as they expand around the world.”",https://image.automotivelogistics.media/666434.jpg?imageId=666434&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-09-15 16:01:04.313363

You don’t have to walk far in Keene to spot a home with shiny black solar panels affixed to the roof.

The city has issued more than 230 permits for solar installations since 2017. Those installations were relatively rare until 2022. From 2018 to 2022, the city issued 51 permits. Since 2022, the city has issued 180.

Those incentives were rolled back in July when President Donald Trump signed what’s known as the One Big Beautiful Bill. Experts say that rollback could make solar less appealing for some property owners, but other factors, like electric costs, could help counterbalance it.

Rapid growth

According to city data, three solar installation permits were issued in 2018. The next three years saw a slight increase, with numbers hovering in the teens, but in 2022 something changed; solar permit applications began to come in much more rapidly.

The city issued 49 permits that year, 73 in 2023 and 58 in 2024. With four months left to go in 2025, the city has already issued 48.

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law under President Joe Biden on Aug. 16, 2022, implemented the Residential Clean Energy Credit, equal to 30 percent of the cost of a new clean energy system.

That means that a homeowner who spent $10,000 on a solar array, solar water heater, or battery storage could be exempt from $3,000 in taxes that year, and be eligible for additional exemptions in the future.

Clean Energy N.H. Executive Director Sam Evans-Brown said the act brought a lot of attention to solar, with more interest in both residential and commercial projects throughout the state.

Spiking electricity prices in 2023 and 2024 added fuel to the fire, he said, as people sought ways to reduce their energy costs.

The growth of solar installations in Keene that has followed that act is part of a national trend of solar growth. The installed capacity of residential solar projects in the U.S. has grown by more than 19,000 megawatts since 2021.

Utility-scale solar has grown even more rapidly.

In total, there’s now enough solar capacity nationwide to power more than 41 million homes.

The city of Keene has worked to incentive that trend. In 2020, the city earned a SolSmart bronze designation from the U.S. Department of Energy program for efforts to make solar a more affordable choice for homes and businesses.

Then-Mayor George Hansel said the designation was “a testament to the shared commitment by our citizens, elected leaders, city staff, businesses, and other community partners to reach our ambitious renewable energy goals.”

The city offers a property tax exemption for solar and other renewable energy systems equal to their total assessed value. That exemption is available to both homeowners and businesses.

More information about going solar in Keene can be found at keenenh.gov/going-solar-keene.

Variables

“There’s a lot of variables involved,” when homeowners or businesses are considering going solar, according to Scott Maslansky, who directs the clean energy finance program of the Community Development Finance Authority.

Tax credits and other incentives, like the Rural Energy for America grant program for businesses, are one thing people take into account. But they also consider things like their electrical costs or whether they’re planning to get a heat pump or electric vehicle, both of which need a lot of power.

“All of those things contributed” to the growth of solar over the past few years, he said.

Maslansky said he believes many people who had been thinking about going solar for a long time jumped at the 30 percent tax credit when it became available. He installed a solar array on his own home last year, in part to take advantage of that credit.

What happens now?

The July, One Big Beautiful Bill set in motion the rollback of most of the solar incentives that the Inflation Reduction Act started. Most were set to run for at least a decade. Now, they’ll phase out over the next two years.

The solar tax credit for homeowners is set to end at the end of the year. Businesses have a little more time; projects just need to be underway by mid 2026 or completed by the end of 2027 to qualify.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month it won’t provide any more funding through REAP, the program that covered up to 50 percent of the cost of renewable energy projects at rural small businesses.

Maslansky said he expects to see a short-term spike in solar installations through the end of the year as people hurry to qualify for incentives before they expire.

Longer-term plans, like developments that might have been considering building solar-ready, might be more likely to change their mind, he said.

Evans-Brown said he expects a “rush for the doors” in the last quarter of 2025.

“If you’re thinking about it, now is the time to do it,” he said.

But once the incentives expire, both experts said they expect a fall-off in interest.

With the REAP program in limbo, some companies who had planned to go solar might decide it’s no longer worth it.

“That will definitely cause a drop,” Maslansky said.

But for most home and businessowners, there are still good reasons to go solar.

Rising electrical costs could make solar look more and more desirable, according to Maslansky and Evans-Brown.

If you lose a 30 percent tax credit but electric costs go up 40 percent, solar still pays for itself in the anticipated timeframe, Evans-Brown explained.

“Taking on debt for something you’re going to see pay back on makes sense,” Maslansky said.

On the other hand, tariffs could cause the price of solar equipment to go up, making it a less cost-effective option.

Both said tariffs are a big area of uncertainty, but Evans-Brown said ongoing incentives for domestic manufacturing of solar equipment could increase US manufacturing.

Keeping up

As in many other areas of the economy, things are changing rapidly in the solar industry. It can be difficult to keep up.

Maslansky recommends property owners consult Clean Energy N.H.’s webpage or speak with a solar contractor to get up-to-date information.

“You really do have to be plugged in,” Evans-Brown said. “You have to do serious research.

“One of the challenges right now is that things are changing really quickly, and it is hard to get good information.”

Green firms in the US have found something of a lifeline in artificial intelligence after being bogged down by high interest rates, shrinking funding and, more recently, President Donald Trump’s sharp rollback of support.

Clean technology companies that have inked deals to support data centers have seen their stocks soar this year, outperforming the S&P 500. Nuclear power startup Oklo Inc.’s shares are up nearly 275% year-to-date while the stock price of fuel cell provider Bloom Energy Corp. has risen 66%. Energy storage and clean power snagged the most public and private investment among climate tech sectors last quarter, according to BloombergNEF.

Even as some clean energy firms struggle to convince investors that they can thrive during Trump’s second term, the AI-driven surge in electric demand — the most in decades — is providing clear tailwinds for others.

“That has reinvigorated enthusiasm for companies that benefit from the trend,” said Jeff Osborne, a senior clean energy analyst with TD Cowen.

But the data center boom may prove short-lived for some carbon-free tech companies. While the age of AI is just starting, the ability of renewable firms to continue benefiting could be limited by a White House keen to boost fossil fuels and kill wind and solar.

Other clean technologies aren’t facing the same headwinds. Trump is an unabashed supporter of nuclear power, which is also seeing a rebound in public support. Geothermal today provides less than 1% of US generation capacity, but new drilling techniques and support from both tech giants and Energy Secretary Chris Wright have positioned it for growth.

Nuclear is an “ideal supply source for data centers,” and companies are willing to pay a premium for carbon-free, round-the-clock power, said David Brown, director of the energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie.

Even before Trump took office for a second term, tech giants like Microsoft Corp. were seeking nuclear power. The company signed a deal with Constellation Energy Corp. last year for energy from the Three Mile Island plant, set to restart in 2027. Constellation struck a similar deal with Meta Platforms Inc. in June to sell power from an Illinois nuclear plant.

Almost a quarter of all venture funding for the US climate tech sector went to nuclear startups in the first half of this year, with firm TerraPower LLC closing the largest deal in the clean power sector at $650 million, according to BNEF. Funders include Bill Gates, who also founded the company, and Nvidia Corp.’s venture capital arm.

In addition, firms focusing on grid-enhancing technologies are also attracting funding, Osborne said. That includes startups like Veir Inc., which is making superconducting powerlines it thinks can solve the AI-fueled power crunch, and Heron Power Electronics Co., which signed a letter of intent to sell next-generation transformers to data center developer Crusoe in June.

A senior official said the Trump administration is working with states and utility regulators to speed data center development while looking to lift restrictions and roadblocks. These successes come as tax credits for some renewables are set to be wound down as part of Trump’s tax law.

“It is dangerous out there for a solar and wind company right now,” said Nancy Pfund, managing partner of impact investment firm DBL Partners and an early Tesla Inc. investor, adding that firms will need to cut costs and look at developing projects in other countries.

Altogether, companies canceled, closed or scaled back more than $22 billion in clean-energy investments during the first half of the year, according to research group E2. That’s about 17% of green projects announced since the start of 2022.

“Even though AI is a national priority for the Trump administration, the energy sector policies that the president has ultimately put forward threaten to slow down US momentum in AI,” Woodmac’s Brown said.

“The Trump administration is working with states and utility regulators to facilitate data center development, fostering a productive and symbiotic relationship among grid operators, developers, and hyperscalers,” a senior administration official said in an emailed statement. “This approach avoids imposing unreasonable or onerous restrictions on American tech companies at the forefront of AI development.”

While the Trump administration has created incentives for geothermal and nuclear, that support alone is not going to make those resources “readily available or plentiful in the next five years,” said Gabriel Kra, co-founder of climate tech venture capital firm Prelude Ventures. Both will take significant time and capital to get permitted and deployed at scale.

Nuclear power plants have historically faced long construction delays, permitting challenges and cost overruns. The last two nuclear reactors built in the US, Vogtle Units 3 and 4, took over a decade to get up and running, compared to utility-scale solar projects, which can be stood up in a year-and-a-half on average.

“The tools we have to scale are gas, solar, wind, batteries,” said Kra. And with natural gas turbine shortages, the hit to the renewables industry means “we just shut down the ability to produce cheap electricity for those customers who want to pay for it.”

For geothermal producer Ormat Technologies Inc., though, the policies in place are set to be a boon. Its shares have risen more than 29% so far this year, and the company has power purchase agreements with utilities and community choice aggregation programs in California. Ormat expects to finalize contracts to support data centers and hyperscalers in the “second half of the year and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer Doron Blachar said on an investor call on Thursday. He added the firm is benefitting from faster permitting timelines and quicker responses from the federal government due to recent regulatory reform.

By extending the production and investment tax credits for geothermal and energy storage, Trump’s legislation is “positioning us uniquely within the renewable energy sector,” Blachar said.

Many electric vehicle (EV) drivers choose their cars to see long-term savings from cheaper fuel and lower maintenance costs. But the upfront cost of the vehicle can be more pricey than gas cars.

If you’re going to be in the market for an EV, here are three affordable ones that experts told GOBankingRates will be cheaper than gas cars by 2026.

2027 Chevrolet Bolt

According to Justin Fischer, an automotive expert at CarEdge.com, two EV originators are making a comeback in 2026, and both will set the new standard for affordable electric cars moving forward.

“With an expected starting price around $30,000, native support for the Tesla Supercharger network and much faster charging than the last generation, the Bolt EV will be an incredible value that beats gas-powered competitors by a long shot when it comes to total cost of ownership,” Fischer said. “In a compact package, the Bolt EV is likely to score well over 110 MPGe in EPA testing. Even the most efficient hybrids can’t get anywhere near that.”

2026 Nissan LEAF

The 2026 Nissan LEAF is a complete reinvention of the model that brought EVs to the masses in 2011, according to Fischer.

“Everything from the electric powertrain to the exterior styling is reimagined for 2026,”Fischer said. “For anyone familiar with the older generation LEAF, that’s probably welcome news. What’s more surprising is the low price.”

According to Fischer, the 2026 Nissan LEAF will start at $29,990, even with huge upgrades across the board. For those who can charge at home or work at affordable rates, the 2026 Nissan LEAF will be a top-value EV from day one, per Fischer.

Tesla Model 3

According to Melanie Musson, an auto industry expert with AutoInsurance.org, the Model 3 isn’t the cheapest EV on the market, but when you compare it to similar gas models, it’s priced competitively.

“The Model 3 is renowned for its reliability, resulting in a low cost of ownership,” Musson said. “As a result, owners can start saving money after a couple of years of lower-cost driving.”",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tesla-model-3-charging-outdoors_iStock-2205601105.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 17:01:40.863072

Real-world impact across the renewable stack The shift to edge-based data normalisation is already taking shape in renewable energy deployments, particularly in utility-scale solar and battery storage projects.
Andrew Foster is product director at open edge data platform, IOTech.","Before operators can optimise assets, forecast performance, or coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) as part of a larger grid strategy, all that raw data must first be cleaned, contextualised and standardised. That may sound simple, but for many teams, this step remains one of the biggest time and cost sinks in modern renewables.

This is the messy middle that is holding up progress, and one that is now being tackled with a new tool: edge-based AI.

The hidden cost of unstructured data

Renewable energy assets are inherently distributed. Unlike centralised power plants, they are deployed across rooftops, utility-scale fields or integrated into community microgrids. Each asset might use a different vendor’s hardware, run slightly different firmware, or follow a slightly different naming convention for what appears to be the same data.

Even when asset owners are committed to aligning their systems with a standard like the SunSpec Alliance models for solar and storage, it is rarely a turnkey process. Getting a multi-vendor ecosystem to comply with these standards in practice involves hours of scripting, mapping, and manual tagging just to get a unified view.

That lack of structure has ripple effects across the ecosystem. Grid operators struggle to trust or ingest data that is inconsistent or incomplete. DERMS platforms and virtual power plant (VPP) aggregators spend weeks retrofitting each new site. Real-time analytics engines fail to generate meaningful insights without clean, labelled data. And project timelines are dragged down by the very thing meant to accelerate them: software.

The result is that messy data turns every clean energy deployment into a bespoke integration project. At scale, that is unsustainable.

Moving intelligence to the edge

To solve this, a new model is emerging, one where data is standardised before it leaves the site.

This is the promise of AI-driven semantic modelling at the edge. By embedding lightweight machine learning models into edge platforms located directly at or near the data source, renewable energy systems can now automatically identify, label and organise their data in real time.

Instead of sending raw data to the cloud for cleanup, edge AI infers what each data stream represents and aligns it with industry models such as SunSpec. This enables a new level of automation. Data arrives pre-structured, semantically tagged and immediately usable by upstream systems.

The shift from cloud-first to edge-first processing brings tangible benefits. Site deployment timelines shrink. Engineers spend less time writing custom integration scripts. DER fleets become easier to scale and manage.

A standards-based example: SunSpec at the edge

SunSpec is one of the most widely adopted standards in the solar and storage sectors. It provides a common information model for elements such as inverter status, power output, battery capacity and grid connectivity.

But aligning field data with SunSpec formats still requires manual work, especially when hardware diversity is high. Each device must map its native structures to SunSpec-compliant ones while ensuring that contextual metadata is properly attached. That is not a one-time task, either. It has to be maintained over time as systems evolve.

Edge AI offers a scalable alternative. With trained semantic models deployed on-site, edge platforms can:

Detect and classify incoming data streams from a variety of sources

Map values and fields to their appropriate SunSpec-defined representations

Normalise naming, structure and units across the board

This approach ensures that every new deployment speaks the same language as those before it. It reduces friction, speeds integration and delivers better data to the systems that rely on it.

Real-world impact across the renewable stack

The shift to edge-based data normalisation is already taking shape in renewable energy deployments, particularly in utility-scale solar and battery storage projects. These systems often span thousands of endpoints across a wide mix of vendors and configurations, making consistent data formatting a critical prerequisite for fast, scalable integration.

Operators are beginning to adopt edge AI techniques to automate semantic tagging and align operational data with models like SunSpec at the point of ingestion. This allows structured data to flow from edge devices into control systems and analytics platforms without requiring extensive post-processing.

Some edge platforms now embed this functionality out of the box, including commercial solutions based on open frameworks like EdgeX Foundry. For example, IOTech’s edge software includes built-in tools to support real-time data normalisation at scale, helping renewable energy providers manage diverse assets more efficiently while reducing integration time and manual effort.

By bringing semantic structure to the edge, these systems are enabling more reliable grid coordination, smoother DER integration, and faster onboarding across distributed energy fleets.

Why this matters now

The growth of renewable infrastructure is compounding the complexity of managing it. Operators are not thinking in terms of one or two assets. They are managing fleets. Aggregators are coordinating multi-site VPPs. Grid operators are dealing with bidirectional flows and unpredictable loads. In this landscape, data quality becomes a gating factor for innovation.

Without structure, interoperability breaks down. Without context, analytics falter. Without consistency, automation slows to a crawl.

That is why edge AI is such a timely advancement. It targets the problem where it begins, at the edge, and turns every data point into something trustworthy and usable from the start.

What comes next

The data challenges being addressed in solar and storage are not unique to renewables. The same fragmented, messy data problems appear in EV charging networks, smart buildings, and industrial facilities. The lesson is the same. Consistent, structured data is the foundation for everything else, including optimisation, forecasting, automation and compliance.

As the industry continues to coalesce around open models like SunSpec, Project Haystack and UNS/ISA-95, the question becomes how to apply these models at scale across heterogeneous environments.

Edge AI gives us a practical way to do that. Not as a bolt-on, but as a foundational capability of future energy infrastructure.

In 1H 2025, the sector installed 1 GW of solar installations, the largest first half ever.
Residential Solar Residential solar installations during Q2 were just over 1 GW, with high interest rates and economic uncertainty suppressing demand.
These costs increased in Q2 2025 following the government’s implementation of a 10% baseline tariff in April 2025.
The report’s base case broadly forecasts a 5% average annual decline in solar installations between 2025 and 2030, up from 2% in the Q1 2025 outlook.","The U.S. solar industry installed 7.5 GW of capacity in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, a 24% year-over-year (YoY) and a 28% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decline, according to Wood Mackenzie and Solar Energy Industries Association‘s US Solar Market Insight report.

The report stated that all segments, except commercial solar, saw capacity additions declining. The commercial solar segment witnessed a strong project pipeline that continued to come online under California’s former net metering regime.

Utility-Scale and Commercial Solar

In Q2 2025, installations in the utility-scale segment stood at 5.7 GW, declining 28% YoY and 33% QoQ. In 2024, average solar prices earned by projects in Texas, the largest utility-scale solar market, declined by 50% from 2023.

In 2024, average power prices earned by solar projects were down over 50% YoY. This decline affected the economic viability of new projects. Contracting across the U.S. also declined. The country signed 4.5 GW of new capacity in Q2, a 26% YoY.

Solar projects in New York supported contracted volumes. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority executed agreements for more than a dozen large-scale projects in May. These projects contributed to over 2 GW of clean energy across the state.

According to the report, the U.S. solar commercial market installed a capacity of 585 MW in Q2 2025, the second highest in history. States such as Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania recorded healthy volumes.

In 1H 2025, the sector installed 1 GW of solar installations, the largest first half ever. This increase was driven by projects under California’s NEM 2.0 program coming online. These projects accounted for over 90% of solar installations during this period.

Residential Solar

Residential solar installations during Q2 were just over 1 GW, with high interest rates and economic uncertainty suppressing demand. The bankruptcies of multiple solar companies also influenced the lower installation volumes.

The residential solar market added 1,064 MW of capacity, falling 9% YoY and 3% QoQ. The quarter witnessed the lowest capacity since Q2 2021, when it reduced to less than 1 GW. California, Florida, and Puerto Rico retained their lead in residential solar capacity rankings. California added approximately 275 MW, leading Florida by 200 MW.

In 1H2025, 33 states experienced a decrease in solar capacity from the previous year, resulting in a 12% YoY contraction.

Community Solar

The community solar segment installed 174 MW, a 52% YoY and a 34% QoQ decline, witnessing the lowest additions since Q1 2021. The segment’s volumes are reducing due to dwindling project pipelines in major markets with supportive policies. The report said no new markets are replacing these pipelines. Volumes for 1H 2025 decreased 36% YoY.

New York contributed heavily to the national contraction, with stagnating volumes during the quarter and capacities declining 56% YoY.

The report said that the U.S. has more than 9 GW of community solar in various stages of development as of Q2 2025. This development is likely to support the sector’s buildout through 2030.

Photovoltaic solar accounted for 56% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the first half (1H) of 2025. It remained the U.S.’ dominant form of new electricity-generating capacity.

OBBBA Impact

The OBBBA (Budget Reconciliation Bill), signed on July 4, 2025, introduced sweeping changes to the U.S. energy policy landscape. The report stated that changes to the tax credit across several technologies, along with the new Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements, will be an inflection point for multiple power sector trends.

Under the new provisions, the solar sector will no longer have access to Section 48E and 45Y tax credits after 2027, or the Section 25D tax credits (for customer-owned residential solar) after 2025.

Currently, projects starting construction on or before July 4, 2026, must come online in four years to earn the tax credits. However, solar projects beginning construction after this date must be commissioned by the end of 2027 to qualify for the 48E and 45Y credits.

The project cost share not allowed for payment to entities of concern will be 40% in 2026 and will increase by 5% every year to 60% from 2030 onwards.

Guidance and Permitting Uncertainty

On July 15, the Department of the Interior issued a memorandum stating that the Secretary of the Interior would personally sign off on numerous types of federal permitting approvals for solar and wind projects.

On August 15, the Treasury issued new guidance changing the definition of “beginning of construction” for solar and wind projects that are utilizing federal tax credits.

Earlier, projects could begin construction in one of the following pathways under the previous definitions: incurring at least 5% of the project cost (Five Percent Safe Harbor) or commencing onsite or offsite “physical work of a significant nature” (Physical Work Test). Projects using either pathway had to be commissioned by the end of the calendar year, four years post the commencement of the project’s construction.

The new guidance, effective September 2, largely maintains these requirements. However, the guidance has now removed the Five Percent Safe Harbor criterion for projects with capacities over 1.5 MW. These projects must now adhere to the Physical Work Test.

The Physical Work Test offers fewer bright-line assessments compared to the Five Percent Safe Harbor. The reduced assessments can create uncertainties for solar projects with planned construction commencement post-September 2.

FEOC Effect on Solar Manufacturing

The solar industry continued to grow in Q2 2025, with module manufacturing capacity reaching 55.4 GW. This growth exceeds the yearly solar installations when the factories are running at full capacity.

The increasing cost from the tariffs and higher labor and utility costs mean the 45X tax credits are crucial for U.S. solar manufacturers. Even though the 45X tax credits were maintained, the recent FEOC mandates could pose a risk to these credits.

Rise in Solar System Pricing

Residential solar system pricing rose 2% YoY. These costs increased in Q2 2025 following the government’s implementation of a 10% baseline tariff in April 2025. Baseline tariffs remained in effect even while a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs was announced. This contributed to cost increases throughout solar market segments.

The anti-dumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) case on solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, beginning in April last year and finalized in May 2025, pushed module prices by 13% YoY across distributed generation segments.

In August this year, the U.S. also initiated AD/CVD investigations against imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

Prices of residential systems averaged $3.36/W, increasing 2% over the previous year. Commercial system costs stood at $1.57/Wd, rising 10% YoY.

In Q2, utility-scale fixed-tilt and single-axis tracking system prices increased 4% YoY, reaching $1.11/W and $1.25/W, respectively. Engineering, procurement, and construction overhead, permitting, logistics, and miscellaneous costs rose 30% YoY on average.

Total utility-scale project system costs increased during the quarter compared to Q2 2024, despite a yearly average decrease of 10% in solar module and inverter prices.

Five-Year Forecast

The report projects 246 GW of solar installations in the next five years.

New installations are projected to surge in 2027, with projects hurrying to meet the tax credit deadline.

Approximately 50 GW of solar installations are projected to begin construction before the end of 2025. Another 40 GW of projects are likely to start construction in 1H 2026.

The report’s base case broadly forecasts a 5% average annual decline in solar installations between 2025 and 2030, up from 2% in the Q1 2025 outlook.

Wood Mackenzie expects the OBBBA to also result in fewer new manufacturing facilities being commissioned in the coming quarters.

The residential solar segment is also expected to rush to install projects before the year’s end due to the expiry of 25D tax credits for it. However, the total installed capacity is unlikely to exceed the record-breaking volumes of 2024.

Commercial and community solar developers are projected to safe harbor equipment or commence physical work to the extent possible.

Between 2025 and 2030, the national commercial solar market is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 3%. Near-term growth is forecasted to remain steady through 2026 since most projects are already under construction or in interconnection queues.

States such as California, with its strong growth, is still witnessing projects under NEM 2.0 taking longer than initially forecasted to come online. Wood Mackenzie projects that the state’s commercial solar installations will continue to grow throughout 2025, with a dip in 2H 2026.

The report said the federal policy changes have reduced the community solar sector’s five-year outlook to 8% compared to Q2 2025.

The community solar market is forecasted to contract by an annual average of 12% through 2030. Multiple state markets have proposed community solar programs. However, stakeholders have struggled to finalize legislation so far. The early expiration of the Investment Tax Credit and the potential cancellation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion “Solar for All” funding are expected to further complicate the design of frameworks for community solar in these states.

Despite the continued growth of successful community solar programs in Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey, Wood Mackenzie projects a 29% market correction this year.

Wood Mackenzie’s base case projects 168 GW of added utility-scale solar capacity between 2025 and 2030.

Approximately 44 GW of planned capacity is projected to be affected by the DOI’s directive. States such as Arizona, California, Utah, and Nevada are likely to be the most impacted.

The report also presents a low-case solar development forecast in addition to its base-case forecast for the quarter to benchmark the possible outcomes of the recent policy developments. This forecast projects an 18% downside risk (44 GW).

In a more constrained permitting environment, the report forecasts a 30% decrease in the commissioning of solar projects in 2026 and 2027 compared to the base case scenario. The differential between the two forecasts reduces from 2028. In the low case, it averages 17% less capacity from this period onwards.

Increased demand for new energy supply and rising power prices are projected to strengthen market fundamentals in the long term. The report’s low case is 18% lower than the base case over the next five years.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-08-29T162119.578.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:40.759664

The Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies, governments and intergovernmental organizations, is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping, including the fee, when they meet in London next month. The statement was shared exclusively with The Associated Press in advance.

“Given the significance of the political decision being made, we think it is important that industry voices in favor of this adoption be heard,” Jesse Fahnestock, who leads decarbonization work at the Global Maritime Forum, said Monday. The forum manages the Getting to Zero Coalition.

The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal before the IMO and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the major climate deal. The U.S. considers the proposed regulatory framework “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable U.N. organization,” the U.S. Secretaries of State, Commerce, Energy and Transportation said in a joint statement last month.

U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber’s president emeritus.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.

Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.

If nations don’t agree, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed and “the chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,” said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.

The U.S. secretaries said in their statement that “fellow IMO members should be on notice” the U.S. will “not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens” if they do not support the United States, against this action. They said ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet “unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets,” driving up costs, and the fuel standards would “conveniently benefit China.” China is a leader in developing and producing cleaner fuels for shipping.

While U.S. opposition and pressure cannot be taken for granted, it still appears as though a majority of countries currently support the regulations, said Faig Abbasov from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization. Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector’s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.

Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them. In addition to the Getting to Zero Coalition, the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption when nations meet at IMO Headquarters in London from Oct. 14 to 17.

They’re the first formal agreements by Google in demand-response programs with utilities—a way to temporarily reduce electricity usage during peak hours—to temporarily curtail its machine learning (ML) workloads, a subset of AI.

AI data centers are flooding U.S. utilities with electricity requests, pushing demand beyond available supply in some regions. The resulting power strain is raising fears of higher bills for households and businesses, along with potential blackouts.

The demand/availability conflict also has complicated the technology industry's expansion of AI, which requires massive amounts of electricity quickly.

""It allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids,"" Michael Terrell, Google Head of Advanced Energy said in an August 4 blog post.

“These agreements represent the first time we’re delivering data center demand-response by targeting machine learning (ML) workloads,” he continued. “This builds on our successful demonstration with Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), where we reduced the power demand associated with ML workloads during three grid events last year—paving the way for us to pursue opportunities at other locations.”

However, although this industry-leading strategy is innovative, not every task can be paused. Some critical functions, such as Google Search, Maps, and services used by healthcare or cloud customers, can’t be interrupted. Google representatives acknowledged that demand flexibility will only be implemented at certain locations, and only where service reliability won’t be compromised.

I&M serves more than 600,000 customers. The new contract is designed to support its capacity needs through clean power generation, supporting its ability to provide reliable service and help lower overall energy costs for customers.

AEP is one of the nation's largest electricity producers with approximately 29,000 MW of diverse generating capacity.

Transmission and Power Strategy

These agreements build on Google’s growing set of strategies to manage electricity needs.

In June of 2025, Google announced a deal with CTC Global to upgrade transmission lines with high-capacity composite conductors that increase throughput without requiring new towers. In July 2025, Google and Brookfield Asset Management unveiled a hydropower framework agreement worth up to $3 billion, designed to secure firm clean energy for data centers in PJM and Eastern markets.

Alongside renewable deals, Google has signed nuclear supply agreements as well, most notably a landmark contract with Kairos Power for small modular reactor capacity. Each of these moves reflects Google’s effort to create more headroom on the grid while securing firm, carbon-free power.

Workload Flexibility and Grid Innovation

The demand-response strategy is uniquely suited to AI data centers because of workload diversity. Machine learning training runs can sometimes be paused or rescheduled, unlike latency-sensitive workloads.

This flexibility allows Google to throttle certain compute-heavy processes in coordination with utilities. In practice, Google can preemptively pause or shift workloads when notified of peak events, ensuring critical services remain uninterrupted while still creating significant grid relief.

Local Utility Impact

For utilities like I&M and TVA, partnering with hyperscale customers has a dual benefit: stabilizing the grid while keeping large customers satisfied and growing within their service territories.

It also signals to regulators and ratepayers that data centers, often criticized for their heavy energy footprint, can actively contribute to reliability. These agreements may help avoid contentious rate cases or delays in permitting new power plants.

Policy, Interconnection Queues, and the Economics of Speed

One of the biggest hurdles for data center development today is the long wait in interconnection queues. In regions like PJM Interconnection, developers often face waits of three to five years before new projects can connect to the grid. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) filings show similar delays across multiple regions, as utilities and grid operators struggle to process unprecedented volumes of requests.

Demand-response agreements like Google’s offer a potential workaround. By agreeing to curtail loads during peak demand, data centers can be granted faster interconnection approvals since they present less risk to overall system stability. This demand flexibility can effectively “buy time” for utilities to complete needed transmission upgrades without forcing developers into indefinite delays.

The economics of such deals often involve capacity payments or bill reductions. In some cases, utilities compensate large customers for agreeing to be interruptible loads, either through reduced rates or direct payments during grid events. For Google, this creates both a cost-saving opportunity and a reputational benefit: helping the grid while accelerating the timeline for new capacity to come online.

Industry Implications

Google’s participation could set a precedent for how AI-driven companies interact with the grid. If hyperscale operators normalize demand-response as part of their standard operations, utilities may increasingly expect—or even require—similar commitments from other large energy users. That shift could ripple across data center site selection, power purchase agreements, and the economics of interconnection.

For now, Google’s agreements with I&M and TVA remain early pilots. But if they prove successful, they could reshape the conversation about balancing AI growth with grid reliability in the United States and beyond.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/09/68c841e499e9905b4cec0530-dreamstime_xxl_87755795.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-15 14:01:49.987798

Dive Brief:

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Friday that the agency will propose a rule to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, which requires over 8,000 companies and entities to calculate and annually report their greenhouse gas emissions for 47 source categories.

The agency estimated that the rule would save U.S. companies “up to $2.4 billion” in regulatory costs, according to the announcement. EPA said in a fact sheet that if the proposal is finalized, companies would not have to submit reports with 2025 data.

Zeldin previously telegraphed Friday’s proposal in the spring, when EPA announced a spate of climate and environmental rules it was planning to reconsider during a “day of deregulation” at the agency. Repealing the GHG Reporting Program could hurt the carbon capture industry and remove data that cities rely on to hold polluters accountable.

Dive Insight:

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was established in 2009, after Congress mandated a GHG reporting rule in response to the appropriations act for the 2008 fiscal year, according to EPA. The program currently applies to certain large industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, as well as carbon dioxide injection sites and fuel and industrial gas suppliers, according to a March fact sheet.

EPA is proposing to rescind the GHGRP in accordance with executive orders President Donald Trump issued on his first day back in office. The agency said it plans to maintain its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, but claimed in the release that the GHGRP “is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,” unlike other mandatory data collection programs under the CAA.

Zeldin said in the Sept. 12 announcement that the program “costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

The substance of the proposed rule would be an amendment to the program that removes “program obligations for most source categories,” according to the rule released for public inspection on Monday. The proposal, which would remove reporting requirements for carbon dioxide injection sites, “most large facilities” and all suppliers of fuel and industrial gas, will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.

The proposed rule would remove 46 of the 47 greenhouse gas source categories from the program. The agency would leave emissions reporting requirements for companies subject to the waste emissions charge, a methane emissions fee established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But, the recent Congressional Republican budget bill will delay data collection under that subsection for petroleum and natural gas systems — required to report under the CAA — until it reports on calendar year 2034.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/XtAzP_3TXhHmYqJGbKWtmqyhY-d7qxOTC_Do57KmKYY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzYwMjQxNzg2X3E3VWt0UnouanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-15 14:01:27.344312

“Given the significance of the political decision being made, we think it is important that industry voices in favor of this adoption be heard,” Jesse Fahnestock, who leads decarbonization work at the Global Maritime Forum, said Monday. The forum manages the Getting to Zero Coalition.

The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal before the IMO and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the major climate deal. The U.S. considers the proposed regulatory framework “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable U.N. organization,” the U.S. Secretaries of State, Commerce, Energy and Transportation said in a joint statement last month.

U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber's president emeritus.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.

Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.

If nations don't agree, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed and “the chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,” said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.

The U.S. secretaries said in their statement that “fellow IMO members should be on notice” the U.S. will “not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens” if they do not support the United States, against this action. They said ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet “unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets,” driving up costs, and the fuel standards would “conveniently benefit China.” China is a leader in developing and producing cleaner fuels for shipping.

While U.S. opposition and pressure cannot be taken for granted, it still appears as though a majority of countries currently support the regulations, said Faig Abbasov from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization. Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector’s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.

Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them. In addition to the Getting to Zero Coalition, the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption when nations meet at IMO Headquarters in London from Oct. 14 to 17.

The project has been slated to begin construction in 2026. If completed, Maryland’s offshore wind project, developed by U.S. Wind, has the potential to power 718,000 homes. 2,680 new stable, well-paying jobs are also now in peril due to this announcement.

Despite multiple studies showing that states with the most renewable energy see the slowest—if any—rise in energy costs, the Trump administration has launched an all-out assault on offshore wind. In April, the administration issued a stop work order on the Empire Wind project in New York. This order was eventually reversed after costing the developer $50 million a week. Two weeks ago, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island received a similar order.

In response, Sierra Club Maryland Chapter Director Josh Tulkin issued the following response:

“The Maryland offshore wind project will provide good jobs, lower our energy bills, and help clean our air. By trying to derail this project, the Trump administration is withholding these benefits from Maryland families and residents, effectively leaving the solution to our energy and economic needs stranded in the water.

“The Atlantic coast has a wealth of wind waiting to be harnessed. We will continue to speak out and demand better for our state, championing clean, homegrown energy that prioritizes people over polluters.”

Sierra Club Senior Advisor Nancy Pyne added:

“Donald Trump is throwing a temper tantrum that's costing Americans cleaner air and lower electricity bills. Despite constantly talking about lowering prices for hardworking Americans and establishing energy dominance in the U.S., Donald Trump’s only real concern is how much profit fossil fuel companies are making. By attacking offshore wind in every way possible, Donald Trump is forcing Americans to rely on expensive and deadly gas and coal, while padding the profits of dirty polluters.

“Offshore wind development in the United States has already allowed hundreds of thousands of families to reliably and affordably power their homes without having to sacrifice their health. Sierra Club has been working to make offshore wind a reality in this country since day one—and we will keep on fighting until these windfarms are built.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-15 14:01:15.417624

That’s when Third Act Illinois and 350 Chicago are hosting a Solar Fest at Montrose Beach to celebrate the strides that clean energy has made in its fight against the fossil fuels industry.

It’s all a part of Sun Day, the first-ever nationwide day of action calling for the large-scale deployment of clean energy that is affordable, reliable, and ready to go.

Chicago’s Sun Day Solar Fest, near Montrose Beach from noon to 4 p.m., will include live demonstrations, valuable resources, dynamic speakers, live music, spontaneous flashmob dances, sing-alongs, a puppet parade, an electric vehicle show, and more.

Joining Third Act and 350 Chicago in supporting the event are more than 30 other organizations — including the Active Transportation Alliance — representing environmental and transportation action and justice, residential and community solar groups, as well as major universities and cultural institutions.

A CHANCE TO RISE UP FOR A SUN-POWERED PLANET

Timed to coincide with the fall equinox, Sun Day comes as the clean energy transition approaches a tipping point. Solar power is now the cheapest form of energy on the planet, clean energy jobs are growing rapidly, and communities across the country are experiencing the benefits of cleaner air and lower energy costs.

But powerful fossil fuel interests are working overtime to preserve the status quo. And the federal government has greatly reduced programs and incentives for solar, wind, and other renewable energy investments.

Bill McKibben, noted environmentalist, author, and a founder of Third Act and 350.org, reminds us that Americans have long thought of solar and wind as “alternative” energy, “the Whole Foods of energy: nice but pricey.” He says it’s time to think of it as “the Costco of energy: cheap, on the shelf, and available in bulk, ready to go.”

THE SUN CAN POWER THE WORLD, YOU CAN POWER A MOVEMENT

Solar power is affordable. It’s the cheapest way to power your home or business – most systems pay for themselves within a few years and can bring energy bills down.

Global solar capacity has grown more than tenfold in the past decade. It’s now the fastest growing energy source in the world.

The clean energy sector now employs millions of workers in the United States, creating sustainable jobs and economic growth in communities everywhere.

A solar system can provide your home with cheap and clean energy for decades. While traditional power grids fail during storms and emergencies, solar panels and the batteries they charge keep the lights on when you need them most.

Communities that get most of their power from solar energy report fewer asthma attacks, clearer skies, and quieter neighborhoods – clean energy improves lives in ways you can actually feel.

Installing solar roof panels is one of the best things you can do for your family’s health and future – they produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases during operation, improve local air quality, and reduce your carbon footprint.

So walk, run, bike, or CTA your way to the Sun Day Solar Fest on Sunday, September 21, at Montrose Beach near the dog park.

There you can take actionable steps toward supporting clean, sun-powered energy in your community. To RSVP or get more information, go to Sun Day Solar Fest.

On July 29, the EPA proposed to not only repeal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, but also to rescind the so-called ""endangerment finding""—the legal predicate for nearly all of the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act. In this regard, the EPA is not seeking merely to undo regulations from the Obama and Biden administrations. It is also seeking to make it more difficult for future administrations to put such regulations back in place unless and until the EPA is instructed to do so by Congress. This is a high-risk strategy. . . .

The primary reason it is difficult to undo the endangerment finding is that the statutory standard is so easy to meet. For purposes of the Act, the question is not whether climate change is catastrophic, nor whether climate adaptation is preferable to mitigation, nor whether federal regulation of sector-specific emissions is rational or cost-beneficial, nor whether such regulations represent a serious or rational way to address the threat of climate change. Nor is the question whether the science is unequivocal, nor is it whether there is certainty about the likely effects of increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions over any given time period. Rather, the question is simply whether the EPA Administrator can ""reasonably anticipate"" that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can have negative effects on health or welfare—effects which the Act defines to include the impact on climate, ""economic values,"" and ""personal comfort and well-being.""

While the EPA suggests that a less-alarmist interpretation of existing climate science is one reason to undo the endangerment finding, relying upon a draft report prepared for the Department of Energy, its primary argument is that the Clean Air Act ""does not authorize the EPA to proscribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns."" The problem is that this argument is almost certainly foreclosed by Massachusetts v. EPA, which expressly concluded that the Act ""authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a 'judgment' that such emissions contribute to climate change."" The EPA suggests one way to address this constraint is to note that domestic motor vehicle emissions are a small (and shrinking) share of global emissions, but Section 202 of the Clean Air Act (unlike some other provisions of the Act) conspicuously lacks any requirement that motor vehicle emissions contribute significantly to the problem.",https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cropped-rinsquareRGB-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:52.152238

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the proposal.

“Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said.

“With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and powering the great American comeback is not a binary choice,” Zeldin added.

The agency said the mandatory collection of GHG emissions data from the approximately 8,000 facilities that had been subject to the reporting requirement was unnecessary because it is “not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

The agency’s action is the latest in a series of regulatory moves stemming from executive orders signed by President Donald Trump aimed at removing barriers to the development of the United States’ fossil fuel resources.

The EPA had previously announced its intention to repeal the so-called “endangerment finding” that enabled it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and other sources.

Currently, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually.

The government has been collecting the data since 2010, previously seeing it as a tool to track carbon dioxide, methane and other emissions believed to be accelerating climate change.

If the agency’s latest proposal is finalized, it would eliminate reporting obligations for all of these entities as well as CO2 injection sites.

“The key challenge facing oil companies today isn’t just optimizing current operations,” Sarah notes.
Sarah led the development of SaaS solutions and offshore applications, learning how to bridge traditional energy operations with digital technology.
Sarah’s background in both energy industry and strategic consulting gives her an edge when helping companies navigate major changes.","Global energy investment will reach a record $3.3 trillion in 2025, with clean energy spending hitting $2.2 trillion – more than double the $1.1 trillion projected for oil and gas, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest World Energy Investment report. This marks the first time clean energy investments significantly outpace fossil fuel spending. Solar power alone will attract $450 billion in investment, making it the single largest category. Meanwhile, upstream oil investment faces its first decline since the COVID crisis, dropping 6% due to lower prices and weakening demand expectations.

Major oil companies are responding with dramatic strategic shifts. Recent industry moves show the variety of paths being chosen: some companies are doubling down on traditional operations, other companies divest hydrocarbons assets to invest heavily in renewables, while others retreat from renewable commitments they made just years ago. Against this backdrop of industry uncertainty, Sarah Fluzin, a management consultant with deep energy sector expertise, recently completed a transformation project that will save a major oil company several billion dollars by 2030. The project focused on identifying operational inefficiencies that had accumulated over decades. Sarah’s team analyzed everything from maintenance schedules to supply chain logistics, finding that many processes were designed for favourable and steady market conditions. More than a decade in the energy industry across the value chain and in companies such as ExxonMobil gave her insight into how energy companies operate – understanding which systems are critical and which create unnecessary bottlenecks. This operational knowledge proved crucial when designing changes that wouldn’t disrupt production.

Multi-Billion Dollar Project

The upstream transformation required a complete redesign of operational models across several business units. For one of the largest Energy players worldwide, Sarah led analyst teams for nine months, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies accumulated over decades. The project included an analysis of over 200 operational processes and an efficiency assessment of 20+ major production assets.

“We looked at everything from people and productivity to technology in operations and maintenance”, Sarah explains. “Many companies are still working in a way designed for oil at $100 per barrel while they would need to adapt to be profitable at $60 per barrel. The main savings generally come from productivity improvements, enabled by process optimization and technology”.

The savings target matches industry pressure to optimize operations.. Industry analysis shows companies increase focus on capital discipline and operational improvements to maintain profitability despite volatile oil prices.

Sarah’s approach goes beyond spreadsheet optimization. During her time at SBM Offshore, she led the development of an in-house application for managing offshore personnel. The system was needed because existing manual processes for tracking offshore workers certifications, shift schedules, and safety compliance were creating bottlenecks or potential safety risks during crew changes on offshore platforms.

Sarah developed a phased implementation plan that avoided operational disruptions during the digital transformation. Rather than implementing across all assets simultaneously, the team tested changes on two pilot facilities before scaling up.

Strategic Leadership Across Global Markets

Management consulting assignments took Sarah from Middle East to African private and public energy entities. One project involved helping a key GCC country develop a plan to hit ambitious renewable energy targets without hurting their oil-dependent economy. The challenge: how do you promise 50% renewable energy by 2030 when oil exports fund 80% of government spend?

“The key challenge facing oil companies today isn’t just optimizing current operations,” Sarah notes. “You need to build systems and capabilities that work across different price scenarios while preparing for long-term market shifts.”

Sarah’s work at AlixPartners, in the aeronautical sector acquisitions taught her to evaluate complex technical businesses quickly. When private equity firms consider buying aerospace companies, they need someone who can assess both the engineering capabilities and market positioning within weeks, not months.

One project involved due diligence for an aviation company with €800 million in revenue. Sarah analyzed strategy, operational and financial data, as well as market trends and competitor landscape. The work required understanding aviation regulatory requirements, manufacturing processes, and market dynamics – due diligence being a typical methodology that can be transposed to most industries, including the energy sector.

Having worked in multiple countries, gives Sarah insight into different business cultures. “In the Middle East, relationships have an important role to guarantee successful business partnership, then business,” she explains. “You could come up with a very sophisticated or efficient solution, but if you haven’t invested time in understanding local priorities and building trust with key stakeholders, the project might not reach the expected outcomes.”

The Gulf sustainability project took 18 months and required managing expectations from multiple entities. Sarah’s team had to balance ambitious environmental targets with realistic economic constraints. The final strategy included specific timelines, budget allocations, and performance metrics that satisfied both environmental advocates and economic planners.

From ExxonMobil to Management Consulting

Fifteen years in the Energy space gave Sarah a deep understanding of upstream and downstream operations before joining the consulting world. Her engineering degree provided technical foundations, while her MBA from HEC Paris added business strategy skills needed for senior consulting roles.

Sarah worked across the energy value chain, from Upstream to Downstream, the latter on refining operations and onshore mega projects.

The transition to digital project management proved crucial. Sarah led the development of SaaS solutions and offshore applications, learning how to bridge traditional energy operations with digital technology. This combination makes her effective at helping companies adopt new tools without disrupting critical operations.

Moving from operational roles to strategic consulting happened when Sarah saw the energy sector entering fundamental change. Companies needed advisors who understood both technical complexity and the business implications of transformation as well as the ability to contemplate innovative and inclusive business models, more aligned with environmental goals while leading on society major shifts such as AI.

“After 15 years in oil and gas, I felt I needed to renew myself and keep the learning going,” she explains. “I also assumed strict technical skills were not enough anymore. Companies needed people who could think strategically about business models, not just optimize existing processes. That’s why I decided to get an MBA – I needed to understand the businesses more holistically, think through new perspectives, understand how to think about transformations, prepare for the future versus solely applying skills to optimize operations and projects.”

Sarah managed operations teams of up to 50 engineers and coordinated brownfield projects worth several millions in capital expenditure. This experience with large-scale project management translates directly to her current consulting work, where she often leads transformation initiatives affecting thousands of employees.

Recognition and Market Impact

Sarah serves as a judge for Globee Awards, evaluating strategic excellence across different industries. This role positions her alongside other senior professionals who assess business transformation initiatives and innovative approaches to complex challenges.

A leading management consulting firm promoted Sarah to manager level after she demonstrated consistent results on complex projects. Top-tier consulting firms typically require 3-4 years of exceptional performance for such advancement. Sarah’s background in both energy industry and strategic consulting gives her an edge when helping companies navigate major changes.

Sustainability Focus

Sarah works on sustainability projects. She’s considering further academic studies in micro and nano-plastics – an area where she has strong interest.

Oil investment drops 6% this year, according to the IEA. Companies need to squeeze more profit from existing operations while preparing for an uncertain future. Sarah’s projects help them do both: optimize what they have now and build capabilities for whatever comes next.

Personal investments in environmental initiatives show Sarah understands where the industry is heading. Companies that ignore environmental requirements risk losing access to capital and markets in the coming years.

The sustainability work reflects broader industry recognition that environmental factors will increasingly drive business decisions. Sarah’s dual expertise in business optimization and sustainability strategy positions her uniquely for this evolving landscape.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/real_3beb2d4e-7ec4-4542-91e8-32e4800e6227.jpeg,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:04.394242

Indeed, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a month later that the program was being frozen.

However, the program has been revised and stations are still being built under its purview.

It seems reasonable to assume that sometime between his January 20 executive order “Unleashing American Energy”—with its Section 1, “to eliminate the ‘electric vehicle mandate’ and promote true consumer choice”—and the end of EV tax credits after September 30, President Trump would have found a way to kill the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) Congress adopted as part of President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure program in 2022.

Trump’s first-day EO prompted us to ask the Federal Highway Administration via email how many EV charging stations the NEVI program had built up to the point of that ominous executive order.

In May of the previous year, we reported that the program, then two years old, had yielded just eight chargers across the US.

As of August 27, there are 110 stations (about 500 charging ports) built by NEVI funding, as tracked in the station locater database according to the Federal Highway Administration.

That response came seven months after we asked the question.

“We’re going to see quite a flood of construction,” a person familiar with the program told Autoweek in September. This source believes the program will build a total of 200 stations by the end of the year, for about 1000 individual chargers.

After Trump’s January 20 EO, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in February announced the program was being frozen. In June, a federal judge ruled the Transportation Department had exceeded its authority in putting an end to the congressionally funded program.

That sort of judicial ruling hasn’t meant much elsewhere for the Trump White House. June also was the month when the House approved a $9 billion rescission package demanded by the president that included the high-profile cut of $1.1 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the current fiscal year and for 2026.

Instead of calling on Congress to do the same for NEVI, Trump jump-started NEVI last August 11, with Duffy saying, “if Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right.”

“Support from states that challenged the freeze also played a role in its prompting the restart and updated guidance,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, industry insights director and a specialist in the EV and electrified vehicle segments for Cox Automotive, told Autoweek.

The NEVI program requires states to supplement the federal funds allocated for EV charging station construction.

Duffy and the FHWA launched a review of the program’s guidance earlier this year to make NEVI more efficient. At the time, according to the FHWA, 84% of the NEVI Formula program funds remained unobligated, which the administration took as a “clear signal” of the program’s failure.

“NEVI was established to fund states’ deployment of EV charging infrastructure,” Duffy said, “but Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg added requirements that were difficult to understand and implement.”

The FHWA directs all states to submit updated plans, which once approved, can resume NEVI funding, the agency says.

This new guidance retains the $1 billion-per-year funding of the program through the current year and through 2026.

Six states already have federal approval for their plans to build more EV charging stations in 2026, according to the National Association of State Energy Officials’ (NASEO) EV States Clearinghouse.

According to NASEO’s EV clearinghouse, 44 states have issued at least one solicitation for federal funds, 38 states have issued awards to build stations, and 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded $544 million in funding to complement the $3.3 billion in federal funding allocated from 2022 to 2025.

While EV federal tax credits end September 30 (though the “leasing loophole” allows consumers to take delivery of an EV after that date and still get the tax credit if they make at least their first payment by then) the auto industry is not backing off a fossil fuel-free future.

Urgency over the end of the tax credit from the One Big Beautiful tax and spending bill passed early this summer has given a big boost to the EV segment. General Motors, the number-two EV purveyor in the US, said it sold a record 21,000 Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs in August, while Cox Automotive says strong EV sales from all brands in the US market in July and August will result in full third-quarter sales when September is counted that will easily break the current record of 356,000 sold in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The other significant rule of the “EV mandate” that Trump cut with his January 20 executive order is the Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency standard meant to boost electric vehicle sales to 30%-56% by 2030-32. While EV market share is very likely to be significantly lower than 30% in five years, the extension of the federal charging station program, which addresses a top concern of EV ownership by American consumers, should guarantee continued electric vehicle growth.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I4s4HuwCJDp5vwyjkQGp8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autos.autoweek.com/7eb6c789e37190566e810c33000540e1,N,,2025-09-15 15:01:05.577132

On Friday, California lawmakers passed a bill that will define, and then ban, ultra-processed foods from school meals.
This year, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia have all passed laws that will ban foods containing certain dyes and additives from school meals.
But implementing a ban on UPFs in California school meals will take more work than simply defining UPFs, food policy experts say.","California has long led the way on school meals. In 2022, it became the first state in the country to make school meals free for all students, regardless of income. Many districts have implemented farm-to-school programs to bring local foods into the cafeteria. And last year, months before the “Make America healthy again” movement would make its way to the White House, it became the first state in the nation to ban six synthetic food dyes from school meals.

This week, it passed legislation that will put it in the lead on school meals in yet another way – banning ultra-processed foods. On Friday, California lawmakers passed a bill that will define, and then ban, ultra-processed foods from school meals. The legislation, which must now be signed by the governor, Gavin Newsom, is believed to include the first statutory definition of ultra-processed foods in the world.

“We have so far found a formula that we think works and can help guide the national conversation on these issues,” said California state assembly member Jesse Gabriel, who sponsored the bill. That formula, he said, is “bipartisan, common sense, science-based”.

Ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, are industrially formulated products that are often high in fats, starches, sugars and additives, and make up 73% of the US food supply today. Think fast food, microwave dinners, sodas, chips, and even packaged bread and sweetened yoghurts.

Although nutritionists have been talking about UPFs for more than a decade, the US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr – a longtime pseudoscience proponent – made them a household term through his “Make America healthy again” coalition. While the federal government has yet to take any significant steps to rein in UPFs – Kennedy’s rhetoric, and growing concerns over the safety of the food supply, have spurred more states to begin assessing ways they can limit UPFs.

But much of that work began in California. In 2023, the legislature passed a first-in-the-nation law, also sponsored by Gabriel, to ban four chemicals already prohibited in the European Union and other nations.

“It really blew my mind how out of step the United States is with the rest of the world when it comes to food safety,” said Gabriel. “We don’t love our kids here in the United States any less than they love their kids in Sweden or Saudi Arabia or South Korea. So why is it that they are taking stronger measures to protect their kids than we are?”

More than 20 other states have copied California’s ban on those four chemicals, or its similar ban on six synthetic food dyes in school meals.

Although it’s the first state to define UPFs, California is far from the only one to consider ways to remove them from school meals and the broader food supply. According to researchers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, lawmakers in at least 18 states have introduced more than 40 pieces of legislation that would restrict the sale of foods with certain additives. This year, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia have all passed laws that will ban foods containing certain dyes and additives from school meals.

“There’s something so interesting about California and West Virginia bookending the country both physically, but also with this issue around food safety,” said Bernadette del Chiaro, senior vice-president for California at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group focused on environmental and agricultural policy, which has backed the California law.

Although Kennedy has spoken out against UPFs from his post in Donald Trump’s Republican administration, Democratic states and lawmakers have raised concerns about food safety as well. But red and blue states have taken different approaches to defining the UPFs they seek to ban.

“It is really hard to define an ultra processed food,” said del Chiaro. “We all kind of know what junk food is when we see it, but putting that definition in writing that has the force of law behind it is” more difficult.

Food policy experts have generally followed a system called the Nova classification to define UPFs, but even nutritionists sometimes disagree over what counts as a UPF. The Nova classification categorizes a product as “ultra-processed” if it’s industrially formulated to be “edible, palatable and habit-forming”. But because that definition is based on processing, not specific ingredients, it can be difficult to agree on exactly which foods fall into the category.

Lindsey Smith Taillie, a professor of nutrition and co-director of the Global Food Research Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she and her colleagues have noted three different approaches states are taking to define the UPFs they seek to ban.

The most common definition of UPFs is foods that include any of about a dozen additives, “primarily artificial food dyes and then a couple emulsifiers or dough conditioners”, said Smith Taillie. A handful of other states, such as Texas and Louisiana, have used a definition that includes about 40 additives, she said, though there’s no clear through-line for why those additives were chosen, as they include some that have already been banned in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. California, she said, stands out for taking “the most rigorous approach to evaluating the science”.

“California is the state that is coming the closest so far to trying to actually take action on this concept of UPFs as it has been defined in the literature, which I think is important because that’s where the evidence of health harm is,” Smith Taillie said. “When we look at what a lot of these states are doing with a super-narrow definition of additive, there’s really no body of evidence that suggests that that’s going to make an impact on health.”

The text of California’s new law defines a UPF as any food or beverage that contains stabilizers, thickeners, propellants, colors, emulsifiers, flavoring agents, flavor enhancers, nonnutritive sweeteners or surface-active agents – and has high amounts of saturated fat, sodium or added sugar, or nonnutritive sweeteners.

Del Chiaro, of the Environmental Working Group, hopes California’s definition might lead the way for other states and school districts.

“Shifting the purchasing decisions of the fourth-largest economy in the world, and the most populous state in the country, I think will have an absolute, positive effect on the buying options that other school districts have,” she said. “I think there will be a snowball effect here that’ll help kids all across America.”

Dating back to the 1970s, scholars have described a “California effect” in which other jurisdictions or industries adopt the regulatory standards set by one region – often California – because it is more efficient to apply the same standards everywhere. The first of those regulations forced automakers to abide by the state’s clean air policies, and more recent ones have aimed to eliminate single-use plastics.

But implementing a ban on UPFs in California school meals will take more work than simply defining UPFs, food policy experts say.

Alternatives to UPFs “would require, by definition, more cooking”, said Smith Taillie. “The only way to really do that would be, you would have to increase labor cost.”

Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food policy at New York University, agrees.

“Taking UPFs out of school meals means providing kids with whole, not UPF, foods. These either have to come pre-prepared or cooked on site,” she said in an email. “USDA reimbursements have to cover not only the food; they also have to cover staff salaries, equipment and supplies.”

“Schools turn to UPFs because they are cheaper and save staff time,” she added. “Taking UPFs out of schools has to be coupled to higher reimbursement rates or it won’t work.”

In the process of passing this bill, Gabriel said many legislators had the same concern about cost. But what they found was that it’s often cheaper to eliminate UPFs. “What was very helpful to us there is that there are a number of districts in California that have already moved in this direction. And so we actually had food service directors come in and testify,” he said. “Not only had it not cost them more, but in many districts they had actually saved money by switching to healthier alternatives.”

He shares an example of switching from serving a syrup with pancakes that contains high fructose corn syrup, cellulose gum, caramel color and other hard-to-pronounce ingredients to one that solely contains maple syrup. In many cases, it’s not a change that is “necessarily gonna cost districts more”, he said.

Del Chiaro of the Environmental Working Group agrees that omitting UPFs doesn’t have to be expensive, and “isn’t likely to have a massive impact of any kind on school budgets”.

“This bill is not mandating that everybody buy organic $6-a-carton blueberries,” she said. “All we’re doing is getting rid of the particularly harmful ultra-processed foods on the lunch tray.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2d398896428d7b15a5baeaae07e8b3c5d10ff/110_0_3374_2700/master/3374.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04ca4663cbeb0562048f200f79e81a22",N,,2025-09-15 13:06:00.761121

OPINION – Following BOEM’s announcement canceling future offshore wind leases across the U.S., it’s important to remember that California still holds existing leases, including the wind area off the Central Coast. As an IBEW electrician, it’s clear to me that offshore wind is essential for our region’s future.

Having spent my career as an IBEW electrician on the Central Coast, specifically Morro Bay and San Luis Obispo, I’ve seen firsthand how this region has powered California, from Diablo Canyon to various fossil fuel operations. We understand the energy business, and frankly, it’s time for a change. As we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, offshore wind isn’t just a good idea; it’s the perfect solution for our community and our future.

The most immediate and tangible benefit of offshore wind is jobs. Good, union jobs. These aren’t temporary gigs; they are long-term careers that will provide stability and prosperity for families right here on the Central Coast. We’re talking about jobs in manufacturing, construction, operations, and maintenance – all roles where skilled tradespeople, like my IBEW brothers and sisters, will be in high demand. We’ve seen firsthand how a robust energy sector can support local economies, and offshore wind offers us a chance to revive that economic engine for generations to come.

Beyond job creation, offshore wind addresses a critical need for our region: energy infrastructure. The Central Coast is currently losing out on business opportunities because we simply don’t have the energy capacity to power new businesses that want to move to our area. This isn’t just an inconvenience, it’s a drag on our economic growth and a limit to our potential. Offshore wind provides a reliable, clean energy source that can directly power our local economy, ensuring that the energy we produce off our coast is used right here, creating a self-sufficient and resilient energy grid.

Furthermore, this is about building a secure and affordable energy future. Union members are committed to keeping California affordable, and that extends to the energy we produce. By investing in offshore wind, we are investing in a stable energy supply that will help regulate energy costs and provide a consistent source of power for our homes, businesses, and industries. This isn’t just about environmental stewardship, it’s about practical economics and ensuring a strong future for the Central Coast.

Now, let me be clear: supporting offshore wind doesn’t make me an environmentalist. I’m an electrician. My primary concern is providing reliable power and good jobs. My priority is ensuring that our nation remains strong, economically stable, and self-sufficient. For me, offshore wind is a common-sense solution to real-world problems.

Keeping America resilient means having a robust energy supply. It means creating and sustaining well-paying jobs for American workers. It means investing in infrastructure that supports our economy and allows businesses to thrive. It means adapting to new technologies and embracing innovation. Offshore wind does all of these things. It’s an opportunity to revitalize our manufacturing sector, train a new generation of skilled workers, and secure our energy independence. This isn’t about political ideology — it’s about pragmatism, progress, and powering our future.

The Central Coast has always been a place of innovation and hard work. Let’s continue that legacy by embracing offshore wind. It’s a win-win for our community, our economy, and our future.

But the automotive gods have finally smiled on budget-conscious buyers: used EVs now cost less than comparable gas cars, flipping decades of conventional wisdom on its head.

The Great Price Reversal

Used EV values dropped 30-39% year-over-year while gas cars declined just 3-7%.

The numbers tell a story that would make any spreadsheet enthusiast weep with joy. Average used EVs hit $28,767 in May 2024, compared to $31,424 for used gas vehicles—a gap that widens monthly as inventory floods the market. This isn’t some statistical anomaly; it’s rapid battery innovation making three-year-old EVs feel ancient compared to today’s 300+ mile range models.

Federal Money on the Table

Up to $4,000 in tax credits sweetens deals on qualifying used EVs.

Uncle Sam wants you driving electric badly enough to subsidize your car payments. Qualifying used EVs under $25,000 earn buyers up to $4,000 in federal tax credits—essentially a government-sponsored discount that makes already cheaper EVs even more attractive. With 34% of used EV inventory now priced under $25,000, you’re looking at real money back at tax time.

Warranty Safety Net

Most used EVs remain under manufacturer coverage, eliminating battery replacement anxiety.

Here’s where the market gets interesting: 72% of used EVs are less than five years old, with 45% from 2023 or later. Translation? Your biggest fear about expensive battery replacement is largely unfounded. Most available models remain under partial warranty coverage, turning what was once a financial gamble into a calculated risk.

She explained the various programs available to support small businesses in their search for capital, including the State’s Small Business Credit Initiative and the Michigan Innovation Fund. Rencher noted that a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem and close collaboration among partners are key to driving the state’s economic growth.

“We have a standing network of hundreds of partners, and we really added on to that in the past couple of years through the [small business] support hubs work,” she said, noting that there are 27 across the state. Through what is dubbed the “hub and spoke” model, their network of partners ensures that both rural and urban communities are not left excluded.

“We have a very strong network of partners for entrepreneurs and innovation in the state,” Rencher said, emphasizing the importance of collaboration to achieve greater impact.

Rencher also spoke about PitchMI, a series of regional pitch competitions designed to support early-stage tech and high-growth companies across the state as part of a broader effort to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in Michigan. The regional competitions offer a total of $250,000 in prizes, with a grand prize of $1 million to be awarded in April 2026.

Removing Burdensome Regulation

State Rep. Joe Aragona (R-Clinton Twp.) spoke primarily on his dedication to reducing regulatory burdens for small businesses. With a background in small business himself, the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee shared that he understands the challenges of owning and operating a small business firsthand.

“Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,” he said, adding, “Whatever we need to do is just get regulations out of businesses’ way.”

He also shared how small business regulation hinders other areas of Michigan’s economic development, including housing, and how small businesses face different requirements across municipalities, complicating the process.

“It’s amazing the different hoops you have to jump through. There’s one set of hoops through this municipality, one set of hoops through another, and they’re all completely different. And you’re building the exact same house,” he said, emphasizing how housing developers struggle to operate across communities in the same county. These regulatory challenges on a hyperlocal level can have a larger-scale effect on Michigan’s economy as new businesses look to move to Michigan.

Regulation and Compliance in Detroit

Arthur Rushin, the City of Detroit’s Chief Enforcement Officer of BSEED, shared how his program’s efforts to improve the licensing and compliance process for small businesses within Detroit have been successful.

He explained that one of the department’s most powerful tools is the Development Resource Center and its online zoning portal. By simply entering an address, business owners can instantly see whether their intended use for a location is permitted, restricted, or requires special approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals. The portal doesn’t just give a yes-or-no answer; it outlines the exact steps needed to move forward so owners can plan whether or not to move forward with their business there and the steps needed to do so.

“We are a resource,” Rushin said. “No project is too small. That’s one of the things we want to make sure we stress to the public… reach out to us first, and we are literally going to walk you through the process of how to get your business started, so that way you can avoid some of the pitfalls.”

Rushin’s advice to Detroit small business owners is clear: start with BSEED before you start your business, because you can get additional resources like a free preliminary plan review.

“You come to us and say, ‘This is what I want to do, I have part of the plan,’ and we will work with you,” he said. “The department partners with agencies like the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and participates in compliance clinics across the city to help owners get into compliance [and] stay in compliance.”

The Impact

By leveraging available resources and fostering strong partnerships, small businesses can thrive and contribute to the economy’s growth. Continued dialogue between small business owners, business advocates, and policymakers is essential in fostering a business-friendly climate in the Detroit Region.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/small-business-owners-at-small-business-and-policy-1024x794.png,N,,2025-09-15 15:01:25.304955

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed ending its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for power plant owners and other sources of carbon emissions — a move carbon capture advocates say would hurt efforts to develop the carbon capture and storage sector.

Parts of the EPA’s GHG reporting program are “inextricably” tied to the federal Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage, according to the Carbon Capture Coalition.

“Should this proposed rule be finalized as is, the fate of hundreds of announced carbon management projects nationwide and the billions of dollars in capital investments and corresponding jobs will be on the line,” Jessie Stolark, the coalition’s executive director, said Friday in a press release.

Treasury Department and IRS requirements for monitoring, reporting and verification programs for geologic carbon storage require taxpayers claiming the 45Q tax credit to show how much carbon they are storing by using the EPA’s GHG reporting program, according to the coalition.

Carbon management project developers have invested about $77.5 billion on existing and near-term projects, according to the coalition. “It is not an understatement that the long-term success of the carbon management industry — and the significant economic and environmental benefits it fosters across the country — rests on the robust reporting mechanisms in place through the U.S. EPA,” Stolark said.

The Carbon Capture Coalition supports policies that enable the commercial deployment of carbon management technology. Its members include unions, environmental groups and companies such as Calpine, DTE Energy, GE Vernova and NRG Energy.

Under the EPA’s GHG reporting program, initially mandated by Congress in 2008, organizations in 46 source categories are required to report their carbon emissions every year.

However, the EPA contends that the Clean Air Act doesn’t require GHG reporting for sectors outside the petroleum and natural gas source category, according to the proposal. For that category, the EPA proposed ending reporting requirements for natural gas distribution utilities and suspending them for the rest of the category until 2034, in line with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The EPA expects the proposal will save affected companies about $303 million a year, with the petroleum and natural gas industry saving $256 million annually, according to an agency fact sheet.

EPA will accept comments on the proposal for 47 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

“The biggest lever to unlock America’s economic potential is modernizing our permitting process,” said Brendan Bechtel, Chairman and CEO of Bechtel and Chair of the Business Roundtable Smart Regulation Committee.
“Congress and the Administration have made meaningful progress on this vital issue, and now is the time to finish the job by enacting bipartisan permitting reform legislation.
Vulnerable to legal gridlock – Lengthy litigation timelines leave projects in limbo, undermining environmental review certainty and economic planning.
Increase domestic energy production and export – Accelerate permitting for all energy resources, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities, pipelines and carbon capture infrastructure.","Washington - Business Roundtable today released “Building a Prosperous Future,” a report on the urgent need to modernize America’s outdated federal permitting system for major infrastructure projects. The report details the economic harm caused by unnecessary permitting delays, highlights recent progress through legislation and executive action, and offers a comprehensive set of reforms to accelerate project approvals across energy, transportation, technology and other critical sectors.

“The biggest lever to unlock America’s economic potential is modernizing our permitting process,” said Brendan Bechtel, Chairman and CEO of Bechtel and Chair of the Business Roundtable Smart Regulation Committee. “From delivering clean energy and AI data centers to meeting the President’s goal of ten new nuclear reactors by 2030, the United States cannot afford to let projects sit idle for years. The policies in this report would help break the logjam and unleash investment, innovation and job creation across every sector.”

“If we want to compete and win in the coming decades, America needs a permitting process that moves at the pace of our ambitions,” said Joshua Bolten, CEO of Business Roundtable. “Congress and the Administration have made meaningful progress on this vital issue, and now is the time to finish the job by enacting bipartisan permitting reform legislation. Without the comprehensive, durable improvements outlined in this report, the United States will continue to leave trillions in investment on the sidelines.”

Problems with America’s current permitting system:

Cumbersome and time-consuming – The federal permitting process takes four to five years on average, with some projects delayed further by litigation long after agency approval.

Costly to communities and the economy – An estimated $1.5 trillion in investment is currently awaiting federal permits, while the unrealized induced GDP impact of infrastructure projects now in federal review totals approximately $1.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion.

Fragmented and redundant – Multiple overlapping reviews across agencies and jurisdictions create unnecessary duplication and delay.

Vulnerable to legal gridlock – Lengthy litigation timelines leave projects in limbo, undermining environmental review certainty and economic planning.

Policy recommendations to build on recent meaningful permitting reforms:

Improve and focus environmental reviews – Limit National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews to impacts not already under another agency’s jurisdiction, require agencies to make permitting decisions within 90 days of issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessments and expand categorical exclusions.

Reform the NEPA litigation process – Specify a statute of limitations of no more than 150 days, expedite case schedules and limit injunctions that block construction after procedural compliance.

Increase domestic energy production and export – Accelerate permitting for all energy resources, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities, pipelines and carbon capture infrastructure.

Expand and improve transmission capabilities and capacity – Improve the speed of the interconnection queue process and support regional and interregional transmission planning.

Ensure secure supply chains – Facilitate responsible domestic mining, processing and recycling of critical minerals essential to semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing.

Modernize digital and AI infrastructure approvals – Codify NEPA categorical exclusions for new and existing facilities, allow a mutual recognition permitting approval process for federal, state and local applications, and require permitting authorities to establish a single point of contact.",https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2F679146658e6d45af922aa9d9409fb683%2Ffd27341a6ba7451dbe31fc8465d7c67b?quality=60&width=200&height=200,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:29.112903

The eurozone — the 20 EU countries that use the euro currency — showed similar patterns, with its global trade surplus falling to 12.4 billion euros from 18.5 billion euros a year earlier.
European imports of U.S. goods surged 10.7% to 31.2 billion euros, while U.S. purchases of European products dropped 4.4% to 44.2 billion euros.
Other European-manufactured goods also struggled, with the trade deficit in that sector widening from 1.9 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros.
Only machinery and vehicles — including German cars and industrial equipment — showed strength, with Europe’s surplus in that sector rising to 21.4 billion euros in July from 16.5 billion euros in June.","BRUSSELS (CN) — Europe’s trade advantage over the U.S. shrank by another $5 billion in July, data released Monday shows, as a monthslong shift continued with Europeans buying significantly more American goods while exports across the Atlantic fell.

The European Union’s trade surplus with the U.S. fell to 13 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in July from 18 billion euros ($19.8 billion) a year earlier, according to official EU data. The shift represents the largest monthly deterioration in the trade relationship since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.

The eurozone — the 20 EU countries that use the euro currency — showed similar patterns, with its global trade surplus falling to 12.4 billion euros from 18.5 billion euros a year earlier.

European imports of U.S. goods surged 10.7% to 31.2 billion euros, while U.S. purchases of European products dropped 4.4% to 44.2 billion euros. The diverging trends signal a fundamental shift in one of the world’s most important trade relationships.

For the first seven months of 2025, Europe’s overall trade surplus with the rest of the world plummeted to 91.8 billion euros from 108.9 billion euros in the same period last year — a decline of 17.1 billion euros, reflecting broader competitiveness challenges.

The deteriorating U.S. relationship drove much of that decline. European exports to the U.S. have fallen as the dollar strengthened and American consumers shifted purchasing patterns, while Europeans are buying more American energy, technology and agricultural products.

European chemical companies — which produce everything from plastics to pharmaceuticals — saw their global trade surplus collapse from 22.2 billion euros to 16.6 billion euros compared to July 2024, a 5.6-billion-euro drop that largely reflects reduced U.S. demand.

Other European-manufactured goods also struggled, with the trade deficit in that sector widening from 1.9 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros.

Only machinery and vehicles — including German cars and industrial equipment — showed strength, with Europe’s surplus in that sector rising to 21.4 billion euros in July from 16.5 billion euros in June.

The trade deterioration reflects broader economic weakness across Europe, where second-quarter growth of just 0.1% lagged far behind the U.S. robust 0.8% expansion. European business investment plunged 1.8% in the second quarter while retail spending declined, reducing demand for U.S. products even as Europeans continued buying essential energy and technology.

Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, contracted 0.3% in the second quarter despite modest annual growth, directly impacting the chemicals and manufacturing sectors that traditionally drive European exports across the Atlantic.

The July figures represent a continuation of trade pressures that began when Trump imposed 10% tariffs on most EU goods in April, with automotive duties hitting 25%. As tensions escalated through the spring, Trump threatened to raise tariff rates to 30%, creating uncertainty that deepened the trade damage.

In June, the EU’s trade surplus had already plummeted 61% year-over-year to just 8 billion euros as businesses braced for potentially devastating tariff increases, with European exports to America falling 10.3% while imports surged 16.4%.

The July data suggest the bleeding continued even as Trump and EU leaders worked toward the trade agreement they would eventually reach on July 27, capping most tariffs at 15%.

The trade shift comes as Trump has intensified pressure on European allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas as a condition for stronger U.S. sanctions against Moscow. On Saturday, Trump wrote on a Truth Social post: “I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA.”

European officials bristled at Trump’s latest public ultimatum.

“We’re not going to comment on social media posts by the U.S. president,” a European Commission spokesman said curtly Monday when pressed about Trump’s demands during a Brussels briefing. “The successive sanctions packages we have brought forward are working. The economic evidence shows that they are having an impact on the Russian economy.”

The tensions reflect broader disagreements over sanctions coordination, with Trump’s assessment that European sanctions against Russia aren’t “tough enough.”

Energy has become a major factor in the changing trade relationship, with the United States now supplying 50.7% of Europe’s liquefied natural gas needs and serving as the bloc’s largest oil supplier at 15% of petroleum imports. European purchases of American liquefied natural gas have surged 113.5% in volume since 2021, a dramatic shift from when Russia provided 48% of EU natural gas and 29% of petroleum oil imports, compared to just 12% and 2% respectively by mid-2025.

European energy purchases from the U.S. totaled $76 billion in 2024, and the July 27 trade agreement commits the EU to buying $250 billion annually in U.S. energy over the next three years — more than tripling current import levels.

However, Trump has warned that tariffs could rise to 35% if the EU fails to meet its commitments, including an additional $600 billion in U.S. manufacturing investments.

The economic slowdown is beginning to affect European job markets, with employment growth slowing to 0.1% in both the eurozone and EU, down from 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Annual employment growth also slowed to 0.6% in the eurozone and 0.4% in the EU compared to the same period last year, according to separate EU data released Monday. About 219.9 million people were employed across the EU in the second quarter, with 171.6 million in the eurozone.

The labor market weakness extended to job openings, with European companies posting fewer available positions. The job vacancy rate fell to 2.1% across the EU in the second quarter, down from 2.4% a year earlier. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, saw its vacancy rate drop from 3.1% to 2.5%, while manufacturing job openings fell to just 1.6% across the EU, suggesting businesses are becoming more cautious about expansion plans amid trade uncertainties.

Trade between EU member states remained strong, rising 2.9% to 349.2 billion euros in July, suggesting Europe’s internal market continues functioning smoothly even as external trade weakens.

The U.S. represents Europe’s largest trading partner outside the European continent, making the relationship crucial for both economies. The European Union — a 27-country economic bloc that includes Germany, France, Italy and other major economies — operates as a single market larger than the United States. Unlike individual U.S. states, EU countries surrender their trade policy to Brussels, which negotiates on behalf of all members.

Unlike other states, which have set targets to reduce traffic and expand public transit, Massachusetts has pinned its climate strategy on hopes that consumers will start buying more electric vehicles (EVs).
The state's official Clean Energy and Climate Plan, published in 2020, says that ""Massachusetts will need to deploy 750,000 to one million ZEVs (zero emission vehicles) by 2030.""
In July, the Republican Party's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" eliminated a $7,500 federal rebate for new electric car purchases.
Researchers from Princeton University predict that the repeal of those benefits will considerably depress the market share for new electric vehicles in the next few years.","Recent actions from the Trump administration and other Republicans in Washington have considerably slowed the rate at which car buyers are choosing electric vehicles – a trend that puts the Commonwealth's legally-mandated pollution reduction targets even further out of reach.

Roads and highways are the biggest remaining source of greenhouse gas pollution (and air pollution in general) in New England. Unlike other states, which have set targets to reduce traffic and expand public transit, Massachusetts has pinned its climate strategy on hopes that consumers will start buying more electric vehicles (EVs).

The state's official Clean Energy and Climate Plan, published in 2020, says that ""Massachusetts will need to deploy 750,000 to one million ZEVs (zero emission vehicles) by 2030.""

That plan isn't working. As of July, there were only 152,000 fully electric or plug-in hybrid cars registered in the Commonwealth.

Meeting the low end of the state's 2030 target for EV deployment would require roughly one in three new car sales to be EVs each year over the next 5 years.

But EVs currently make up around 11 percent of new car sales, and those sales have slowed considerably this year, driven by plummeting demand for Teslas over the winter and spring.

Meanwhile, gasoline consumption – and all the air pollution that comes with it – is continuing to increase.

And then came Trump

If the outlook for the state's EV market was discouraging before, it's deteriorated even further in the last few months.

In July, the Republican Party's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" eliminated a $7,500 federal rebate for new electric car purchases. That rebate will no longer be available after September 30th.

Researchers from Princeton University predict that the repeal of those benefits will considerably depress the market share for new electric vehicles in the next few years. With the tax credits, EVs were expected to make up 40 percent of new car sales by 2030; without them, they're expected to represent just 24 percent of new cars by the end of the decade.

Congress has also voted to eliminate the ""Advanced Clean Cars"" rule, a California clean-air regulation that Massachusetts and several other states have adopted to gradually phase out the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles.

California regulators are fighting that legislation in court, and Attorney General Andrea Campbell joined the lawsuit in June.

But in Massachusetts, it's a bit of a moot point. In deference to lobbying from car dealers and manufacturers, Governor Healey had already announced (in May) that her administration won't enforce the Advanced Clean Car rule for the next two years anyhow.

Massachusetts Democrats sit idly by

This spring, the Massachusetts legislature announced that it was launching ""Response 2025,"" which lawmakers described as ""a coordinated effort"" to counteract new policies from Washington with legislation at the state level.

""We are committed to protecting our residents, defending our values, and leading Massachusetts through the uncertainty of federal action,"" Senate President Karen E. Spilka said in an April 1 press release. ""The Senate will not sit idly by—we have heard the concerns of our residents, and we are prepared to act.""

StreetsblogMASS reached out to Sen. Cindy Friedman of Arlington, who's leading the ""Response 2025"" initiative, to ask whether she and her colleagues were discussing any ideas for putting the transportation sector back on track to meet the state's climate goals.

Stephen Acosta, a spokesperson for the Senator, wrote back to tell StreetsblogMASS that ""unfortunately, she's not available to speak on this.""

At a ribbon-cutting for a new e-bike charging station in Somerville last month, StreetsblogMASS put a similar question to the Commonwealth's Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt.

""We're keeping with pushing ahead,"" said Tibbits-Nutt. ""We have the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI), which is $65 million from the federal government which we have obligated.""

That federal program is also under fire from Washington's Republicans, but the funding will install new charging stations every 50 miles along the Commonwealth's major highways.

Still, without a major change in course in the Commonwealth's current laws and regulations, there won't be nearly enough electric vehicles using those stations to make a meaningful impact on air pollution.

Course correction

When we pressed Tibbits-Nutt to tell us what her agency would do to reduce the root cause of highway pollution – the excessive number of vehicles clogging the state's roadways – the Secretary cited the administration's efforts to fund the MBTA and increase funding for the state's Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs).

""For us it's always been the focus, on reducing VMT (vehicle miles travelled). One of the reasons I think the Legislature is with the record amount of transportation funding, especially to the MBTA, we're able to put more buses on the road and expand transit, so we can encourage people to that mode shift,"" said Tibbits-Nutt.

But the vast majority of the Legislature's budget increases for transit agencies this year is merely backfilling a decade's worth of cuts and deferred maintenance left over from Gov. Baker's administration. The T still has a multi-billion dollar shortfall for repair projects, and its most transformative plans to expand transit service remain unfunded.

Seth Gadbois, an attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation, says there's a fundamental gap in accountability between what lawmakers have promised in the Global Warming Solutions Act and what they fund in their budgets.

""States like Massachusetts not only have the space to act, they have a legal and moral responsibility to do so,"" Gadbois told StreetsblogMASS (editor's note: the Conservation Law Foundation is the fiscal sponsor of StreetsblogMASS, which means it administers our payroll and finances; it does not have any role in governance or editorial decisions).

Gadbois has been working with a handful of lawmakers, led by Sen. Cynthia Creem of Newton and Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis of Framingham, to pass what they're calling the ""Freedom to Move Act,"" which would require MassDOT to align its spending priorities with the pollution reduction mandates in the state's Global Warming Solutions Act.

Lawmakers in Colorado, Washington, and Minnesota have already passed similar laws.

""Right now we don’t have a check against whether our transportation dollars are helping or hurting our climate targets,"" said Gadbois. ""Freedom to Move aligns state level transport policy and spending with our climate obligations... It’s a big policy alignment shift that will ultimately expand the menu of options for how people get around.""

At the ribbon-cutting in Somerville last month, we asked Tibbit-Nutt whether she supported the Freedom to Move Act, or whether MassDOT had taken a position. She declined to answer the question.",https://lede-admin.mass.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/05/EmptyTeslaChargingParking-e1757618338900.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:41.030475

AEM’s Advocacy Team is focused on expanded workforce funding, targeted tax-credit programs, and ongoing incentive language that can influence site-selection and workforce pipeline development. Municipal procurement and local permitting reforms being discussed by the municipal associations are impacting installers and on-site equipment businesses and should continue to provide insight on opportunities.

Boosting direct manufacturing supports like the Manufacturing Equipment Grant Program reimbursing up to 50% of equipment purchase or down payment was the focus. There were also some adjustments to taxes and fuel fees aimed at lowering the near-term capital cost of buying machinery and encouraging tech upgrades in small- and mid-sized shops. AEM’s Advocacy Team will continue engaging on program details and scoring criteria for equipment grants.

Site readiness, broadband, and targeted capital financing being provided by the Council on Development Finance is through loans and grants. These loans and grants can also be leveraged for factory modernization. The new administration has touted less reliance on traditional grants and revamping existing policies. AEM’s Advocacy Team will be monitoring any changes to incentive structures and forthcoming bond/capital projects legislation.

Recent policies expanded business incentives, jobs retention and training credits, resiliency programming, and clean-energy procurement preferences, while modernizing manufacturing support for sectors like semiconductor and advanced-manufacturing. State-level clean energy and solar program funding changes are affecting supply chains for equipment makers in the state by redistributing incentives. This creates the need to review tax-credit policy as it is implemented with a focus on manufacturing wage/training credits.

Benefitting from a proposed increase in funding for vocational education, apprenticeships, and advanced-manufacturing workforce grants; equipment manufacturers could also see scaled tech training. Workforce pipeline investments that improve access to skilled operators/technicians and job retention credits for site expansions are being prioritized in the budget proposal also. The budget process currently lies with the General Assembly awaiting votes for final passage.

New Jersey

Last month the Governor signed a significant manufacturing tax-credit package: $500 million to expand tax credits for manufacturers who locate or grow their business in the state. From that, $200 million is being dedicated over the next two years for clean-energy product manufacturers (solar, geothermal, green hydrogen).

On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump voiced support for an “all the above” approach to energy policy. However, the second Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress have come down hard on solar, wind, and electric vehicles via Congressional budget changes and executive actions.

Chief among the changes within the OBBBA are the early phase-outs of the 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC). Both credits are demand-side incentives that have been instrumental in speeding up the energy transition.

The early loss of tax credits is expected to deal long-term damage to the industry. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that 10-year installations could decrease 17%, reaching volumes as low as 375 GW.

Crunch time

Following a predicted boom to meet deadlines for accessing the PTC and ITC, U.S. clean-energy installations could plunge 41% after 2027, according to a forecast from BloombergNEF (BNEF).

Previously, the 48E and 45Y tax credits were to be available to projects until the United States achieved a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2022 levels. These credits were made available via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Now, under the OBBBA, solar and wind projects that begin construction more than 12 months after the July 4 enactment must be “placed in service,” meaning reaching commercial operations, by Dec. 31, 2027, to qualify for credits.

Projects that begin construction within 12 months of enactment can be eligible for tax credits if a “substantial portion” is built. These projects are “safe harbored” and can gain the tax credit if they are placed in service by mid-2030.

“Solar installations are expected to increase in 2025-26 as developers rush to meet deadlines,” said Wood Mackenzie. “Permitted projects are well-positioned, but unpermitted developments face growing uncertainty as permitting bottlenecks threaten to push completion dates outside eligibility windows.”

Keith Martin, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said projects will likely need to “incur” at least 5% of their cost to qualify for safe harbor designation. “Costs are usually incurred only as the developer takes delivery of equipment or services, with one exception. A payment for specific equipment or services by the deadline counts if delivery is reasonably expected within 3.5 months. There are nuances about counting payments for services,” said Martin.

The other path to qualification, he said, is to start “physical work of a significant nature” at a project site on portions of an installation eligible for the 48E credit.

“In the short term, we’re all going to be extremely busy trying to get projects going at the outset of July 4, 2026,” said Martin, appearing on the “Currents” podcast hosted by law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. “After that, I think people will have their heads down trying to develop and build these projects, finance them. There’ll be a distant place and service date for those.”

“So I think we’ll do fine,” said Martin. “Eventually there will be a new administration. Maybe people will be more concerned about climate change. We’ve seen this play before. These tax credits started in 1992 and they have expired, been restored, expired, been restored. So it’s perfectly possible we’ll see that again.”

The storm is surely in sight. In July, shortly following passage of OBBBA, New Leaf Energy, a community and utility-scale project developer, laid off about one-fifth of its workforce – 41 out of 217 employees. “The pathway to developing clean energy projects has narrowed, but it has not vanished; reducing the size of the company is intended to provide stability and free cash while the company adapts to a changed market for the long term,” said New Leaf Energy in a statement.

Unlike solar and wind, grid-scale energy storage will remain eligible for the ITC and PTC under its original schedule. The 48E and 45Y credits for storage projects will phase out by 25% each year starting in 2032 until Dec. 31, 2035, when the credits will expire entirely.

What’s more, projects are facing tightened restrictions on components and materials sourced from “Foreign Entities of Concern” (see pp. 10-12).

Residential pressure

The window is even tighter for residential solar. While lobbying was successful in preventing a near-instant phase-out of the 48E ITC, the 25D tax credit for residential solar projects, paid directly to individuals who purchase home solar with a loan or cash, is phased out for projects not installed by the end of 2025.

The cuts to credits come at a particularly hard time for U.S. residential solar. Installations declined 31% in 2024, according to Wood Mackenzie. Over the last year, industry titans like SunPower, Sunnova, and Mosaic Solar have filed for bankruptcy. The industry historically has leaned on the value proposition of lowering customer electricity bills and providing predictable costs for the long term. However, that value has been increasingly difficult to provide.

Gone are the days of low interest rates enabling attractive finance terms for loans or leased systems. In many major markets, such as California, net metering rates for sending excess electricity to the grid have been slashed by 75% or more. One pathway to continuing to drive customer value is pursuing lower soft costs – expenses not tied to hardware.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said more than 65% of the cost to install residential solar is related to soft costs like paying sales teams, securing permits, and grid connection costs. The United States may find a path forward by pursuing market conditions like Australia, where over 40% of homes in some regions have rooftop solar. Soft costs are far lower in the nation, with an average residential solar installation cost of AUD 0.89/W ($0.58), according to a January 2025 report from price comparison website Compare the Market – more than AUD 2.00/W cheaper than in both Canada and the United States.

Underlying strength

Since long-term federal tax credits were enacted by the IRA, about 80% of investment announcements were in Republican-led districts. More than 224 projects totaling nearly $110 billion in investment and leading to more than 83,000 jobs were announced in Republican voting districts, according to E2. Even before the OBBBA was passed, the looming threat of cuts led to billions of dollars in project and factory cancellations and the loss of tens of thousands of expected or existing jobs in these districts.

However, the fundamentals for solar remain strong. Analysis by financial advisory Lazard found that solar levelized cost of electricity beats the lowest-cost fossil fuel for new-build projects, even without tax credits. Solar represented 78% of new capacity added to the grid in 2025 through April, according to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data. With electricity demand expected to rise 2% per year and 50% cumulatively by 2050, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, demand for projects that can be added to the grid quickly will remain robust.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Solar_installation_technician_on_rooftop_5392894792-1536x865-1-1200x676.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:46.502426

Alternative energy truck maker ZM Trucks cut the ribbon on its U.S. headquarters and assembly plant last month in Fontana, California — launching its expansion just as federal EV tax credits wind down, emissions rules shift and charging infrastructure remains uneven.

Even so, the company says policy headwinds won’t deter it from competing in the North American market.

“ZM Trucks has never relied on federal incentives as part of our go-to-market strategy,” a spokesperson for the OEM said in an email to Trucking Dive on Sept. 9. Instead, the company focuses on state-level programs in key markets, such as New York, New Jersey, Texas and California — along with plans for Nevada and Washington.

A subsidiary of Japan-based ZO Motors, ZM Trucks has the benefit of a global perspective when it comes to its customers’ potential charging concerns. ZO Motors has plants in Japan and Cambodia, producing both electric- and hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles.

“Our experience has shown that establishing ‘behind-the-fence’ charging is critical for a successful transition to electric powertrains,” ZM Trucks said via email. “Relying on public charging as a primary solution is cost-prohibitive in the U.S. While it’s useful as a backup in emergencies, it doesn’t support a sustainable business case on its own.”

With infrastructure seen as a limiting factor, ZM Trucks is turning attention to what it can control: production.

At its 210,000-square-foot facility in Fontana, ZM Trucks currently has 39 employees on its pilot line, where it plans to build two models:

The battery-electric T75, a heavy-duty vehicle built for ports, warehouses and distribution yards with a 75-mile range

The battery-electric ZM8, a short-wheelbase model designed for urban delivery and upfit applications with an estimated 165-mile range

So far, the ZM8 has found its largest base among final-mile delivery companies and small businesses, while the T75 is currently used exclusively in port operations. The company did not disclose customer names.

Notably, the factory was designed to build ZM Trucks’ T75, ZM8 and future models all on the same line. Once the line is fully operational, it will be tooled to produce three trucks per hour, the company said.

“With our current tooling investment, we can support three jobs per hour on a single shift — giving us ample production capacity to meet future demand,” ZM Trucks said, noting production is constrained by supply chain lead times, rather than its ability to scale internally.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dooKGyzDOaKkvv-Aqa401oke3OYPeyw2ImG0pgFXG5U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9aTVRydWNrc0V2ZW50MjAyNTQ1LnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:49.922524

Researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and LG Energy Solution have developed a ""cohesion-inhibiting new liquid electrolyte"" that effectively solves the dendrite problem that has long plagued lithium-metal batteries. This innovation enables remarkable performance metrics that could transform the EV landscape: 800km range on a single charge, a lifespan exceeding 300,000km, and most impressively, a super-fast charging time of just 12 minutes.

The dendrite challenge is solved

Lithium-metal batteries, which replace the graphite anode found in conventional lithium-ion batteries with pure lithium metal, offer significantly higher energy density. However, they've been hampered by the formation of dendrites—tree-like lithium crystal structures that grow on the anode surface during charging, particularly during rapid charging cycles.

The research team identified that non-uniform interfacial cohesion on the lithium metal surface is the fundamental cause of dendrite formation during rapid charging. Their solution employs an anion structure with weak binding affinity to lithium ions, which minimizes interface non-uniformity and effectively suppresses dendrite growth even under fast-charging conditions.

""This research has become a key foundation for overcoming the technical challenges of lithium-metal batteries by understanding the interfacial structure,"" stated Professor Hee Tak Kim from KAIST's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. ""It has overcome the biggest barrier to the introduction of lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles.""

The study was published in Nature Energy on September 3, 2025, with Hyeokjin Kwon as the first author.

The fast-charging revolution

This breakthrough joins a wave of recent advancements in fast-charging battery technology that we have been featuring in recent months:

In May 2025, CATL unveiled its Ultra-Fast battery technology, which can provide enough charge for 75km of driving in mere seconds. CATL's second-generation Shenxing battery technology aims to deliver charging speeds comparable to refueling a gasoline vehicle, potentially accelerating mass EV adoption.

The CATL Shenxing Pro battery employs several innovative approaches to achieve its remarkable charging speeds. As we reported, the Shenxing Pro batteries feature a 758 km WLTP range and are specifically designed for Europe's growing EV market with fast-charging capabilities.

According to Inside EVs, CATL claims this is ""the world's first LFP battery featuring both an 800 km range and a 12C peak charging rate,"" making it one of the most impressive advancements in LFP battery technology to date.

Industry implications

The IEA Global EV Outlook 2025 report highlights that fast-charging infrastructure is rapidly becoming essential for EV adoption worldwide. According to our cousins at EV Infrastructure News, global fast charging capacity is projected to grow more than tenfold by 2030, keeping pace with the growing EV market that exceeded 17 million sales globally in 2024.

Leawat has also entered the ultra-fast charging space with their 46-Series cylindrical batteries featuring 20% reduced internal resistance, 5% higher energy density, and an impressive 50C discharge rate, as announced at The Battery Show Europe 2025.

The KAIST/LG Energy Solution breakthrough represents a significant leap forward, as their 12-minute charging time for an 800km range battery would effectively eliminate range anxiety and charging concerns for most consumers.

Associated Press

The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25255740590738.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:31.001258

As one of the hottest topics in boardrooms and for governments, it is the subject of a key panel at Sustainability LIVE: Climate Week NYC on 22 September at Convene, 360 Madison Avenue, NYC.

Hundreds of c-suite sustainability leaders will gather for the landmark event, hoping for new ideas on how to accelerate the energy transition.

The Future of Energy Transition, sponsored by Siemens

Automation Machinery Manufacturing giant Siemens is sponsoring the panel, which will be introduced with a keynote by Stacy Mahler, US Head of Sustainability.

Stacy has more than 15 years of experience in the industrial and energy sectors.

As Head of Sustainability for Siemens Smart Infrastructure (SI) in the US, she engages organisations on their sustainability journey.

Her work includes helping them with infrastructure enhancements that improve energy efficiency, integrate renewable energy and enable electrification of transportation and facilities.

Stacy also supports the carbon reduction roadmap for Siemens SI’s carbon footprint in the US.

She holds a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida and an MBA from Northwestern University.

Three major themes

While the panellists are likely to cover a broad range of aspects to the energy transition, three in particular are expected to feature:

Decentralisation of energy systems

The future of energy is moving from centralised, fossil-fuel power plants to decentralised networks of renewable generation.

Solar rooftops, wind farms, microgrids and virtual power plants (VPPs) are among the technologies designed to increase resilience against blackouts, reduce transmission losses and democratise access to clean energy.

Companies are pioneering distributed solutions, while governments are updating regulations to accommodate peer-to-peer energy trading.

Decentralisation also supports rural electrification, particularly in emerging economies, where microgrids can leapfrog traditional grid infrastructure.

Electrification of transport and industry

Hard-to-abate sectors transport and heavy industry are attempting to electrify to cut reliance on oil, coal and gas.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are scaling rapidly, with many global automakers committing to phase out combustion engines.

In heavy industry, processes including steelmaking and cement production are increasingly using renewable power.

The challenge lies in ensuring that grids can handle increased demand without compromising reliability – meaning energy storage, demand response and grid modernisation will be crucial.

Green hydrogen and alternative fuels

Green hydrogen, produced through renewable-powered electrolysis, is emerging as one of the keys of the energy transition.

It offers a solution for sectors where direct electrification is difficult, such as aviation, shipping and heavy industry.

Companies including Air Liquide, Siemens Energy and bp are investing heavily in hydrogen infrastructure.

Alongside biofuels and synthetic fuels, hydrogen promises to help decarbonise global trade and transport. But scaling requires massive investment, cost reductions and supportive policies.

Leaders from NVIDIA, Oracle and EEI

Stacy will be joined on the panel, moderated by BizClik Group Broadcast Director Neil Perry, by:

These include a deal between X-Energy and Centrica, with plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. This would generate enough power for 1.5 million homes, and create up to 2,500 jobs. The project, the companies noted, could be worth £40bn in economic value, with £12bn of value within the North East of England alone.

The suite of deals would also include an £11bn project between Holtec, EDF and Tritax creating advanced data centres powered by small modular reactors in Nottinghamshire, and a project between Last Energy and DP World, backed by £80m in private investment, to establish one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants.

It also includes a £4m deal between Urenco and Radiant to supply advanced HALEU fuel to the US market, and a plan between TerraPower and KBR to conduct studies and evaluate UK sites for the deployment of the Ntrium advanced reactor technology, with each reactor supporting around 1,600 construction jobs and 250 permanent jobs.

Under the deal, the US and UK could fast-track reactor design checks for those reactors already rigorously checked in one country to avoid duplication of work. This would cut nuclear approvals for advanced designs, such as the Rolls-Royce SMR, from three to four years to just two.

The deal has the potential to create around 2,500 jobs in Teesside, going beyond the already 11,000 jobs created in 2025 through government-led investment, according to Nuclear Industry Association statistics.

The partnership also extends to fusion energy through co-ordinated experimental programmes, in which AI technology is used to create advanced simulation tools. Following this, a global fusion energy policy summit will be co-hosted in the US in 2026, to strengthen international cooperation on fusion energy.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “This landmark UK-US nuclear partnership is not just about powering our homes, it’s about powering our economy, our communities, and our ambition. These major commitments set us well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.

“Together with the US, we’re building a golden age of nuclear that puts both countries at the forefront of global innovation and investment.”

Prior projects

Expanded nuclear power is central to the UK Government’s clean energy mission, part of the UK’s drive to build more clean power for improved energy security.

This deal is part of what has been described by the UK Government as a ‘golden age’ of nuclear, and follows a £38bn investment in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant by investors including the UK Government, Canadian multinational La Caisse, British energy giant Centrica, EDF and Amber Infrastructure.

The Sizewell C plant will have an operating lifespan of at least 60 years. While project costs have grown from £20bn over the years, partly due to inflation, the UK Government maintains that it represents value for money, with £2bn of avoided annual electricity system costs predicted compared to renewables.

Critics of the nuclear power drive have raised objections that the nuclear fuel cycle produces significant volumes of dangerous waste, some of which remains radioactive for thousands of years. However, proponents highlight nuclear power’s low-carbon nature and ability to reliably generate energy at any time of day, at scale.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the US to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.

“Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid skilled jobs for working people.”",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/full_42080.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:09.665807

The likely tradeoff, of course, is thinner margins on the inventory that's being cleared out. According to a report from StoneEagle, front-end gross profits on leases – all leases, not just EVs – turned negative in July for the first time since early 2020.

""Our data shows that dealers leaned on aggressive lease strategies, particularly in EVs, to clear aging inventory ahead of expiring EV tax incentives,"" Allen says.

Deadline Essentially Extended

Some context: The earlier expectation was that EV buyers had to take actual delivery by Sept. 30, when the $7,500 EV tax break is set to expire. But on Aug. 21, the IRS published guidance that says EV buyers still qualify for the incentive as long as they get their orders in by the deadline, even if actual delivery takes place later.

The actual wording is trickier. The IRS says that to qualify for the tax incentive, the buyer has to ""acquire"" an EV by the deadline. But in a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section of the notice, the IRS states, ""a vehicle is 'acquired' as of the date a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made. A payment includes a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in.""

With the deadline approaching, manufacturers are making ""call to action"" appeals to likely EV consumers. ""Federal Tax Credit Expires in Three Weeks,"" says the subject line of an email Tesla sent out Sept. 9 to consumers who had expressed an interest in the brand.

EV buyers are responding, often through leases, says Melinda Zabritski, head of Automotive Financial Insights for Experian Automotive, tells WardsAuto.

According to the Experian State of the Automotive Finance Market report for the second quarter, published on Aug. 28, leases account for 57.7% of EV financing, up from 47% a year ago.

The installation is one of three that supplies renewable energy to the Rhode Island electric grid, in exchange for utility bill credits for regional housing authorities, lowering their operating costs and ultimately lowering energy prices for public housing residents. Announced in 2021, the construction of the project is now complete, and all three solar installations are supplying green energy to the Rhode Island electric grid.

The collaboration between PHARI, Nautilus and Veolia is a first of its kind in the nation encompassing multiple public housing authorities under a single renewable energy contract. The Exeter Mail installation is the largest of three contracted by the housing authorities.

Combined, the three sites exceed 13 MW, removing approximately 4,800 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, the equivalent of taking more than 1,000 cars off the road. The market value of the generation from the three projects will be distributed among nine housing authorities in Rhode Island (Providence, North Providence, Newport, Cranston, Smithfield, Warwick, Warren, Bristol and Lincoln) in the form of utility bill credits. The credits will generate a discount against prevailing electricity supply rates, which lowers the operating budgets of the housing authorities in a region with some of the highest energy costs in the U.S. , benefiting both taxpayers and public housing families.

Located primarily in the towns of Exeter and Smithfield, the solar fields provide approximately 20 million kilowatt hours annually. The projects are estimated to save over $35 million in energy costs over the next 20 years.

Nautilus has overseen the development, permitting and construction of the solar installation. The company will now look after the ongoing management, maintenance and performance for the life of the projects, estimated at 25 to 30 years. Leveraging its deep knowledge of decarbonization, power optimization, and solar generation, Veolia was selected by PHARI to serve as a buy-side agent for the collaboration of housing authorities to manage the procurement effort, advise technically and manage the complexity of the vendor selection process.

The energy generated from the projects now feeds into the electric utility territory of Rhode Island Energy, a subsidiary of PPL Corporation. The completion of the Exeter Mail 6.5 MW field, the third of three that were contracted, marks the conclusion of this project.

Karin Hamel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Veolia's Sustainable Industries and Buildings business said: ""Veolia is proud to contribute to this transformative solar installation, which not only harnesses the power of renewable energy but also directly supports the well-being of thousands of low-income families in Rhode Island. This project aligns with Veolia's GreenUp strategy. Producing local, low-carbon energy is a critical growth booster for accelerating ecological transformation. This project is a perfect example of how green energy can be used for good.""

Jeffrey Cheng, Chief Executive Officer of Nautilus Solar said: ""This solar installation marks an important milestone in our mission to make clean energy more accessible. By delivering the benefits of community solar directly to public housing residents, we're pioneering a model that supports renewable energy goals while delivering long-term economic benefits to the local community. Rhode Island continues to be a key state for innovation in clean energy access, and we're proud to continue growing our investment in the state while building stronger, more resilient communities.""

Robert Coupe, PHARI Co-President and Executive Director of Cranston Housing Authority said: ""Every housing authority in Rhode Island is working to provide the highest quality affordable housing possible with limited budgets. Our partnership with Veolia and Nautilus dramatically reduces utility costs, freeing up valuable resources to invest in property maintenance, facility improvements and operational support. By supporting the growth of renewable energy projects, we are improving the quality of life for future generations while enhancing our ability to serve current residents.""

The Scale of the Problem

Food waste in the United States is staggering. According to a 2025 EPA report titled, “Estimating the Cost of Food Waste to American Consumers,” Americans collectively throw away more than 133 billion pounds of food annually. That translates into over $400 billion in lost value and makes food waste the single largest component of municipal landfills. On an individual level, the cost is equally striking – consumers lose an estimated $728 per person each year, or nearly $3,000 for a family of four. These losses represent roughly 11 percent of household food spending.

Beyond the financial implications, wasted food carries environmental and human costs. Decomposing food in landfills generates methane – a greenhouse gas significantly more potent than carbon dioxide. At the same time, millions of American households are food insecure, highlighting the disconnect between food supply and food access.

Feed It Onward is a voluntary program connecting farms, restaurants, grocery stores, food brands, military bases, and nonprofits already engaged in “food recovery efforts” to minimize food waste. By providing a national platform, EPA hopes to amplify success stories, promote collaboration, and inspire replication across communities.

The program reflects the values of America’s 250th anniversary celebration – generosity, grit, and community – by showcasing how everyday Americans are turning food waste into opportunity. Its launch event included a tangible example – Frey Farms delivered a truckload of fresh produce that would have otherwise gone to a landfill, providing meals for military families at Scott Air Force Base.

EPA has long emphasized waste reduction and sustainable materials management. While Feed It Onward does not create new legal mandates, it sits within a larger policy landscape where federal, state, and local governments regulate waste disposal, landfill management, and greenhouse gas emissions.

The voluntary nature of the initiative makes it more of a public-private partnership platform than a regulatory program. However, businesses and institutions that participate may benefit indirectly from reduced disposal costs, enhanced compliance with state-level waste diversion requirements, and improved ESG performance.

Aligning with EPA’s national platform can also provide reputational benefits. For companies navigating tightening state food waste laws – such as mandatory organics recycling requirements in California and New York – voluntary engagement with Feed It Onward can complement compliance efforts and demonstrate proactive corporate responsibility.

Feed It Onward underscores the intersection of environmental protection, economic efficiency, and community well-being. By offering a national platform for voluntary collaboration, EPA is positioning the program as both a celebratory initiative for America’s 250th anniversary and a practical response to one of the country’s most persistent waste challenges.

For businesses, nonprofits, and communities, participation represents not only an opportunity to reduce waste but also to strengthen relationships, improve environmental outcomes, and enhance resilience. While voluntary in design, the program may shape the broader policy conversation around food waste, sustainability, and corporate responsibility in the coming years.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.11157_2634.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:26.643810

The company's commitment to sustainability extends beyond generation. MGE Energy has set a clear target to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution system, a critical step in reducing the climate impact of its operationsHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. This aligns with broader industry trends, as utilities face mounting pressure to address methane leaks, which have a potent short-term warming effect. By proactively addressing this issue, MGE Energy is not only mitigating regulatory risks but also enhancing its reputation as an environmentally responsible operator.

Strategic Partnerships and Regulatory Alignment

While specific 2024–2025 regulatory filings or partnerships are not explicitly detailed in recent disclosures, MGE Energy's actions suggest a proactive approach to navigating the evolving regulatory environment. For example, the company's Columbia Energy Storage Project has been selected to receive a federal grant, underscoring its ability to secure public support for innovative infrastructureHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ].

This structure allows MGE Energy to hedge against market volatility while capitalizing on long-term trends such as electrification and decentralized energy systems.

Shareholder Value: A Legacy of Stability and Growth

For investors, MGE Energy's appeal lies in its ability to balance environmental stewardship with financial discipline. The company has a 110-year history of paying dividends, with consecutive annual increases for over 50 yearsHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. This track record reflects a conservative capital allocation strategy that prioritizes reliability—a critical factor in the utility sector, where earnings stability is paramount.

MGE Energy's recent financial performance further reinforces its value proposition. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company has maintained a consistent dividend policy and demonstrated operational efficiency, as evidenced by its recognition as the most reliable electric utility in the United StatesHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. These accolades are not merely symbolic; they translate into customer retention, regulatory favor, and investor confidence.

Risks and Considerations

No investment is without risk. MGE Energy's reliance on state-level regulatory approvals means its clean energy projects could face delays or cost overruns. Additionally, while its methane reduction goals are ambitious, achieving net-zero emissions will require sustained capital expenditures and technological innovation. However, the company's track record of prudent investment and its alignment with national decarbonization goals suggest these challenges are manageable.

Conclusion: A Model for the Future of Utilities

MGE Energy exemplifies how a traditional utility can evolve into a clean energy leader without sacrificing shareholder value. By investing in solar, wind, and storage infrastructure, targeting emissions reductions, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, the company is well-positioned to thrive in a low-carbon economy.

Why Battery Recycling Matters

From smartphones and laptops to e-scooters and power tools, batteries power nearly every part of daily life. Most of these rechargeable devices run on lithium-ion batteries made up of limited resources like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese. When batteries are recycled, these valuable materials can be recovered and repurposed domestically, reducing reliance on global supply chains, preventing safety hazards, and strengthening America's energy future.

That mission is at the heart of Batteries Plus, which recycles more than 52 million pounds of batteries each year. By keeping thousands of tons of these materials out of landfills and in circulation, the brand helps prevent dangerous battery-related fires in waste facilities while securing critical minerals for reuse. With 730+ locations nationwide and more than three decades of recycling expertise, Batteries Plus is leading the effort to make battery recycling a simple, safe, and repeatable habit for communities everywhere.

Road ahead The IEA stresses that achieving net-zero scenarios would require green hydrogen to make up 65 per cent of global hydrogen output by 2035, up from just 1 per cent today.","Global hydrogen deployment is gathering pace, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned in its Global Hydrogen Review 2025 that stronger policy support, investments and infrastructure are vital to meet net-zero goals, even as India emerges as one of the fastest movers with plans to produce 5 million tonnes (mt) annually by 2030.

The report highlights that hydrogen demand worldwide is set to rise from about 95 million tonnes (mt) today to over 180 mt by 2030, driven largely by decarbonisation commitments in heavy industry, long-haul transport and power. Yet, most of the growth so far has come from fossil-based hydrogen, and low-emission hydrogen accounts for less than 2 per cent of production.

“Hydrogen is no longer a niche discussion — it is becoming a central pillar of clean energy strategies worldwide,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “But we need to close the gap between ambition and action.”

Clean hydrogen capacity surges but lags targets

Globally, more than 220 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser capacity is in various stages of planning, with about 15 GW operational or under construction — a sharp increase from under 1 GW just three years ago. Electrolysers use renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen, which can slash lifecycle emissions by over 90 per cent compared to fossil hydrogen.

Still, the IEA warned that only a fraction of these projects is progressing to final investment decisions (FIDs). Supply chain constraints, permitting delays, and uncertain demand visibility are slowing momentum.

“Announced projects could deliver the volumes needed, but the reality is that too few are reaching the construction phase,” the report cautions. “Clear long-term policy signals are vital to unlock private capital.”

Investment and policy landscape strengthening

Over 50 countries now have national hydrogen strategies, while dedicated public funding pledges have crossed $280 billion through 2030. The European Union, United States, Japan, and South Korea are leading on subsidy frameworks, carbon contracts for difference, and production tax credits.

The U S Inflation Reduction Act has emerged as a game changer, offering up to $3 per kg of green hydrogen produced, while the EU has launched its Hydrogen Bank to support early projects and import corridors.

“Stable revenue mechanisms and coordinated infrastructure planning are now the decisive factors for market take-off,” the IEA said.

India ramps up Green Hydrogen ambition

Meanwhile, IEA noted that India is among the fastest movers, with the National Green Hydrogen Mission, aiming to produce 5 mt of green hydrogen annually by 2030, supported by an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.

India is racing to establish a fully indigenous solar manufacturing ecosystem by 2028, with plans to produce not just solar modules but also cells, wafers and ingots domestically to slash import dependence, create jobs, attract investments and position India as a global clean energy powerhouse, Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi announced on September 11, 2025.

India has already crossed 251.5 GW of non-fossil installed capacity — achieving over half of its 2030 target of 500 GW — and hit 50 per cent of total installed power capacity from non-fossil fuels five years ahead of schedule.

The country has already notified incentives for electrolyser manufacturing and green hydrogen production, while state governments such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Odisha are rolling out policies for dedicated renewable zones and port-based hydrogen hubs.

“India has the dual advantage of abundant renewable potential and a fast-growing industrial base,” the report observes. “If it succeeds in lowering production costs, it could become one of the world’s largest exporters.”

Companies like Reliance, Adani, NTPC, and Indian Oil have announced multi-gigawatt projects, while ports such as Mundra and Vizag are positioning to export green ammonia to Europe and Asia. However, the report warns that cost competitiveness hinges on scaling electrolysers rapidly and reducing renewable power tariffs.

Road ahead

The IEA stresses that achieving net-zero scenarios would require green hydrogen to make up 65 per cent of global hydrogen output by 2035, up from just 1 per cent today. This demands faster permitting, better infrastructure planning, and robust demand-creation policies in steel, fertilisers, shipping, and aviation.

“Hydrogen is essential to decarbonise the toughest sectors,” Birol said. “But without faster progress this decade, we risk missing our climate targets.”

The review concludes that coordinated international efforts, carbon pricing, and trade rules are critical to accelerate the clean hydrogen economy — and that India, if it executes its plans, could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this global shift.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-15%2F58bqyuxi%2FHydrogen.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:28.037834

The British government is hopeful that reaching a deal with the United States will speed up what has, so far, been a halting effort to build nuclear plants in Britain. “Together with the U.S., we are building a golden age of nuclear,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement on Monday.

Mr. Starmer’s government favors construction of more nuclear plants despite their drawbacks. These facilities come with huge price tags and other risks, but they produce large volumes of steady energy with low emissions.

The industry’s advocates say that the benefits of having large domestic sources of power generation outweigh the negatives. “Replacing reliance on imports with domestic carbon-free power will contribute significantly to the U.K.’s energy security,” said Vincent C. Zabielski, a partner at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman in London who works on nuclear issues.

Building nuclear stations also creates jobs, an important consideration for the government, which is aligned with the trade unions. About 98,000 people already work in the industry in Britain, constructing, operating and decommissioning plants, according to the Nuclear Industry Association, a trade group.

Britain’s existing nuclear plants are gradually reaching the end of their lives, and the country is struggling to add new ones. The last nuclear station to be completed, Sizewell B in Suffolk, began generating electricity in 1995.

Given how quickly the political winds on clean energy have shifted in the U.S. over the past year, it’s easy to lose sight of the continued momentum.

But focus on the facts, not the rhetoric, and you see the real story. Investors and companies are making choices driven by innovation, efficiency, opportunity, and profitability. And I, along with many of these leaders, will be at Climate Week in New York City next week, underscoring how seriously they’re pursuing these opportunities.

The headwinds are real, with the federal government actively opposing clean energy. And with special interests waging a politically driven campaign to force investors to ignore climate risks, introducing hundreds of state laws to control private investment strategy.

But alongside this turbulence, the market forces driving the clean economy remain undeniable. Rising energy demand and spiking costs. Weather damage topped $93 billion in just the first half of this year. Fierce global competition in markets from batteries to sustainable agriculture. And an urgent need to cut pollution and safeguard natural resources that businesses rely on.

Opportunities and choices

These forces bring both opportunities and choices for investors and businesses to double down, shape policy, and accelerate cost reductions and innovation that benefits consumers and creates good paying jobs.

They are why solar investment—the most cost effective and faster energy to deploy in the U.S. held steady this year this year in the U.S. despite federal backsliding and why more solar and battery capacity is expected to be installed in the U.S. over next three years than at any other time in the past. Texas leads the nation, ranking first in both utility-scale solar and land-based wind capacity. Globally, clean energy and grid investments are projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025—twice the amount expected to flow into fossil fuels this year

They are reflected in the strategic planning and capex decisions companies are making to compete in an advanced global economy and deliver returns for their investors. According to PWC, 84% of corporations are standing by their goals for cutting carbon pollution, and 37% are increasing their ambitions, because they know that climate solutions are good for business. A Morgan Stanley survey finds that 88% of companies see sustainability as a driver of long-term value, and more than 80% can track measurable ROI on their projects. Sustainability is no longer about compliance—it's about profit and resilience.

Risk management tells the same story. Some 61% of business leaders expect rising climate disruptions to create costs, with over half building adaptation and resilience into strategies. And 92% of businesses say the cost of inaction to their business will be higher than the cost of transition, compounding risk and hindering growth.

Winners and Losers

Right now, the U.S. federal government is in retreat, ceding the lead to other countries, China chief among them. The setback threatens American companies’ ability to compete and scale homegrown manufacturing in growing markets, from batteries to electric vehicles. It also creates harmful friction for utilities eager to adopt the cheapest, most readily available energy to power AI—just when the technology’s expansion depends on speed and competing demand is driving energy costs up.

Momentum alone won’t secure America’s leadership. What happens next depends on choices—by businesses and investors to press for smarter policy, expand markets, and prove that clean energy is the most competitive path forward.

Lean into the states

The biggest opportunity to sustain the clean energy boom and reduce pollution lies with the states, where forward-looking policies can help companies, investors, and consumers. For example, more than 40 businesses, including IKEA U.S, Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and REI Co-op, are urging California to strengthen its cap-and-trade program. This market-based approach, long recognized as the most efficient and affordable way to cut carbon pollution, has fueled private investment, created good-paying jobs, funded programs that lower energy bills, and kept California competitive as the world’s fourth largest economy.

Continue championing efforts to protect core American freedoms

Since 2023, more than 400 bills have been introduced to ban investment and business strategies that consider all financial risks and opportunities in decision-making, including those related to climate risks, supply chains, and governance. Fewer than 8% have passed—largely due to fears of market distortion, higher costs, and dangerous precedent. But the push continues and so does the need to aggressively counter it.

Keep engaging on federal policy

Federal backsliding is a material setback not just for U.S. clean energy growth, but the government’s own security, energy, and manufacturing goals. Over the next year, the private sector can continue laying out this reality to Congress[SS1] . Businesses are already mobilizing to push for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to uphold the greenhouse gas Endangerment Finding to protect the stable policy environment that businesses need to invest confidently in critical 21st industries. And with Trump’s budget bill now passed, members of Congress are already acknowledging they will need to address surfacing problems.

Industry leaders can help shape solutions by advocating for policies that meet rising energy demand and combat rising electricity prices through new transmission infrastructure and permitting that includes clean energy. And by extending and simplifying wind and solar tax credits, which President Trump’s budget bill sharply curtailed.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68c81957d1860af8beb31c15/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-15 11:01:55.598611

Conclusion: A Call for Systemic Resilience Negative natural gas prices in Texas are not an isolated event but a warning shot for the U.S. energy sector.","The phenomenon of negative natural gas prices in Texas is not merely an anomaly but a symptom of deeper structural imbalances in the U.S. energy system. While the absence of 2025-specific data on recent price collapses limits immediate analysis, historical patterns and systemic vulnerabilities provide a compelling case for reevaluating the resilience of Texas's energy infrastructure and market design.

The Roots of Imbalance: Oversupply, Storage, and Infrastructure

Negative prices typically arise when supply outstrips demand and storage capacity reaches saturation. Texas, with its sprawling Permian Basin and prolific shale production, has long been a bellwether for such imbalances. In 2019, for instance, the Henry Hub in Louisiana—a key pricing point—saw prices dip into negative territory as a cold snap froze pipelines, stranding supply and overwhelming storage facilities: Texas.gov | The Official Website of the State of Texas[ 1 ]. While Texas's own grid (managed by ERCOT) is geographically and politically isolated, its natural gas infrastructure faces similar constraints.

The state's reliance on just-in-time delivery systems, rather than robust storage infrastructure, exacerbates volatility. According to a 2023 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Texas's natural gas working gas in storage remains below the five-year average, leaving the system vulnerable to sudden shifts in supply or demand. This fragility is compounded by the rapid growth of renewable energy. Wind power, which accounts for over 40% of Texas's electricity generation during peak periods, can lead to sudden surges in energy supply, further depressing gas prices when grid flexibility is insufficient to absorb the excess.

Infrastructure Bottlenecks: A System in Perpetual Strain

Texas's energy infrastructure, though historically robust, is increasingly strained by its own success. The state's “energy-only” market model, which relies on short-term price signals rather than long-term investment incentives, has left critical bottlenecks unaddressed. For example, the lack of interconnections between ERCOT and neighboring grids limits the ability to export surplus energy during periods of oversupply. A 2024 analysis by the Rhodium Group noted that such isolation amplifies price distortions, as Texas cannot easily balance its market with broader regional trends.

Pipeline constraints further compound the issue. The state's natural gas gathering and transmission systems, while extensive, were not designed for the scale of production seen in the 21st century. During periods of high production, especially in regions like the Permian, the cost of transporting gas to market can exceed its value, leading producers to curtail output or, in extreme cases, pay buyers to take the gas. This dynamic, as highlighted by BloombergNEF in 2023, is a harbinger of systemic risk: when infrastructure lags behind production, the entire market becomes prone to cascading failures.

The Tipping Point: Policy and Investment Imperatives

The question is no longer whether Texas will face another episode of negative pricing but when—and how prepared the system will be. The 2021 winter storm Uri, which caused catastrophic power outages, exposed the state's vulnerability to extreme weather and inadequate infrastructure hardening. Yet, as of 2025, progress on long-term solutions remains uneven.

Investors must weigh the risks of continued underinvestment in storage, grid interconnections, and demand-side management against the potential for regulatory intervention. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has signaled growing concern over regional market imbalances, with a 2024 order urging states to adopt more resilient market designs. However, Texas's political landscape, which resists federal oversight, complicates such efforts.

Conclusion: A Call for Systemic Resilience

Negative natural gas prices in Texas are not an isolated event but a warning shot for the U.S. energy sector. They underscore the urgent need to align infrastructure investment with the realities of a decarbonizing, digitizing, and increasingly volatile energy landscape. For investors, the lesson is clear: portfolios must account for the interplay of market design, physical infrastructure, and regulatory inertia. Without systemic reforms, the next tipping point may not be a question of if, but how severely the system will falter.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757944331070.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-15 14:02:04.034969

In June 2024, the World Bank approved USD1.5 billion to support its clean energy transition, underlining international confidence in the roadmap.","By Akshay Hiranandani, CEO, Serentica Renewables

India stands at the crossroads in its path to energy sovereignty with fossil fuels continuing to contribute 68 per cent to electricity production. In 2024 alone, the electricity sector released over 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 and the nation spent almost $60 billion importing petroleum. Simultaneously, India has become a clean energy global leader with more than 135 GW of solar and 50 GW of wind capacity having been installed by March 2025. Wind installations contributed 1.8 GW during Q1 FY 2025, solidifying the country’s position as the world’s fourth-largest market in the space. To remain a global energy leader, it needs to ramp up the capacity to 100 GW of wind and 500 GW of non-fossil fuel by 2030.

The key is scaling up renewables and creating a strong, resilient, future-proof power system that incorporates wind, solar, storage, and smart grids to meet industrial, commercial, and domestic demand — 24/7. It is not just about increasing the capacity but also about providing clean, dependable, affordable power that powers industries, homes, and growth.

Clean energy is now cheaper and smarter

The energy economics have shifted. The cost of wind power is now Rs 3.17 per kWh, lower than coal-powered electricity, which is at Rs 3.50 per kWh. The cost of solar power is lower in many states. With hybrid technologies that integrate wind, solar and storage, renewable energy (RE) now offers firm dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) that matches fossil fuels on both cost and reliability parameters.

India’s commercial and industrial (C&I) sector, which consumed USD60 billion of fossil fuels in FY 2024, is proactively switching to renewables in order to reduce emissions and manage fuel price volatility. With C&I electricity demand expected to grow 40 per cent by 2040, the transition to green power will be imperative. Enhancing the share of FDRE can reduce 95 million tonnes of CO2 a year, help in complying with international decarbonisation requirements, such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and make Indian exports competitive worldwide.

Addressing the grid and storage gaps

As capacity generation increases, bottlenecks continue to persist. Grid congestion, land acquisition delays, and slow approvals continue to hold back RE deployment. In light of this, India’s high-renewable energy states need transmission upgrade urgently, catalysed by schemes such as the Green Energy Corridor.

The new frontier is energy storage. India is planning to install 50 GW of storage capacity by 2030 using battery energy storage systems (BESS), pumped hydro, and innovative green hydrogen solutions. These technologies are key to spanning intermittency and ensuring 24/7 green power for industry.

Digitalisation is also critical as AI-driven forecasting applications that can reduce land acquisition timelines by 30 per cent and intelligent grid systems that provide real-time load balancing and demand response.

Wind, solar, offshore and repowering

India holds 695 GW of wind potential at 120m hub height, including 174 GW offshore in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. A planned 100 MW offshore pilot by 2027 can unlock a new frontier. Repowering old wind sites alone could yield 25 GW of new capacity. New low-wind speed turbine technology is making previously unviable geographies viable, while floating solar and canal-top installations are optimising space use.

A thriving domestic ecosystem and global backing

The country’s renewable energy push is backed by a robust domestic manufacturing base, now producing 25 GW of solar modules and 20 GW of wind turbines annually. This not only reduces import dependence but also creates jobs. The wind sector alone added 90,000 jobs in FY 2025, with over 360,000 clean energy jobs expected by 2030.

India is also attracting serious global capital. In June 2024, the World Bank approved USD1.5 billion to support its clean energy transition, underlining international confidence in the roadmap.

The road ahead: Integration, not isolation

The future isn’t wind versus solar or fossil versus renewable – it is integration. Powering a USD5 trillion economy requires a systemic approach that combines generation, storage, transmission, and digital intelligence.

India has the scale, the market, and the will. What it needs now is speed: fast-tracked tenders, plug-and-play industrial green zones, forward-looking policies, and agile execution. We can either retrofit yesterday’s systems or build tomorrow’s power architecture today, rooted in clean, firm and sustainable energy.

Richard Zdunkewicz is CEO of Distributed Energy Clearinghouse®, a provider of next generation analytics for the distributed energy value stack and DER investments in all markets across the United States.","The term “value stack” refers to the combination of economic, reliability, and sustainability benefits that DERs provide. Unlike centralized power plants, which generate value primarily by selling electricity into wholesale markets, DERs deliver multiple benefits simultaneously.

One of the most immediate sources of value is energy cost savings. By generating electricity on-site with solar or by reducing consumption through efficiency, customers can reduce their reliance on utility-supplied power. This offsets retail consumption and reduces overall energy bills. Closely tied to this are demand charge reductions, particularly for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers who are often billed based on their peak demand. By lowering peak load through demand management and storage, businesses can avoid substantial charges.

Financial incentives and tax benefits further strengthen the economics of DERs. Federal tax credits, state renewable energy incentives, and accelerated depreciation can all reduce the effective cost of projects, making them more attractive to buyers. Beyond customer-level economics, DERs can also participate in grid services and wholesale markets. Batteries, flexible loads, and aggregated resources can provide valuable services such as frequency regulation, capacity, and ancillary support that help stabilize the grid. As battery storage technologies improve yielding faster charge times and longer durations, the market will increasingly accept batteries as reliable resources and value them accordingly.

Another essential layer of the value stack is resilience and reliability. For many buyers, especially those operating hospitals, data centers, or manufacturing plants, the ability to keep operations running during an outage can outweigh traditional financial considerations. Though difficult to quantify, the avoided cost of downtime can be significant. Finally, sustainability and ESG goals are increasingly part of corporate strategies. DERs contribute directly to decarbonization, help companies comply with regulatory mandates, and support brand reputation by demonstrating environmental leadership.

The precise makeup of the value stack varies widely depending on region, utility rate design, policy framework, and the specific load profile of each customer. A battery in one market may generate wholesale market revenues through frequency regulation, while in another, the very same battery might deliver greater value through demand response and enhanced resilience.

Rapid evolution

Over the past decade, DER economics shifted from simple payback calculations to complex, multi-dimensional revenue models. This evolution has been driven by a combination of regulatory shifts, expanded market opportunities, technological advances, and changing customer priorities.

From a regulatory perspective, many states are transitioning from net metering to net billing. Under net metering, exported solar energy was often compensated at the full retail rate, but under net billing, exported energy is valued at avoided cost or wholesale market rates. This shift reduces the economics of solar-only systems and elevates the importance of storage and demand management. Similarly, the introduction of dynamic tariffs such as time-of-use pricing and real-time pricing creates both risks and opportunities, rewarding those who can shift load or store and dispatch energy strategically.

Market participation has also expanded. FERC Order 2222 opened wholesale markets to aggregated DERs, allowing distributed resources to compete alongside centralized generation. This has paved the way for the rapid rise of VPPs, which pool together DERs from multiple sites to deliver system-level services. These market structures are still in development, but they signal a fundamental shift in how distributed resources are valued.

Technological advances have accelerated this evolution. Forecasting capabilities, AI-driven optimization, and cloud-based platforms make it possible to model DER performance with unprecedented precision. These tools enable simulations of different scenarios, quantify risks, and optimize dispatch strategies across multiple value streams simultaneously.

Finally, customer priorities are changing. For critical facilities, resilience and reliability have become top priorities, sometimes even surpassing economic savings. At the same time, sustainability is no longer a peripheral concern but central to corporate decision-making. Many companies are setting carbon reduction targets and using DERs as a strategy to achieve them. The result of all these forces is a DER value stack that is dynamic, region-specific, and increasingly sensitive to regulatory and market conditions.

Transparency

In today’s complex DER markets, sellers cannot rely on black-box sales pitches. Without transparency, three main risks emerge. First, mismatched expectations can occur when buyers overestimate savings or underestimate risks. This leads to disappointment, erodes trust, and can damage seller reputations. Second, investors may deploy capital into projects with inflated forecasts, resulting in inefficient allocation of resources and weakening overall confidence in the sector. Third, overstated claims about project returns could invite regulatory scrutiny, slowing down innovation and increasing compliance costs.

Transparency is the antidote to these risks. Robust tools and transparent methodologies allow sellers to show their work by making assumptions explicit and disclosing the models behind their projections. Transparency also enables sellers to highlight risks proactively, including tariff changes, performance degradation, or the expiration of incentives. Equally important, transparency provides buyers with a basis for comparability, making it easier to evaluate competing offers on equal terms. In a crowded and competitive market, transparency is no longer just good practice; it is a competitive advantage and the foundation for building long-term trust.

Buyers benefit

For commercial and institutional customers, understanding the DER value stack enables more informed and resilient decision-making. By demanding transparency, buyers can require detailed breakdowns of projected savings, revenues, and risks. This ensures that sellers cannot gloss over unfavorable assumptions and creates accountability in the sales process.

Buyers who take the time to stress-test assumptions gain further advantages. By evaluating what happens under different scenarios — such as changes to tariff structures, the reduction of incentives, or underperformance in wholesale markets — they can better understand the range of possible outcomes and reduce exposure to downside risks.

Moreover, a focus on the value stack allows buyers to think beyond simple payback metrics. DERs can provide substantial value through enhanced resilience, contributions to ESG goals, and participation in new markets that may open in the near future. By aligning DER investments with broader corporate priorities such as carbon neutrality, cost stability, and operational resilience, buyers ensure that energy projects serve both financial and strategic goals.

Finally, many buyers benefit from leveraging advanced analytical tools or advisors who can model projects rigorously. These tools provide clarity and help uncover value streams that might otherwise be overlooked. When buyers understand the value stack, negotiations shift from vague promises to data-driven clarity, leading to better outcomes and fewer surprises.

Continued evolution

The next decade promises even greater complexity and opportunity. Several developments are likely to define this period. First, the value of grid services is expected to increase as renewable penetration grows and flexibility becomes more important. DERs that can provide fast, dispatchable services will play a critical role in stabilizing the grid.

Second, VPPs will become more widely deployed and more deeply integrated into capacity planning and reliability markets. As market operators become more comfortable with aggregated resources, VPPs will transition from pilot projects to core components of the energy system.

Third, carbon valuation will become a significant factor. Whether through explicit carbon pricing mechanisms or implicit valuation via ESG reporting requirements, carbon attributes will be monetized and included in project valuations.

Fourth, electrification across sectors will create new opportunities. The adoption of electric vehicle fleets, the electrification of heating, and increased industrial electrification will introduce new sources of flexible demand that DERs can integrate with.

Finally, digitalization will advance, with AI-driven optimization becoming a standard tool for unlocking value streams that were previously too complex to access. Together, these trends make clear that the value stack is a moving target that will expand and diversify, requiring increasingly sophisticated analysis.

Flexibility, resilience, carbon reduction

The future sources of value will extend well beyond today’s bill savings. Flexibility markets will reward DERs that can deliver fast, dispatchable balancing services, helping grid operators manage variability from renewable generation. As climate and cyber risks continue to rise, resilience premiums will grow. For many businesses, the ability to maintain operations during an outage will become more valuable than simple energy savings.

Carbon credits and reporting value will also expand. As decarbonization goals become mandatory in more sectors, companies will increasingly monetize carbon reductions through voluntary or regulated markets. DERs that can demonstrate carbon benefits will be particularly attractive. In addition, DERs will contribute to community-scale value. Microgrids, peer-to-peer trading, and resilience hubs will provide shared benefits at the local level, further broadening the appeal of distributed energy solutions.

Finally, integrated load management will emerge as a frontier for value creation. By coordinating DERs with electric vehicles, smart buildings, and industrial processes, system operators and customers alike will unlock new efficiencies. These emerging layers of value reinforce the importance of robust modeling and transparent methodologies, as the risks of mispricing and overestimating benefits will only grow with increased complexity.

Support to navigate complexity

Navigating the DER landscape can be daunting, but new platforms and services are rising to meet the challenge. Advanced software tools such as that offered by Distributed Energy Clearinghouse® can now model complex tariffs, simulate wholesale market participation, and assess risks with increasing accuracy. The DECH platform features intuitive dashboards and scenario modeling, making it easier for decision-makers to interpret results.

Independent consultants continue to play a vital role by bringing expertise in energy economics, regulatory frameworks, and project finance. Buyers who lack internal expertise can rely on these advisors to ensure projects are evaluated rigorously. Industry associations and standards bodies are also contributing by publishing guidelines and methodologies that promote consistent valuation practices. Finally, collaborative marketplaces are emerging as trusted environments where buyers, sellers, and investors can transact with greater transparency and comparability.

For buyers, the key takeaway is to insist on open, transparent methodologies. For sellers, the imperative is to adopt tools and practices that foster comparability and trust. Together, these actions will strengthen the market and ensure that the full potential of DERs is realized.

Conclusion

The DER value stack has matured into a sophisticated, multi-dimensional framework that continues to evolve alongside the global energy transition. Transparency is now the critical ingredient that aligns buyers, sellers, and investors. Sellers who adopt robust, transparent tools will differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace and build long-term customer relationships. Buyers who demand transparency will capture greater value and future-proof their organizations against uncertainty.

The future of the DER value stack is one of expansion, complexity, and opportunity. Those who embrace transparency today will be best positioned to capture tomorrow’s benefits.

EV Credits Almost Gone

The IRC § 25E Previously-owned Clean Vehicles Credit and the IRC § 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit both terminate September 30, 2025, meaning neither credit will be allowed for vehicles acquired after that date.

Originally set to expire after 2032, the OBBBA signed July 4 expedited the sunset of the clean vehicle credits, or the ‘EV’ credits as they are often referred to. Amended by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, the credits served to incentivize car buyers to go in an eco-friendlier direction but came with detailed eligibility requirements.

The Section 30D EV credit provides up to $7,500 for the purchase of qualifying new plug-in EVs and fuel cell vehicles. But it is split into two $3,750 components: one for meeting a critical minerals requirement and one for meeting a battery component requirement.

Eligible vehicles must have a battery capacity of at least 7 kWh, be manufactured by a qualified manufacturer, have final assembly in North America, and not exceed certain MSRP thresholds ($80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups; $55,000 for other vehicles).

The used vehicle credit under Section 25E provides up to $4,000 (or 30% of the sale price, if less) for the purchase of eligible used electric or fuel cell vehicles from a dealer for $25,000 or less.

It is subject to income limits and other eligibility requirements for both the vehicle and the buyer. Both credits are non-refundable and must be claimed on Form 8936, Clean Vehicle Credit.

Economic Impact

According to Baker Tilly Principal Michael Mader, July and August were “very strong EV sales months” because of the OBBBA’s change to the credits’ expiration date. Customers are hurrying to buy eligible vehicles before the end of September, while dealerships are working to move their inventories and keep pace with this temporary spike in demand, Mader told Checkpoint.

With the deadline less than three weeks away, dealerships are using the credits to bring in foot traffic to showrooms, although customers basing their decision to buy around the expected value of a credit will not need convincing.

He noted that the new vehicle credit has a cap of $80,000 while the used vehicle credit maximum is $25,000. “A customer that was going to buy an EV used needs to find one that’s priced at $25,000 and they’re going to pay [$21,000]” if they buy this month.

Afterwards, “they’re going to pay $25,000 for that vehicle, because that credit’s not there.”

This will trigger a “shift in the market,” said Mader. “There’s going to be a drop after September 30, and then it’s going to come back to normalization again.”

Tips for Taxpayers

While buyers may have several questions about the credits, their worth, and how to claim them, Mader said it is ultimately the taxpayer’s responsibility to “educate themselves on the EV that they are considering, and what are their proximities to charging stations.” And, he continued, if there are charging stations, are they compatible? “Because some vehicles take special charging hookups and some don’t.”

Prospective buyers should also factor in how long they plan on owning the vehicle and if the value of the credit is worth it right now. While waiting will cause a taxpayer to miss out on these credits, Mader said the EV technology may improve down the line and become more attractive to that customer later.

But for those who are ready to buy now and have done their homework on eligibility, the advice is: “Don’t hesitate.”

The IRS in recently issued FAQs (FS 2025-05) seemed to indicate that “it’s possible you could take delivery after September 30 to get the credit” so long as the payment was made and the contract was signed beforehand. But Mader suggested that taxpayers not take the risk on possibly losing out on a credit, just in case.

Other advice Mader had for those considering an EV included ensuring the dealer is registered to the IRS portal for submitting documentation. Taxpayers cannot claim the credits if the dealership is not registered.

“You need to have [a Form 8936] and the time of sale report,” he said. “Make sure when you walk out of the dealership, you’ve got your time of sale report.”",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:30.683961

Its policy moves are slowing the momentum of solar energy and may result in increased costs and security risks.

What's happening?

As EnergySage reported, solar power is affordable and scalable despite the federal government subsidies expiring at the end of the year. EnergySage is an objective, independent source of solar industry expertise, offering free tools to compare quotes and receive quick installation estimates.

A Lazard report revealed that solar and wind energy are the most affordable sources of new electricity in America. Meanwhile, gas costs are increasing, and the cost of building a new gas-powered plant is significantly higher than that of a new solar-powered one.

""Lazard's latest Levelized Cost of Energy+ analysis found that gas plant construction is at its most expensive point in a decade, driven by record-high electricity demand and a growing shortage of equipment like turbines,"" EnergySage's Casey McDevitt wrote.

EnergySage also highlighted the fact that America's backtracking on clean energy puts the country at a competitive disadvantage to China. With increasing energy demands resulting from the growth of artificial intelligence and data centers, the U.S. could miss opportunities to advance the latest technologies because of grid limitations.

Meanwhile, clean power is essential to energy independence and less reliance on foreign providers. National security and economic competitiveness are at stake for nations that fail to adopt energy solutions that are cheaper and quicker to build than gas and other pollution-heavy energy sources.

Why is reverting to gas problematic?

Curbing and reversing progress on clean energy momentum is concerning because the alternative is reverting to outdated, nonrenewable resources that harm the environment.

Gas emits high rates of methane and pollution when burned, exacerbating our climate crisis. It relies on aging infrastructure, is becoming more expensive to use, and makes the U.S. less secure and competitive.

Clean, renewable energy sources have been growing steadily, benefiting both people and the planet. However, recent political actions risk reversing that progress by ignoring promising innovations and halting large-scale projects that could put the country in a more sustainable position.

What's being done to advance the clean energy transition?

Despite what is happening at the federal level, there are still many things that you can do to live a sustainable life and set an example for people around you.

For example, you can reduce your personal reliance on the grid by installing solar panels on your home and pairing them with a backup battery system. EnergySage provides a mapping tool to help you maximize the benefits of all available solar incentives tailored to your location.

To take it a step further, you can pair solar panels with energy-efficient home appliances and a heat pump to lower your utility bills and reduce household pollution.

You can also set a positive example for others by driving a clean energy vehicle and using public transportation when possible.

When local and state elections are coming up where you live, step up to be an advocate for clean energy policies and influence legislation from a grassroots level. In many places, pro-climate lawmakers are still working hard to advance the clean energy transition for the benefit of our people and the planet.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oUL5BnBNp3l8o95lTIMZoQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/4ac5145e4a25beb21b87587ae55b4265,N,,2025-09-15 11:02:58.587168

Lithium, the cornerstone of battery production for electric vehicles (EVs), has become a strategic asset, with the U.S. government prioritizing domestic production to reduce reliance on foreign imports. At the forefront of this effort is Lithium Americas, whose Thacker Pass project in Nevada has emerged as a linchpin in the Biden administration's push for energy independence. With a production target of 40,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually by late 2027, the project could redefine the U.S. lithium landscape—if it meets its ambitious timelines and cost projections.

Strategic Funding and Partnerships: A Blueprint for Scale

Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass project has secured a robust funding package, reflecting both private-sector confidence and federal support. The company recently finalized a $250 million investment from Orion Resource Partners LP, structured as a mix of convertible debt, production-linked payments, and a delayed draw facility Lithium Americas Reports 2024 Full Year Results, [https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2025/Lithium-Americas-Reports-2024-Full-Year-Results/default.aspx][ 1 ]. This is complemented by a landmark $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), with the first draw anticipated in Q3 2025 Lithium Americas Secures Full Funding for Thacker Pass, [https://www.stocktitan.net/news/LAC/lithium-americas-reports-first-quarter-2025-f1kfc57u9qyp.html][ 2 ]. Such backing underscores the project's alignment with national priorities, particularly the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocates billions to decarbonize transportation and strengthen domestic mineral processing.

Equally significant is the partnership with

(GM), which has committed $100 million to the project as part of a final investment decision (FID) agreement. This collaboration not only de-risks capital expenditures but also ensures a stable off-take agreement for a key U.S. automaker. By 2027, when production is slated to begin, GM's EV ambitions will require a reliable domestic lithium supply chain—a need Thacker Pass is uniquely positioned to fulfill.

Production Capacity and Economic Impact

With a projected output of 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually, Thacker Pass could account for a substantial share of U.S. demand. While exact figures for domestic consumption are not publicly available, industry analysts estimate that achieving 40,000 tonnes of annual production would cover a significant portion of the lithium required for EV battery manufacturing in North America. This scale is critical: the U.S. currently imports over 90% of its lithium, with China dominating processing and refining. Thacker Pass's success would reduce this dependency, insulating the U.S. from geopolitical volatility and supply bottlenecks.

Economically, the project is expected to create thousands of jobs during construction and hundreds of permanent roles in operations. Nevada, already a hub for mining and renewable energy, stands to benefit from a new industrial ecosystem centered on lithium processing and battery manufacturing. The state's political leadership has actively supported the project, recognizing its potential to diversify the economy and align with federal clean energy goals.

Challenges and Strategic Risks

Despite its promise, Thacker Pass faces hurdles. Environmental permitting delays and community concerns over land use have historically plagued large-scale mining projects in the U.S. While Lithium Americas has navigated these challenges thus far, any setbacks could push back the 2027 timeline or inflate costs. Additionally, the project's reliance on federal loans exposes it to policy shifts—though the bipartisan nature of the Infrastructure Law suggests long-term stability.

From a market perspective, the project must also contend with global oversupply risks. As Australia, Chile, and Argentina expand production, lithium prices could face downward pressure. However, the U.S. market's unique demand dynamics—driven by EV adoption and regulatory mandates—may insulate Thacker Pass from broader price swings.

A Model for U.S. Self-Sufficiency

Thacker Pass represents more than a mining operation; it is a test case for whether the U.S. can build a vertically integrated lithium supply chain. The project's alignment with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, coupled with strategic partnerships and federal financing, positions it as a blueprint for future mineral projects. If successful, it could catalyze further investments in processing and refining, closing the loop on a supply chain that has long been fragmented.

For investors, the stakes are high.

Now an administrative center called Building One, the former terminal has made history for a new reason: It’s the first edifice owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate transportation agency, to undergo an all-electric retrofit.

“It’s so exciting to see [this kind of] reinvestment and making things new again,” said James Lindberg, senior policy director at the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation, who wasn’t involved in the project. ​“Energy efficiency and decarbonization is part of that. … We know how to do it — we just need more of it.”

Buildings account for a whopping one-third of the nation’s carbon pollution. Every building — even the 80,000 structures that, like Building One, are listed in the National Register of Historic Places — must break up with fossil fuels to align with a cooler climate future.

Retrofitting any existing structure is going to be tougher than going with all-electric systems from the start. But engineers looking to upgrade historic buildings are doubly constrained by the need to maintain their charges’ distinctive architectural features; you can’t just tear down the walls of a landmark.

The Port Authority’s Building One is an early example demonstrating that storied buildings can be electrified — all while keeping their vaunted status intact.

It ​“was the perfect project to show the art of what’s possible,” said Dennis Pietrocola, director of operations services at the Port Authority. ​“If we were able to undergo an electrification transformation to Building One” — among the most challenging of the Port Authority’s structures — ​“then it sets the stage for [decarbonizing] the rest.”

That’s coming. The Port Authority aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, a goal that includes its entire portfolio of more than 1,000 buildings — from storage and parking structures to terminals to offices — at its airports, bridges, tunnels, railways, bus stops, and shipping ports.

Heat pumps, electric boilers, and more

Building One is the bustling home base of 190 Port Authority employees, including operations and maintenance workers, police, and firefighters. In 2023, the building’s gas-fueled equipment was ready to conk out, making it a prime candidate for a decarbonization retrofit. Pietrocola and his colleagues carefully planned a series of cost-effective electrifying updates and hired an experienced general contractor, Constellation NewEnergy, to carry them out.

The team installed five large heat pumps on the roof to provide zero-emissions heating and cooling. They put in an energy-recovery system to recycle waste heat from the locker and IT rooms. The crew added a system that can dial down power use when the grid is strained by high demand. And in the parking lot, workers installed 29 new charging ports for electric vehicles.

The team also swapped the building’s gas boilers with electric-resistance ones. Operating with the same physics as big electric tea kettles, these provide an extra boost as needed to the building’s water-based heating system. Pietrocola had considered using heat-pump boilers instead, which can be twice as efficient because they move heat instead of making it, but he nixed the idea because it would’ve meant replacing the hydronic system’s distribution pipes with bigger ones.

Workers also made some more staid updates to lower energy costs: weatherizing the building, applying heat-blocking films on the windows, and replacing more than 1,500 light fixtures with ultra-efficient LEDs.

In total, the project took 18 months and cost about $15 million — $3 million more than it would’ve had the Port Authority stuck with gas-fired equipment, according to Pietrocola.

The Port Authority didn’t use any incentives to cover the expenses, in part because the team needed to act quickly to replace the building’s worn-out systems. But federal and state tax credits are available to private entities and public-private partnerships to electrify operations as part of renovation projects, Lindberg pointed out. Unlike the consumer credits for heat pumps, EVs, and other clean energy tech, the Rehabilitation Credit was left unscathed by Republicans’ federal budget law enacted this summer, he said.

Building One’s retrofit has slashed energy use by about 25%, Pietrocola said. Still, due to the area’s relatively high cost of electricity, he doesn’t expect the structure’s utility bills to fall.

Pietrocola plans to apply the lessons learned at Building One to other Port Authority structures as their fossil-fueled systems age out, he said. He’ll approach each project with a fresh eye to the building’s particular needs and the technology available. Next time, he added, the agency may go with hydronic heat pumps instead of the electric-resistance boilers.

Decarbonizing buildings ​“is a very important cause to me, personally and professionally,” Pietrocola noted. Recently, he worked with his 14-year-old daughter, Kayla, on a climate-change science project. ​“It made me realize, well, I’m part of the problem — the way I’ve operated facilities [in the past], perhaps with a closed mind.” After guiding the electrification of one of the country’s most storied structures, he feels like he’s become part of the solution.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/image.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=580bbe9fe179523053d193a1379689af,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:59.545237

Solar Energy UK has committed to working with the planning profession to ensure that training is fit for purpose.","A new era of clean energy independence dawned in early July, with the publication of the UK’s highly anticipated Solar Roadmap [1].

The government-industry paper describes 62 practical measures to boost the supply of cheaper and more secure power, deliver new industries and create skilled jobs – all while providing significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and gains in biodiversity. By addressing issues such as the electricity grid, supply chain, skills and planning, it will play a major role in delivering the British Labour government’s mission for the UK to become a clean energy superpower and meet – or potentially exceed – the capacity goals set out in December’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan.

By then, we could see around 9 million small-scale rooftop installations, up from 2 million now, with the sector supporting 35,000 jobs – almost twice the number of today. Meanwhile, solar farms would still take up a tiny amount of the country, put at significantly less than 1% of farmland.

The roadmap was produced over two years and two governments by the Solar Taskforce, led by secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, and Solar Energy UK, and supported by leading figures from across the solar industry and related sectors. The taskforce will shortly transition into the Solar Council, set to drive future progress and guide the implementation of the plan.

Writing in a foreword to the roadmap, the secretary of state wrote: “This is an incredibly exciting time for solar in our country. More than 1.5 million homes across Britain now have solar installed, and since this government came to office my department has consented almost 3GW of nationally significant solar projects – nearly three times as much as the previous 14 years combined. But we know we need to go further to deliver our goals for clean power by 2030 and beyond

“Solar offers huge potential to boost our energy independence, bring down bills and tackle the climate crisis. It also presents significant economic opportunities; we estimate that around 35,000 jobs supported by solar will be needed by 2030, a doubling of today’s number.”

Added to those reflections, solar energy is among the lowest-cost and most popular forms of power generation in the UK. Unlocking its potential will increase Britain’s energy security, drive down bills and be a major contributor to preventing dangerous climate change. The fact that it can be deployed rapidly in so many ways, from household rooftops to warehouses to reservoirs and large-scale solar farms, is the key ingredient to this potential.

Rooftop

Despite enormous cost reductions over recent years, one key barrier to more widespread adoption of rooftop photovoltaics remains their upfront cost. So, the government will work with the Green Finance Institute, the finance sector, consumer bodies and the solar sector itself to provide financial solutions for all customers.

The taskforce also identified an ongoing lack of awareness of the benefits of both domestic and commercial solar energy as a further obstacle, with potential buyers unaware of trusted sources of information. Accordingly, the government will update its Energy Efficient Home website to promote solar deployment. Meanwhile, the UK Warehousing Association has agreed to develop a toolkit for the commercial-scale market, including how to obtain a power purchase agreement.

How solar is reflected in energy performance certificates will be updated next year, and incentives to install solar energy will be considered for social landlords. Meanwhile, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors will ensure that the value of solar homes is assessed properly, while incentives to install solar power on social housing will be considered.

As may be expected, the paper also mentions the recently confirmed Future Homes Standard. This should, alongside the forthcoming Future Buildings Standard, virtually mandate solar on new properties. In due course, retrofit customers will benefit from a review of consumer protections, so they can have confidence in the quality of work when upgrading their homes.

Warehousing has huge potential to expand solar generation but faces many barriers [2]. To resolve these, the UK Warehousing Association will collaborate with the real estate and solar sectors to overcome problems with building leases, develop standard contracts for landlords and tenants and develop a standard approach for building valuation. The connection processes of independent distribution network operators (DNOs), which often operate power systems in business parks, will be reviewed and the regulation of the sector reconsidered by the regulator, Ofgem.

According to government estimates, only around one in five schools have solar panels, leaving them paying for power rather than investing in the nation’s youth. To help remedy this, the government will commit to supporting schools to deploy the technology, possibly through the DESNZ’s ‘one stop shop’ Net Zero Accelerator Service, building on the newly founded, publicly funded clean energy company GB Energy’s recent investment in 200 schools, in which it plans to spend £180 million on investing in 70-100MW of PV on schools and hospitals.

Supporting its anticipated Local Power Plan, GB Energy will provide “funding, capacity and capability support at all stages of project development”, to drive the growth of community energy, building on the Local Net Zero Hubs Programme. In parallel, the National Wealth Fund also offers free advice and low-cost, long-term finance to local authority infrastructure projects that align with net-zero and economic growth mandates, which includes the development of solar projects.

Meanwhile, the National Wealth Fund will “explore potential structures to finance solar projects or portfolios”. The Department of Business and Trade will coordinate a cross-government steering group to “consider potential government intervention” to promote corporate power purchase agreements – buying power directly from solar farms, at a significant discount from the grid.

A study into the safety of small-scale solar energy systems that can be plugged directly into the domestic mains supply will also commence. Current UK regulations forbid them, although they are increasingly popular on the Continent.

Grid access

Excessive waiting times for electricity grid connections have long been the bane of the solar industry, for both ground-mounted and large-scale rooftop systems.

The Solar Roadmap spells out a series of measures to address the issue, in parallel with reforms arising from the Winser Review and raising transmission impact assessment thresholds. These include adopting a common definition of commercially sensitive data, which should provide a better understanding of which projects are most likely to proceed. Ofgem will also consider introducing standards to improve levels of service after grid connections are accepted, with the UK’s National Energy System Operator (NESO) conducting a series of technical measures to improve transmission impact assessments.

As things stand, solar projects above 3.68kW, corresponding to 16 amps per phase, must receive approval from DNOs. This red tape can encourage installers to limit system capacity below the threshold, though one operator has raised the threshold to 5kW, encouraging larger residential installations. Those under 14.72kW are now subject to a fast-track process, with responses due within ten working days.

The roadmap also indicates that high-voltage overhead power lines over 2km long mounted on wooden poles will no longer be considered nationally significant infrastructure projects due to their low visual impact.

One of the most welcome aspects of the package concerns the treatment of battery energy storage systems (BESS), commonly co-located with solar farms. BESS are currently considered a hindrance to the electricity system, rather than providing the benefits of absorbing excess power and supplying it during periods of peak demand. New and harmonised modelling procedures will be introduced in response.

Reforming who pays for new high-voltage supergrid transformers, which the roadmap describes as a “postcode lottery”, is also expected.

Ground-mount solar

The roadmap endorses Solar Energy UK’s Community Engagement Good Practice Guidance [3]. Aside from supporting developers, operators and the supply chain, it is equally “useful to local authorities and communities as a referencing material for engaging with solar industry developers and operators”, says the paper.

The association has also committed to developing a template for developers to use for stakeholder mapping and a communications toolkit for conveying the benefits of solar power when engaging with local communities.

In parallel, the provision of community benefits has a vital role to play, and it is the subject of an ongoing DESNZ consultation [4]. While the Government’s position is being considered, Solar Energy UK will publish a voluntary protocol and guidance for community benefits later this year, covering installations over 5MW (other than rooftop, ‘behind the meter’, community-owned or community-led solar farms).

Scotland is consulting on refreshing its principles for community benefits, while the Welsh Government has already issued guidance [5, 6].

Supply chain

The roadmap represents a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to grow the solar supply chain and manufacturing capacity in the UK”. While economics exclude the manufacturing of conventional silicon-based panels, there is scope to grow the production of transformers, inverters, switchgear, supporting bracketry and cabling, it says, not to mention batteries and R&D, particularly for lightweight and cutting-edge perovskite PV technology.

Accordingly, the government will consider supporting companies looking to scale up production of innovative solar technologies, processes and associated equipment, alongside the development of standards and testing facilities for next-generation solar technologies.

The roadmap also details the government’s support for the “world-leading” Solar Stewardship Initiative, intended to prevent the procurement of solar panels produced with raw materials coming from forced labour. This comes after confirming that the system will be used by Great British Energy.

“The UK Government is clear that there should be no procurement of solar panels where there is evidence of forced labour. Government will empower contracting authorities to exclude suppliers from government contracts who have committed labour market misconduct and/or environmental offences in the UK or overseas… The UK solar sector has been proactive in its response to this issue,” says the roadmap, noting Solar Energy UK’s Supply Chain Statement and Responsible Sourcing FAQ [7, 8].

Skills development

The rapid growth of the UK solar industry, expected to expand by up to 17% this year, “offers a generational opportunity to create a wealth of high-quality jobs. At this crucial juncture, we must put the structures in place to build the skilled workforce needed now and in the decades to come,” the roadmap says.

Without action, there is a risk of skilled labour shortages, skills gaps, loss of key skills “and potentially costly, urgent intervention further into the future,” it warns.

Solving the problem will require intervention from across government, including the National Wealth Fund, GB Energy, Skills England, the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and the devolved administrations. Solar Energy UK has also stepped up, with the formation of the Solar Careers UK initiative, which will provide information and guidance on what skills and competences are needed for jobs in the sector and how to attain them. It has already held its first careers fair and is continuing to expand engagement.

The roadmap itself offers no fewer than 11 actions on skills, including improving the provision and effectiveness of training, mapping the routes to competence for core occupations and connecting colleges and businesses. Solar Energy UK will work with other trade bodies on how to attract and retain newly trained installers and prepare teaching materials for schools.

Planning

In the case of development planning, much of the action needed to help the sector has already been undertaken or is underway. This includes raising the threshold for solar farms to be considered ‘nationally significant infrastructure projects’ from 50MW to 100MW, in force from the end of the year, and the recruitment and training of new planning officers.

The Planning and Infrastructure Bill currently proceeding through parliament will simplify the consenting process for major infrastructure projects and require national policy statements to be reviewed every five years. The environmental impact assessment system is also being streamlined, and the first Spatial Energy Plan and Land Use Framework are being developed.

The National Planning Policy Framework has been reformed to give greater weight to the benefits of renewable energy and proposals’ contributions to meeting net zero, and a consultation on the National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy was held recently [9].

But there is still more to do. Solar Energy UK has committed to working with the planning profession to ensure that training is fit for purpose. It will also produce factsheets to advise planners and councillors, plugging the gap in the expertise needed to assess solar applications effectively. We also intend to engage with any regional mayor or combined authority interested in driving forward solar developments in their area.

There is also work to do in relation to floating solar, which has significant potential but currently faces higher costs than deployment on the ground. Reforms to support the nascent sector will be considered under the planning regime and potentially via the Contracts for Difference system.

Solar Energy UK would like to extend our sincere thanks for the work of the former co-chairs of the taskforce, Andrew Bowie MP and Graham Stuart MP, alongside the members of its five sub-groups on networks, skills, supply chain and innovation, rooftop solar and communications. We are also grateful to former MP Chris Skidmore, who suggested the taskforce’s formation in his 2023 Review of Net Zero.

While Trump is stifling clean energy, there are also setbacks at the state level.
To check on how these developments are affecting clean energy in North Carolina, I spoke with Steve Kalland, executive director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State University.
The clean energy industry is thriving nationally, though it will be slowed once tax breaks and other incentives expire in 2026, Kalland said.
In practice, making it harder to expand clean energy will undermine Trump’s push to expand U.S. manufacturing.","President Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” will limit the development of solar and wind power at a time when they offer the fastest and cheapest ways to meet a rising demand for electricity.

The new law phases out tax credits and other incentives for producing and using renewable energy that were adopted under former President Joe Biden.

The timing is particularly bad for North Carolina, where growth in population and manufacturing are increasing the demand for energy.

While Trump is stifling clean energy, there are also setbacks at the state level. The legislature has dropped interim targets for sharply reducing utilities’ carbon emissions by 2050, and the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy, has put off plans to tap the state’s bountiful offshore wind resource.

To check on how these developments are affecting clean energy in North Carolina, I spoke with Steve Kalland, executive director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State University. He had just finished attending last week’s renewable energy trade show in Las Vegas, which drew more than 40,000 participants and 1,300 exhibitors.

The clean energy industry is thriving nationally, though it will be slowed once tax breaks and other incentives expire in 2026, Kalland said.

In practice, making it harder to expand clean energy will undermine Trump’s push to expand U.S. manufacturing. It will actually limit the ability to quickly increase the electricity supply, drive up energy costs and slow the emergence of industries built around renewable energy, a growing part of the North Carolina economy.

“In general, it does seem counterintuitive that the attacks on clean energy — which are clearly and demonstrably the lowest-cost options right now — just seem to run directly in the face of the goals of the administration, which is to cut energy costs and make America energy dominant,” he said.

Utilities say they can meet increasing electricity demand with new natural gas-powered plants and smaller-scale nuclear units, but Kalland said bringing those power sources online can take five years or more while the demand is rising now and expanding clean energy can happen quickly.

“So the expectation is that either we are going to build solar and wind over the next five to seven years nationally and in North Carolina in order to meet increasing demand, or we are not going to meet increasing demand, which is going to be a problem,” he said.

As demand presses the energy supply, prices are rising, he said.

“We’re seeing energy prices climb faster than the rate of inflation. In some places maybe as much as twice the rate of inflation,” he said. “That’s not a good sign for anything because energy touches every single part of the economy.”

Kalland is worried by legislation passed this year that removed the 2030 carbon emissions reduction target for North Carolina utilities, though the goal of achieving net zero emissions — an even balance between emissions released and emissions reduced — by 2050 remains.

“If people are not working steadily toward that 2050 goal, it creates an opportunity for folks to not be making the steady progress that’s necessary because they think some new technology will come in,” he said. “Because of that, we could easily wind up at 2045 with a fairly sizable distance to go.”

Not committing to offshore wind power is also a setback, he said. “The offshore wind thing may be the biggest loss for North Carolina’s economy because we really had just started to capture it. It was really coming,” he said.

Disruptions in the advancement of clean energy are hardly new. Kalland has witnessed the ups and downs since began working with solar power in 1993. “We affectionately call it ‘the solar coaster,’ “ he said.

Kalland said the clean energy industry will rebound from the loss of incentives.

“I think that there is hope that once everybody lets the dust settle from what’s going on with the ‘big’ – it’s hard for me to call it the ‘beautiful bill’ – once that dust settles I think the industry will evaluate where things stand, get out their spreadsheets and come up with a new way of doing things. It will be slower but it will continue to go forward.”",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/y0rp63/picture312047442/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fd91329d-5cee-4c7b-9f34-36ed321a5fbd,N,,2025-09-15 09:59:49.926655

When New Jersey celebrates “Made in New Jersey” Manufacturing Day on October 3, 2025, industry leaders will have no shortage of topics to discuss. Chief among them is Governor Phil Murphy’s recent signing of the Next NJ Manufacturing Program (A5687/S4407) into law on August 13. The initiative, housed within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), is designed to sharpen the state’s competitive edge by driving new investment, capital expansion, and job creation across the manufacturing sector.

The program allocates $500 million in targeted tax credits exclusively for qualifying manufacturing businesses, with a dedicated $100 million carve-out for clean energy manufacturing. By reserving a significant portion of funds for firms building renewable and sustainable products, Trenton is signaling that advanced and green manufacturing are central to the state’s long-term growth strategy.

In addition, the program allows for certain qualified businesses, such as Minority and Women Business Enterprises, located in Opportunity Zones or those businesses with collective bargaining agreements or labor harmony agreements to receive bonus credit awards. This program is just the latest of many incentives programs the NJEDA has rolled out to spur economic development and job creation as part of Governor Murphy’s dedication to creating an innovation economy.

A Broad Incentive Strategy

The manufacturing initiative builds on a framework of business support programs that have been introduced or expanded during Governor Murphy’s term. The Emerge Program provides tax credits tied directly to job creation and capital investment, rewarding companies that commit to staying and growing in New Jersey. The Aspire Program supports real estate and redevelopment projects, helping attract commercial tenants while breathing new life into New Jersey’s urban centers.

Fueling Innovation and Startups

Governor Murphy has consistently tied economic development to innovation. For example, the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund (NJIEF) is a flagship program that combines public and private capital to fund promising startups. By auctioning state tax credits to established companies and reinvesting those proceeds in young firms, NJEDA is fostering both capital flow and corporate mentorship for emerging entrepreneurs.

Complementing this is the long-standing Net Operating Loss (NOL) Program, which allows early-stage tech and life sciences companies to sell operating losses for immediate cash. Expanded in recent years, it now makes New Jersey one of the most attractive states for research-driven startups.

Targeting Strategic Industries

The state has also invested heavily in clean energy, film, and advanced manufacturing. The Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program has lured major productions to the state, creating jobs and boosting local economies. In 2023, the state saw nearly $600 million in qualified film spend. And, in 2025, “Happy Gilmore 2” spent over $152 million on just one film.

Balancing Costs with Opportunity

New Jersey is an expensive state to start and build a business. But officials are betting that targeted, imaginative, tax credits and incentives will offset those costs and attract new companies while at the same time keeping others rooted in the Garden State. The Next NJ Manufacturing Program underscores that strategy: making long-term investment in New Jersey more attractive, while reinforcing the state’s position as a center for innovation, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

Voters are especially concerned about rising insurance rates, and many also expect climate change to impact everyday costs like utilities and groceries.
Against this backdrop, voters overwhelmingly support requiring oil and gas companies to pay their share of climate damages, including through a climate superfund law, and are more likely to support candidates who back those measures.
Under the cost-sharing frame, 77% of voters express support, including 89% of Democrats, 78% of Independents, and 64% of Republicans.
Voters also say that support for a climate superfund bill could influence their choices at the ballot box.","This year has brought record-breaking heat domes across the central and eastern U.S., catastrophic flash floods in Texas that swept away homes and RVs, and devastated a summer camp community, and destructive wildfires in Southern California that leveled thousands of homes. These disasters are becoming more frequent and are driving up costs that average people are forced to bear. As families across the U.S. shoulder this financial burden, states like New York and Vermont have passed “climate superfund” laws, and several others have introduced similar proposals — measures that require polluting industries to pay for a share of climate damages caused by their emissions. Now, these laws face opposition from the federal government, which is moving to strike them down or otherwise shield polluters from legal accountability. Despite these developments, polls consistently show voters overwhelmingly support efforts to hold polluters accountable for mounting climate damages.

In a new poll of national likely voters, Data for Progress and Fossil Free Media find that nearly half of respondents say they or someone they know has personally experienced extreme heat waves in the past five years, and most believe these events are becoming more frequent. Voters are especially concerned about rising insurance rates, and many also expect climate change to impact everyday costs like utilities and groceries.

Against this backdrop, voters overwhelmingly support requiring oil and gas companies to pay their share of climate damages, including through a climate superfund law, and are more likely to support candidates who back those measures. These views are consistent with earlier polling and, in several cases, reflect increased levels of concern and support over time. This support is broad across demographics and partisan lines, including with majorities of Republicans who back polluter accountability, suggesting that public appetite for such action is durable and growing.

When asked about extreme weather, nearly half of voters (45%) report that they or someone they know personally has experienced extreme heat waves in the last five years, while about 3 in 10 say the same about flooding or flash flooding. In states that were oversampled for this survey, the toll is especially stark: About half of North Carolina and Texas voters report experience with flooding, nearly 4 in 5 Floridians and 3 in 5 North Carolinians say the same about hurricanes or tropical storms, and in every state, at least 2 in 5 voters report that they or someone they know has experienced extreme heat waves.

Looking more broadly, a majority of voters believe both climate change (56%) and fossil fuel pollution (52%) will directly affect their household finances, views consistent with an earlier poll from this year. Views follow clear partisan patterns: More than two-thirds of Democrats and just over half of Independents expect financial impacts, while a majority of Republicans say these factors will have little to no effect.

State results mirror these partisan divides. In bluer states like Illinois and Virginia, voters are far more likely to expect financial impact; two-thirds in Illinois (66%) and nearly 3 in 5 in Virginia (59%) say climate change will affect their household finances. In more conservative states such as Texas, Florida, and North Carolina, voters are more split, with about an equal share saying climate change will have an impact on their finances as those who say it will have little or no impact. The same pattern holds for fossil fuel pollution: Majorities in Illinois and Virginia expect financial effects, while respondents are generally split in the more Republican-leaning states.

Among voters who do expect financial effects, large majorities point to higher utility bills (73%), grocery bills (68%), and gas prices (65%). Many also anticipate increases in health care costs, housing costs, and property maintenance expenses.

This broad consensus translates directly into support for legislative action. In an A/B split sample, voters were asked about a proposed “climate superfund” bill in two different ways: One framing emphasized requiring oil and gas companies to pay a share of the cost of damages caused by their pollution (Split A), while the other emphasized requiring them to pay into a fund that would help communities recover from climate disasters (Split B).

In both cases, support is overwhelming. Under the cost-sharing frame, 77% of voters express support, including 89% of Democrats, 78% of Independents, and 64% of Republicans. Under the recovery fund frame, support remains nearly identical at 78% overall, and 89%, 80%, and 66% among Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, respectively.

State-level results reinforce the breadth of this support. In both Illinois and North Carolina, 78% of voters back the recovery fund framing, while support in Florida (75%), Texas (73%), and Virginia (79%) is also strong. Under the cost-sharing framing, support is highest in Florida (80%) and Texas (78%), with majorities in all oversampled states backing the measure.

Across both split sample groups, there is a marked increase in climate superfund support when compared with polling from 2024, when 66% of voters said they would support a ""climate superfund"" bill that would require oil and gas companies to pay a share of the cost of climate damages caused by their pollution.

Voters also say that support for a climate superfund bill could influence their choices at the ballot box. Sixty-one percent report they would be more likely to support a candidate who backed such a measure, compared with just 16% who say they would be less likely. This includes nearly 4 in 5 Democrats (78%), about 3 in 5 Independents (59%), and nearly half of Republicans (47%).

State-level results are consistent: In each of the oversampled states, large majorities say they would be more likely to support a candidate who favored a climate superfund bill.

Compared with April 2024, when 50% of voters said they would be more likely to support a candidate who backed a superfund bill and 22% said they would be less likely, the latest results point to a clear increase in support. Because the earlier poll included a “don’t know” option, some of that change reflects differences in question design, but the overall movement still indicates real growth in support for candidates who support these efforts.

Together, these results show that supporting polluter accountability carries broad electoral appeal, with significant support even among Republican voters typically seen as more aligned with the oil and gas industry.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa9be92f8370a24714de593/t/68c48193ca6e662c7fdb2c2f/1757708691445/Poll+LA+Strong+Majority+of+Voters+Believe+Congress+Shouldn%E2%80%99t+Fund+AI+Innovation+Until+It+Passes+AI+Consumer+Protection+Laws+%2873%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:55.137960

Under the deal, both countries will be able to fast-track reactor design checks, meaning if a reactor has already passed rigorous safety checks in one country, this work can be used by the other to support its assessment, avoiding duplicating work.

It is also expected to unlock billions in private investment, accelerating the development of clean energy projects and boosting the UK’s position as a global leader in nuclear energy.

Major deals include an £11 billion small modular reactor (SMR) at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, 12 advanced reactors in Hartlepool, and micro-reactors for London Gateway port’s £1 billion expansion.

These projects promise to boost energy security, create jobs – including 2,500 in Nottinghamshire – and stimulate regional growth.

Those announced so far feature partnerships between Holtec, EDF and Tritax, X-Energy and Centrica, Last Energy and DP World, Urenco and Radiant, and TerraPower and KBR.

Simon Bowen, chairman at Great British Energy – Nuclear said: “The UK-US commitment to nuclear energy sends a clear signal – this is a pivotal moment for energy security and clean growth.

“There is enormous potential to unlock investment in the UK’s nuclear sector – supporting high-quality jobs, regional growth, and the development of a resilient, capable supply chain.”

According to the Nuclear Industry Association, the sector has already seen 11,000 new jobs created this year following government-led investment.

powering clean technologies—rare earths, aluminum, and copper—are becoming scarcer as demand surges. Primary extraction is no longer sufficient to meet global decarbonization goals, nor is it sustainable. Recycling, once a niche activity, is now a strategic imperative. By 2025, the race to close the rare earths scrap gap has intensified, with recycling pioneers emerging as linchpins of supply chain resilience and environmental stewardship. For investors, this shift represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on an undervalued asset class at the intersection of sustainability, geopolitics, and technological innovation.

The Market Dynamics of Secondary Metal Supply Chains

The urgency to scale recycling is driven by three forces: sustainability mandates, supply chain security, and technological breakthroughs. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, global demand for rare earths is projected to grow by over 1,000% by 2050, driven by electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, and grid infrastructureThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. However, primary mining remains concentrated in China, which controls 60% of global rare earth processing capacityThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. This concentration has spurred a strategic pivot toward recycling, particularly in countries like India and the U.S., where policy incentives and domestic manufacturing mandates are reshaping the landscape.

China's dominance in the sector is not just a function of scale but of policy. The country has invested heavily in urban mining—extracting metals from discarded electronics, batteries, and industrial waste—while imposing stricter export controls on raw materialsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, India's early achievement of its 2030 renewable energy targets has created a surge in decommissioned solar panels and wind turbines, fueling a nascent but rapidly growing recycling industryThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These developments underscore a broader trend: recycling is no longer a supplement to primary supply but a core component of national energy strategies.

Technological Innovations and Policy Catalysts

Advancements in recycling technologies are closing the efficiency gap between primary and secondary production. For example, hydrometallurgical processes now enable the recovery of over 95% of rare earths from neodymium magnets in EV motorsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Similarly, innovations in aluminum and copper recycling have reduced energy consumption by 90% compared to smelting, aligning with corporate net-zero commitmentsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These technologies are being scaled by startups and traditional recyclers alike, creating a fragmented but dynamic market ripe for consolidation.

Policy shifts are amplifying this momentum. The U.S.-China trade dispute in 2025, for instance, highlighted the strategic value of copper and rare earths, prompting both nations to partially roll back tariffs on key commoditiesTracking tariffs: Key moments in the US-China trade dispute[ 3 ]. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for recycled materials have incentivized automakers and grid operators to prioritize secondary supply chainsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. The European Union's Circular Economy Action Plan, meanwhile, mandates a 70% recycling rate for critical raw materials by 2030These are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These regulatory tailwinds are creating a “policy premium” for companies that can demonstrate circularity in their operations.

The Investment Thesis: A Gold Rush for Circular Assets

The convergence of these factors positions recycling as a high-conviction investment theme. Unlike traditional commodities, secondary metal supply chains offer dual value propositions: environmental impact and geopolitical diversification. For example, a company specializing in rare earth recovery from electronic waste not only mitigates supply risks but also aligns with ESG benchmarks, attracting capital from institutional investors and green bonds.

Emerging business models further enhance the sector's appeal. “Urban mining” platforms, which aggregate scrap from consumers and industries, are leveraging AI and blockchain to optimize collection and traceabilityThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Partnerships between recyclers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are also gaining traction, with

and Siemens now sourcing 30% of their copper and rare earths from recycled streamsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These collaborations create sticky, long-term revenue streams and reduce exposure to volatile primary markets.

Risks and the Path Forward

While the sector's potential is clear, risks remain. Recycling technologies are capital-intensive, and scaling them requires upfront investment. Regulatory uncertainty—such as fluctuating tariffs or inconsistent global standards—could also disrupt margins. However, these challenges are surmountable. Investors with a long-term horizon can mitigate risk by targeting companies with proprietary technologies, strong policy alignment, and diversified feedstock sources.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2643784bc002.png,N,,2025-09-15 16:01:17.510183

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead,” Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO, said in a statement.
“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said.
“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said.
“The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers.","Last week, electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen bought the hydrogen developer Ambient Fuels. The deal was backed by $400 million from the investor Generate Capital to finance projects all over the world that use the zero-carbon version of the fuel.

It’s part of what analysts say is a forthcoming wave of consolidation as an industry that expanded quickly grapples with limited near-term demand for its fuel.

“You’ve got way too much potential supply out there,” Martin Tengler, the head of hydrogen research at the consultancy BloombergNEF, told Latitude Media. “We count more than 100 manufacturers and not enough demand for the electrolyzers they produce. That naturally leads to attrition.”

In some cases, that means mergers. In July, for example, oil and gas giant Baker Hughes bought hydrogen heavyweight Chart Industries. In others, it means going bust. In May, the French hydrogen stripe McPhy collapsed into insolvency, with a court overseeing the sale of its parts.

If all the green and blue hydrogen projects announced worldwide came to fruition, the industry would generate 200 million metric tons of fuel from renewably-powered electrolyzers and carbon capture-equipped gas per year, Tengler said. That’s double the global supply of gray hydrogen, the version of the fuel made with unmitigated gas.

Yet only 6% of those green and blue hydrogen projects have identified offtakers to buy the fuel, which is far more expensive than the dirty alternative. Of that 6%, just 13% have binding offtake agreements.

“So, less than 1% of this 200 million tons have secured a binding agreement where the buyer must buy,” Tengler said. “If you don’t have that kind of offtake agreement, it’s going to be hard to find a banker to finance the project.”

Electric Hydrogen appears to be betting it can capture more of the market by vertically integrating its equipment with the projects deploying it.

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead,” Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO, said in a statement. “We believe this new integration will both enable the industry to scale faster and give Electric Hydrogen even more ways to serve our diverse array of customers — from those who want to do it all themselves, from power procurement all the way to the finished clean-fuel — to those who prefer a partner to finance and develop the hydrogen plant so they can remain focused on their business outcomes.”

In other words: Electric Hydrogen wants to seize as much of the demand in the market as possible. It’s an extension of the company’s enduring tactic of scaling up manufacturing even through a downturn, as Garabedian explained on a March episode of the Green Blueprint podcast.

For more on Electric Hydrogen’s strategy, listen to Raffi Garabedian on the Green Blueprint:

But until now, Electric Hydrogen’s approach has solely been to build large-scale, 100-megawatt electrolyzer plants for industrial projects; the company has never itself been a hydrogen producer. With the Ambient acquisition, Electric Hydrogen is expanding its potential customer base to include hydrogen end users — as well as the ammonia plants or SAF facilities that have already been buying the company’s electrolyzers to make hydrogen of their own.

“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said. “The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers. If they can find a buyer for the hydrogen, then that seems like an interesting move.”

The shifting policy landscape

The acquisition comes as the hydrogen industry leans into something it hasn’t had for years: relative policy certainty.

The 45V tax credit enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act was just the start of a regulatory rollercoaster. The months that followed the law’s passage in 2022 brought fierce debate over how the Treasury Department should define eligibility for the credit — and by extension what kind of hydrogen could be considered “clean.” The fairly strict initial proposal included three pillars — additionality, deliverability, and hourly matching — and prompted intense pushback from certain segments of the industry.

Ambient, for instance, planned to build a major project in Texas “smack dab in the middle” of six refineries currently running on gray hydrogen, and there wasn’t enough physical space to add new batteries big enough to deploy solar panels and wind turbines and allow those refineries to run 24/7 — as the draft guidance would have required for eligibility for 45V credits.

“We wanted to be the billboard for the next generation of carbon-free hydrogen, right in the middle of all that heavy industry, all that refining,” Ambient CEO Jacob Susman told Latitude Media last year. “In making that choice, we put ourselves at risk. If you were required to have this hourly matching, it might make more sense to be sitting right next to the solar plant or the wind farm.”

The debate over the Treasury guidance persisted well into last year. The industry finally got clarity on how the tax credits would work in December 2024, mere weeks before the Trump administration took office. The final rule added some flexibility, providing carve-outs for nuclear plants that would have been excluded under the additionality requirement, and for projects in states with high amounts of renewables.

When President Donald Trump took office pledging to rescind much of the IRA, the fate of the policy was once again thrust into uncertainty. But lobbying by powerful Trump allies, including some representatives of the oil and gas industry, helped preserve the tax credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that largely replaced the IRA. The turnaround helped ensure that certain projects would pencil out beyond a single year.

This was roughly what Susman predicted last fall, telling Latitude Media: “We don’t think they’re coming for hydrogen first.”

If the industry can manage to find enough buyers for green hydrogen now, Tengler said, a tie-up between Ambient’s projects and Electric Hydrogen’s electrolyzers may help produce a giant in the space that can compete with the Chinese manufacturers currently dominating the market.

“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said. “The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers. If they can find a buyer for the hydrogen, then that seems like an interesting move.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-12T182829.060.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:41.132995

Australia’s roughly 11 million households have the world’s highest level of solar installations, helping to drive the nation’s transition away from its aging fleet of coal-fired power generators. The government is eager to tap that enthusiasm as it seeks to meet an ambitious target to more than double renewable generation by 2030, and in July launched a program to cut upfront costs of home batteries.

Residential battery sales almost tripled in the first half of 2025 from a year earlier in the lead up to the program, the CEFC said. Meanwhile, about 1.1 gigawatts of rooftop solar was installed, surpassing the 1 gigawatt of commissioned large-scale renewable energy projects.

A weak grid, limited interconnector capacity between states and the slow rollout of key transmission projects pose big risks for new large renewable energy developments, according to BloombergNEF, which forecasts Australia won’t meet its goal for renewables to supply 82% of electricity until 2036. Many flagship emissions-reduction projects — including green hydrogen and offshore wind — have faced setbacks.

As nuclear power projects falter under the weight of escalating costs and operational delays, investors are increasingly turning their attention to renewable energy as a more resilient and scalable alternative. This shift is not merely a response to environmental imperatives but a strategic recalibration driven by hard financial realities. The recent failures of flagship nuclear projects, such as the Vogtle plant in Georgia and the Olkiluoto 3 reactor in Finland, underscore the systemic risks of capital-intensive nuclear energy. In contrast, renewable energy technologies—bolstered by technological innovation and agile deployment strategies—are outpacing traditional models, offering investors a clearer path to long-term value.

The Financial Quagmire of Nuclear Projects

The Vogtle nuclear project in the United States epitomizes the financial instability of modern nuclear energy. Originally budgeted at $14 billion for two reactors, the project's costs ballooned to over $31 billion, with additional penalties pushing the total to nearly $35 billion Vogtle Electric Generating Plant - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. Delays spanning over a decade, coupled with the bankruptcy of its contractor, Westinghouse, have left ratepayers and shareholders bearing the brunt of these overruns Vogtle Electric Generating Plant - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. Similarly, Finland's Olkiluoto 3 reactor, initially projected to cost €3 billion and come online in 2009, faced 14 years of delays and €11 billion in costs before commencing operations in 2023 HS: Olkiluoto 3 has been a financial catastrophe for Areva, Siemens[ 3 ]. These cases reveal a pattern: nuclear projects are prone to cost overruns, regulatory hurdles, and technical complexities that erode investor confidence.

The risks are not confined to individual projects. A 2023 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) noted that global nuclear capacity additions have stagnated since 2010, with only 15 reactors under construction as of 2023—far below the 150 needed to meet net-zero targets by 2050 Azure Data Factory CI/CD with GitHub Actions[ 5 ]. This stagnation reflects a broader market skepticism, as investors increasingly view nuclear energy as a high-risk, low-liquidity asset class.

The Resilience of Renewable Energy

Renewable energy, by contrast, offers a compelling counterpoint. Solar and wind power have seen their costs plummet by over 80% and 60%, respectively, since 2010, making them the cheapest sources of new electricity generation in most regions Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information[ 2 ]. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), renewables accounted for 9% of total U.S. energy consumption in 2023, with projections suggesting they could supply over 45% of global electricity by 2030 Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information[ 2 ]. This growth is driven not only by falling hardware costs but also by advancements in energy storage, smart grids, and digital analytics.

The scalability of renewables is further enhanced by their modular nature. Unlike nuclear plants, which require years of planning and billions in upfront capital, solar farms and wind parks can be deployed incrementally, allowing investors to adapt to market conditions. This agility mirrors the principles of software development: just as JavaScript's object model enables rapid prototyping and iterative updates, renewable energy systems can be scaled and reconfigured to meet evolving demand Get Started - Handbook - Apache ECharts[ 4 ].

Tech-Enabled Energy Systems: A New Paradigm

Modern energy systems are increasingly underpinned by technologies that mirror the flexibility of software development. For instance, Git's branching strategies—used in open-source software to manage parallel development streams—offer a useful analogy for renewable energy deployment. Just as Git allows developers to test and refine code in isolated branches before merging them into a stable release, renewable projects can be piloted in small-scale trials before full-scale rollout. This reduces risk and accelerates innovation, much like how GitHub Actions automate testing and deployment in software workflows Azure Data Factory CI/CD with GitHub Actions[ 5 ].

Power BI's dynamic data integration further illustrates the power of tech-enabled energy systems. By aggregating real-time data from distributed solar arrays, wind turbines, and battery storage units, Power BI dashboards provide stakeholders with actionable insights into energy production and consumption patterns. This mirrors the role of ECharts, a JavaScript-based visualization library, in creating interactive energy analytics platforms Get Started - Handbook - Apache ECharts[ 4 ]. Such tools enable investors to monitor performance, optimize asset allocation, and respond swiftly to market shifts—a stark contrast to the rigid, data-scarce environments of traditional nuclear projects.

Strategic Capital Reallocation: A Call to Action

The case for reallocating capital from nuclear to renewable energy is both economic and technological. Nuclear projects, with their long lead times and high fixed costs, are ill-suited to a world demanding rapid decarbonization and grid flexibility. Meanwhile, renewables—supported by scalable infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and digital innovation—are positioned to dominate the energy transition.

Investors must act decisively. The window for capturing value in renewables is narrowing as policy frameworks solidify and competition intensifies. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (2022) has already spurred $369 billion in clean energy investments, with tax credits favoring projects that demonstrate technological agility Renewable energy explained - U.S. Energy Information[ 2 ]. Those who delay risk being left with stranded assets in an energy landscape increasingly defined by speed, adaptability, and data-driven decision-making.

Conclusion

The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon but an unfolding reality. As nuclear projects like Vogtle and Olkiluoto demonstrate the perils of capital-intensive, inflexible infrastructure, renewables are proving their mettle through scalability, innovation, and investor returns. By embracing the agility of JavaScript-driven analytics, Git-style deployment strategies, and Power BI-powered insights, the renewable sector is not just competing with traditional energy—it is outpacing it. For investors, the message is clear: the future belongs to those who prioritize resilience over rigidity, and adaptability over obsolescence.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd380f29cbc002.png,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:38.141947

Members of the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders have devised a checklist that is helping to drive scope 3 action.

Companies that act today, guided by this checklist, will lead tomorrow in climate performance, resilience, profitability and long-term success.

Sustainability is a shared responsibility that demands coordination, collaboration and bold action. Success isn’t about isolated efforts; it involves aligning strategies, working with partners and taking meaningful steps toward lasting change. So, how do we clean up global value chains while keeping businesses thriving?

Value chains span the entire product lifecycle — from raw materials to customer use — impacting the economy, environment and society at each stage. Addressing scope 3 emissions means engaging with the entire ecosystem. Companies, however, have been slow to adopt scope 3 targets, providing a number of excuses for this, ranging from a lack of data and regulatory clarity to infrastructure problems.

In a fast-changing climate and regulatory environment, however, perfection isn’t the goal — progress is. A report by the World Economic Forum's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders highlights a 10% aggregated emissions reduction between 2019 and 2022. This achievement demonstrates that sustainable growth is a tangible business value driver.

So, how do we move from theory and ambition to action? Achieving this kind of progress requires not only strategic alignment, but also co-creating solutions with stakeholders and fostering lasting behaviour change. Incorporating elements, such as gamification, can help engage teams and partners more deeply, making sustainability efforts more tangible, motivating and enduring. When members of the Alliance, including Philips, AVEVA, DHL and ManpowerGroup, met with sustainability experts from across various industries and non-profit organizations, such as Games for Health, We Mean Business Coalition and UN Global Compact, they devised the following checklist to drive scope 3 action immediately:

1. Sustainability offers a competitive advantage

Sustainability leaders capture market share, improve customer retention and build resilient operations. DHL’s GoGreen Plus service, for example, enables its corporate customers to track and reduce their logistics emissions, positioning DHL as a strategic sustainability partner. AVEVA’s industrial software enables its customers to reduce their energy waste and carbon footprint, while increasing efficiency. Philips strengthens long-term relationships through circular business models, offering customers lower operational costs and access to the latest technology.

“

The green transition must create a path to prosperity for the many, not the few. That's why we take a people-centric approach. Investing in industry-specific reskilling ensures workers see opportunity, not threat, in the shift to sustainability.

—Frits Scholte, Senior Vice President, ManpowerGroup”

— Frits Scholte, Senior Vice President, ManpowerGroup

ManpowerGroup attracts top talent by aligning corporate values with sustainability-driven career paths, giving Gen Z and millennial workers a compelling reason to join. But, the talent shortage is real — 94% of employers globally say they lack the skilled talent to achieve their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, while 70% are urgently recruiting green talent, particularly in renewable energy, manufacturing, operations and IT.

2. Digitalization, data and transparency accelerate supply chain resilience

Good intentions don’t cut emissions. Data does. Data-driven emissions tracking and real-time insights help companies find faster, smarter ways to reduce emissions, increase efficiency and cut costs. Successful sustainability leaders are rapidly pivoting sustainability to a business enabler, rather than treating it as a compliance checkbox or reporting exercise.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus solution provides customers with monthly high-quality reports with individualized emissions audited by an external auditor, ensuring in-depth analysis and official reporting.

“

There is a lot of insecurity about the path forward out there and it is our time as industry leaders to move ahead and boost scalability in this field. We will benefit tremendously from sharing our approaches and learning from each other.

—Nikola Hagleitner, Post & Paket Germany, DHL Group”

For DHL operations, smart charging for EVs, energy and building management and AI-related route optimizations for fleets are all key drivers. AVEVA’s AI-driven analytics helps companies predict equipment failures, reducing unplanned asset downtime and energy consumption. Philips offers digital monitoring solutions for hospitals that optimize energy usage without compromising patient care. Then there’s the human side of data. ManpowerGroup uses workforce analytics to identify skills gaps in sustainability-related roles and helps companies integrate sustainability into daily operations.

3. Collaboration and leadership support systemic change

Too often, companies focus on internal sustainability efforts while overlooking the broader value chain. The key to delivering systemic change lies in collaboration, with cross-industry partnerships, supplier engagement and leadership that balances long-term sustainable value creation with short-term gains being crucial to succeed.

Philips is helping customers with easy software upgrades and equipment returns, shifting from traditional product sales to service-based models, cutting waste and creating long-term value along the way. DHL adopts a similar mindset. Recognizing that transport emissions go beyond its own fleet, DHL supports subcontractors in transitioning to cleaner vehicles by offering attractive financing conditions from OEMs, access to DHL's gas station infrastructure and a strong partnership.

4 . Sustainability as a profit generator, not a company expense

Sustainability is often perceived – and misconceived – as an added expense, with traditional financial models overlooking hidden environmental costs, such as emissions and resource depletion. Additionally, as regulation evolves — in the EU in particular — businesses must adapt to pricing and investment strategies that reflect the true cost of environmental impact.

Companies embedding sustainability into their core strategies are creating strategic advantages. They consistently reduce operational costs, attract investors and increase resilience.

Philips links its cost of capital to environmental performance through sustainability-linked financing. DHL reduces logistics costs by, e.g. investing in compressed natural gas (CNG) trucks and infrastructure, EVs for pick-up and delivery services and photovoltaic.

“

The industrial sector has a huge role to play in decarbonization and data is the foundation. AI and automation can help businesses find and fix inefficiencies before they become major issues.

AVEVA develops AI-infused software to optimize the use of critical resources, transforming sustainability from a cost into a savings driver by reducing waste, lowering operational expenses and enhancing industrial performance. ManpowerGroup helps companies track green job trends and align talent development with future business needs.

5. Train and upskill workforces to drive a sustainable future

Finally, beyond innovation, differentiation and financial incentives, scaling sustainability across value chains can only succeed if people are equipped to lead it. Every function must build sustainability into its mindset and skillset.

As more companies transition to low-carbon business models, demand for green skills in engineering, supply chain management and digital transformation is skyrocketing. Yet, this presents an opportunity and a challenge. While the green economy promises new roles, without proper support for reskilling, many workers fear these shifts could leave them behind, rather than open new doors. ManpowerGroup addresses this through targeted reskilling initiatives that ensure people see their place in the greener future, while companies get the critical talent they need to achieve their sustainability plans. DHL and Philips train employees in sustainability best practices, ensuring all teams – from managers to drivers to sales and procurement teams – can contribute to corporate climate targets.

Start by taking action

The data is compelling: studies from Morgan Stanley, NYU Stern and Oxford’s Smith School show that sustainable businesses outperform peers in efficiency, resilience and risk mitigation. Companies aligning sustainability with business goals gain a competitive edge in a changing economy.

True sustainability activates the entire ecosystem, well beyond scope 3 emissions reporting alone, to help equip partners to reduce them. Companies that act today will lead tomorrow in climate performance, resilience, profitability and long-term success. Whether through smarter data use, stronger partnerships, financial innovation or workforce training, the tools to act are already here. Philips, DHL, AVEVA and ManpowerGroup demonstrate the possibilities when sustainability drives strategy and is not an afterthought.

This is the decade of delivery. Action is the only metric that counts. Supply chain transformation is already happening. Are you ready to lead it?",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_LkGuaXpaxu1xIDKzYYv5GyYW834BQnVitAcBJR5tF2U.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:02:31.686559

That, analysts warned, could raise the risk of a “back door” entry into the U.S. market.","Investing.com -- Europe’s embrace of Chinese EVs is fueling speculation over when those brands will challenge the U.S., according to analysts.

At this year’s IAA Mobility show, “over a dozen Chinese car brands and, by our count, over 50 Chinese models had a presence,” UBS analysts said.

Their footprint in Europe is growing fast, with JATO data showing that Chinese brands captured 5.1% of new car registrations in the first half of 2025, nearly double from a year earlier.

Another 2.9% came from Chinese-owned brands, much of it focused on battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

, for example, now offers 13 models in Europe, up from six just two years ago, and plans to operate more than 1,000 stores across 32 countries by year-end. It aims to produce all of its European EVs locally by 2028, starting with its Surf model from a Hungarian plant.

Other brands are following similar paths. Hongqi is targeting 15 model launches in Europe by 2028, while has entered 10 European markets and is opening an R&D center in Germany.

“Everything we do starts with the needs of European users,” said an executive at GAC Group, another Chinese carmaker, and highlighted “accelerating steps towards localized production.”

The competitive dynamic in Europe has important implications for U.S. automakers and suppliers. Analysts warn this could echo what happened in China, where global suppliers underperformed as customers lost share to domestic players.

European incumbents like , , and Renault (EPA:RENA) could face pressure if Chinese brands succeed, while suppliers such as Mobileye Global (NASDAQ:MBLY), , , Lear Corporation (NYSE:LEA), and all have significant exposure to Europe.

For now, U.S. policy provides more insulation. UBS points out that the American market is “effectively closed,” helping protect Detroit’s automakers and their suppliers.

Still, U.S. executives are watching closely. CEO Jim Farley has praised the Xiaomi SU7, remarking that “we see the Chinese, companies like and BYD” as the real competitors for the next generation of EVs.

CEO RJ Scaringe was even more blunt, saying Chinese “cars are actually better” and that the industry should prepare for their eventual arrival.

Mexico’s recent move to impose a 50% tariff on Chinese vehicle imports adds another layer of complexity.

While the measure is seen as protecting local production and aligning with U.S. preferences ahead of USMCA renegotiations, it could encourage Chinese firms to build plants in Mexico. That, analysts warned, could raise the risk of a “back door” entry into the U.S. market.

“Separately, we note that as it stands, a 50% tariff from China into Mexico could impact who we believe imports ~125k units, though we do wonder if there could be exemptions for GM,” the analysts added.

But at the same time, the analysts view this “as an opportunity for GM to “backfill” some of their Mexican footprint that may come available as they resource some production to the U.S.”

In sum, while Chinese EVs may not flood U.S. showrooms soon, “better product, particularly if it’s cheaper, tends to find a way into the market,” the analysts stressed.

U.S. policy shields the domestic market for now, offering protection to local automakers, as well as suppliers tied closely to the Detroit Three and truck production, though how long that insulation lasts remains a question.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEE5R0P9_L.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 09:59:24.956853

The company’s contract delivery firms also use their own vehicles, including BrightDrop vans they’ve leased themselves.
Top photo: BrightDrop electric vans at the General Motors CAMI Assembly Plant in Ingersoll, Ontario.","Amazon.com Inc. has been quietly evaluating General Motors Co.’s BrightDrop electric van, evidence that the e-commerce company continues to explore options to reduce the carbon emissions of its sprawling delivery operation.

Amazon confirmed in a statement to Bloomberg that it was testing the vehicles. “We’re committed to having 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, and we regularly test various vehicle options — including a small number of Chevrolet BrightDrops in our fleet,” Steve Kelly, a company spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.

The pilot, though modest – about 12 vehicles, according to Amazon — places the GM vans among a fleet that also includes vehicles built by Ford Motor Co., Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Stellantis NV, as well as Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric vehicle startup Amazon backed with a massive investment and an order for 100,000 electric vans to be delivered by 2030.

The partnership with Rivian and the rollout of its bug-eyed vans have featured heavily in Amazon’s sustainability marketing, but the company still makes many deliveries from gasoline-powered vehicles like Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster vans. Rivian has cut jobs and vehicle delivery targets as it works to bring new consumer models to market and contends with President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the looming expiration of the US EV tax credit.

A GM spokeswoman said the automaker sold Amazon a small batch of vans in 2023. Getting in the door with Amazon could be a win if the Detroit automaker can build on the relationship and push beyond a pilot program. GM launched BrightDrop in 2021 as a new business unit to target fleet customers, with the goal of also supplying them with software to track shipments and deliveries.

The division struggled to gain traction and, by August 2024, GM folded it into GM Envolve, its fleet business division. GM electric van sales are growing but remain tiny. Chevy sold just under 1,600 of them in the first half of the year. By comparison, GM sold more than twice as many electric Cadillac Escalade IQs. GM even idled the van plant in April amid slow sales.

Amazon buys vans in bulk and, through fleet management companies, leases them to its network of contract delivery firms. The company has tested more than 15 EV models and has more than 31,000 on the road, including over 24,000 Rivian vans. Substituting electric vehicles for gasoline-powered ones is a cornerstone of Amazon’s effort to reduce carbon emissions.

Then, in September 2022, Ian, a bruising Category 4 hurricane pushed up to 12 feet of water across the low-lying island, collapsing part of the only causeway on and off Sanibel, flooding thousands of single-family homes and condominiums with brackish water, and forcing some year-round residents into exile for over a year. Two more hurricanes, Helene and Milton, in 2024 added to the island’s misery.

The damage was both staggering and surprising. It had been years since Sanibel experienced a hurricane of any consequence. Officials had also taken steps to reduce their risks, limiting development to a third of the 12-mile-long island and setting aside land for a federal wildlife preserve. Still, Sanibel is only a few feet above sea level and many older homes are at ground level.

“We had so many good years, 30 or 40 years, we were spoiled,” said Daniel Moore Thompson, whose two-bedroom house and gift shop flooded. “And then Ian happened, and it was like we lost our innocence. I basically lost everything except my Jeep and dog.”

“The insurance crisis in the U.S. is the canary in the coal mine, and the canary is dead,” says a former California official.

In a matter of hours, Sanibel went from being an insurer’s dream to a financial nightmare. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which sells most flood policies, was hit with $620 million in claims, a nearly hundredfold increase from the total that it had paid Sanibel homeowners over the previous four decades.

But Sanibel wasn’t the only Southwest Florida community to suffer a dramatic reversal of fortune. Homeowners in Fort Myers Beach, Cape Coral, and Punta Gorda received over $1 billion in flood payouts, records show. Meanwhile, property insurers covering wind and other damages paid billions more, helping to make Ian one of the costliest hurricanes in history.

For insurers, the three hurricanes were a rude awakening. After years of underestimating risks posed by climate-fueled storms, wildfires, and other natural disasters, the industry now faces a perilous future. Old models based on stable climates are being challenged by more frequent, extreme, and damaging events — from searing wildfires in the coastal canyons of California, to hail and torrential rain in the Midwest, to explosive hurricanes such as Ian in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. Now, as sea levels rise, drenching rain storms swell rivers, and hail the size of baseballs pound roofs and cars, the increased costs are pushing insurers to the limit, upending housing markets, and even reshaping the makeup of some communities.

“The insurance crisis in the U.S. is the canary in the coal mine, and the canary is dead,” said Dave Jones, the insurance commissioner of California from 2011-2018 and now director of the Climate Risk Initiative at the Center for Law, Energy and Environment at the University of California, Berkeley. During his time as commissioner, wildfires exploded in Paradise and Malibu, resulting in billions in damages. Coupled with the Trump administration’s aggressive moves to roll back climate initiatives, Jones fears: “We are marching toward an uninsurable future in this country and across the globe; marching into the abyss.”

Jones isn’t alone in such dire warnings. Testifying this February before the Senate Banking Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell predicted that “in 10 or 15 years there are going to be regions of the country where you cannot get a mortgage [because insurance isn’t available].”

Even more recently, the economists and climate analysts Carolyn Kousky, Spencer Glendon, and Barney Schauble raised the idea that the future may be uninsurable. “As natural disasters grow more frequent, extreme, and damaging, more people and businesses are struggling to afford — and even get — insurance,” they wrote in a recent article. “In places of increased climate risk from disasters such as fires and storms, insurance has gone from an afterthought to a source of concern, dismay, and anger.”

In a five-year period, insurers canceled nearly two million homeowner’s policies in the face of rising climate risks.

The markets for property and flood insurance are already in crisis, and in some high-risk areas, are broken, analysts say. Dozens of insurers in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and California have collapsed or been declared insolvent following searing wildfires and catastrophic hurricanes. Meanwhile, prominent national insurers, including Progressive, Allstate, and State Farm, have fled high-risk states or scaled back on writing new policies. In one five-year period, 2018-2023, insurers canceled nearly 2 million homeowner’s policies in the face of rising climate risks — over four times the number that would normally be expected in a year. Many of the notices came with little warning or explanation, leaving homeowners scrambling to find new coverage, no longer a given, and likely at a sharply higher price.

Deborah Brown received notice in 2017 that her family homeowner’s policy was being canceled after years with the same insurer. Her home was 10 miles inland, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but insurers considered it to be high risk. When she looked for a new policy, she was quoted a figure of $8,000, Brown recalled, double her last policy, and over three times the national average, about $2,300. “That was the straw that broke our back,” Brown said. She and her husband sold their house and are now splitting their time between an RV and their daughter’s home upstate.

Florida and other high-risk coastal states have the highest rates of non-renewals, data prepared by the U.S. Senate Budget Committee show. However, there are signs that the trend — while not as pronounced — is spreading inland to Iowa, Oklahoma, and other states.

“People always question: Is insurance going to break?” said Benjamin Keys, a Wharton School economist who has written extensively about the impacts of climate change on real estate. “Well, it already broke a long time ago. Private insurers don’t want to write in the riskiest areas. The Florida insurance market has been broken for a long time.”

In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew caused billions in damage in southern Florida, and several companies collapsed or stopped writing policies, the state created Citizens Property Insurance Corporation to act as an insurer of last resort. Although never intended to compete with private companies, Citizens has since grown to become one of the largest insurers in Florida, with as many as 1.4 million policies at one point. Concerned about its growing financial exposure in the wake of Ian, Citizens began “depopulating” its rolls and transferring policies back to newer, smaller private insurers that have entered the chaotic Florida market.

Since 2000, Florida has had 36 presidential disaster declarations, with damages in the last seven years exceeding $300 billion.

More than 30 states have followed Florida’s path and created their own so-called FAIR plans to fill gaps in the private market. In California, hundreds of thousands of homeowners flocked to the state plan when insurers canceled their policies or stopped writing insurance in the wake of devastating wildfires. But the state policies do not come cheaply, and analysts worry that the small insurers do not have sufficient reserves and reinsurance to cover catastrophic disasters. In 2023, Louisiana was forced to raise the rates of its FAIR plan by over 60 percent in the wake of back-to-back hurricanes Laura and Ida.

Some analysts believe the federal government may have to step in to prop up the wavering market for home insurance, the way it did decades ago when it created the federal flood insurance program after private insurers abandoned the market. But the federally subsidized flood insurance program has lost billions over the years and currently is about $20 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury (that’s after the government already forgave $16 billion of its debt). The troubled NFIP recently increased prices, with the average policy expected to double in five years. Tens of thousands of homeowners have canceled their policies in response, and many more are expected to follow.

“I don’t think the story is insurance won’t be available,” said Keys. “I think the question is affordability and what is the price going to be. For wealthy owners, that may not be a deal-breaker. But others will have to bear more of the risk themselves, either out-of-pocket or by taking out higher deductibles.”

Keys and other analysts estimate that the average cost of a homeowner’s policy nationally has risen between 30 to 40 percent in the last five years — more in high-risk states such as Florida, where there are few regulatory caps and the average premium increased by $1,450 between 2020-2023. Overall, Florida is the most expensive state for homeowner’s insurance, with rates up to four times the national average and painfully high deductibles costing homeowner’s thousands of dollars more.

The risks associated with our hotter, wetter world are growing as natural disasters become more damaging. Ten of the 20 largest wildfires in California have occurred in the last five years, including the devastating 2025 L.A. fires, while hurricane damages and flood losses have soared to all-time highs.

Since 2000, Florida has had 36 presidential disaster declarations, with damages from just the last seven years exceeding $300 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Florida, Louisiana, and Texas alone account for about two-thirds of all hurricane and flood losses.

For example, between 1979-2003, Florida homeowners filed $1.52 billion in flood claims, data show. Then, in 2004, four large hurricanes struck the state, followed by a string of other storms and floods, including Ian and five other major hurricanes. Flood claims have since swelled to $18.9 billion. Most are in coastal counties along the Gulf of Mexico, including Lee County, home to Sanibel Island.

Keys said the rising costs associated with sea level change, hurricanes, and other natural disasters should be sending “a loud and booming signal” to the housing market. “There is a certain portion of the population that has been skeptical of climate risk, but when it hits your pocketbook you take it seriously,” he said.

Potential buyers have begun asking about climate risks and demanding discounts on homes located in coastal floodplains, known as Special Flood Hazard Areas, with a 1 percent annual chance of a 100-year storm. The sharp uptick in the cost of home and flood insurance is also dampening demand for homes, with tens of thousands of houses sitting unsold and some buyers avoiding high-risk areas entirely.

Potential buyers are factoring climate risks into their purchasing decisions, notes Selma Hepp, an economist at the research firm Cotality (formerly CoreLogic). “They’re pricing in insurance premiums, future storms, and the potential for resale challenges,” she said.

The challenges are especially acute in storm-prone Florida, with 1,350 miles of coastline and millions of houses and condominiums perched along shorelines, lagoons, and canals. Now, following three major hurricanes in two years, the housing boom there shows signs of stalling, or even becoming a bubble.

On Sanibel Island, with three hurricanes since 2022, scores of properties have been on the market for months or longer.

“In Fort Myers and Cape Coral, we have 12,000 properties for sale. Five years ago, maybe there would be 30,” real estate agent Susanne Perstad told The Times of London in April. “There’s so much property for sale — maybe five or six houses on every street — and nothing sells. It’s insane.”

Back on Sanibel Island, scores of homes and condominiums have been on the market for months, or longer, and owners are offering discounts up to $100,000 to lure buyers.

During Covid, demand for homes soared across Florida, but especially along the Gulf. “There was so much demand, we ran out of inventory, and you could sell anything for whatever you wanted,” said Eric Pfeifer, who owns a popular real estate agency on Sanibel. The median sales price soared to $1.3 million, but has since dropped to pre-Covid levels, about $830,000. “It was unsustainable,” Pfeifer said. “People weren’t thinking about sea level rise and climate change. In hindsight, it appears unfortunate.”

Thousands of Sanibel homes have been repaired three years after Ian. But a surprising number haven’t been elevated, and with the island less than five feet above sea level, those properties remain vulnerable to future hurricanes and floods. In Ian, older properties, including many at ground level, accounted for about 70 percent of $620 million in flood losses.

Under an NFIP regulation known as the 50 percent rule, if a house is damaged by half or more of its market value, it is required to elevate in order to keep its flood insurance. But some Sanibel homeowners avoided that requirement by requesting new assessments. The new, higher valuations make it less likely damages reach the 50 percent threshold.

Daniel Moore Thompson said he applied for a state grant to help raise his two-bedroom, two-bathroom house located near Blind Pass, where Sanibel merges with Captiva Island. But he was turned down after the state program ran out of money. “It costs $100,000 or $200,000 to elevate on Sanibel. I didn’t have that with all the other costs I had.”

Thompson got a new, higher assessment, which allowed him to stay on the ground for now. But he still plans to elevate. “It just kind of has to wait until I have the money.”

The federal flood program paid him the maximum $250,000 to cover Ian’s flood damage to his house, plus $75,000 for contents. “I still have my same homeowner’s insurance, and it only went up about 30 percent,” he said. “When I heard some of the horror stories from my friends, who had to fight their insurers or had their policies canceled, I was lucky.”

Thompson’s gift shop, Suncatchers, didn’t have flood insurance, and he estimated he lost about $1 million worth of inventory. He has since relocated to an elevated commercial mall on Periwinkle Way.

Even with the challenges, Thompson plans to stay on Sanibel “as long as nature” allows him. “I moved here from Western Pennsylvania. When I saw the nature and the water, I knew this is where I was meant to be. I get up in the morning, walk out my door and fish. I mean who doesn’t want to live by the water?”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/Sanibel-House_AP-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1757690272&s=7567ef0d93cb4ab1d9db7b58dc304216,N,,2025-09-15 07:00:07.247341

Volkswagen appears keen to deliver on its promise to bring 8 affordable electric vehicles (EVs) to market by 2027, including a €20,000 euros (about $23,500) model.

At the International Mobility Show in Munich, Germany, the automaker showcased the tech that should make this feat a reality: It has developed a “unified cell”, a kind of lego-shaped battery cell design which can either be filled with NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) for long-range, premium EVs, or with LFP (lithium iron phosphate), for low-cost models.

The unified cell tech gives batteries the capacity of fast charging from 10% to 80% in under 25 minutes and a driving range of up to 280 miles.

Two of VW’s upcoming small and affordable EVs, the ID. Polo and the ID. Cross, will feature the new battery tech. (These models seem to already be creating quite a buzz for another reason: VW seems to have listened to customer feedback and has ditched a number of disruptive haptics controls to return to manual buttons).

But one thing is for sure: VW has hit the nail on the head by investing in battery tech. According to a Gartner study, battery costs represent close to 40%, or the biggest manufacturing expense, in the production of an EV.

The good news: Battery prices, mainly LFPs, have plummeted over the past 10 years to the point that EVs are expected to be cheaper to produce than regular cars by 2027.

Are expensive electric trucks on the way out?

Which brings us to another major EV news story, this time in the U.S.: After much raised expectations, and many delays, giant automaker Stellantis has decided to cancel what was supposed to be Ram’s first-ever electric pick-up truck. The official reason cited: Slowing demand.

The move wasn’t completely unexpected, with Stellantis having already postponed the launch several times, noting that there was more interest in its upcoming Ramcharger plug-in hybrid (PHEV). But the RAM electric truck, expected to be a direct competitor to the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the Ford F-150 Lightening, might have suffered from more than the changing whims of consumer: Its hefty price: Kelley Blue Book estimated the truck would be priced at around $58,000 for a basic model, with fully loaded versions likely topping $100,000.

And its battery? The very expensive NCM lithium ion type. The Ram electric truck’s estimated retail price was right in line with those of competitors – but that might be part of the problem: Sales of Ford and GM electric trucks have softened.

Kelley Blue Book notes that consumers are feeling more and more inflation pressures, with car prices having increased by about $12,000 to $15,000 on average over the past ten years.

GM, Ford commit to LFP batteries

Both Ford and GM have invested in LFP chemistry for their batteries. GM has partnered with LG Energy solutions to produce cheaper batteries. In Ford’s case, its newly announced next-gen platform is also geared towards more efficient, and therefore less costly, car production. But no doubt, its commitment to LFP batteries is a huge factor in its goal to produce EVs, including small trucks, priced closer to $25,000.

Newcomers in the robotaxi space

We recently reported that Stellantis is also backing away from self-driving technology, citing “limited demand” and high costs.

Meanwhile, the expansion of robotaxi services seems far from over in the U.S., starting with Lyft, which is attempting to catch up with Uber and Waymo.The ride-hailing company just launched robotaxi services in Atlanta in partnership with May Mobility. The service is still in pilot phase involving human safety operators in the front seat of Hybrid Toyota Sienna Autono-Maas vehicles. Both Waymo and Uber have already started delivering driverless rides since the beginning of summer.

Amazon-backed Zoox also kicked off its robotaxi service offering free rides in a number of locations in Las Vegas. A San Francisco launch is expected before the end of the year, to be followed by Austin and Miami.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-09-15 06:01:47.721247

Most Virginia campaigns are won or lost on hot-button issues like taxes, education, reproductive rights, guns and gay marriage, so everyone who runs for office has a position on these questions. This holds true for candidates in this year’s high-stakes races for the state’s executive branch and all 100 House of Delegates seats.

Inevitably, though, there are topics the average candidate doesn’t completely grasp. Some are narrow and – thankfully – nonpartisan. Where do you stand on Sunday hunting? Should I-81 have more lanes? How do you feel about skill games? Will you vote to save the menhaden, whatever a menhaden is? (It’s a fish, and I encourage you to say yes.)

Other topics affect the lives of every Virginian, but they are, frankly, complicated. One of these is energy. Not only is it hard to get up to speed on energy issues, but technology is changing so rapidly that keeping abreast of developments would be a full-time job. Who would spend that kind of time on such a dreary topic?

Uh, that would be me.

So here we go: I’m going to cover five things political hopefuls need to know about energy in Virginia before you get to the General Assembly and start passing laws that affect your constituents’ wallets and futures. And for voters, these are things you should ask candidates about before they earn your vote.

First up:

If you are going to talk about energy, you have to talk about data centers

By now you surely know that Virginia has embraced the most energy-intensive industry to come along since the steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution. Northern Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which already consume an estimated 25% of the state’s electricity, with massively more development planned. The reason isn’t vacation photos or Instagram cat videos; it’s the competition to develop artificial intelligence (AI).

After putting tax incentives in place to attract the industry 15 years ago, the General Assembly and the current governor have rejected all attempts to put guardrails on development or make data centers more energy efficient. The subsidies now cost taxpayers a billion dollars per year (and counting). Virginia asks for almost nothing in return.

Under the best of circumstances, the skyrocketing demand for electricity would put upward pressure on energy prices. But our situation is even worse: Virginia already imports about half our electricity from other states, and the regional grid that we’re part of faces its own energy crunch.

Grid manager PJM has been so slow to approve new generation that governors from member states, including Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, wrote a letter taking PJM to task and urging it to move faster. But the damage has been done. Supply is tight, electricity prices have risen, and prices will continue to rise unless and until supply catches up.

PJM has decided to fast-track new high-cost, gas-fired generating plants ahead of the cheaper renewable energy projects that make up 95% of the queue. It’s a much-criticized move and seems more likely to increase costs. Once built, fossil gas plants burn a fuel that has doubled in price just over the past year, threatening a repeat of the post-pandemic price surge that Virginia ratepayers are still paying for. And there is no relief in sight, with utilities now having to compete with a doubling of U.S. natural gas exports.

Short of unleashing all the renewable energy stuck in the queue, there is no easy way to protect Virginia residents from higher electricity costs. Dominion Energy, Appalachian Power, and at least one of the electric cooperatives have proposed special rate classes for large-load customers, but that would shield residents from only some of the costs of serving the data centers.

Utility bills are going up. Dominion Energy is seeking hefty rate increases that would push up residential bills by an average of more than $10 per month in base rates plus almost $11 per month in fuel costs, primarily due to those higher natural gas prices. Coal-heavy APCo has seen even steeper rate increases in the past few years.

Dominion proposes higher utility rates, new rate class for data centers

Virginia needs new legislation ensuring data centers bear the full expense and risks of serving Big Tech, and they should be required to source their own clean energy. Localities, meanwhile, must be required to evaluate the costs to all Virginians before they issue permits to data centers, including considerations like where the energy will come from, water impacts, and the siting of transmission lines.

You can’t get from here to there without solar

Virginia wasn’t producing all of its own energy even before the data center rush, and PJM’s problems are now pushing us into a crisis. Our near-term options are limited; new data centers are breaking ground at a breathtaking rate, and only solar can be installed on the timeline needed to prevent an energy shortfall. Even if we were willing to pay for high-priced gas or nuclear plants, developers face a backlog of as long as seven years for gas turbines, and advanced nuclear is still not commercially viable.

Fortunately, solar is not just the fastest energy source to deploy, it’s also the cheapest and cleanest. Though President Donald Trump blames rising electricity prices on renewable energy, that’s false, just one of many myths the fossil fuel industry has propagated against solar. Nor is solar unreliable, another myth. When solar is paired with battery storage, it can match the rise and fall of demand perfectly.

The war on woke…energy?

It’s true, however, that while the great majority of Virginians support solar energy, many rural residents oppose it on aesthetic grounds. Of course, they would also oppose nuclear reactors and gas fracking in their neighborhoods. Legislators should be sensitive to their concerns – but having chosen to welcome data centers, Virginia leaders can’t just shrug off the need for energy.

We also have to recognize that many farmers need to lease their land for solar in order to keep the land in their family and generate stable income. This should be as important a consideration to lawmakers as the objections of people who aren’t paying the taxes. Preventing landowners from making profitable use of their land is more likely to lead to the land being sold for development than to it remaining agricultural.

The good news is that solar panels are compatible with agricultural uses including livestock grazing, beekeeping, vineyards and some crops. Dominion Energy uses sheep instead of lawnmowers at several of its solar facilities in Virginia and plans to expand the practice. The combination is a beautiful synergy: sheep and native grasses improve the soil, and in 30 years when the solar panels are removed, the land has not been lost to development.

While there is no getting around the need for utility-scale solar projects, rooftop solar also has an important role to play. In addition to harnessing private dollars to increase electricity generation, distributed solar saves money for customers and makes communities more resilient in the face of extreme weather.

This year the governor vetoed a bill to expand the role of distributed solar in Virginia. The legislation had garnered strong bipartisan support, so it will likely pass again next year. However, lawmakers will need to go further to encourage customer investments in solar now that federal tax credits will be eliminated for residential consumers at the end of this year.

Batteries: For all your reliability needs

The fastest-growing energy sector today is battery storage. Batteries allow utilities to meet peaks in demand without having to build gas combustion turbines that typically run less than 10% of the time. Batteries also pair perfectly with intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, storing their excess generation and then delivering electricity when these resources aren’t available.

Battery prices have tumbled to new lows, while the technology continues to improve. Most lithium-ion batteries provide 4 hours of storage, enough to meet evening peak demand with midday solar. When renewable energy becomes a larger part of Virginia’s energy supply (it’s less than 10% now) we will need longer term storage, such as the iron-air batteries that are part of a Dominion pilot program. This year the governor vetoed a bill that would have increased the amount of storage our utilities must invest in. Given the increasing importance of batteries to the grid, the legislation will likely be reintroduced next year.

In Puerto Rico, customers are helping to keep the lights on. Could a Virginia program do the same?

Batteries installed at homes and businesses can also play a vital role in supporting the grid. Alone or combined with distributed solar, smart meters and electric vehicle charging, customer devices can be aggregated into a virtual power plant (VPP) to make more electricity available to the grid at peak demand times. Dominion will be developing a VPP pilot program under the terms of legislation passed this year.

Advanced nuclear is still in Maybeland

The enormous expense of building large nuclear plants using conventional light-water technology has made development almost nonexistent in this century. Proponents believe new technology will succeed with scaled-down plants that can, in theory, be standardized and modularized to lower costs. Many political and tech leaders hope these small modular reactors (SMRs) will prove a carbon-free solution to the data center energy problem.

It’s hard not to think they’re kidding themselves, or maybe us. Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power plan to develop one SMR each, with Dominion shooting to have one in service in 2035. Not only is this too late to meet today’s energy crunch, but a single SMR would add less energy to the supply side than new data centers add to the demand side each year. Virginia still needs near-term solutions, which means solar and batteries.

Industry enthusiasts believe the 2035 timeline can be shortened, while critics say SMRs may never reach commercial viability. SMRs have to be able to compete on cost with much cheaper renewable energy, including wind, solar and emerging geothermal technologies, and cost parity is a long way off. The economic case for nuclear reactors also requires that they generate power all the time, including when the demand isn’t there, so SMRs need batteries almost as much as renewable energy does.

Geothermal energy is having a moment. Could it power Virginia’s data centers?

Finally, radioactive waste remains a challenging issue, as much (or more) for SMRs as for legacy nuclear plants. The U.S. has never resolved the problem of permanent storage, so nuclear waste is simply kept onsite at generating stations. The risk of accidents or sabotage makes it unlikely that communities will accept SMRs in their midst, especially if the idea is for SMRs to proliferate on the premises of privately-owned data centers near residential areas statewide.

A nuclear technology with less of a waste problem? Fusion energy. A fusion start-up plans to build its first power plant in Virginia in the “early 2030s,” if the demonstration plant it is building in Massachusetts proves successful. While fusion would be an energy game-changer, there are so many uncertainties around timeline and cost that only an inveterate gambler would bet on it helping us out of our predicament.

Pretending climate change isn’t real won’t make it go away

We don’t have to talk about climate change to make the case for transitioning to carbon-free renewable energy, but global warming hovers in the background of any energy debate like an unwanted guest. If you need a primer or are even slightly tempted to say you “don’t know” whether human activity is responsible because you’re not a scientist, read the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s summary for policymakers. The continued habitability of the planet is too important for ignorance to be an acceptable dodge – and of course you, as a respectable candidate, would never stoop to such a thing.

Virginia codified its own action plan in 2020 with two major laws. One provides for the commonwealth to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a multistate compact that uses auctions of carbon emission allowances to incentivize a shift away from fossil fuels and raise money for energy efficiency and climate adaptation. After taking office in 2022, Youngkin removed Virginia from RGGI – illegally, as a court ruled. Virginia remains outside RGGI while the appeals process continues.

The second law is the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), which creates a pathway for Dominion and APCo to transition to carbon-free electricity by 2050. The VCEA includes provisions requiring Dominion and APCo to invest in renewable energy, storage and energy efficiency and make renewable energy an increasing portion of their electricity supply.

The VCEA contains special provisions for offshore wind, which I haven’t addressed here because Trump is determined not to allow projects to move forward while he is in office. This is a shame, as there is bipartisan support in Virginia for this industry and the huge economic development opportunities that come with it. Still, Virginia’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project is 60% complete and will start delivering power next year. Eventually, hopefully, it will be remembered as the first of many.

The VCEA also prohibited new investments in fossil fuel plants except under certain conditions. Dominion is currently seeking permission from the State Corporation Commission to build a $1.5 billion, fossil gas-fired peaker plant, citing data center demand and a need for reliability. Local residents, environmental organizations and ratepayer advocates oppose the plant and filed expert testimony showing that solar, storage and other less expensive technologies would better serve consumers.

In what passes for a bombshell in the energy space, Dominion was forced to admit last month that it had not obtained an independent review of the bid process before selecting its own gas plant over resources offered by third-party bidders.

“No regrets” solutions are progressive and conservative

As you’ve probably figured out by now, there is no perfect power source available today. And yet we would need new generation even if we stopped data center construction cold in its tracks – which isn’t in the plans. Solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest source of generation, allowing us to preserve land – and keep options open – for the future. If the data center boom goes bust, having surplus clean energy on the grid will let us eliminate dirty sources faster, while saving money.

Since taking office in January, Trump has ordered a moratorium on new offshore wind leases, required the Interior Department sign off for renewable projects on federal land, and signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4 that curtailed tax credits for wind, solar and electric vehicles.

Last month, the US Transportation Department canceled $679 million in funding that had been allocated to 12 offshore wind projects nationwide.

The steps mark a sharp reversal from former President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which unleashed record levels of clean energy investment.

Last month Trump declared: ""Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS. THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY! We will not approve wind or farmer destroying solar.""

""Obviously, it (Trump's remarks) creates uncertainty, because the US was attractive over the last years for clean energy projects,"" Thibault Michel, a research fellow at the Paris-based think tank IFRI's Center for Energy and Climate, told Anadolu.

Michel noted that Trump has shifted from skepticism to outright rejection of wind and solar power, deepening concerns about the future of clean energy investment in the US.

- US investment drops 36% in first half of 2025

Wind additions in 2024 slowed to their weakest level in years, with many projects still awaiting final investment decisions when the administration tightened rules.

Denmark's Orsted halted its nearly complete Revolution Wind project in Rhode Island after a federal stop-work order, while US renewable spending fell sharply.

According to BloombergNEF, US investment dropped 36%, or about $20.5 billion, in the first half of 2025 compared with the prior six months.

During the same period, EU-27 investment surged nearly 63%, close to $30 billion.

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) President and CEO Ray Long blasted the stop-work order.

""The Trump administration's decision to halt the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island is an extraordinarily damaging mistake,"" said Long.

He said the project was nearly complete, employing 2,500 people and delivering billions in private investment, and warned that canceling it sends ""a chilling signal to investors and developers that the US cannot be relied upon to honor its commitments, even when projects are 80% built.""

Long added that the decision risks higher power bills, and undermines US competitiveness as China races ahead with energy infrastructure spending.

While, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the administration's stance, arguing offshore wind is uncompetitive without government support.

""In the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' President Trump advocated, we removed subsidies for wind,"" Wright told the Financial Times.

""Offshore wind is twice as expensive as onshore wind, and we wouldn't have a big onshore wind industry without a lot of subsidies. The economic outlook for offshore wind in the United States is not promising,"" he added.

According to Michel, US developers were already strained by high costs and global competition before Trump took office.

""Jobs destroyed in the wind and solar supply chain won't be replaced by oil and gas,"" he said. ""Most studies agree that for the same amount of energy, renewables employ more people than fossil fuels.""

""Trump's idea is to create new growth for oil and gas, but US oil production is expected to stabilize, not grow much, according to the Energy Information Administration,"" he added.

- ""Investments in renewables are outpacing fossil fuel""

Electricity demand in the US is climbing, driven in part by the growth of data centers, but generation capacity has increased only modestly over the past decade, almost entirely from wind, solar and battery storage.

""If you withdraw additions from wind, solar, or battery storage, it seems impossible to keep pace with growing demand,"" Michel said.

He noted that nuclear and gas projects could add supply, but new plants are unlikely to come online before 2028.

Despite this uncertainty, some US states continue expanding renewables, he explained. ""The US remains a big market, so it will still be attractive. But these announcements send a misleading signal. No one knows what will happen next.""

Globally, however, the picture is much clearer, renewables accounted for 92.5% of new power generation capacity added in 2024, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

""Investors around the world support their deployment: investments in renewables are outpacing fossil fuel funding by a substantial margin,"" Christoph Zipf, a spokesperson for the industry group WindEurope, told Anadolu.

""New wind farms generate electricity at lower costs than new fossil or nuclear power plants,"" Zipf added.

""The only way to slow down the global growth of renewables [in the power sector] is through policy interventions. Such interventions run counter to economic reason,"" he said.

It remains to be seen whether the rule will be adapted after industry feedback or if reporting will be shifted towards individual states.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a rule that would dismantle its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), which currently obliges around 8,000 industrial facilities to report annual emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases.

According to the proposed rule, 46 of the 47 source categories would be relieved of reporting requirements, and many of those in the petroleum and natural gas sector would see their reporting suspended until 2034 under recently enacted legislation.

Administrator Lee Zeldin positioned the move as part of the Trump administration’s “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” agenda, calling the reporting obligations burdensome to business and saying the data collection “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

The EPA estimates that the rule could save U.S. businesses roughly $2-2.4 billion over ten years. The proposal is one in a growing wave of regulatory rollbacks aimed at loosening climate-related controls.

Earlier plans have targeted the EPA’s “endangerment finding,” a legal determination that underpins many federal greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act, as well as efforts to scale back monitoring and reporting regimes.

Impact on carbon management

The consequences for the emerging carbon management industry could be substantial. The current framework underpins almost everything from the actual measurement of CO2, to its transportation and storage. Carbon removal projects involving direct air capture and approaches focused on biomass power generation would also be affected.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, an organization spanning over 100 companies and organizations working in the industry said: “The EPA’s GHGRP, along with the Class VI injection well program, serves as the regulatory backbone of the carbon management industry, underpinning the integrity, transparency, and accountability of the 45Q tax credit in the United States.

…Carbon management project developers have already invested an estimated $77.5 billion in capital expenditures across the nation in existing and near-term projects. This amount is far more than the $2.4 billion in savings cited by EPA in their announcement ending 46 of the 47 subparts of the program. Relevant subparts of the GHGRP are mission-critical to the business plan for those projects and remain crucial components to electing the 45Q tax credit – ensuring that these projects and investments translate into corresponding jobs and additional economic benefits.”

Expected pushback

Critics have warned that eliminating much of the GHGRP would strip away transparency, obstruct scientific and policy planning, and weaken public accountability just as climate risks grow.

Meanwhile, business interests supporting national standards have said that certainty helps them plan investments, even amid regulatory uncertainty.

Public comment on the proposal will be open for 47 days after its publication in the Federal Register. Legal challenges could also be expected if the rule is finalized as proposed.

It remains to be seen whether the rule will be adapted after industry feedback or if reporting will be shifted towards individual states. The former would most likely slow down the adoption of rules and regulations while also hampering large-scale projects.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bernd-dittrich-lg2MPRWw2c4-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 06:59:54.364411

Mars confirmed that additional global agreements are in the pipeline to support the development of renewable energy projects that serve the company and its suppliers.
“For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches.
It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.”","Mars has teamed up with energy partner Enel as part of its sustainability programme, Renewable Acceleration, aiming to speed up the shift to clean energy across its entire value chain.

The initiative is designed to fuel the move away from fossil fuels by bringing the totality of Mars’ value chain’s electricity usage to the renewables market.

This involves sourcing renewable energy to cover everything from the farms that grow ingredients to the trucks that deliver products, and even the energy used by consumers at home to enjoy Mars products.

By implementing the Renewable Acceleration strategy, Mars said it could cut around 3 million tonnes of carbon emissions from its value chain – around 10% of its current total footprint.

Direct operations across the business globally use approximately 2 TWh of electricity each year, roughly the equivalent of the annual consumption of The Bahamas. However, when including the full Mars value chain under Renewables Acceleration to include its suppliers, customers and consumers, that number jumps to 8-9 TWh – the annual equivalent of Estonia.

The recently signed contract with Enel is the provider’s largest-ever power purchase agreement transaction with a commercial and industrial customer worldwide, as well as Mars’ largest contract to date.

Mars confirmed that additional global agreements are in the pipeline to support the development of renewable energy projects that serve the company and its suppliers.

According to the F&B giant, its first three contracts with Enel will generate a combined 1.8 TWh annually, avoiding approximately 700ktCO₂e per year. Mars will benefit from the entire output from Enel’s three solar plants in Texas, US. Vegetation across all three sites will be managed by sheep grazing, a dual-use solar practice that Enel expanded through the largest solar grazing agreement signed in the US.

Kevin Rabinovitch, global VP sustainability at Mars, said: “Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture”.

Supply Chain Economic Impact Comprehensive four-pillar implementation generates profound supply chain transformation extending far beyond environmental compliance.","The global supply chain crisis has a hidden dimension that few executives fully grasp: The energy supply chain powering industrial operations worldwide remains largely carbon-intensive, creating unprecedented risks for companies committed to ESG goals. With 37.4 billion tonnes of annual CO₂ emissions and the power sector accounting for 40% of energy-related emissions, the thermal power generation presents the greatest supply chain and ESG related challenge.

Developing economies still depend heavily on thermal power generation for energy security and economic growth. For example, in India alone, coal-fired power plants generate over 60-70% of electricity, supporting industries that employ millions and provide essential services to 1.4 billion people. Similar dependencies exist across other developing countries, where thermal power remains the backbone of industrial development and poverty alleviation.

This creates the ""thermal power paradox"": the simultaneous need to maintain energy security while drastically reducing environmental impact.

The Supply Chain Reality Check

While supply chain leaders focus on optimizing logistics networks and supplier relationships, the fundamental energy infrastructure supporting industrial operations continues to generate massive environmental and operational risks. A typical 500 MW thermal power plant, the type powering major manufacturing hubs across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, represents a complex supply chain ecosystem requiring 15,000-25,000 tonnes of steel, 50,000 cubic meters of concrete, and coordination among hundreds of global suppliers.

Yet these same facilities release 3 million tonnes of CO₂ annually while consuming 2.5 billion gallons of water daily, creating cascading supply chain impacts, from increased healthcare costs and agricultural productivity losses, to infrastructure damage that disrupts regional logistics networks.

The Four-Pillar Transformation Framework

A systematic approach to transforming thermal power supply chains addresses both environmental imperatives and operational reliability. This four-pillar framework offers supply chain leaders a replicable methodology for engaging with energy suppliers on decarbonization while maintaining the reliability essential for industrial operations.

Pillar 1: Emissions Control Supply Chains

Advanced flue gas desulfurization (FGD) creates new material flows. FGD implementation transforms waste streams into supply chain assets. A single FGD installation prevents 30,000 tonnes of SOx emissions annually while generating 40,000 tonnes of synthetic gypsum — creating new revenue streams for wallboard manufacturing that can generate $5-8 million annually per unit.

The supply chain complexity is substantial: FGD projects require limestone procurement at 1.1-1.3 tonnes per tonne of SO₂ removed, creating ongoing supplier relationships with quarry operations while generating gypsum distribution networks that serve construction industry supply chains. This circular economy approach demonstrates how environmental compliance can enhance rather than burden supply chain economics.

Pillar 2: Renewable Integration Networks

Building diversified energy supply chains. Strategic renewable integration creates resilient energy supply chains that reduce single-source dependency while improving cost predictability. Solar PV integration — with costs declining 85% since 2010 — enables thermal facilities to optimize generation timing, operating during peak efficiency periods while solar handles midday demand.

The procurement implications are significant: A 100 MW solar installation requires coordination of photovoltaic modules, inverters, and electrical infrastructure across hundreds of acres, typically spanning 18-24 months from engineering to commissioning. Success depends on managing fragile component transportation and synchronizing electrical grid integration with multiple technology providers.

Pillar 3: Fuel Supply Chain Transformation

Parallel fuel systems enhance supply security. Rather than disruptive fuel switching that creates supply chain vulnerabilities, parallel fuel systems enable gradual transition while maintaining operational reliability. Natural gas integration alongside existing coal infrastructure provides 50% CO₂ reduction while preserving backup fuel options.

This approach requires sophisticated procurement strategies, including long-term gas contracts, storage capacity and transportation diversity. Implementation involves complete parallel infrastructure — pipeline connections, compression stations, and treatment systems — creating redundant fuel supply chains that optimize based on pricing, availability and environmental considerations.

Pillar 4: Water Resource Supply Chains

Ecological engineering reduces resource dependencies. Phytorid bed technology transforms wastewater treatment from resource-intensive operations into self-sustaining ecological systems. These nature-based solutions achieve superior treatment performance with 60-80% lower operating costs compared to conventional systems while eliminating chemical reagent supply chains.

Implementation requires minimal ongoing inputs: Periodic plant harvesting and substrate maintenance replace chemical procurement, mechanical equipment, and high energy consumption. The approach converts waste streams into productive ecosystems that sequester carbon while generating biomass for composting or biogas production.

Supply Chain Economic Impact

Comprehensive four-pillar implementation generates profound supply chain transformation extending far beyond environmental compliance. The economic model reveals attractive returns through multiple value streams:

Direct cost optimization. Fuel efficiency improvements reduce costs by 15-25%, creating annual savings of $15-30 million for a 500 MW facility. Combined with reduced water consumption and waste disposal costs, operational savings justify implementation investments.

New revenue streams. Byproduct sales from gypsum production, renewable energy sales during peak pricing, and biomass production create additional revenue totaling $8-15 million annually per facility — transforming environmental compliance from cost center to profit contributor.

Risk mitigation. Fuel diversification, environmental compliance and community acceptance reduce regulatory, market and social risks that translate to lower financing costs and higher asset valuations.

Implementation Methodology for Supply Chain Leaders

A staged approach minimizes disruption. Successful transformation requires parallel system development that maintains operational capability while building sustainable capacity. Rather than disruptive replacement, this approach enables gradual transition as new systems prove reliable.

The five-stage methodology begins with comprehensive baseline assessment, progresses through technology integration planning and parallel system development, enables gradual transition and optimization, and concludes with continuous improvement and scaling. Each stage maintains supply chain reliability while building transformation capability.

Stakeholder ecosystem development. Transformation projects catalyze development of supporting supply chain ecosystems that create regional economic development. FGD installations support local limestone mining and gypsum processing, while renewable integration creates demand for installation services and maintenance providers that develop capabilities transferable to other projects.

The Strategic Imperative

For supply chain leaders, the thermal power transformation represents both risk mitigation and competitive opportunity. Early movers gain advantages through reduced energy costs, enhanced ESG performance, and stronger stakeholder relationships. The question isn't whether transformation will occur — economic and regulatory forces ensure it will — but whether companies will lead or follow this supply chain evolution.

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act incentives, which offered up to $7,500 in tax credits per EV, are set to expire on September 30. Analysts warn the move could sap demand and slow supply chain investments across the U.S. EV sector.

Compounding the challenge, a $4.3 billion Hyundai–LG battery plant in Georgia has been forced to push back its launch by at least two to three months after a federal immigration raid disrupted construction. The facility was expected to start supplying lithium-ion cells next year.

Hyundai and Kia are now leaning on hybrid vehicles to fill the gap. U.S. sales of their hybrids jumped nearly 48 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of 2025, reaching almost 200,000 units. But the vast majority of these cars are exported from South Korea, leaving them exposed to a steep 25 percent import tariff.

That tariff burden could grow more costly as Japan, Hyundai’s biggest hybrid rival in the U.S., prepares to secure a reduced 15 percent tariff under its trade terms with Washington. Toyota and Honda already dominate the U.S. hybrid market with a combined 68 percent share, while Hyundai and Kia trail at 12.3 percent.

Industry analysts warn the risk of a price reversal is real: Kia’s Sportage Hybrid, priced at $30,290, could overtake Toyota’s $32,850 RAV4 Hybrid if tariffs raise its sticker price to nearly $38,000, leaving Hyundai at a competitive disadvantage.

Hyundai is expected to outline a revised North America hybrid strategy at its upcoming CEO Investor Day. Market watchers say the company must emphasize durability, parts distribution, and service networks to reassure investors — and to fend off Japanese rivals poised to consolidate their lead in a post-subsidy market.

Solar projects are groups of solar panels used to harness energy from the sun, while wind projects include wind turbines, which are used to harness energy from the wind.
Tesdell’s solar projects generate about 75 percent of his electricity needs for his farmstead, including his house, barn, and well.
Lee Tesdell mentioned the use of agrivoltaics — defined as agricultural production underneath solar panels — as a way to further mitigate the amount of land solar projects take up.
Restrictions on foreign-made solar panels The news release also announced restrictions on panels “manufactured by foreign adversaries,” which could make solar projects more expensive.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, will no longer fund renewable energy projects on prime farmland, according to an Aug. 19 news release. This will prevent farmers in Iowa from installing solar and wind projects on their land.

Solar projects are groups of solar panels used to harness energy from the sun, while wind projects include wind turbines, which are used to harness energy from the wind.

Lee Tesdell, a farmer located in Slater, Iowa, and a board member for the Center for Rural Affairs, has had solar projects on his land for 10 years. Starting with just an array of six panels, he has since added 24 additional panels. He called the USDA decision “terrible.”

“It’s a sad day when Washington wants to tell us that we can’t farm the wind, can’t farm the sun,” Tesdell said.

Tesdell said many farmers have good reasons to have renewable energy projects on their land — not only for financial reasons— but also because it is a“cleaner energy source” than fossil fuels.

“It makes all kinds of sense for [Iowans] to farm the sun and farm the wind, just like we farm the soil, right?” Tesdell said.

Tesdell’s solar projects generate about 75 percent of his electricity needs for his farmstead, including his house, barn, and well.

Tesdell also said he is “grid tied,” with his electric utility company, Consumers Energy Rural Electric Cooperative — meaning the amount of energy he overproduces goes into the energy grid, leading to a reduced bill each month.

He also has a net metering agreement with the cooperative, meaning compensation for overproduction comes at a retail rate instead of wholesale price, leading to a large difference in the payback each month.

Jennifer Studebaker, interim executive director at the Women, Food, and Agriculture Network, or WFAN, described the decision as unfortunate. She said it will become costly to all Iowans if farmers are no longer able to build wind and solar projects contributing to the energy grid.

Studebaker elaborated on the financial benefit farmers can get, especially if they sell the energy they generate.

“For farmers, that $10,000 or so difference in terms of costs, that’s sometimes, if they get to keep their farm, in terms of the security that that can offer,” she said.

Emma Colman, organizing representative of the Sierra Club’s Iowa Chapter, an environmental nonprofit, said the move represents a lack of understanding of rural America.

“It is a testament to how little our current federal administration understands our state and local communities,” she said. “It ultimately is just taking power out of the hands of our communities, and that’s really disappointing.”

She said farmers should be able to make their own decisions on their property because solar and wind projects allow farmers to make a better living, and are another form of farming.

Chris Hoffman, a member of the Johnson County Solar Task Force, has been in the solar industry for 12 years. He said the federal administration has been clear they do not want to move toward cleaner energy initiatives.

“In reality, the administration just doesn’t want renewable energy projects,” Hoffman said. “This is probably a dug-up excuse for not doing so.”

Prime farmland in Iowa

According to the Clean Grid Alliance, 5,755 out of 30,000,000 acres of Iowa farmland house solar projects, which amounts to less than one percent of total farmland.

The alliance also found 17.5 million out of Iowa’s 30 million acres are considered “prime farmland,” which is defined by the USDA as “land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and is available for these uses.”

U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-IL, sees these projects as taking up too much farmland, therefore limiting the amount of food that is grown to feed Americans.

“We shouldn’t be subsidizing solar projects on prime farmland; that land is too valuable for producing the food and fuel our nation depends on,” Bost said in the news release.

Lee Tesdell mentioned the use of agrivoltaics — defined as agricultural production underneath solar panels — as a way to further mitigate the amount of land solar projects take up. For example, he has set up a fence around his panels and allowed his sheep to graze underneath them, which he said works nicely.

He disagrees with the argument that solar and wind projects take up too much space, and said solar and agriculture can work well together in this way.

“It’s kind of a bogus argument to be honest,” Tesdell said.

Studebaker also brought up agrivoltaics as an alternative to the lack of space argument.

“What I really see as a missed opportunity by the Trump administration is recognizing that you can have renewable energy and sustainable farming working together,” she said.

Environmental impacts of wind and solar projects

Peter Thorne, an environmental professor at the University of Iowa, said solar and wind projects have little negative effect on the land they are built on. Though he mentioned farmland less than ideal for growing crops — not considered “prime farmland” by USDA standards, including land located by streams and rivers — may be a proper place for wind and solar projects.

“We really need to be thinking more smartly about how we use Iowa’s land,” Thorne said. “I think the focus should really be on carefully taking land out of production, that is, this vulnerable land, that’s erodible.”

He explained solar and wind projects, a form of clean energy, are better for the environment than fossil fuels.

“The science all points to the need for clean energy, both in terms of it being the best for the health of the ecology and human health, and also in terms of energy independence,” Thorne said. “We know that fossil fuels are going to run out, and that they are responsible for a lot of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and deaths.”

Studebaker said there are ways for farmers to mitigate any potential impacts projects could have on farmland.

“If you’re worried about erosion or movement of water, there are different things you can do in terms of planting certain types of native plants to block that and absorb more of the water,” she said.

Colman said limiting solar and wind projects will harm the land, as farmers will have to resort to using fossil fuels. She added that energy demand in Iowa and across the world is going up, and that the state must adapt to meet that demand.

“The reality is, if they aren’t investing in renewables, energy efficiency, and battery storage, then they’re going to be building new gas and coal plants across our state — and are those good for the farmland?”

It is unclear if projects on poorly graded land will continue to be approved, as the new restrictions only pointed to protection of prime farmland.

Restrictions on foreign-made solar panels

The news release also announced restrictions on panels “manufactured by foreign adversaries,” which could make solar projects more expensive.

According to the International Energy Agency, China is responsible for over 80 percent of the production of solar panels worldwide.

Studebaker said she expects this to affect farmers’ ability to purchase and install solar panels, even if the project isn’t on prime farmland.

“There may be a few US companies, but I don’t think we have the domestic industry to allow for people to buy solar panels, and especially at an affordable cost,” she said. “The ones [solar panels] being produced in China are probably the most affordable for farmers.”

David Bader, press secretary for U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Grassley will continue to “review the regulation to ensure the U.S. continues to pursue a strategy that supports farmers while increasing our energy savings.”",https://dailyiowan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_09_11_WindTurbine_GD_008.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 00:58:29.089976

But the sun continues to shine, and in Evanston, residents continue to install rooftop panels to turn that into electricity.

It was a year ago when Libby Hillinstalled 12 rooftop solar panels on her northwest Evanston home. We met up again in late August to find out how those panels are doing.

Hill pulled out her phone and showed us that the system had produced 6.18 megawatt hours of power since they were installed. She has paid for extra electricity just once, when midsummer heat made air conditioning unavoidable. Otherwise, she’s been paying just $19.54 a month, the minimum that ComEd charges for connecting to the grid.

She relishes checking the SolarEdge app that tracks electricity production, especially on a clear day when the panels are at their most productive. Even when she’s out of the country, she checks to see whether it’s sunny enough at home to keep the solar power humming.

But the point Hill wanted to emphasize is that she’s not alone. She mentioned several nearby houses with rooftop solar installations, and when she walked around later to confirm, she found even more.

Big trees rule out rooftop solar in many parts of Evanston. But “in my neck of the Evanston woods, I find I’m in good company,” she said. Within a few blocks, she found 12 other solar installations on houses that vary in age and style.

“Homeowners have found suitable locations for panels on house roofs to garages, sometimes sandwiched into the space where the sun reaches on an otherwise tree-shaded roof,” she reported. “Panel-covered roofs face south, east, west and in one case north, and in another case three sides of the roof except north. On my sunny late morning walk, the sun was shining on all.”

Permit applications from the City of Evanston confirm that what she’s observed in her neighborhood reflects a broader pattern. From January 2019 through August of this year, the city issued 409 permits for residential solar installations. For the five years that began in January 2019, the average number of applications per year was 60. Applications rose to 70 in 2022, the year the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and federal tax credits for solar went into effect.

Act fast for federal tax savings

Now that the Trump administration’s budget bill has dismantled much of the IRA, tax credits for rooftop solar will expire at the end of this year instead of continuing through 2035.

Groups like Rewiring America are urging people to act fast, offering tips like this guide to using tax credits before they’re gone. Electric vehicle credits also expire at the end of September. Rooftop solar installations have to be complete and connected to the grid by Dec. 31 to qualify. (Check EnergySage for other available incentives.)

Even with these credits expiring, solar energy will remain a “hedge against utility rates, which have climbed high in recent years and are expected to rise even further as data centers demand more energy and the Trump administration stymies cheap wind and solar power,” Dan McCarthy writes for Canary Media. “Most households that install rooftop solar see their energy bills drop.”

Saving money isn’t the main consideration for everyone, Hill pointed out, and those who can afford the up-front cost have other important reasons to go solar: “People do it because it’s a good thing to do,” she said.

‘Benign and beautiful way to produce energy‘

Bill McKibben, the author of a 1989 book that raised public alarm about the perils of human-caused climate change, is spearheading plans for Sun Day on Sunday, Sept. 21. The event, a revival of sorts of the first Sun Day in 1978, which Hill remembers fondly, will be celebrated locally with events in Wilmette and at Montrose Beach in Chicago. (Find out more here.)

As McKibben said in a recent interview: “The sudden explosion of solar and wind energy over the last three years is the first time we’ve had anything that’s really started to scale in a way that might make a difference in how hot the planet eventually gets. … We have a benign, indeed, a beautiful way to produce energy, energy from heaven, not from hell.”

Drop by the Sept. 21 Sun Day event at Montrose Beach: “Over 30 groups — from solar installers and nonprofits to justice organizations and houses of worship — will share fun, easy ways to go solar, including community solar that can save you 15–20% on your electric bill.”

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?” AP",https://www.communicationstoday.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US-power-grids-strain-under-data-center-boom-forcing-strategy-shift.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 01:57:55.204424

Installed renewable capacity is expanding at record speed, spanning solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and nuclear. Yet, the true test is not how much we add, but how fully and efficiently we use what is already generated. Unless every kilowatt-hour is delivered at the lowest cost and highest reliability, capacity growth will remain a hollow statistic.

The vision must be uncompromising: Power for all Indians, of the highest quality and lowest cost. Reliable electricity is not just a household need but the foundation of industrial growth, digital expansion, agricultural productivity, and social equity. Delivering clean, uninterrupted power at globally competitive costs is both an economic imperative and a national commitment—essential to India’s prosperity and resilience.

Principles for Transformation

Eliminate power waste: Every photon, gust, or drop converted into electricity must find productive use. Curtailment of renewable energy, still common in several states, undermines both abundance and investor confidence.

Manage surges and shortfalls: AI-driven forecasting, storage, and flexible demand response can smooth out fluctuations. Without such integration, renewable power will remain prone to waste and unreliability.

End tariff distortions: Cross-subsidies discourage efficiency and deter investment. Replacing them with direct benefit transfers (DBT) to vulnerable households ensures transparent, cost-reflective tariffs that attract capital while protecting the poor.

Global standard maintenance: Poor operation and maintenance (O&M) increases outages and costs. Preventive maintenance—using AI, IoT, and drones—must replace reactive fixes, ensuring turbines, substations, and feeders meet global reliability benchmarks.

Full utilisation of assets: Idle plants and stranded assets cannot coexist with power shortages. A national dispatch system with real-time monitoring and strict merit-order discipline will ensure every plant contributes optimally.

AI-led optimisation: Artificial intelligence must permeate every function—demand forecasting, frequency regulation, market clearing, and predictive maintenance—to orchestrate a dynamic, reliable grid.

Reach the last hamlet: Distributed microgrids—solar, mini-hydro, and biomass—must complement national transmission networks, ensuring no community is left without power.

Regional energy diplomacy: South Asia’s power future is interdependent. Hydro imports from Nepal and Bhutan, natural gas and biogas from neighbours, and cross-border grid connections with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka can create a resilient regional bloc.

Abundance as justice: The goal is not just adequacy but justice—clean, uninterrupted, affordable power delivered at globally competitive costs to every citizen.

Strategic pillars of action

Transmission: A multi-terminal HVDC overlay grid linking Rajasthan, Gujarat, Ladakh, and Tamil Nadu directly to industrial centres is essential. The 500 GW transmission expansion must be fast-tracked and monitored transparently. Cross-border HVDC interconnections will add resilience.

Market reform: Market-Based Economic Dispatch (MBED) with five-minute settlements can lower system costs. Breaking state-level scheduling silos and guaranteeing transparent curtailment compensation are critical to investor trust.

Storage and flexibility: India needs to auction at least 100 GWh of storage annually, spanning batteries and pumped hydro. Storage must be treated as infrastructure, paid for its availability and ramping services. Aligning time-of-day tariffs with renewable peaks will drive efficiency.

Tariff and subsidy reform: Direct benefit transfers can replace opaque subsidies, while national tariff rationalisation ensures fairness and stability. Cost-reflective tariffs will also align investor expectations with consumer protection.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Digital and AI orchestration: An AI-led system operator, backed by a national digital twin of the grid, can optimise dispatch and forecast demand. Real-time, open-access data will spur innovation from startups and utilities alike.

Maintenance excellence: Utilities must adopt ISO 55000-compliant asset management and global preventive O&M standards. Drones and robotics can make inspections continuous, reducing outages and costs.

Regional energy diplomacy: Hydro imports from Bhutan and Nepal should be locked into long-term contracts. India must lead in creating a South Asian Power Pool and regional green gas market, positioning itself as the anchor.

Universal access: Distributed renewable microgrids and prepaid meters must integrate rural consumers into digital markets. Reliable 24×7 power should be treated as a constitutional right.

Governance and finance architecture

A National Renewable Evacuation and Optimisation Mission (NREOM) should take single-point responsibility for integration. Financing must draw on PGCIL InvITs, sovereign green bonds, and blended finance to mobilise over $100 billion annually. Contracts must be outcome-based, with strict penalties for delays.

If executed with urgency, India can:

Eliminate renewable curtailment by 2030.

Deliver the world’s lowest cost per kilowatt-hour, anchored in efficiency.

Guarantee reliable 24×7 power to every household.

Become a net exporter of clean power, stabilising South Asia’s grid.

Lead in AI-optimised grid operations, proving industrialisation can be decoupled from carbon emissions.

Clean energy: From vision to execution

India has pledged 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030 and Net Zero by 2070. These numbers inspire confidence, but they risk becoming hollow milestones if generation is wasted, if tariffs remain distorted, and if assets are left idle. The challenge now is to turn capacity into capability—power that is fully utilised, efficiently dispatched, and equitably shared.

The first step is to eliminate systemic inefficiencies: end renewable curtailment, replace cross-subsidies with direct benefit transfers, and enforce cost-reflective tariffs. At the same time, AI-enabled optimisation must become the backbone of grid management, predicting demand, regulating frequency, and enabling market-based dispatch. Maintenance must move from reactive repair to global-standard preventive care, ensuring every plant and transmission line operates at peak efficiency.

Equally vital is the extension of abundance to every household. Distributed microgrids, supported by digital tokens and prepaid meters, can bring the remotest villages into real-time power markets. Cross-border connections with Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka can anchor a resilient South Asian energy bloc, positioning India as both provider and stabiliser.

This is not simply an energy strategy. It is a civilisational pledge—to deliver clean, affordable, uninterrupted power as a basic right of citizenship, to build competitiveness for industry, and to secure regional leadership. The test of ambition lies not in setting targets but in ensuring that no unit of power is wasted and no citizen is left in the dark.:",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/green-bonds.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 21:59:46.896683

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act incentives, which offered up to $7,500 in tax credits per EV, are set to expire on September 30. Analysts warn the move could sap demand and slow supply chain investments across the U.S. EV sector.

Compounding the challenge, a $4.3 billion Hyundai–LG battery plant in Georgia has been forced to push back its launch by at least two to three months after a federal immigration raid disrupted construction. The facility was expected to start supplying lithium-ion cells next year.

Hyundai and Kia are now leaning on hybrid vehicles to fill the gap. U.S. sales of their hybrids jumped nearly 48 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of 2025, reaching almost 200,000 units. But the vast majority of these cars are exported from South Korea, leaving them exposed to a steep 25 percent import tariff.

That tariff burden could grow more costly as Japan, Hyundai’s biggest hybrid rival in the U.S., prepares to secure a reduced 15 percent tariff under its trade terms with Washington. Toyota and Honda already dominate the U.S. hybrid market with a combined 68 percent share, while Hyundai and Kia trail at 12.3 percent.

Industry analysts warn the risk of a price reversal is real: Kia’s Sportage Hybrid, priced at $30,290, could overtake Toyota’s $32,850 RAV4 Hybrid if tariffs raise its sticker price to nearly $38,000, leaving Hyundai at a competitive disadvantage.

Hyundai is expected to outline a revised North America hybrid strategy at its upcoming CEO Investor Day. Market watchers say the company must emphasize durability, parts distribution, and service networks to reassure investors — and to fend off Japanese rivals poised to consolidate their lead in a post-subsidy market.

Fleet deployment target is the largest announced to date for Advanced Modular Reactors in the U.K. and could generate at least $54 billion in economic activity, creating thousands of high-quality jobs.

Deployed new nuclear capacity is set to make a significant contribution to the next wave of clean, secure electricity and high temperature heat for industry and manufacturing.

Centrica plc (“Centrica”) and X-Energy, LLC (“X-energy”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC, today announced their entry into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) to deploy X-energy’s Xe-100 Advanced Modular Reactors (“AMR”) in the United Kingdom. The companies have identified EDF and Centrica’s Hartlepool site as the preferred first site for a planned U.K. fleet of up to 6 gigawatts.

The agreement represents the first stage in a new trans-Atlantic alliance which could ultimately mobilize at least $54 billion in economic value to bring clean, safe and affordable power to thousands of homes and industries across the country and substantive work for the domestic and global supply chain.

A 12-unit Xe-100 deployment at Hartlepool could add up to 960 megawatts (“MW”) of new capacity, enough clean power for 1.5 million homes and over $15 billion in lifetime economic value. It would be developed at a site adjacent to Hartlepool’s existing nuclear power station which is currently scheduled to cease generating electricity in 2028. Following its decommissioning, new reactors would accelerate opportunities for the site and its skilled workforce. The site is already designated for new nuclear under the Government’s National Policy Statement and a new plant would also play a critical role in generating high-temperature heat that could support Teesside’s heavy industries.

Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026. Subject to regulatory approval, the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are already in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica said:

“Centrica is proud to be at the forefront of Britain’s clean energy transition - investing in infrastructure and jobs that meet today’s energy needs while enabling tomorrow’s ambitions. Our partnership with X-energy marks a bold step forward in delivering advanced nuclear technology that is not only scalable and secure, but also vital to clean industry and powering homes. The Xe-100 fleet will help build a resilient energy system that supports national security, affordability, and sustainability. From Sizewell C to Hartlepool, we are backing Britain’s energy future - and building it.”

J. Clay Sell, CEO of X-energy said:

“Our partnership with Centrica represents a commitment to bring X-energy's industry-leading advanced nuclear technology to the U.K. at scale. Together, we aim to build a fleet that has the ability to reliably deliver clean power, strengthen energy security, and grow the trans-Atlantic economy for decades to come. We believe Hartlepool is the right place to begin this journey, with an established industry and a base of professionals and services who can help drive the next generation of nuclear forward.”

In 2021 the U.K.’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) identified High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising advanced technology for demonstration. In 2025 X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear completed a number of year-long assessments, co-funded by DESNZ’s ‘Future Nuclear Enabling Fund’, to support the commercial deployment of Xe-100s in the U.K. Discussions are now underway with Government regarding the “route to market” in the UK, consistent with the principles set out in June for supporting privately led projects. The Government’s ongoing work to create a clear and credible pathway is instrumental in making the UK an attractive destination for investment in advanced modular reactors. Support for initial projects, and those that follow, will be decisive in unlocking the full potential of advanced nuclear for Britain’s energy future.

U.K. Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said:

“This cross-Atlantic partnership demonstrates the transformative potential for the British people of US and UK businesses joining forces, with X-Energy and Centrica’s planned first project alone having the potential to create up to 2,500 good, skilled jobs, add £12 billion in economic value and generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes. By working with the US, we will reap the benefits of this golden age of nuclear, powering British homes with clean, homegrown energy, delivering well-paid skilled jobs and getting energy bills down for good.”

United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said:

“With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution. Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators. Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”

Simone Rossi, CEO of EDF in the UK, said:

“As part of its role to enable further new nuclear development in the UK, EDF welcomes the interest by Centrica and X-Energy in Hartlepool as the first site to develop this technology, and we will support the development plans as they evolve.”

Factors such as upfront costs and access to charging are among significant barriers to “mass adoption” of the technology, the AA said.

A survey by the motoring organisation indicated that some drivers are also concerned about battery health and the resale value of EVs.

The AA has launched an “EV readiness index” aimed at reflecting how practical and appealing EV ownership is.

Its initial rating of 47.5 out of 100 was based on factors such as:

– The average cost of a new EV across four models analysed being 27% higher than their petrol equivalents.

– Home charging being 22% more expensive per mile than petrol equivalents when the average cost of financing a home charger over a one-year period is included.

– Broken down EVs being more likely to be fixed at the roadside than petrol or diesel vehicles.

The index will be updated every three months.

The AA called for the Government to encourage more people to switch to electric motoring by considering targeted incentives for used EVs and reducing VAT for public on-street charging.

Edmund King, AA president, described the recently introduced electric car grant – which reduces the cost of some new EVs by up to £3,750 – as a “welcome boost” but warned “we need to go further to make EVs a realistic choice for all drivers”.

He said: “Drivers tell us they’re excited about going electric and they love the tech, but they’re also confused and cautious.

“Our index shows that upfront costs and charging access are still major concerns.

“Our polling also suggests battery health and resale values are still issues for some.

“Our index is an independent barometer of the issues that are either holding drivers back or propelling drivers to go electric.

“We are confident that the readiness rating will increase with more chargers, less expensive products, targeted incentives and better information.”

The Government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030.

Battery EVs held a 26.5% share of the new car market in August, which was the highest monthly level this year.

A total of 4.1% of all licensed cars in the UK were fully electric as of the end of March.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We recognise the nervousness of some drivers to go electric, which is why our electric car grant is slashing prices for consumers, giving drivers across the UK access to new electric cars for less – with 35 models now eligible.

“This £650 million scheme is helping families make the switch to cleaner cars while putting money back into the pockets of working people.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3.OTEaPbntJAY7yy93Gxgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/73e7302fe950e216d61bdaf2e8e5e9c8,N,,2025-09-14 19:59:51.297836

The money will bolster the Government’s UK SHORE programme for investing in low-carbon innovation for the maritime industry. This initiative was first launched in March 2022 with an initial budget of up to £206m.

A total of £240m has been allocated through the programme to date, benefitting 200 projects across the UK, including scientific research, factory trials, real-world demonstrations and commercial trials.

The Government claims the investment has also unlocked a further £110m in direct private investment.

Previously supported projects have included the installation of electric charging points at ports for vessels. These are now in place at Cammell Laird dry dock at Birkenhead in Liverpool and various locations across the South Coast and London.

UK SHORE has also supported innovations in low-carbon hydrogen production, ammonia and methanol-based fuels and wingsail attachments for boats.

Domestic transport accounts for around 28% of the UK’s terrestrial emissions footprint. Shipping accounts for around one-fifth of that.

Private investment

Further to the Department for Transport’s funding, the UK Government has confirmed that £700m of private investments will be confirmed on the first day of London International Shipping Week this Monday (15 September).

Peel Ports will invest £300m in modernising its Liverpool, Hunterston and Great Yarmouth ports. A further £150m has been pledged by the operators of the Port of Tyne, largely to accommodate new offshore wind and manufacturing facilities.

NatPower Marine will invest £250m in shore-side power in the UK, which it claims will support more than 2,000 skilled jobs in engineering, construction, and green technology services.

The announcements come shortly after the UK Government consulted on proposed changes to the planning process for ports. Ministers want to make it easier and faster for port owners and operators to expand in order to support nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs), like large offshore wind farms.

Following its decommissioning, new reactors would accelerate opportunities for the site and its skilled workforce. The site is already designated for new nuclear under the Government’s National Policy Statement and a new plant would also play a critical role in generating high-temperature heat that could support Teesside’s heavy industries.

Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026. Subject to regulatory approval, the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are already in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica said:

""Centrica is proud to be at the forefront of Britain’s clean energy transition - investing in infrastructure and jobs that meet today’s energy needs while enabling tomorrow’s ambitions. Our partnership with X-energy marks a bold step forward in delivering advanced nuclear technology that is not only scalable and secure, but also vital to clean industry and powering homes. The Xe-100 fleet will help build a resilient energy system that supports national security, affordability, and sustainability. From Sizewell C to Hartlepool, we are backing Britain’s energy future - and building it.""

J. Clay Sell, CEO of X-energy said:

""Our partnership with Centrica represents a commitment to bring X-energy's industry-leading advanced nuclear technology to the U.K. at scale. Together, we aim to build a fleet that has the ability to reliably deliver clean power, strengthen energy security, and grow the trans-Atlantic economy for decades to come. We believe Hartlepool is the right place to begin this journey, with an established industry and a base of professionals and services who can help drive the next generation of nuclear forward.""

In 2021 the U.K.’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) identified High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising advanced technology for demonstration. In 2025 X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear completed a number of year-long assessments, co-funded by DESNZ’s ‘Future Nuclear Enabling Fund’, to support the commercial deployment of Xe-100s in the U.K. Discussions are now underway with Government regarding the ""route to market"" in the UK, consistent with the principles set out in June for supporting privately led projects. The Government’s ongoing work to create a clear and credible pathway is instrumental in making the UK an attractive destination for investment in advanced modular reactors. Support for initial projects, and those that follow, will be decisive in unlocking the full potential of advanced nuclear for Britain’s energy future.

U.K. Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said:

""This cross-Atlantic partnership demonstrates the transformative potential for the British people of US and UK businesses joining forces, with X-Energy and Centrica’s planned first project alone having the potential to create up to 2,500 good, skilled jobs, add £12 billion in economic value and generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes. By working with the US, we will reap the benefits of this golden age of nuclear, powering British homes with clean, homegrown energy, delivering well-paid skilled jobs and getting energy bills down for good.""

United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said:

""With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution. Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators. Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.""

Simone Rossi, CEO of EDF in the UK, said:

""As part of its role to enable further new nuclear development in the UK, EDF welcomes the interest by Centrica and X-Energy in Hartlepool as the first site to develop this technology, and we will support the development plans as they evolve.""

""It's really important that remote communities get a say in where their power comes from,"" Mr Schoenemann adds.
In Djarindjin, his company Amboranj Power is building a solar and battery power station, which will be locally- and publicly-owned.
For her, making sure remote residents have access to reliable, renewable power is about energy justice and equity.
""We've got technology that could really help lower people's energy costs,"" she notes.","Dark, rolling skies always trigger memories of disaster for Kathleen Walker.

She was one of 300 residents evacuated by helicopter from Wujal Wujal, in Queensland's far north, as Tropical Cyclone Jasper crossed the coast unleashing unprecedented floods in December 2023.

""When I see black clouds, I still have a trauma,"" she tells AAP.

Her community was left without power and unable to return to their homes for months.

Being away from home took a toll on the tight-knit group of residents yet it was also the eventual catalyst in fulfilling their decades-long dream of launching Wujal Wujal's own solar microgrid and battery system.

The project was an idea that had come from her husband and uncle some 20 years earlier, Ms Walker says.

They had both wanted to bring renewable energy to the small community as it had long struggled through power outages and other reliability issues.

Ms Walker says the microgrid will alleviate some of the still existing anxiety about being left without power.

""I am so proud and I am so glad that I get to see this thing go ahead,"" she says.

Richard Schoenemann has been working with Wujal Wujal since 2019 to make its dream a reality.

His company, Volt Advisory, needed to consult closely with the local Jabalbina Corporation and Elders to develop the project, he says, because they knew what they needed.

""It's really important that remote communities get a say in where their power comes from,"" Mr Schoenemann adds.

""It will actually work out better in the long run.""

Community is also at the heart of what Bard man Patrick Greechan is doing in Western Australia's Kimberley region.

In Djarindjin, his company Amboranj Power is building a solar and battery power station, which will be locally- and publicly-owned.

Aalga Goorlil, known as the sun turtle project, aims to lower costs, emissions and dependence on non-renewable energy.

""Renewables are a great vehicle to create financial security so that these communities can then pick which way the benefits go,"" Mr Greechan says.

""They can give themselves cheaper power, they can pay themselves in dividends, they can use the income to create other projects for the community, purchase other assets.""

He is also working on a solar and battery system for health clinic in Warburton, a remote Indigenous community on the Great Central Road, just south of the Gibson Desert.

It suffered 13 power outages in 2024 alone, impacting dialysis machines and emergency room facilities.

As Australia finds itself in a renewable energy boom, Mr Greechan reckons it's important isolated communities are empowered to decide what is best for them.

That's why he launched Amboranj, to make sure the people of the Kimberley aren't left behind and do have a voice in the projects developed on their Country.

""Any entities wishing to go into this space, need to understand that this is the opportunity to create economic prosperity,"" he says.

""If they could look at that versus their bottom line it saves the government, saves the taxpayer and creates so much ownership and pride within the community.""

Jaru and Gidja woman Ruby Heard, says as companies start to develop renewables in remote Australia, it's also important to make sure residents are educated about what might be best for them.

""There's predatory installers that go out to remote places, Indigenous communities and they are trying to sell second-rate technologies at high prices into to our households,"" she warns.

""It's, it's preying on people and they're not always aware that the technology is not leading technology and that the costs are too high.""

Ms Heard started Alinga Energy Consulting after volunteering for engineers without borders, building microgrids in communities Ethiopia without access to reliable energy.

She realised many remote communities in Australia could also benefit and were often being excluded from innovations like rooftop solar due to cost and distance.

For her, making sure remote residents have access to reliable, renewable power is about energy justice and equity.

""We've got technology that could really help lower people's energy costs,"" she notes.

""What we're finding is these benefits are being really unequally distributed because it's very cost-driven and for people living in remote areas, the costs are higher to get them connected.""

The bottom line for First Nations Clean Energy Network co-chair Karrina Nolan, is everyone deserves access to power and every community should have homes that are climate resilient.

Remote settlements across the country are making strides in renewables; getting involved in solar, wind, battery and hydro power projects while advocating for policy changes and funding to ensure the best possible outcomes for First Nations people.

While welcoming the federal government's commitments to implementing the First Nations Clean Energy Strategy, Ms Nolan says there's more work to be done to get the transition right.

""Some of our communities are living in extremely vulnerable conditions,"" she says.

""This is an opportunity to retrofit these households, upgrade them, get energy efficient appliances into them, put solar on the roof or next door in a microgrid.

""That makes them climate resilient, cheaper, more livable and cuts a whole heap of social and health costs.""",https://cdn.nit.com.au/storage/6YkcdWTmTb7gBBJLU0RVt36PCLU1I80p3ISJvD01.jpg?size=featured,N,,2025-09-14 18:59:57.965457

The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies.
This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.
The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.
""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement.","The Trump administration has unveiled a pilot program to accelerate the use of electric air taxis, a move aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in airspace technology.

The Department of Transportation on Friday said the Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop ""new frameworks and regulations for enabling safe operations"" and form partnerships with private sector companies as well as with state and local governments.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement on Friday. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. That means more high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity.""

The program will include at least five pilot projects and will run for three years after the first project is up and running, the department said. The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies. The aircraft will also be used to test their effectiveness in emergency situations, such as airlift and medical transport.

The program would allow the testing of aircraft both unmanned and piloted, and which may be capable of carrying passengers, before they complete FAA certification, a process that can take years. Aircraft must have FAA certification before carrying cargo or passengers when flying commercially, according to federal regulations.

This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.

In June 2023, the FAA greenlit a plan from Joby Aviation, a California-based aviation company, to begin test flights of an electric flying taxi prototype. The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.

""We've spent more than 15 years building the aircraft technology and operational capabilities that are defining advanced aerial mobility, and we're ready to bring our services to communities,"" Joby's chief policy officer Greg Bowles said in a statement. ""We look forward to demonstrating our aircraft's maturity and delivering early operations in cities and states nationwide.""

Another company, Archer Aviation, also said Friday that it plans to participate in the program.

""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement. ""These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.""

The FAA said it is accepting proposals and a minimum of five participants will be selected, according to an unpublished federal notice about the program that is set to become public on Tuesday.

Failing to take action to cut transport emissions in this way could see Australia miss its 2050 net-zero target, Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Julie Delvecchio said.
The findings showed the tax cut was making electric cars accessible to a wider group of people, National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association chief executive Rohan Martin said, including workers who would not have otherwise been able to switch from a petrol or diesel car.
“The electric car discount is popular with families on middle incomes who live in the outer suburbs,” he said.
The federal tax cut and state-based registration discounts should be replaced, the commission said, by greater support for car-charging infrastructure.","The modelling comes after the Productivity Commission called on the federal government to scrap the tax break, calling it a duplicative and expensive policy.

It also follows national debate over the introduction of a road-user tax to be levied on electric vehicle drivers, and after several states, including NSW, Victoria and Queensland, removed rebates for their purchase.

The research, prepared by Magenta Advisory, investigated the fringe-benefits tax exemption introduced in July 2022 that cut the price of electric cars purchased through novated leases.

It found the tax cut could help to put an additional 1.5 million electric cars on Australian roads if extended until 2035, and had already aided in the purchase of 105,000 more EVs between 2022 and 2024.

An additional 200,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles could hit the roads in Australia by 2035 if they were allowed back into the scheme, the modelling found, and could contribute to a growing second-hand market by adding 870,000 low-emission cars.

Allowing the scheme to run until 2035 would also cut transport emissions by 50 per cent more than if the tax exemption was removed in 2027 when it is due to be reviewed, the report said.

Failing to take action to cut transport emissions in this way could see Australia miss its 2050 net-zero target, Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Julie Delvecchio said.

“With transport on track to be Australia’s largest emitting sector, incentives like the EV discount are critical to hitting our climate goals,” she said.

“Keeping this support until 2035 and bringing back plug-in hybrids into the scheme could deliver hundreds of thousands more new and second-hand EVs, making them affordable for more households.”

Electric car purchases under the scheme had been most popular in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane suburbs between 30km and 44km outside city centres, the analysis found, and to drivers on incomes between $90,000 and $120,000.

The findings showed the tax cut was making electric cars accessible to a wider group of people, National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association chief executive Rohan Martin said, including workers who would not have otherwise been able to switch from a petrol or diesel car.

“The electric car discount is popular with families on middle incomes who live in the outer suburbs,” he said.

The findings come despite a proposal from a Productivity Commission report to scrap the tax break, which it said had cost taxpayers between $1000 and $20,000 per tonne of carbon emissions abated.

With EV adoption on the rise and regulatory scrutiny intensifying, insurers and policyholders alike are navigating uncharted territory.","Auto insurance in Michigan—and across the nation—has always been a hot topic, but recent events and new data are pushing it right back into the spotlight. On September 12, 2025, CURE Auto Insurance, a New Jersey-based insurer, agreed to pay a Troy, Michigan man $75,000 for a claim on his wrecked 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee. This payout came only after the company initially denied the claim, canceled his policy, auctioned off the SUV, and kept the proceeds, according to reporting by The Detroit News.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The same day, Anita Fox, director of the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services, issued a strongly worded bulletin warning insurers against what she called ""improper"" and ""abusive practices."" While Fox's bulletin didn't name specific companies, the timing and details echoed the very practices CURE Auto Insurance is accused of in the Troy man's case and in other lawsuits. Fox's message was clear: ""Insurers must not engage in practices that harm or disadvantage consumers when handling claims.""

Fox's bulletin outlined a laundry list of unacceptable behaviors, including denying valid claims, canceling policies without adequate justification, and profiting from the sale of claimants' vehicles after denial. These practices, she noted, violate not just the letter but the spirit of Michigan's insurance regulations, which are designed to protect policyholders from unfair treatment. ""We are committed to holding insurers accountable when they fail to treat Michigan consumers fairly,"" Fox stated.

The CURE case has become a flashpoint for broader concerns. The company is currently being sued for similar alleged improper practices in other claims, and the spotlight from state regulators is only growing brighter. For many Michigan drivers, especially those who rely on their vehicles for daily life, these revelations are deeply unsettling. After all, when you pay your premiums faithfully, you expect your insurer to have your back in a crisis—not to pull the rug out from under you.

But the story doesn't end with individual disputes. Michigan's insurance market is facing another, perhaps even more dramatic, shift—one that's affecting drivers far beyond the state's borders. According to a recent report from Insurify, as highlighted by GOBankingRates on September 14, 2025, premiums for electric vehicle (EV) drivers have soared by 16 percent in the last year alone. On average, EV owners are now paying $4,058 annually for coverage—about 49 percent more than their gas-powered counterparts, who pay roughly $2,732 per year.

Why the dramatic difference? Insurify points to the higher costs associated with repairing and replacing EVs. These vehicles, while often touted as the future of transportation, come with expensive parts and specialized labor requirements. That means when accidents happen, insurers are on the hook for bigger payouts—and those costs are being passed along to consumers in the form of higher premiums.

Not every EV is created equal when it comes to insurance costs, though. Insurify's data reveals that several popular models stand out for their particularly steep premiums. The Tesla Model X, for example, is the priciest to insure, with an annual cost of $4,765. Its gas-powered counterpart, the Audi Q3, costs $2,889 to insure—a difference of nearly 65 percent. The Model X's luxury status and advanced features, like its iconic falcon-wing doors, certainly play a role in driving up those numbers.

Even the more affordable Tesla Model 3, which starts at $44,130 according to Kelley Blue Book, carries a hefty insurance bill: $4,546 per year. That's 21 percent more than its gas-powered alternative, the Mercedes-Benz A-Class, which costs $3,592 to insure. And while the Model Y is less expensive to insure than the Model X or S, its insurance cost of $4,189 is still about 44 percent higher than the Audi Q5's $2,915. Interestingly, the Model Y also has a claims frequency of 29.47 percent, compared to just 5.22 percent for the Model S, according to data cited by Insurify from auto insights company Mitchell. That's a staggering difference and a key factor in the higher premiums.

It's not just Tesla drivers feeling the pinch. The Cadillac Lyriq, another luxury EV, costs $3,752 per year to insure compared to $2,671 for its gas-powered sibling, the Cadillac XT5—a 29 percent jump. The Hyundai Ioniq 5, which has won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy Award in the EV class for two years running, isn't immune either. Its insurance cost is $3,503, about 34 percent more than the Hyundai Kona, its gas-powered alternative, at $2,621.

The reasons for these disparities are complex. As Insurify explained, ""Premiums reflect the risk and expense of paying out claims."" With EVs, the risk profile is different: batteries are costly to replace, repairs require specialized technicians, and even minor accidents can lead to expensive fixes. For insurers, that means higher potential losses—and for drivers, it means higher bills.

For many consumers, these rising costs are forcing tough choices. Some may reconsider the financial wisdom of going electric, despite the environmental benefits and potential long-term savings on fuel and maintenance. Others might be tempted to cut back on coverage or shop aggressively for better rates, hoping to find an insurer willing to take a chance on their EV at a more reasonable price.

Meanwhile, Michigan regulators are under pressure to ensure that all drivers—whether they're behind the wheel of a gas-guzzler or a cutting-edge EV—are treated fairly. Fox's bulletin, while not naming specific companies, sends a strong message to the industry: ""We will not tolerate practices that disadvantage Michigan consumers."" For insurers, it's a warning shot across the bow. For consumers, it's a glimmer of hope that someone is watching out for their interests.

As the auto insurance landscape continues to evolve, one thing is certain: the stakes are higher than ever. With EV adoption on the rise and regulatory scrutiny intensifying, insurers and policyholders alike are navigating uncharted territory. The coming months will reveal whether companies like CURE—and the industry as a whole—can adapt to these new realities while keeping trust with the drivers who depend on them.

For now, Michigan drivers—and EV owners nationwide—are left to weigh their options carefully, hoping that the next time they need their insurance, their insurer will be there for them, not just in the fine print, but in practice.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-09-14 21:59:58.527091

The US (about 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action.","The scale of the Albanese government’s climate action ambition for the next decade will be set this week with the anticipated release of its 2035 emissions reduction target.

The target is one of several expected announcements revealing the “scary” risks posed by the climate crisis, what the government intends to do, and how.

Climate risks

The first announcement, expected on Monday, will be the release of the national climate risk assessment, a long-promised analysis of the economic and environmental risks posed by the climate crisis.

People familiar with it have said it is “intense and scary”, and confronting even for those who work in the area. It will be accompanied by a national climate adaptation plan, a high-level framework for managing a changing climate.

Developed by the Australian Climate Service and the climate change department, work on the risk assessment has included highly detailed modelling of future damage, estimates of the number of people who could be killed by worsening heatwaves and development of a mapping tool that forecasts flooding risk in suburbs across the continent.

Sources say that under some scenarios, even major systems – such as electricity networks, transport routes, food production and the financial sector – could struggle to cope.

Cutting emissions

The biggest announcement will be the government’s 2035 emissions reduction target, expected on Thursday or Friday after cabinet signoff.

Like the risk assessment, this has been significantly delayed. It was initially promised by February but postponed until after the May election as the government waited on advice from the Climate Change Authority, a government agency chaired by former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean.

The government is expected to announce the target at the same time it releases a barrage of reports, including the Climate Change Authority’s target advice, a plan to reach net zero by 2050 and an analysis of what can be done to cut pollution in six sectors of the economy, including electricity and energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land, resources and the built environment.

New policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be unveiled alongside the new goal, which would build on the government’s 2030 target of a 43% reduction on 2005 levels.

The latest annual emissions projections, published in November, suggest the government is on track to hit 42.6% – just shy of the legislated target.

Setting targets

The 2035 target matters not just in Australia, but internationally. It will be submitted to the UN as part of the country’s “nationally determined contribution” – what the government says it can do to help the world meet goals in the 2015 Paris agreement. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has indicated Australia is likely to submit a range rather than a single number.

The Paris deal includes a commitment that the target must be more ambitious than the existing 2030 goal – there can be no backsliding – and reflect the country’s “highest possible ambition”. The Climate Change Authority released a consultation paper in April 2024 with its preliminary assessment, finding a cut of at least 65% and up to 75% “would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”.

Since then, the authority has been consulting with experts and interest groups and has undertaken modelling to refine its advice. It is understood its board – including scientists and business figures – reached its final position last week, and the report is yet to go to government.

The authority is required to consider what the best scientific advice says Australia should be doing to keep alive the goal of trying to limit global heating to 1.5C since preindustrial times. It should also consider the international political and diplomatic landscape, the economics of what’s possible, the pace of technological development and what is considered socially deliverable.

From a scientific view, analyses have found Australia should make a percentage cut of somewhere between the high 70s to 100% – actually reaching net zero – by 2035. Australia’s Pacific island neighbours have also stressed the need for their more developed friend to be as ambitious as possible – and to stop approving new fossil fuel developments.

Some of these analyses – including by the thinktank Climate Analytics and the Australian Conservation Foundation – have detailed estimates of how cuts could be made to meet a target of at least 75%. Climate campaigners generally believe the target range must include 75% to be credible.

But other experts, such as Frank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy, have argued that even a target of 65% would be ambitious, given it would require pollution to be effectively cut in half over the next decade. He argues that new policies behind the target are ultimately more important than the number.

Business organisations are politically influential and vary markedly in their positions. One group of about 500 that includes Fortescue, Atlassian, Ikea and Unilever has argued strongly for 75%. Others have emphasised the cost of action and pitched for a goal in the 50s.

The Business Council of Australia issued a veiled warning about setting a target in the 60s or 70s, publishing modelling suggesting between $395bn and $530bn of capital investment would be needed.

International action

The picture across developed countries is mixed. The US (about 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action. The UK has a 2035 goal equivalent to a 78% cut below 2005 levels, and the EU is expected to land in the 70s. But Canada and New Zealand have set much lower goals (45-50% and 51-55% respectively).

As an emerging economy, China – the world’s biggest national polluter – has not yet set targets on the scale of those nations that developed earlier. Its current goal is that its pollution will peak by 2030.

Some analyses suggest that may have already happened as it builds extraordinary amounts of renewable energy and uses less coal power (even as it continues to build new plants). There is a lot of focus ahead of the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November on what Beijing will promise to do by 2035.

In an interview last week, Bowen pointed to a 2021 calculation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that suggested global emissions needed to be cut by 60% between 2019 and 2035 to keep the 1.5C goal on the table. That translates to a 68% cut below 2005 levels – the baseline used by Australia.

But global heating has accelerated since then and 68% is a planet-wide average. Developed countries such as Australia would have to do more.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98031c4650d3ed0623532c713bcc53a1dac6015f/0_0_3207_2567/master/3207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77c404808207b883212dad60f549971d",N,,2025-09-14 16:59:08.568476

The legislation was announced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Senate President pro Tempore Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas on Sept. 10.

AB 825, authored by Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, Senator Josh Becker, and Speaker Robert Rivas, “preserves California’s control over critical policy functions — including transmission planning and procurement — while unlocking the benefits of broader regional cooperation: greater grid reliability, reduced blackout risk, more affordable clean power, and lower emissions,” a news release from Becker’s office said.

Recent amendments to AB 825 “include rigorous annual legislative oversight by relevant California legislative policy committees to ensure the new market operates in line with California’s clean energy and reliability goals. The bill also provides strong protections for state authority, including California’s right to withdraw at any time if participation ceases to benefit the state,” the news release said.

“By enabling least-cost dispatch across a broader pool of Western resources, the Pathways Initiative is expected to save California ratepayers up to $10 billion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Brattle Group,” Becker’s office said. “California will also reduce the costs of maintaining a state-specific strategic reliability reserve by pooling resources with other participating areas.”

The California ISO said that the “bill establishes a clear path toward independent governance for the West's interconnected electric grid. This milestone was shaped by years of successful regional collaboration and the proven success of our Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM), which has delivered more than $7.41 billion in cumulative savings since launch in 2014,” it said.

As the Pathways Committee develops the framework for the new regional organization, “we will coordinate closely to ensure alignment with legislative requirements. We remain fully committed to the successful launch of our Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) in 2026 and will offer technical support throughout this important transition,” the grid operator said.

Becker’s office said that key safeguards in AB 825 include:

• Maintaining California ISO’s role in planning for and operating California’s grid.

• Ensuring that governance of the new market respects state procurement, environmental, reliability, and other public policies.

• Providing the CPUC and other stakeholders with access to critical market data.

• Protecting California’s ability to withdraw from the regional market at any time.

Wildfire Funds (SB 254)

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/7e5595a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7547x4245+0+448/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F32%2F32%2Fad74d8e809b04ee8d202675b6393%2F2183a975fede4e5bbfd309f8aa660def,N,,2025-09-14 16:59:13.121616

The state’s Oil Conservation Division (OCD) recently posted proposed rules, along with a regulatory “crosswalk” comparing the draft rules to existing federal requirements, as part of its application to the EPA for Class VI primacy.

Under the proposed rules, amendments passed in House Bill 457 (2025 Regular Session) would strengthen the state’s legal authority to regulate permitting, monitoring, corrective action, and public engagement. Public comments are being accepted through September 26, 2025 (details here), and a stakeholder workshop is scheduled for October 9.

New Mexico on track to join Class VI well club

If approved, New Mexico will join a small but growing group of states that already hold primacy for Class VI wells used for carbon storage. States with full authority at this point include North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, and West Virginia.

Arizona has also just been granted Class VI primacy by the EPA. Other states—including Texas, Colorado, Utah, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Alaska—are in various earlier stages of rulemaking or pre-application activity.

New Mexico’s efforts reflect both growing urgency and complexity in the regulation of carbon capture and storage: ensuring that state rules are at least as protective as federal regulations, managing public participation, and setting up monitoring and enforcement regimes.

Utilities have reported a 45% reduction in outages by using LiDAR and AI modeling for vegetation management.","Vegetation is a much-needed part of the natural world and is essential for life to thrive on Earth. Yet, when unmanaged, it’s also one of the greatest threats to the grid and a leading culprit for causing outages. Fallen branches topple powerlines, roots damage underground cables, and overgrown trees close to energized wires are known to ignite catastrophic wildfires.

The consequences are enormous. Power outages hit Americans with a $150-billion bill every year, based on Department of Energy numbers, and vegetation issues are behind a lot of those costs.

Just two years ago, a devastating wildfire hit Maui, killing 102 people and destroying 2,200 structures. Sparks from damaged utility lines re-energized unexpectedly, setting nearby vegetation on fire. This is a devastating reminder of the difficult balance utilities must strike between keeping the lights on and protecting public safety.

Historically, utilities have used routine trimming and in-person inspections to manage vegetation. But with labor shortages, rising costs, and wildfire risk increasing, they now need to evolve into risk-based vegetation management.

AI alongside drones and LiDAR (light detection and ranging), provide visibility, predictive modeling, and automation. This empowers utilities to reduce risks, cut costs, and maintain compliance, all while mitigating outages and keeping the power on.

The Vegetation Challenge

Vegetation may seem like a simple problem to solve, but in practice it’s one of the most persistent threats to reliable power delivery. Fast-growing species grow towards overhead conductors, and storms, heavy winds and ice cause branches to snap, igniting wildfires, taking down power lines and triggering widespread outages. And the industry has been grappling with this issue for decades. With extreme weather causing more frequent wildfires, the industry must adopt AI to protect the grid and serve its ratepayers.

Yet traditional approaches are not working. Ground crews may spend weeks patrolling remote corridors on foot or by truck, only to cover a fraction of the system. Helicopter inspections expand coverage areas but bring considerable safety concerns and hefty price tags. And more than half of utilities admit their vegetation management funding doesn’t match operational requirements.

The situation, therefore, becomes even more problematic. Vegetation threats are growing while the money to address them keeps shrinking. AI presents an opportunity to bridge this gap.

How LiDAR and AI Can Drive Smarter, Safer Vegetation Strategies

Utilities have long needed to supplement manual inspection with technology like satellite imagery, aerial surveys, and, more recently, drones. Yet the real breakthrough comes when high-resolution LiDAR data is combined with AI, transforming raw images into actionable business insights.

Clarity of Data Collection: LiDAR technology allows utilities to survey vast areas and infrastructure in weeks by creating detailed 3D point clouds capturing vegetation density, tree height, and encroachment risks with centimeter-level accuracy. Manual patrols simply can’t match this. And the data stays objective and repeatable and avoids human error or fatigue. This removes significant pressure from manpower constraints, eliminating the need for crews to spend days on manual inspections.

AI Modeling of Data: AI and ML algorithms review and analyze LiDAR data to detect vegetation encroachment, tree health issues, and potential hazards in high-risk areas. Rotting trees create serious risks for power lines during intense storms and high winds, for instance. Utilities can use LiDAR-based modeling to identify problematic trees, then quickly dispatch teams to safely remove them—this reduces future outage risks.

Via a combination of data from past vegetation growth, weather, and up-to-date field insights, LiDAR and AI-driven modeling, can predict future issues. For example, the AI system flags areas where fast-growing trees will likely extend onto transmission and/or distribution lines, causing outages in future storms. This gives utilities sufficient data and time for proactive tree trimming crew scheduling rather than waiting for outages or fire risks during storms or natural vegetation growth.

Fixed Cycle to Risk-Based Scheduling

Traditionally, utilities trim vegetation on fixed cycles. For instance, trim trees every three or five years, regardless of actual risk. Instead of trimming every mile of line on a fixed schedule, utilities can use AI risk models to target the most vulnerable corridors. With crews attending to the most risk-prone areas first, this supports risk-based scheduling. This targeted approach reduces outage risk, lowers wildfire exposure, and improves compliance with regulatory clearance standards. And as importantly, this approach saves money: avoiding routine trimming where it isn’t needed and reallocating funds to high-risk zones.

Centralizing Data: On top of its exceptional modeling capabilities, when utilities leverage an AI platform, it provides a centralized location for all data. When teams continuously gather information from the field like photos and sensor readings, they can be documented and stored in a centralized system, creating a single source of truth for decision-making, accessible to all. Combining field data collected on a continuous basis with LiDAR data gathered on an annual basis provides a powerful dataset for modeling.

This “single source of truth” creates a living digital twin of the network and enhances audit readiness, regulatory reporting, and cross-department collaboration. Instead of sifting through fragmented spreadsheets and inspection notes, decision-makers see a unified risk picture across the grid.

Implementation Considerations: AI may sound like the magic bullet for utilities in their efforts to get vegetation management under control, but it takes some thoughtful planning to implement AI safely and successfully.

AI Integration: One of the first hurdles utilities face when adopting LiDAR and AI is making it work with their existing utility management systems. Most utilities have a patchwork of tools, including outage management systems, GIS mapping, SCADA monitoring, and asset management platforms that don’t ‘talk’ to each other.

Integrating AI so its recommendations flow directly into existing workflows is a must. AI should be able to automatically create a maintenance ticket, update the asset database, and alert the right teams for follow-up actions when it spots a risky stretch of power lines. All of this must be completed without manual data entry, along with the ability for human intervention.

The way to make this happen is by building a robust data pipeline:

Bringing in data from LiDAR, drones, satellites, and field crews.

Cleaning and standardizing that data so it’s usable.

Storing the data in an organized and consistent way.

Running AI models to turn raw data into prioritized, actionable insights.

When done right, integration allows AI to become part of the utility’s daily operations, helping crews respond faster and budgets stretch further.

Staff Training and Operational Changes

Even the best AI system won’t make an impact if people don’t know how to use it. Vegetation management crews, dispatchers, and planners need training not just on the software but on how to interpret and trust AI-driven recommendations.

For success, utilities need to appoint change management leaders to organize the training and control the AI rollout. Hands-on training for AI literacy, clear communication about “why” the shift is happening, and a phased adoption so staff don’t feel overwhelmed will all assist in an easier transition. In practice, this looks like an AI pilot program used to prioritize inspections in one region, allowing teams to feel confident and comfortable before scaling company-wide.

Utilities have to stretch tightened budgets to maintain the millions of miles that make up utilities infrastructure across the U.S., but leaning on manual inspection is not feasible or efficient. Integrating LiDAR and AI solutions smartly and safely can help utilities reduce risks, improve compliance, and shift from reactive to proactive vegetation management.

Regulatory and Security Considerations

Utilities face compliance obligations under North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards. AI tools can strengthen audit readiness by providing timestamped, geolocated evidence of vegetation clearances.

At the same time, centralizing sensitive data introduces cybersecurity risks. Utilities must ensure robust protections for cloud storage, mobile field devices, and AI platforms.

Financial Justification: Convincing utility executives to invest in AI requires more than technical promise. It requires financial justification. Fortunately, there’s compelling potential for the return on investment.

UReduced inspection costs: LiDAR and AI analysis can cover in weeks what might take boots-on-the-ground crews months and years.

Lower outage costs: Preventing even a single wildfire or large-scale outage can save hundreds of millions, even billions in potential liabilities and fines. Utilities have reported a 45% reduction in outages by using LiDAR and AI modeling for vegetation management.

Improved compliance: Automated reporting reduces manual effort and audit penalties.

Optimized trimming cycles: Targeted risk-based scheduling saves money by trimming only where needed.

Early adopters have seen inspection cost reductions of 30 to 50%, in addition to saving millions annually in avoided emergency response. As AI models mature and data volumes grow, these savings are likely to accelerate.

Unmanaged vegetation is a persistent and costly challenge for utilities. AI and LiDAR can help utilities shift to a proactive approach to managing vegetation. With a technology-forward approach utilities can manage risk, stretch budgets farther, improve compliance and reliability, and enhance resilience.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vegetation-management-wildfire.png,N,,2025-09-14 14:58:43.043596

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.everythinglubbock.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2025/09/68c5fc4a93f3e4.61868730.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 12:03:37.003165

Brett Christophers has put his finger on an uncomfortable truth. Renewable energy has reached the point where it is often cheaper to generate than fossil fuels, yet the rate of investment is still far below what climate targets demand. His book, The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the Planet, explains why.

Investors follow profit, not need, and renewables are structured in a way that turns falling costs into falling revenues. Solar panels and wind turbines produce power at near zero marginal cost, so competition drives prices down. That is good for consumers and good for emissions, but it makes for wafer-thin profit margins that are not attractive to capital looking for steady, high returns. Fossil fuels by contrast remain in many cases more profitable because their scarcity can be controlled and their markets are designed to reward incumbents. Christophers’ conclusion is stark. If profitability is the bottleneck, then leaving the transition to private capital will not work at the speed required. The state must take on a far larger role.

The core of his argument is hard to dispute. If companies and financiers do not see an acceptable return, they will not deploy capital. He documents how even record low bids for renewable projects have been followed by cancellations or pleas for more support when inflation or supply chain pressures squeeze margins. He reminds readers that what has been built so far has leaned heavily on subsidies, tax credits, or guaranteed contracts, not on free market enthusiasm. Without that scaffolding, private developers walk away. It is a useful correction to the triumphalist narrative that renewables will sweep the board simply because they are cheaper on paper.

Christophers’ prescription for action is that governments must move beyond reliance on markets and take a leading role by building and owning renewable infrastructure themselves, or through public utilities and agencies. Where private developers are involved, he insists that the state must guarantee returns through long-term contracts, subsidies, or price supports that stabilize revenues.

He frames electricity as a public good ill-suited to volatile spot markets and better managed through planned, coordinated investment in generation, grids, and storage. In short, he calls for a decisive expansion of state leadership and ownership, with private capital relegated to a supporting role under strict public frameworks, on the grounds that only by bending or bypassing the logic of profit can the transition proceed at the pace the climate crisis demands. Basically, he calls for socializing electrical generation and removing markets from the equation.

However, credible critics have pointed out that the story is not quite that simple. Renewable profitability varies by technology, geography, and market design. A rooftop solar installation in Germany is a different investment proposition than offshore wind in the North Sea or utility-scale solar in Texas. Many economists note that market design can be reshaped to stabilize revenues. Contracts for difference, long-term power purchase agreements, and capacity payments already exist in many jurisdictions and have drawn in billions of dollars of private capital. Others stress that non-financial bottlenecks such as lengthy permitting, overloaded interconnection queues, and grid congestion slow the pace of deployment even when investment appetite is strong. Christophers is right to highlight profit as a barrier, but it is not the only brake on progress.

There are also fair cautions about his solution. Public ownership can deliver long-term capacity, but state-run utilities have mixed track records, and governments face their own constraints, from budget limits to political interference.

The real question is not whether capitalism must be abandoned but how far it must be bent to public purpose. History offers a guide. Almost every major infrastructure build in the past century combined public rule-setting with private execution. Railroads, highways, telecommunications networks, and electricity grids were all made possible by government interventions that made them investable. The clean energy transition will be no different. The challenge is to design frameworks that unlock capital while ensuring deployment at the necessary pace.

One tool is market design that ensures adequate returns. Electricity markets that rely on energy-only spot prices expose renewable projects to extreme volatility. When the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, prices collapse, sometimes to zero or even negative, and investors cannot rely on a steady cash flow. That makes banks reluctant to lend without charging a high premium. Instruments like contracts for difference in the UK solve this by guaranteeing a fixed price for generation over 15 to 20 years. Developers bid competitively, which keeps costs down for consumers, but they know exactly what revenue they will earn, which makes projects financeable.

Long-term corporate power purchase agreements play a similar role, although Christophers notes that large buyers often negotiate very low rates that squeeze developers. Capacity markets and ancillary service payments can also provide steady income for being available to the grid, not just for producing power in a given hour. These tools stabilize cash flows and lower the cost of capital, which is critical for capital intensive technologies like wind and solar.

Another tool is public support for finance. Governments can use green banks, loan guarantees, or co-investment funds to take on part of the risk that deters private lenders. A green bank providing low interest loans, or a public entity taking the first loss in a project portfolio, can make the difference between a renewable project being bankable or shelved. The Inflation Reduction Act in the United States was an example of public money creating private profitability. Generous tax credits and direct payments made clean energy projects attractive to investors, and as a result the pipeline of solar, wind, and battery plants expanded dramatically. This is capitalism with a thumb on the scale, and it shows that policy can shift capital quickly when it aligns profits with climate goals.

There is also a role for direct public investment in infrastructure the market will not build on time. Transmission lines, interconnectors, and large-scale storage are expensive, slow to permit, and often unprofitable for private firms to build on their own. Yet without them, renewable projects remain stranded. Governments can and should take the lead on these backbone elements, whether by funding them outright or by creating regulated monopoly frameworks that guarantee returns. The payoff is that private developers can then connect new projects without prohibitive delays. Public ownership is justified in these cases because the social value of expanded grids and storage far exceeds the private return.

Carbon pricing and clean energy standards are additional levers. By making fossil fuels more expensive or mandating a rising share of renewables in electricity supply, governments tilt the economics decisively. A robust carbon price or an enforceable renewable portfolio standard creates predictable demand for clean power. That demand, in turn, gives investors confidence that their projects will have a market. These policies are not without political difficulty, but they are well within the toolkit of capitalist economies.

Reducing soft costs is another area where policy can raise effective returns without raising consumer bills. Every month cut from permitting timelines or interconnection delays improves the net present value of a project. Standardized contracts, transparent grid data, and faster regulatory processes all contribute to making renewables more attractive investments. This is not about subsidies or public ownership, but about making the system function more efficiently.

There are selective cases where public ownership makes sense. Grid infrastructure is one. Repowering old coal sites with renewables where transmission already exists is another. Early stage offshore wind zones or large storage projects may also benefit from public build-own-operate models, especially if private capital is hesitant. The key is to ensure such ventures are governed transparently, with clear mandates to deliver reliable, low-cost clean power, not to serve as political tools.

Evidence from around the world supports this blended approach. The UK’s offshore wind boom was driven by contracts for difference that de-risked investment. The United States is seeing a surge of projects thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits and loans. China’s massive build-out of wind and solar is guided by state planning and executed by both state-owned and private firms. Each case shows that when government sets the ground rules and shoulders part of the risk, private capital will scale clean energy. The common thread is that markets are not left on their own. They are bent to serve a public purpose.

As a note, this is one of a select group of books I’ve read which does an excellent job of assessing a complex space and clearly identifying issues, then veers off course into fairly bad prescriptions for action. Marx’ Communist Manifesto did an excellent job of identifying issues with capitalism, then offered a terrible alternative. Naomi Klein’s No Logo‘s first half was a master class in branding, and I learned a lot from it, but the second half was a laundry list of mostly meaningless resistance, not a useful alternative. The Price Is Wrong falls into this category, and for anyone seeing a trend here, you aren’t wrong. All three are worth reading for the diagnosis of the problems, but the strategic policies and plans are shaped by bias, aren’t relevant, and are clearly better resolved within the framework of market economies than through removing markets from the equation.

The conclusion is straightforward. Addressing Christophers’ challenges does not require abandoning capitalism. It requires writing rules that make clean, reliable power profitable to build and cheap to buy. Capitalism will not save the planet on autopilot, but it can be harnessed if governments are willing to set the terms. The measure of success is not ideology but delivered clean terawatt-hours at stable prices. The faster policymakers align markets with that outcome, the faster the transition will proceed.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-14-2025-07_40_26-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-09-14 12:01:44.183049

Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?""","HARRISBURG, Pa. — With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said.

Questioning the affordability premise The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt.
“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said.
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind.
His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.","Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.

The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.

Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.

The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature.

Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.

Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.

Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.

“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”

The future of cap and trade reinforced

At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.

The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.

The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”

The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.

Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.

Questioning the affordability premise

The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.

At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.

“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”

Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”

Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”

Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.

Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.

A ‘giveaway to big oil’?

At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there.

The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”

Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”

“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.

Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.

Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern.

The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fde5aad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+109/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2F46%2F485856f344ccafaa914580726190%2F090622-powerlines-lv-cm-002.JPEG,N,,2025-09-14 10:59:49.557277

Over time, VW plans to use the cell across all its brands—from VW to Porsche—and adapt it to chemistries including LFP, sodium-ion and solid-state.

The Volkswagen Group's years-long effort to create a standardized battery cell to use across its electric portfolio is finally coming together. This week at IAA Munich, Europe's biggest auto expo, the automaker said it completed development of its ""unified cell"" and laid out a roadmap for the technology's future.

The idea behind the standardized cell is to unlock super-sized economies of scale around one of the most crucial EV components, VW executives explained at the show. That's critical, because almost no manufacturers besides Tesla have managed to turn a profit on their electric cars—largely because they've been crushed by high battery costs and limited production scale. Carmakers in Europe in particular need to meet escalating emissions rules and combat an influx of high-quality, highly subsidized Chinese offerings too.

Now, as Volkswagen prepares a renewed EV product offensive and advanced electrical architectures sourced from Rivian, it also has big plans for the batteries that are central to any EV.

""This brings us back to the driver's seat in one of the key technologies of our industry,"" said Thomas Schmall, member of the Volkswagen board of management responsible for technology, at IAA.

The prismatic cell developed by PowerCo, the automaker's battery subsidiary, will start series production within ""weeks"" at its factory in Salzgitter, Germany and ramp up next year, PowerCo CEO Frank Blome said during a presentation. Production will follow at plants in Spain and Canada in 2026 and 2027, respectively, he said.

The cell will power up to 80% of the VW Group's EV models from 2030 and extend to all brands, the company said. That means variations of it will be found in everything from Volkswagens and Škodas to Porsches and Audis. And they'll go into vehicles sold across the U.S., China and Europe. Notably, Porsche recently scrapped its own in-house battery manufacturing project.

""The basic idea for us is to standardize things wherever possible. We customize wherever necessary,"" said VW battery executive Guenther Mendl.

The unified cell will debut in the VW Group's ""Electric Urban Car Family,"" four models on the new MEB+ platform that VW says will start at around 25,000 euros, or roughly $29,000. Those include the Volkswagen ID. Polo and ID. Cross, along with the Cupra Raval hatchback.

VW says the unified cell will deliver a driving range of up to 450 kilometers (279 miles) in those cars. It says the cell demonstrates a volumetric energy density of 660 watt-hours per liter, a 10% improvement over VW's previous cells.

Ultimately, though, range and other specs will vary from vehicle to vehicle. VW says the cell can be adapted to different dimensions and can work in large and small vehicles. It can work with 400-volt and 800-volt architectures too.

VW's unified prismatic cells can be adapted to different sizes, executives said at IAA.

The unified cell will eventually employ several different battery chemistries, according to VW, starting with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), which is the most popular format in the West. Soon, PowerCo will start manufacturing cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells too, which are taking off globally because of their low cost and durability over years of charging.

""Technologically speaking we're still at the very beginning,"" Blome said, through a translator. ""So we're going to first have NMC, then LFP, then sodium and solid-state is also in the pipeline. It's included in the development roadmap, and we're also talking about further architectures and cell chemistries that we've started to work on.""

VW will start producing LFP unified cells at a factory in Valencia, Spain, in 2027. Solid-state batteries are likely farther off, as no company has successfully commercialized this holy grail battery technology. However, at IAA, Volkswagen rolled out its first demonstration vehicle with solid-state battery tech, a Ducati motorcycle with cells from VW-backed QuantumScape.

Executives said they chose the prismatic form factor—a rectangular box rather than a cylinder or flexible pouch—so that it could accommodate different chemistries over time. The shape is key in another way, too. In a new design for the VW Group, the cells stack together and slot directly into a vehicle's battery pack, rather than being packaged into a handful of modules first.

This cell-to-pack technology eliminates parts and frees up more space for batteries inside a vehicle, boosting range while cutting weight and cost, Mendl said, also calling the design ""extremely important.""

VW isn't alone here. The cheaper-to-build, overhauled EV platform that Ford announced in August uses prismatic cells integrated directly into a pack as well. The Rivian R2 eliminates the modules found in its R1 series. General Motors bet big on a scalable battery platform called Ultium, based on battery packs with different configurations of standardized modules. Now it's also looking into prismatic cells that can eliminate battery substructures and reduce the number of modules.

Volkswagen won't take on the brunt of manufacturing all on its own. The company said it plans to offload about 50% of cell production to suppliers, which, according to a presentation attended by InsideEVs Germany, include Gotion, CATL, Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution.

The cells aren't just for cars, either. They will also go into stationary battery banks built by Elli, VW's new energy storage company.

In 2025, with Tesla sedans quietly weaving through traffic and BYD, Ford, Nissan, Chevrolet, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Polestar, Lucid Motors, and Rivian all fighting for market share, electric cars have leapt from niche status to global presence. Still, persistent myths muddy the facts for curious new drivers and skeptics alike. Are EVs really worse for the environment? Are battery fires about to erupt? Is public charging still a mythological quest? Below, we untangle the biggest misconceptions, diving into real-world stories, data, and a few surprises about the cars shaping our roads, jobs, and future.

Electric Vehicle Environmental Impact: Separating Myth from Reality

As Jane, a journalist from Manchester, prepared to trade her aging Ford Focus for a gleaming new EV, she heard it all: “It’ll take you 77,000 miles just to break even on emissions.” Yet recent data tells a different story. A Tesla Model Y in the UK balances out its initial ‘carbon debt’ after just 13,000 miles—less than two years for most drivers. Over a full life, its emissions are about three times lower than an average petrol car. Production emissions, especially from batteries, do exist; however, as Europe’s and the world’s electric grids get cleaner, the benefits keep improving. Meanwhile, manufacturers like Volkswagen and Hyundai are pushing for greener supply chains, driving these numbers down further. The story is clear: whether you drive a Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt, or Polestar 2, the green advantage begins early and grows over time.

Electric Grid and Charging Infrastructure: Can the System Cope?

Skeptics like to recall headlines forecasting grid collapse or a shortage of public chargers. Yet, since the UK hit 50,000 public charging points, and with global investments topping $1 trillion for future infrastructure, the landscape is shifting rapidly. Technologies like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) now allow EVs to stabilize the grid rather than overwhelm it. In fact, modern grids—even in coal-heavy countries—are handling the transition smoothly, aided by smarter home charging and overnight rates. Jane, now a proud Hyundai Ioniq 5 owner, charges at home most nights, waking to a full battery. And with networks from Tesla Superchargers to ChargePoint expanding fast, ‘range anxiety’ is giving way to newfound convenience.

Myths Around Cost, Maintenance, and Battery Life in Electric Cars

For many like Alex, a London rideshare driver recently switching from a diesel VW Golf to a BYD Atto 3, the biggest shock wasn’t the silence or acceleration—it was realizing his maintenance costs had plummeted. Even as headlines warn that EVs are too expensive or that their batteries are dangerously short-lived, real-world economics look different. Battery warranties from Ford, Nissan, and others stretch eight years or more. Major studies reveal 90% of EVs with 100,000 miles still have at least 90% battery capacity. And when it comes to cost, falling battery prices, incentives, and cheaper electricity mean the total cost of ownership for models like the Chevrolet Bolt or Kia EV6 is now on par—sometimes even below—that of comparable petrol vehicles. Maintenance? With 90% fewer moving parts and no oil changes, it’s no contest.

Performance, Range, and Practicality: Today’s EVs in the Real World

Step into the world of enthusiasts like Priya in Los Angeles, who swapped her hatchback for a Lucid Motors Air Grand Touring. The myth that EVs are slow or limited to city streets evaporates on the freeway, where her car covers 837 km (520 miles) on a single charge—more than some gasoline rivals. Whether it’s the instant torque of a Tesla Model S Plaid or the adventurous spirit of a Rivian R1T tackling unpaved trails, EVs today are as thrilling as they are practical. Data from Norway—where EVs outnumber nearly every other type—demonstrates that not only do drivers travel further each year, but range is no longer a barrier. Even in harsh winters, Hyundai and Tesla models excel, with adaptive tech ensuring drivers are rarely caught short.

Job Market, Manufacturing, and the Future of Mobility

Beneath the shift toward electric mobility lies another, less visible revolution. When Ford’s F-150 Lightning rolled off a new assembly line in Michigan, it was more than a product launch—it was a harbinger of change for millions. Contrary to dire warnings about job losses, investments from Chevrolet, Volkswagen, and Polestar are ushering in tens of thousands of new roles, from battery production to software engineering. Recent research even suggests manufacturing EVs may require more labor, at least for now, due to new assembly technologies. The UK alone is poised to add 80,000–100,000 jobs by 2030, contingent on securing manufacturing plants. As Jane tells friends skeptical of “losing jobs to robots,” it’s human adaptation and retraining—supported by industry and government—that is rewriting the workplace, not the end of employment itself.

Frequently Asked Questions: Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked

Do electric vehicles pollute more than gas cars due to battery production?

No. Despite higher initial emissions from battery manufacturing, EVs like the Tesla Model Y pay off their ‘carbon debt’ in one to two years, ultimately reducing lifetime emissions by 65-70% compared to petrol cars.

Are EVs too expensive for the average driver?

Although some models have higher upfront prices, falling battery costs, tax incentives, and much lower maintenance and fueling expenses make EVs like the BYD Dolphin or Chevrolet Bolt highly affordable over their lifespan.

Can EVs be used for long trips and in cold climates?

Absolutely. Models from Lucid Motors, Tesla, and Hyundai now boast 400–800 km ranges, and advanced battery management ensures reliable performance even in freezing temperatures. Norway’s high EV market share supports this with real-world data.

Is the charging infrastructure enough to support millions of EVs?

Yes. Rapidly expanding networks—public and private—along with home charging, now mean that finding a plug is easier than ever, with 4 million+ public chargers worldwide and thousands more coming online monthly.

Do EV batteries last, or will I need to replace mine every few years?

Most EV batteries are rated for 10–15 years and over 300,000 miles, with warranty support and continually improving chemistry. Less than 2% of batteries have needed early replacement in large-scale studies.

Ford Motor Co. unveiled plans for a new line of budget electric vehicles in a $5 billion bid to achieve the mass appeal that has so far eluded its money-losing EV business.

The automaker’s new “universal EV platform” represents its first battery-powered models fully designed from the ground up, after early efforts such as the F-150 Lightning plug-in pickup failed to meet lofty sales expectations.

The new platform will spawn a family of EVs starting with a $30,000 mid-sized pickup truck in 2027, the company said in a statement Monday. That will be followed by battery-powered models expected to include a crossover SUV and a vehicle for ride-hailing, Bloomberg has reported, which will be priced below $40,000, about $10,000 less than the average price of a new car in the US.

Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley has billed the new EV line as Ford’s big bid to take on the growing global dominance of Chinese EV makers such as BYD Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. It’s part of what Farley called a “tremendous pivot” away from its earlier strategy of electrifying its largest models, which it largely abandoned a year ago when it canceled plans for an electric three-row SUV.

“This is a Model T moment for the company,” Farley told analysts last month, invoking the car that put Ford on the map a century ago. “We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese over the globe on EVs is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process.”

Farley on Monday cautioned that the strategy around its new EV line might not succeed, especially given how unpredictable the US EV market has been as American car buyers have been slow to embrace electric vehicles.

“There are no guarantees,” Farley told a crowd of workers and politicians at an event at Ford’s Louisville, Kentucky, factory. “It is a bet. There is risk.”

Factory Overhaul

The push includes a new, $2 billion investment to convert Ford’s Louisville plant from producing gasoline-fueled Escape SUVs, a model it is discontinuing, to manufacture the new EV line.

The battery-powered models will take 40% less time to build and require 600 fewer workers than the Escape thanks to an efficient design that was led by former Tesla Inc. executive Alan Clarke in what Ford called a skunk-works project in California. The Louisville plant will employ 2,200 hourly workers to build the EV line, down from 2,800, the company said.

The new models will have more interior room and advanced features, such as hands-free driving. They will be powered by lower-cost lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries Ford is to begin building next year at a new $3 billion battery factory in Marshall, Michigan, the company said.

Farley told reporters after Monday’s plant event that Ford can only beat Chinese automakers by offering an EV with more innovative features and efficient manufacturing methods because Ford can’t beat their low labor costs. “You’ve got to get close on cost, but then you have to apply the innovation,” he said.

Ford deliberately chose not to actually reveal a prototype of the electric pickup coming in two years because it didn’t want to tip its hand to competitors.

Despite Ford’s embrace of smaller, more affordable EVs, the automaker is still moving forward with plans for a successor to the F-150 Lightning full-size pickup. The automaker has repeatedly delayed its next generation electric F-Series truck and has now pushed its launch to mid-2028, from late 2027, according to a person familiar with the change.

Ford said in a statement that it has communicated the timing adjustment to its suppliers and employees in June.

Ford plans to build it at a new $5.6 billion manufacturing compound in Stanton, Tennessee, in 2028. The factory, Ford’s first new assembly plant in a half century, is capable of building more than 300,000 trucks a year, far more than the market is now demanding. It was part of Farley’s now-jettisoned $50 billion plan to churn out 2 million EVs a year by 2026 and overtake Tesla as the market leader in battery powered models.

It remains unclear how Ford will fully utilize its new Tennessee factory, though Farley has suggested the plant could also produce extended-range electric vehicles, a new type of plug-in hybrid.

EV Losses

Ford last year lost $5.1 billion in its EV unit and has said the deficit could widen this year as it brings its new line of battery powered models to life. But Farley has said any new EV at Ford must be both affordable and profitable within its first year on the market. Mainstream consumers have been turned off by the high price of electric vehicles.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,” Farley said in a statement.

Ford’s big bet on battery-powered models runs up against President Donald Trump’s crusade against what he calls an “EV mandate.” Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package is eliminating a $7,500 consumer tax credit on EV purchases and nearly derailed manufacturing subsidies that were critical to Ford’s business case for its Michigan battery plant.

The automaker lobbied furiously to protect those manufacturing credits, including an appeal by Executive Chair Bill Ford, great-grandson of founder Henry Ford.

Ford also said Trump’s tariffs cost the company $800 million in the second quarter and represent a $2 billion headwind for the year. That’s despite the fact that the Dearborn, Michigan-based company produces more cars in America than any other automaker.

Five major offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, are under construction.
The three other wind farms under construction are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts, Sunrise Wind off the coast of New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.
Just this week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) issued her support for the Coast Virginia Offshore Wind Project.","Clean energy advocates hoped that wind power would have a role to play in Trump’s second term, as the administration faces the problem of securing enough power to meet growing demands brought on by the artificial intelligence race.

However, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum insisted this week that offshore wind essentially has no “future” in the United States right now.

“Right now, under this administration, there is not a future,” Burgum said of the industry during the GasTech conference in Milan. “I think the fact that subsidies have been either cut back or limited means that it’s likely that there won’t be future offshore wind built in America.”

Halting construction

Burgum’s remarks come just weeks after the Interior Department issued a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. It cited unspecified “national security” concerns.

The project, which is being developed by Danish wind giant Ørsted, is estimated to be roughly 80% completed with around 45 out of 65 planned turbines installed. Recent federal court filings revealed that the company is losing roughly $2 million a day over costs incurred from the stop-work order.

However, Ørsted faces billions of dollars’ worth of revenue losses if it cannot meet critical deadlines outlined in its power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, according to the Providence Journal. Under the contracts, the wind farm must start generating power by the end of December of next year and mid-January 2027. Otherwise, the utilities could terminate the contracts.

If the project were to be scrapped entirely, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection warned it could cost consumers up to $500,000, an increase of between 5% and 7% in their electric bills.

“Every day that goes by without a resolution to this largely unexplained stop work order is a waste of American resources,” Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind nonprofit organization Turn Forward, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

“Hundreds of union workers sit idle, wondering if their jobs still exist. Regional grid officials counting on this critical new energy source to stabilize the grid and hold down electricity bills must plan for increased risks to reliability,” Bright added. “And billions of dollars of U.S. infrastructure investment are slowly being drained rather than helping a project come to life.”

Other projects in the air

In the last few weeks, the Trump administration has moved to yank federal permits previously granted to offshore wind projects set to be constructed along the East Coast.

This included construction and operations permits granted to U.S. Wind for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, also known as MarWin, which was approved by the Biden administration in December 2024.

The wind farm is expected to have up to 114 turbines that will generate enough electricity to power over 718,000 homes.

The Interior Department is also targeting permits granted to SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind off the coast of Massachusetts. All three projects have not yet started construction.

Five major offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, are under construction. Trump previously issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind off the coast of New York. However, it was ultimately lifted after the administration said it had made a deal with Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) to approve two gas pipelines in her state.

The three other wind farms under construction are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts, Sunrise Wind off the coast of New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.

Burgum said that all five projects are being reviewed by the administration this week.

“Yes, they were permitted, but they got moved through a very fast, ideologically driven permitting process,” Burgum said.

While permit reviews of such projects are not uncommon at the start of any administration, many in the offshore wind industry have said the Trump administration is going a step too far.

“These particular projects have already been through nearly a decade of rigorous studies and permitting reviews,” Katharine Kollins, president of the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the Washington Examiner.

“While this administration has shown hostility to the industry, we believe the long-term momentum behind wind energy, which is driven by market demand, technological progress, and private investment, will continue,” Kollins added. “What’s important is that we provide a stable and predictable regulatory environment that allows this industry to provide the domestic energy needed to fuel our economic growth.”

Republican support

As Trump and his allies have rallied against the offshore wind industry, a growing number of Republicans in Congress have directly challenged the crackdown or come out in support of various projects.

Just this week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) issued her support for the Coast Virginia Offshore Wind Project. The project, which is being built by utility Dominion Energy, is set to be the largest offshore wind farm in the country.

Kiggans, who did not openly criticize the administration, said she remains a “staunch” advocate of the project due to the economic development and job growth in the region. She also noted that it has become crucial for meeting energy security demands in Virginia, particularly when it comes to defense.

“I always speak about that project in light of the national security benefit and that benefit to Naval Air Station Oceana,” Kiggans told reporters on Monday. “I have a base here that needs a lot of infrastructure help, and Dominion Energy has been a great partner for us. That public-private partnership is giving Naval Air Station Oceana a $500 million power grid upgrade.”

Similarly, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) offered his support for the project, which has somehow remained unscathed in the administration’s offshore wind crackdown thus far.

“Yes, I’ve talked to the Trump team and there are ongoing conversations about that,” Johnson told E&E News when asked about the Virginia Beach project this week. “I understand the priority for Virginians, and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see.”

WRIGHT BACKS TRUMP ARGUMENT BLAMING RENEWABLES FOR RISING ELECTRICITY PRICES

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) has also quietly backed the offshore wind farm and reportedly called Burgum last month to voice his support.

However, with Burgum insisting that offshore wind has no “future” and Trump vowing not to let any new windmills be built in the U.S., any public support from Republican industry allies might be for naught.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25237502829235.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-14 12:02:24.013081

Tesla, once the dominant player in the U.S. EV market, has seen its market share decline to its lowest level since 2017, dropping to 38% in August 2025.

The expiration of federal EV tax credits has also contributed to the temporary market spike and further complicated the landscape for Tesla.

The decline in profits is also influenced by the high costs of transforming production lines to meet the demands of EV manufacturing. This includes the development of advanced technologies like autonomous driving and energy solutions, which require significant investments. Additionally, supply chain disruptions, such as semiconductor shortages, have posed substantial challenges in meeting production targets and delivering vehicles on time.

The sector's outlook remains uncertain, with experts predicting that the crisis may persist due to ongoing competition, regulatory pressures, and the need for substantial investments in new technologies.

Membrane innovation boosts speed and stability

A core innovation is a novel ultra-ion-selective membrane called SPEEK-SX. It delivers ionic conductivity while restricting unwanted ions, allowing the battery to operate at high current densities (≈160 mA/cm²) over 600 full charge/discharge cycles with minimal capacity loss (≈0.00935% per cycle). This performance exceeds that of the widely used Nafion-212 membrane, particularly in terms of cycle stability and speed.

Safety, cost and real-world readiness

Unlike many lithium-ion systems, the flow battery uses non-toxic, non-flammable materials and relies on abundant components. It stores energy in liquid electrolytes and uses a membrane barrier system to separate ion streams, making it simpler to scale. Researchers are 3D-printing prototypes and testing under realistic conditions; if results hold, the battery could become commercially available in a few years.

How it compares with lithium systems

Current lithium-ion storage systems used for rooftop solar in many markets cost around USD 10,000. This new flow battery aims to undercut those costs, while offering safety and performance advantages. The fast charging enabled by the membrane means it can more closely match solar output in real time.

Implications for the manufacturing sector

For manufacturers of battery components, membranes, and storage systems, this is a potential game changer. The shift away from expensive, fluorinated separators toward more affordable and safer alternatives opens new supply chain opportunities. Local industries focusing on organic chemistry, polymer membranes and scalable manufacturing methods stand to benefit. There is also demand for R&D in prototype validation and product engineering as adoption moves from lab to market.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/09/14/monash-university.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 12:02:59.121299

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030.
Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions.
“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.
The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2025/09/68c5fc4e13c733.48887980.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:50.794586

Rea, a senior associate with the nonprofit RMI, analyzes the latest plans put out by U.S. electricity utilities for meeting projected demand over the coming decades.

His most recent review of all 128 plans found that utilities were looking to build twice as much natural gas capacity as they had anticipated just 18 months earlier.

The main reason for this shift: Utilities are rushing to accommodate the electricity needs of data centers, and projections of those needs keep rising. It’s a troubling trend for anyone concerned about the costs for ratepayers and the effects on the climate.

“Utilities that have updated their plans since the end of 2023 have added just a small amount of wind and solar capacity, 4 gigawatts, but a lot more gas capacity, 52 gigawatts,” said Rea, whose organization seeks to accelerate the energy transition.

At first glance, utilities’ long-term plans seem to favor renewables overall, projecting wind and solar growth of 258 gigawatts versus natural gas additions of 102 gigawatts through 2035. But a closer look reveals the shift.

Just one year back, these plans showed wind and solar could overtake natural gas as the nation’s biggest source of electricity generation by 2035. At the new rate, gas would keep reigning.

AI Boosts Demand

U.S. tech giants are betting big on an AI future, but the power grid is still a relic of the past.

Data centers—essentially warehouses for computers that form the backbone of the internet—are multiplying as companies add power-hungry servers for artificial intelligence. Some existing sites use as much energy as a small city, and new ones are even bigger.

As a result, data centers, which used less than 2 percent of total U.S. electricity prior to 2018, consumed 4.4 percent in 2023 and are on track to make up anywhere between 6.7 and 12 percent by 2028. That’s according to a congressionally mandated report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last year.

After nearly two decades of flat demand, the power grid—much of it running on equipment that is over half a century old—is scrambling to keep up.

“It was designed to accommodate big central power plants that sent electricity in one direction down the lines to the customers,” said Todd Olinsky-Paul, senior director of the Clean Energy Group’s Resilient Power Project.

It was not built for a system that has much more rooftop solar and home-based batteries, with electricity going to and from the customer.

Energy companies and regulators have been working for years to modernize the grid and move toward cleaner sources of energy. But when faced with a rapid increase in electricity demand, ambitions of just a few years have faded in favor of plans to rely heavily on new natural gas power plants—with everyone bearing the costs, from higher electricity bills to harmful climate impacts.

Resorting to Natural Gas

Experts say that utilities are leaning extensively on gas due in part to the inertia of existing regulatory processes and a tendency of the power sector to hype its demand outlook.

When utilities want to raise rates, they almost always have to make their case in public proceedings before a state commission. In most states, the regulator-approved rate hikes only account for the fixed costs of building new infrastructure, including plants and power lines. The fluctuating cost of the fuel that goes into running those plants is passed through to consumers on a rolling basis year after year.

“Often the fuel price risk is ignored, probably intentionally ignored, by utilities when they speak with their regulators,” said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based consultancy focused on transmission and power markets.

Gramlich, who testified before a Senate committee in July about rising electric demand, previously worked with a Republican chairman of the federal energy regulator as well as with the country’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection.

Among the reasons for utilities to favor gas is the rate-setting process, which makes it more profitable for utilities to opt for power plants in their territory rather than contracting for renewables, Gramlich said.

“Renewables have been a little bit less attractive because often they’re in a neighboring service territory or spread around the region,” he said, and “they’re usually developed and owned by independent power producers.”

Utilities also like to err on the side of caution. To avoid blackouts, they prefer to build more rather than less, which shows up in their off-the-charts projections. Since 2006, their 10-year growth forecasts have overshot reality by 17 percent on average, according to an RMI analysis.

That saddles customers with the bill for unneeded facilities. And it’s a particular risk in the current fast-changing environment.

Utilities are preparing to meet a 24 percent increase in electricity demand by 2035, according to another RMI analysis.

Jeremy Ortiz, a spokesperson for the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group, said in a statement, “Our members are investing more than $1.1 trillion in infrastructure projects nationwide over the next 5 years to help keep costs as low as possible for families and businesses while enabling the innovation America needs to win the AI race.”

Without regulatory changes, the costs will be effectively socialized across the customer base even though much of the growth is coming from one kind of customer—data centers.

“The typical rate-making structures are not set up for this because typically electrical infrastructure—generation, transmission, distribution lines—is paid for by the entire customer base, which is a reasonable assumption when you assume that everything is growing in a similar way,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But today’s growth is coming from some of the world’s largest corporations, which are sparing no expense to win the AI arms race.

“Because the data centers are so enormous,” Kunkel said, “it’s a different paradigm.”

While this is playing out around the country, the most acute impacts are regionally concentrated. Northern Virginia is the world’s largest hub of data centers—and the utility that serves them, Dominion Energy, raised its capital expenditure by a fifth to $12 billion last year, the largest jump for any investor-owned electric utility in the nation.

Soaring electricity prices in Virginia, and throughout the wider Mid-Atlantic region, have been attributed in large part to data centers.

As Virginia strains to accommodate that growth, “we’re seeing data center companies right now seek out anywhere that they see perceived headroom or ability to power their load throughout the country,” said Lauren Shwisberg, a principal at RMI’s Carbon-Free Electricity Practice.

Against this backdrop, many other states are courting data centers and their tax revenue, following in Virginia’s footsteps.

But data centers don’t produce a lot of permanent local jobs, and they “may be effectively crowding out other forms of economic development” by siphoning large portions of the region’s available electricity away from other types of industrial and manufacturing investments, Kunkel noted.

Meanwhile, sparse information disclosed by data-center developers—and the speculative nature of many proposals on the cutting edge of tech—makes it harder to effectively plan the grid of the near future.

“It is worrisome that we’re going to end up overbuilding generation, particularly overbuilding fossil-fuel generation, which no one wants to see,” Kunkel said.

Blow to Clean Energy

Clean energy is literally waiting in line to help the grid out—and waiting, and waiting.

Another report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last year found that 95 percent of energy projects queued up at the end of 2023 for permission from grid operators to get connected were either solar, batteries or wind. The report noted that wait times are rising, from less than two years for projects completed in 2008 to nearly five years for those finished in 2023. Historically, just about one in five projects in the queue get completed.

With all these projects in the pipeline, “we can meet the vast majority of the requirements for many of these data centers with pretty close to exclusively clean energy, if we had both the political apparatus and will to be able to do so,” said Jeremy Fisher, principal advisor on climate and energy with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program, who co-authored a report last September about leveraging growing electric demand for a cleaner grid.

At a federal level, with a president who has made no secret of his disdain for renewables, the will is now entirely absent.

“The cancellation of permits, the difficulty of getting federal permits and the uncertainty and loss of tax credits are all very likely to reduce renewable energy growth in the next few years,” Grid Strategies’ Gramlich said, referring to Trump administration moves to discourage wind and solar. All of that compounds the effects of burgeoning demand, he said, “making clean energy targets more difficult to meet in a number of places.”

Take Virginia’s example. The state passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act in 2020, setting staggered targets, under financial penalty, for investor-owned utilities to keep raising the share of carbon-free electricity in their statewide power sales, topping out at 100 percent in 2045 for Dominion.

But Dominion’s long-term planning indicates that it might miss those targets. In 2023, its modeling showed it might not meet the statutory requirement to retire all carbon-emitting power generation by 2045, citing “an increasing load forecast.” Last year’s plan said it was getting ready to collect fines for some of the years through 2040 when it expects to fall short of the targets. Those fines would pass to customers.

Dominion did not respond to requests for comment.

Even if compliance with the law was possible and compatible with high levels of data center growth, it would require “unprecedented investment in an ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy” on energy. That was the finding of a study released in December by the state legislature’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which also said the state’s current regulatory practices “were not designed to account for this level and continued pace of large load growth from essentially a single customer type.”

In neighboring North Carolina, where data center construction is exploding, the Republican-led state legislature last month dropped a 2030 deadline for utility Duke Energy to slash its carbon emissions by 70 percent.

Risks to Consumers

Already, utility bills are rising as climate change drives more extreme weather and grid hardening costs. Deepening dependence on gas further piles on risks for ratepayers, and not only because gas worsens climate change.

“When [gas prices] spike, that’s an instant rate increase outside the rate-case process that flows directly to your bill,” said Ted Thomas, founder of consultancy Energize Strategies and former chair of the Arkansas Public Service Commission. “If you’re a regulator, your consumers are twisting in the wind if they’re just sitting there eating those costs on both electricity and natural-gas home heating.”

Then there’s the possibility of the political pendulum swinging back. Make energy investment decisions assuming the current federal policy environment won’t change, and “you’re probably going to get hammered,” Thomas said.

“The people that think the only reason to do renewables is environmental, they get it wrong,” Thomas said. His guidance for utility commissioners: “You’ve got to leave your ideology at home. … We can’t pretend that natural gas prices don’t spike because if they do, our constituents are going to have to pay for it.”

Some states are taking a hard look at the other major grid issue posed by data centers: Everyone bearing the costs of that development. In July, utility American Electric Power got buy-in from state regulators in Ohio to make large data centers pay for at least 85 percent of their projected energy use each month, even if they end up needing less. A report that same month from the Clean Energy States Alliance details other ways that officials are trying to make data centers pick up the tab—and stay the course on the clean-energy transition.

“The momentum was always at the state level,” said Olinsky-Paul, a co-author of that report. “States have a very good, effective ability to institute new policy and regulations and new programs to accelerate the deployment of clean energy resources. They know how to do it. They’ve been doing it for decades.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2214908574-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 05:58:51.486591

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the credit—offering up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones—is set to expire on September 30, 2025. However, recent IRS clarifications, as detailed in a Yahoo Finance report, allow consumers to secure the incentive by entering a binding contract and making a payment before the deadline, even if the vehicle isn’t delivered until later.

This adjustment addresses a practical hurdle: supply chain delays and inventory shortages that have plagued the auto industry. Buyers who sign a non-refundable agreement or provide a down payment by the cutoff date can still claim the credit on their 2025 tax returns, provided the vehicle meets all other qualifications like battery sourcing and price caps.

Navigating the Binding Contract Loophole

Industry experts view this as a lifeline for an EV market still recovering from post-pandemic disruptions. According to insights from WebProNews, analysts predict a 10-15% sales dip without the credit, but the extension via contracts could mitigate that by encouraging pre-deadline commitments. Dealerships are already adapting, with some offering streamlined online contracting to lock in deals remotely.

For consumers, the key is understanding what constitutes a “binding contract.” The IRS specifies it must be enforceable under state law, with at least a partial payment or trade-in. This echoes guidance from the IRS’s own clean vehicle tax credits page, updated in May 2025, which emphasizes that acquisition is defined by commitment, not possession.

Implications for Automakers and Supply Chains

Automakers like Tesla and General Motors stand to benefit, as the loophole could sustain demand into late 2025. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Sawyer Merritt highlight how the original expiration shift from December 31 to September 30 caught the industry off guard, prompting urgent marketing pushes. Meanwhile, a CNBC analysis notes that this flexibility particularly aids out-of-state purchases, where shipping delays might otherwise disqualify buyers.

Yet, not all vehicles qualify. Eligibility hinges on factors like North American assembly and income limits—$150,000 for single filers, $300,000 for joint. NerdWallet’s July 2025 update on EV tax credits lists models like the Chevrolet Bolt and Ford F-150 Lightning as prime candidates, but warns of potential changes if battery mineral rules tighten further.

Consumer Strategies and Market Shifts

To maximize savings, experts recommend acting swiftly. A NPR report from August underscores that shoppers don’t need keys in hand by September 30, easing pressure on rushed deliveries. This has sparked a flurry of activity, with Consumer Reports noting in its August 2025 piece on qualifying EVs that plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius Prime remain strong options amid the deadline.

Looking ahead, the expiration could reshape EV adoption. Without the credit, prices may rise effectively by thousands, potentially slowing the transition to cleaner transport. As Edmunds explores in its coverage of the loophole, this might accelerate innovation in affordable models, but for now, the IRS’s extension offers a critical window for savvy buyers to electrify their drives on favorable terms.

Economic Ripple Effects and Policy Context

Broader economic implications are evident. The credit, extended multiple times since its inception, has subsidized over a million EV purchases, per Department of Energy data from its clean vehicle credits page. X posts from figures like Pramila Jayapal reflect past enthusiasm for such incentives, but with the 2025 cutoff, attention turns to state-level rebates in places like California.

Critics argue the policy favors wealthier buyers, as echoed in older X commentary from Guy Reschenthaler, yet recent IRS tweaks aim for inclusivity. As the September deadline looms, industry insiders advise consulting tax professionals to navigate claims, ensuring this final extension doesn’t slip away unused.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DALL·E-2024-08-09-06.35.54-A-dynamic-image-depicting-the-rapid-rise-of-electric-vehicles-EVs-dominating-the-automotive-landscape.-The-scene-shows-a-futuristic-cityscape-with-h.webp,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:27.113174

1 state for building new small hydropower,"" Brown Kinloch told state lawmakers last year.","Hydropower provides a vast majority of Kentucky's renewable electricity generation, and many unused dams could offer an opportunity for more.

Unlike other technologies like solar and wind, hydropower has seen broad bipartisan support, from the White House to the Kentucky legislature.

Upfront cost and a lengthy licensing process remain steep barriers for hydropower projects, and can disproportionately affect the smaller projects more common in Kentucky.

When it was built nearly a century ago, the Ohio Falls hydroelectric dam churned out enough power to serve nearly the entire budding city of Louisville.

Adorned by wooden handrails, vintage analog gauges and original tile, the plant's eight turbine units still chug away today, producing carbon-free electricity from the Ohio River. Anglers, water birds and wildlife congregate around the historic structure, jutting off of Shippingport Island along the McAlpine locks and dam system.

Louisville's power demand outgrew the station's generating capacity many years ago. But with a recent modernization effort, LG&E expects the station to persist for yet another century, meeting the electricity needs of tens of thousands of homes.

The Ohio Falls generating station is one of about a dozen hydroelectric plants operating in Kentucky waters.

Dozens more of Kentucky's existing dams could be suitable for hydroelectric generation but have not yet been developed — offering an opportunity to grow Kentucky's share of the oldest form of renewable energy. That opportunity is vast: The commonwealth has more miles of navigable water than any other state after Alaska, and many rivers and streams are already dammed from past efforts to shape these watersheds.

But developers say hydroelectric projects in states like Kentucky face significant hurdles, including an arduous federal licensing process and the need for long-term investment. Turbines are typically custom-designed and manufactured, posing another costly challenge.

Nevertheless, several hydroelectric projects are moving forward in Kentucky, and proponents see momentum and cause for optimism in the industry. Hydropower has enjoyed bipartisan favor, even amid the Trump administration's efforts to reverse federal support for other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar.

Building upon eligible, existing dams could yield hundreds of megawatts of reliable and renewable electricity, by some estimates. Additionally, by installing new hydropower generation without building new dams, developers avoid some of the knotty environmental challenges of reworking river systems.

Once stations do come online, they offer a reliable, carbon-free power source, often for a century or more. In fact, the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2017 assessed all power plants built before 1930 and still in operation across the country. Hydroelectric stations made up 99% of the capacity.

""Hydro is now being called the forever renewable,"" Kentucky hydropower developer David Brown Kinloch said, ""because these plants last forever.""

Kentucky's leading source of clean power

Hydroelectric power plants function by a relatively simple premise: Water flows downstream and through a turbine, causing it to spin, which in turn runs a generator.

Plants harness the kinetic energy of moving water ― a concept applied in some form since at least the days of ancient Greece ― to generate electricity. The volume or flow of the water and the elevation change at the point of the dam determine the potential generation.

Louisville's Ohio Falls station, which sits at the single highest drop in the entire 981-mile length of the Ohio River, is in a particularly opportune location. Each of the station's eight turbine units can take in 4,000 cubic feet of water per second from the river, at capacity.

""The taller the dam, the more power you can make,"" Brown Kinloch said.

In Kentucky, hydropower is often generated in a run-of-river context, harnessing the natural flow of a waterway. It's also implemented in lakes and reservoirs, like Kentucky Utilities' Dix Dam at Herrington Lake.

Hydroelectric stations made up roughly 7% of Kentucky's electricity generation and a vast majority of its renewable power in 2022, with solar still fighting to gain ground. Dams in Kentucky waterways collectively generate millions of megawatt hours each year. (A power plant would need to burn billions of pounds of coal to generate the same amount.)

But the remaining 93% of the state's electricity generation came from polluting and planet-warming fossil fuels: coal and gas. Kentucky's electric power industry emits more than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent emissions each year ― more than the state's transportation and agriculture sectors combined, according to EPA data.

Increasing the generation of carbon-free power and curtailing emissions from burning fossil fuels is mandatory for avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, according to the world's leading experts.

Hydropower's momentum in Kentucky, where conservative politics has slowed efforts for a clean energy transition, is part of a larger effort to chip away at stubborn power sector emissions.

Appalachian Hydro Associates, Brown Kinloch's development firm, is building a number of small hydroelectric projects up and down the Kentucky River. The firm has also partnered with Berea College on some projects, including a completed station near Ravenna.

And in Bell County, a billion-dollar pumped storage project is progressing with the help of some federal dollars.

But a burdensome federal licensing process and difficulty finding long-term investors can pose formidable hurdles for hydro projects, experts said. Installing hydro in an existing dam can take a decade or more, depending on the need for environmental assessments and other steps.

""When you go to most investors, they're wondering, 'What's the profit next quarter?'"" Brown Kinloch said. ""And you're talking about a project that's got a 100-year life, at minimum.""

Brown Kinloch said his firm has partnered Berea College because it also has taken the long view.

""They're not so concerned about whether the thing is making money in the first two months,"" he said. ""They realize it's a long-term investment.""

The bipartisan appeal of hydropower

In 1983, a state report analyzed potential sites for hydropower at existing dams across the commonwealth. Brown Kinloch has a copy; the pages have yellowed, but many of the dams it lists have yet to be developed.

Last year, he presented some of these statistics to a committee of state lawmakers, some of them staunch allies of the coal industry who have rejected the merits of decarbonizing Kentucky's power sector.

Installing hydroelectric systems in dozens of existing dams across the state could yield more than 600 megawatts of reliable electricity, Brown Kinloch explained — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

Lawmakers were impressed.

""This seems to me to be a much more intelligent application of resources than, you know, basically future garbage dumps that we're building with all these solar projects,"" Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, said of hydropower during the committee meeting.

""When you look at all the energy aspects, and you see all the solar farms and you see all the potential harm that it can do to our farmlands and things, our return on investment isn't that great with some of these renewables,"" said Rep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester. ""But with hydro, I see the great potential in it.""

Party leaders, while remaining staunch in their defense of fossil fuels, have expressed concerns about electricity shortages and price hikes, especially as data centers and other energy-hungry industries take root around the state.

Hydropower boasts relatively low operation and maintenance costs. Dams also don't face the fuel input costs of coal- or gas-fired power plants, although operators do pay a fee to the federal government for use of the waterway.

Also, hydroelectric stations can generally operate for a larger portion of the year than solar or wind, although periods of flooding or drought — too much or too little water — can impede generation.

""Hydropower really does enjoy huge bipartisan support,"" said Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association. ""It appeals to both sides of the aisle.""

Alongside oil, gas, coal and nuclear, President Donald Trump has indicated his support for hydropower — ""which is fantastic,"" he said on the campaign trail — showing favor over other forms of renewable energy technologies.

Some of Trump's energy-related executive orders prioritize hydropower, and the president's domestic policy megabill spared key incentives for the hydro industry while crippling Biden-era support for other renewables, like solar and wind.

""If you're conservative, you like that it's baseload. It's not intermittent, like wind and solar,"" Woolf said. ""You like that it's domestic and secure. You understand it, because it's been around for 100 years.""

Hydropower projects moving forward in Kentucky

Even the industry's most fervent proponents admit hydroelectric dams are unlikely to ever generate a significant portion of Kentucky’s modern energy needs, especially as demand is expected to surge.

""Hydropower is not going to solve all of Kentucky's problems,"" Brown Kinloch said.

But it could still have a valuable role, even without the construction of new dams. Several new developments are forging ahead in the state, from small hydropower installations to larger investments.

Together, Brown Kinloch said, ""they're going to add up.""

Along the upper reaches of the Kentucky River, Brown Kinloch's firm is building a series of small hydroelectric stations on existing dams. Once complete, these projects will generate enough power for thousands of homes.

A station at lock 12, near Ravenna, is already in service ― and named for Matilda Hamilton Fee, the ""first lady"" of Berea College at its founding.

Another similarly sized station at lock 7, near Shakertown in Mercer County, is named for Mother Ann Lee, a religious leader of the Shakers. Inside, turbine housings are painted in bright colors and embellished with the artwork of schoolchildren.

""I took those plates off and took them over to my daughter's elementary school, and they painted the fish of the Kentucky River on there,"" Brown Kinloch said. ""So, it's a kids' art gallery also.""

In Bell County, a proposed project would add 266 megawatts of pumped storage on a former coal mine. Rather than generating power, pumped storage acts as a ""water battery,"" and this project would store electricity for up to 8 hours at a time, available for dispatchable use as needed to help stabilize the grid.

Rye Development is investing more than $1 billion in the project, which is named Lewis Ridge. It's expected to create 2,300 construction jobs.

Republicans representing the area have praised the Lewis Ridge plans. State Sen. Scott Madon, of nearby Pineville, called it a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity for Eastern Kentucky communities to build upon their energy-producing legacy,"" and an economic boon for the region.

""As we grow our economy, it's vital that Kentucky strengthen our energy system through common-sense solutions like the Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage Project,"" U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers said in a news release. ""Additionally, this project will help keep energy prices stable and affordable for Kentuckians.""

An 'extremely broken' regulatory process

Despite hydropower's momentum on the Kentucky River and elsewhere, industry experts say long timelines still pose formidable hurdles. Licensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can take years.

""The process is and has been, for many, many years, extremely broken,"" Brown Kinloch said.

The licensing process for a pair of relatively small hydroelectric projects on the Kentucky River, he added, took more than seven years.

The regulatory process is designed to ensure a hydropower project won't cause harm to the environment, recreation or other resources. In some cases, hydroelectric projects can pose a threat to fish, mussels and other species, although modern turbine designs and other tactics have sought to reduce harm. The Mother Ann Lee dam on the Kentucky River, and the Meldahl station on the Ohio, are both certified by the Low Impact Hydropower Association for taking measures to reduce disruption of the environment.

The federal government itself has recognized the licensing process can inflict undue cost and delays to building new hydroelectric infrastructure, even in projects with minimal controversy. A Department of Energy report found the arduous licensing process can disproportionately hinder smaller projects ― such as those fit for Kentucky's existing dams.

One piece of legislation, which the National Hydropower Association called a ""critical first step"" toward streamlining the licensing process, recently passed in the U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan backing. It would require regulators to report to Congress with regular updates on the licensing process for each application.

Industry advocates said easing licensing barriers could be key to unlocking more hydroelectric projects ― especially in states like Kentucky, where hydropower has proven politically palatable in ways solar and other clean energy technologies have not.

""Kentucky is the No. 1 state for building new small hydropower,"" Brown Kinloch told state lawmakers last year. ""And it is our intent to build a whole industry centered here in Kentucky, with component suppliers and everything to supply small hydro, and teach the rest of the country how to do it.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/05/PLOU/85531689007-hydro-03.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x0,y120&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-14 05:58:55.231397

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Electricity Isn’t the Only Concern

There have also been recent reports about the amount of water data centers are using that have caused concern among communities impacted by tech companies moving in next door.

A data center in Georgia, operated by Facebook’s parent company Meta, is said to use roughly 500,000 gallons of water daily to cool their computing equipment. This amounts to about 10% of water use in the county, roughly equivalent to the demand of about 1,600 homes. Newer AI data centers are expected to use more than a millions gallons daily, according to water permit applications. Some have even asked for as many as six million gallons of water per day.

In some areas it has been suggested that residents may have to start rationing water by 2030, all so the tech companies can keep pushing their hot new product.

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data Centers Might Have to Adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s Largest Grid Operator Has a Proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A Deal is Shrouded in Secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A New Way of Thinking About Electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

Taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://www.poncacitynow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Amazon-Data-Center-08-22-2024-AP.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 07:59:03.473407

Of equal importance is the social dimension of the coal transition.
The challenge is to leverage what remains of coal’s economic utility to accelerate, rather than delay, the clean energy pivot.
The clean energy era is not about erasing the past; it is about harnessing it to finance and secure a more sustainable future.","Jakarta, IO – Every era of a nation’ s development has its emblematic resource. For Indonesia, coal has long played that role. From the sprawling mines of Kalimantan to the busy ports along Sumatra’s coast, coal has not only powered turbines but also filled state coffers, paid for schools, hospitals and roads, and served as a diplomatic bargaining chip in global trade. Yet as the world edges ever closer to a clean energy future, Indonesia’s reliance on coal stands at a critical juncture. President Prabowo Subianto’s ambitious pledge to move toward 100 percent renewable energy within a decade underscores both the urgency and the opportunity of this moment. The pressing question is not whether coal will decline, but how it will be repositioned in the nation’s evolving energy landscape.

Coal’s legacy is both monumental and contradictory. On one hand, it has been the backbone of Indonesia’s electrification drive, enabling the lights to switch on in rural villages and industrial estates alike. The state has long depended on royalties and taxes from coal exports, particularly to energy-hungry neighbors in Asia. In 2022 alone, coal exports generated more than US$45 billion in foreign exchange, making it one of the largest contributors to Indonesia’s trade surplus. The resource has also created jobs across mining provinces, anchoring local economies and political networks. Yet this success has come with undeniable costs: deforestation, polluted rivers, respiratory illness among neighboring inhabitants from particulate emissions, and a carbon footprint that has placed Indonesia among the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters.

Globally, the coal narrative has shifted with remarkable speed. Banks, insurers and sovereign wealth funds have withdrawn financing from coal projects. Multilateral institutions now view coal as a “stranded asset” waiting to happen. Across Asia, long a bastion of coal demand, countries from China to India are scaling up renewable capacity at unprecedented rates. For Indonesia, which exports around 70 percent of its coal, this shift threatens to erode a vital stream of income. Domestically, the commitment to decarbonization, enshrined in the Paris Agreement and Indonesia’s net-zero pledge by 2060, further accelerates the imperative to transform. The recently-updated National Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) reflects this pivot, slating the majority of new capacity additions to come from renewables rather than coal-fired plants.

Yet phasing coal out of the grid is only part of the story. A more strategic question is how to reposition coal in a way that preserves its economic value, while aligning with the clean energy vision. Simply abandoning coal is neither feasible nor fiscally prudent. Instead, coal must be reframed not as an enemy of the transition but as a resource that, if managed wisely, can serve as a bridge to Indonesia’s clean energy era.

One avenue is industrial repositioning through downstream development. Indonesia has already experimented with coal gasification, aiming to convert coal into dimethyl ether (DME) as a substitute for imported LPG. Similar pathways exist for coal-to-methanol, coal-to-ammonia, and other petrochemicals that could supply domestic industry. While the environmental credentials of such technologies remain contested, particularly if carbon capture is not employed, they represent an attempt to move coal higher up the value chain. Rather than exporting raw coal, Indonesia could extract more economic rent by transforming it into intermediate products that support fertilizer, plastics, or chemical industries. This would mirror the government’s broader strategy of resource nationalism, exemplified by the nickel downstreaming push.

Another, perhaps more compelling, role for coal is as a fiscal buffer. Just as Norway built its sovereign wealth fund from oil revenues, Indonesia could channel the remaining windfall from coal into a “clean energy transition fund.” Such a mechanism would ensure that coal rents are not squandered on short-term expenditures but rather invested in renewable infrastructure, grid modernization and worker retraining. With careful design, this fund could become a stabilizing pillar for energy transition, insulating the state budget from commodity price volatility while underwriting longterm resilience. The analogy is not perfect; coal is far dirtier than oil, and time is shorter but the principle of converting resource wealth into future security remains powerful.

Coal could also serve as a strategic energy buffer. Even as renewable energy expands, intermittency and reliability issues will persist, especially in archipelagic regions where grid integration is costly. Maintaining limited coal reserves as an emergency fallback, akin to a strategic petroleum reserve, could help Indonesia hedge against supply disruptions, whether from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions or sudden demand surges. This does not mean prolonging the dominance of coal in the power mix, but rather reimagining it as a backup, a form of insurance in the broader resilience framework.

Of equal importance is the social dimension of the coal transition. Millions of Indonesians rely directly or indirectly on the coal economy, from miners in East Kalimantan to truck drivers, port workers and small traders in mining towns. Abrupt closure of coal operations would devastate these communities, fueling unemployment, poverty and social unrest. A just transition requires deliberate planning: channeling coal revenues into retraining programs, supporting micro-enterprises in affected regions and investing in new industries – ones that can absorb displaced workers. Provinces that once thrived on coal should not be left behind in the clean energy era. Instead, they should be recast as hubs for such renewable energy development as solar farms on reclaimed mining land, wind turbines along coastal ridges, or biomass plants tapping local resources.

The repositioning of coal also demands robust institutional frameworks. Without strong governance, efforts at downstreaming or fiscal reallocation risk succumbing to rent-seeking, inefficiency or even corruption. Transparent mechanisms for managing coal revenues must be established, with clear lines of accountability, to ensure that every Rupiah serves the transition. Likewise, the coal-to-clean narrative must be embedded within a broader strategy of national energy resilience, not treated as an ad hoc policy experiment. Coordination across ministries, local governments, stateowned enterprises, and the private sector will be critical.

Repositioning coal in this manner does not imply romanticizing its role. The environmental costs remain steep, and no amount of rebranding can obscure its carbon intensity. However, realism is essential. Coal will not disappear overnight, nor can Indonesia afford to sever its dependence without careful preparation. The challenge is to leverage what remains of coal’s economic utility to accelerate, rather than delay, the clean energy pivot.

In this respect, Indonesia has an opportunity to craft a uniquely Indonesian model of transition. Rather than importing blueprints wholesale from Europe or North America, the country can integrate its own historical experiences, developmental priorities and social realities. Coal repositioning can be framed not as capitulation to external pressure but as an assertion of energy sovereignty; redirecting a domestic resource to serve long-term national resilience. Such a framing would resonate with the ethos of Article 33 of the Constitution, which mandates that natural resources be harnessed for the greatest prosperity of the people.

The international community will also be watching closely. How Indonesia manages coal will influence its credibility as a climate actor and shape investor confidence in the broader energy sector. If the country demonstrates that coal revenues are being transparently and strategically reinvested into clean energy, it could unlock greater flows of climate finance, concessional loans and technology partnerships. Conversely, if coal is merely prolonged under the guise of transition, skepticism will grow, potentially deterring the very investment needed to achieve the renewable vision.

The narrative power of repositioning coal lies in turning a liability into leverage. Coal built Indonesia’s industrial past, but it does not have to be an albatross around the neck of its future. By converting its fiscal benefits into renewable investment, transforming its industrial role into higher-value products and using its reserves as a strategic buffer, coal can be recast as an enabler of the clean energy era, rather than its obstacle.

The stakes are high. Indonesia’s aspiration to become a green industrial powerhouse by 2045 will falter if coal is mishandled. But if managed wisely, coal could serve as the launchpad for the next chapter of national development, one in which energy security, economic resilience, and environmental stewardship converge.

In the end, the story of coal in Indonesia will be judged not by how long it persisted, but by how wisely it was repositioned. The clean energy era is not about erasing the past; it is about harnessing it to finance and secure a more sustainable future. Coal lit Indonesia’s path to prosperity. Now it must fund the journey toward sovereignty in a cleaner, more resilient age.",https://cdn.observerid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Feiral-Rizky-Batubara-2.webp,N,,2025-09-14 05:58:35.730966

LAS VEGAS, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Exhibitors at RE+, North America's largest clean energy expo in Las Vegas, warned that U.S. tariffs and policy uncertainty pose major challenges for the global renewable energy industry, disrupting supply chains and complicating project planning.

The expo, held from Monday to Thursday, brought together exhibitors and industry professionals worldwide to showcase the latest solar, wind and energy storage technologies, explore new products, forge partnerships, and discuss trends shaping the renewable energy sector.

Behind the bustling exhibition halls, however, many companies voiced concerns over tariff-driven cost pressures and supply chain disruptions.

""Tariff hikes have brought significant cost pressure, forcing companies to pass the increases on to downstream customers, namely the end consumers,"" said Cheng Wang, CEO of Xenerpower, a Texas-based maker of transformers, switchgears and switchboards.

The uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and clean energy policies, along with rising costs, could severely impact the U.S. clean energy sector, particularly the solar and wind industries, Wang told Xinhua.

""When subsidies were in place, companies could fully cover their costs and even receive additional financial support. Now, with tax incentives removed and stricter approval standards, many projects have been forced to pause or be canceled,"" Wang noted.

For Premier PV, an Arkansas-based solar solutions company, tariffs are complicating component sourcing.

""For the parts and the raw materials, we do have quite a bit of supplies from Europe, the DC feeder cables come from either China or India, and lugs from India,"" said Brian Moore, the company's director of business development.

""There's some tariff the international components will carry ... at one point this year, the tariff went up to 125 percent. It's crazy. But it didn't actually go through, so it got reduced down,"" Moore added.

On U.S. energy policy, Moore said that President Donald Trump's administration has not actively supported renewable energy development.

""Trump keeps fighting against renewable energy. At the same time, for energy independence, the fastest to deploy is generally going to be renewable energy. At least for the next four or five years, we really don't see a way for them to get around it. That's a trend,"" he said.

He added that independent of government subsidies, tech companies with high energy demands -- such as data centers -- are likely to continue pursuing renewable energy projects.

Some companies are taking a wait-and-see approach as they navigate the volatile tariff environment.

Jeannette Holton, senior communications manager at EcoFlow, a multinational specializing in portable power and home solar systems, told Xinhua the company is closely monitoring the situation and will reassess its pricing strategy as needed.

""Our business model isn't really focused on the tariff situation, because we know it's always up and down, and it's constantly changing,"" she said.

Looking ahead, Wang said the future of U.S. clean energy remains uncertain, with corporate planning and investment under heavy pressure. ■",,N,,2025-09-14 06:58:41.840831

As buyers race against the clock ahead of the October 1 deadline, projections indicate that while this surge is likely to lead to an immediate influx of EV purchases, a subsequent decline in sales is expected once the incentives are no longer available.

Historically, the financial benefits provided through these tax credits have played a vital role in encouraging consumers to transition to electric vehicles. However, industry analysts suggest that the advantages of owning an EV extend beyond initial incentives. Many new EV owners who are experiencing the benefits of electric driving—such as cost savings on fuel, reduced maintenance needs, and the convenience of home charging—are expected to share their positive experiences with friends and family. This word-of-mouth marketing could catalyze a broader shift in consumer attitudes toward EVs.

As new buyers take the plunge and enjoy the advantages of their electric vehicles, a ripple effect may occur. Those who are influenced by these early adopters—co-workers, friends, and relatives—might become more inclined to consider an EV for their next vehicle purchase, even in the absence of financial incentives. While some consumers may initially hesitate to make a purchase immediately after the credits expire, feeling they may have missed out on savings, the overall awareness and interest in electric vehicles could still lead to additional sales over time.

There is also a discussion around the timing and impact of the EV purchase surge. Some argue that the tax credits, if retained, might support a steadier growth of EV sales over time, easing the transition for consumers. Yet, there’s an interesting perspective suggesting that the accelerated sales during this window could set off a cascading effect as early adopters ignite further interest. This phenomenon could potentially lead to quicker adoption rates among the broader population, pushing society closer to the goal of reaching 50% EV sales sooner.

The potential for a cyclical pattern—where incentives are phased out, leading to an immediate surge, followed by a return of incentives—has also been considered. Such a cycle might not only promote an explosive burst of sales but also ensure renewed support mechanisms for EV buyers in the future.

As the deadline for these financial incentives approaches, the electric vehicle market stands at a pivotal junction, with upcoming consumer behaviors and industry shifts likely to shape the landscape of EV adoption well into the future.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Surge-in-Electric-Vehicle-Purchases-Anticipated-Before-Tax-Credit-Expiration.jpeg,N,,2025-09-14 04:58:03.278924

The European Union has threatened retaliatory tariffs, including on Kentucky bourbon.
What does that mean for Kentucky bourbon makers?","Bankers aren’t typically required to wear a uniform, but for a while, many did: a dark Patagonia vest with a dress shirt and slacks.

The look was so widely associated with finance that it developed a nickname, the “Midtown Uniform,” a reference to the New York City neighborhood known for its many investment banks and law firms. It even had an Instagram account with 168,000 followers.

When he unexpectedly found himself at the helm of a successful clothing company, it provoked an identity crisis of sorts. Even when he couldn’t make payroll, Chouinard refused to accept outside investments or consider an initial public offering. He declined offers to sell the company to Berkshire Hathaway and Ralph Lauren, and early on turned down the promise of a $100 million payday if he let the investment bank Robertson Stephens lead an I.P.O.

Although he ultimately became a billionaire himself, Chouinard boasted of his children that “both believe that billionaires represent a policy failure,” adding: “They were brought up right.”

Patagonia pared back sales to financial and tech firms in 2019, uncomfortable with having its products become hot commodities on Wall Street. Many of those Patagonia vests were issued to interns on orientation day and tossed aside a few months later when the interns moved on to a new job. That kind of disposable mind-set was antithetical to Chouinard, who wanted to make things that lasted a lifetime.

It wasn’t the first time he had deliberately throttled the company’s growth, fearing that it would be impossible to scale the business without compromising his high environmental and ethical standards. In 2011, Patagonia ran an ad in The New York Times that read “Don’t Buy This Jacket.”

And still, the company kept getting bigger, establishing a reputation as a small corporation with a big cultural influence.

Forbes magazine placed Chouinard on its annual list of billionaires in 2017, pegging his net worth at a cool $1 billion.

It made Chouinard livid. “It really, really pissed me off,” he said.

His reaction stood in sharp contrast to most American billionaires, many of whom flaunt their fortunes. But material possessions never meant much to Chouinard, who still lives in a log cabin cluttered with secondhand furniture and cooks off the same cast iron skillet he’s had for 50 years.

In 2022, determined to get off the Forbes list, Chouinard resolved to get rid of his wealth once and for all. He considered selling to a like-minded billionaire, handing ownership of the company over to its employees or reincorporating in Switzerland or Denmark, countries that accommodate charitable corporations.

But none of those options satisfied all of Chouinard’s requirements, which included ridding himself of his billionaire status, protecting the integrity of Patagonia and funneling more money to causes like conservation.

In the end, he and his family took the unusual step of giving away their equity in Patagonia to a new series of trusts and nonprofit organizations that now distribute the company’s profits to environmental activism. (Critics accused them of dodging taxes.)

It was a complex transaction, full of legal intricacies and complex paperwork, and Chouinard and his team didn’t do it alone.

Rather, to figure out how to get the deal done, they hired a merchant bank, BDT — just the kind of place where you’d find analysts wearing the Midtown Uniform.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

The Murdoch family settled a yearslong feud over the future of its media empire. Rupert Murdoch’s elder son, Lachlan, has cemented his place as leader of the powerful conservative media outlet after the family agreed to a multibillion-dollar deal. Three Murdoch siblings — Prue, Liz and James — will get $1.1 billion each for their shares in the family business in return for ending their succession fight.

The Ellison family is said to be eyeing a megamedia roll-up. A deal would combine Paramount Global, the media group controlled by David Ellison, with Warner Bros. Discovery — potentially bringing CNN, CBS News, HBO Max and Paramount Plus under one roof. Shares of both companies rose on the report. It was a momentous week for Ellison’s father, Larry, a co-founder of Oracle, who briefly became the world’s wealthiest man after the tech giant reported a knockout forecast.

Traders upped the odds for interest-rate cuts. The futures market was forecasting yesterday that the Federal Reserve would lower its benchmark lending-rate three times this year after jobless claims rose to a four-year high. That’s even though the Consumer Price Index on Thursday showed inflation on a re-accelerating path. Another factor: The Trump administration moved a step closer to getting Stephen Miran, a close adviser to the president, nominated to the central bank in time for next week’s meeting.

Other big deals: Oracle said it had added hundreds of billions of dollars in future contract revenue during its most recent quarter, sending its shares skyrocketing (and briefly making its co-founder Larry Ellison the world’s richest person). OpenAI took a big step toward reorganizing as a for-profit. Giorgio Armani’s will directs heirs to sell an initial 15 percent stake in his company within 18 months. And Air Taxis get another boost from President Trump.

Kentucky’s governor wants Democrats to get real

And he has become a force for renewable energy development in his coal state. Under his watch over the last six years, Kentucky has attracted two electric vehicle battery plants totaling $8 billion in investment. In August, the governor scored another clean energy victory, securing a $2 billion investment from Ford Motor to remake its Louisville plant into an electric truck hub.

Those investments have helped counter the nearly 15,000 coal jobs lost in the state since 2011. But Beshear’s clean energy agenda faces mounting hurdles. President Trump has pushed forward policies that undercut the electric vehicle industry, creating uncertainty that contributed to a halt in hiring at one of Kentucky’s electric vehicle battery plants.

Beshear spoke to DealBook about his plans to make Kentucky an E.V. powerhouse, whether a 2028 presidential run is on the horizon and what can be done about the rise in political violence. The interview has been condensed and edited.

The Trump administration has cut the federal government’s $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, and many analysts expect sales to dip after it expires. Why make a bet on electric vehicles now?

A lot of people have tried to fight the future, and none of them have ever won. E.V.s are coming. They will be a significant part, if not a dominant part, of the automotive economy.

When I look at the rollback of the E.V. credits, yes, I’m disappointed with the president, but I’m really disappointed with Kentucky Representative Brett Guthrie, who pushed that bill through the House. Guthrie has both Kentucky’s BlueOval battery plant, which will employ 5,000 people, and the Envision plant, which will employ 2,000 people, in his district.

Ford delayed production of its electric truck at the BlueOval plant to 2028. What makes you confident Ford’s latest investment in the state will go through?

You don’t build a multibillion-dollar facility if you’re not going to use it. Ford has repeatedly assured me that it’s only a matter of when, and not a matter of if. I take them at their word. I believe the private sector is showing people very clearly that the economy is and will continue to head in the E.V. direction.

Beyond the electric vehicle industry, President Trump’s tariffs have dealt a blow to your state’s bourbon industry, which produces 95 percent of the world’s bourbon.

The other 5 percent is counterfeit.

Ha. Many Canadian provinces have stopped importing alcoholic beverages from the U.S. The European Union has threatened retaliatory tariffs, including on Kentucky bourbon. What does that mean for Kentucky bourbon makers?

Donald Trump’s tariff policy is the most destructive economic policy I’ve seen in my lifetime. What’s happening with bourbon is both the result of tariffs and the president’s misguided foreign policy. So tariffs are impacting the E.U., and the countermeasures that we’re seeing with bourbon in Canada, it’s primarily that the president has insulted them over and over.

Your podcast was recently picked up by SiriusXM. You’ve said that the show is meant to demonstrate a kind of realness you don’t often see in politicians. What do you mean by that?

Oftentimes all you see from a governor or a senator or even a C.E.O. are their policies. But we need to see each other more as human beings, especially right now.

When we get there, we can create grace and space to disagree on some things, but come together on others. So when I describe the reason that I veto anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation, I talk about it being because of my faith. I believe all children are children of God and we shouldn’t be picking on them. That provides a different way that people can hear someone who is disagreeing with them, and help them recognize that they’re maybe doing it for the right reasons.

Do you think Democrats are going to need more of that realness in 2028?

Democrats need to communicate across as many new platforms as possible and haven’t. That’s why I think that Gov. Gavin Newsom’s podcast is really important. Mine tries not to be an overly political voice. I want to make sure it’s a place where people can come and process all this complicated, difficult news.

Are you planning to run in 2028?

Right now I’m out there trying to be a reasonable voice in the chaos, to be a voice of common sense, common ground and getting things done. Next year, I’m fully committed to this job as governor and being the head of the Democratic Governors Association. And then after that, we’ll sit down with my family and I, and we’ll consider it.

Charlie Kirk was assassinated on Wednesday. His killing is the latest incident in a surge of political violence. I’m wondering what you think can be done to address this trend.

What happened yesterday is awful. Leaders have a choice right now to say that violence is wrong no matter who it’s perpetrated against, or to say violence is wrong when it’s perpetrated against people like me or that I agree with now. Now is the time to take the stand to say all of it’s wrong and all of it has to end.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/business/13DB-PATAGONIA-VEST2/13DB-PATAGONIA-VEST2-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 00:58:09.898420

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.
The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/09/68c5fc454680e4.86648230.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 00:58:51.310725

The facility will transform forest byproducts, such as sustainably sourced wood waste and thinnings, into low-carbon fuels like renewable naphtha and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Governor Greg Abbott announced the project in 2022 with an initial $1.7 billion investment, which is expected to create over 140 permanent jobs. USA BioEnergy has secured more than 1,600 acres in Bon Wier for the refinery, aiming to turn an idle property into a clean energy hub by 2025.

The refinery has entered a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines for up to 680 million gallons of SAF. The facility plans to produce between 34 million and 65 million gallons of renewable fuels annually, contingent on the final design. USA BioEnergy confirmed the implementation of Honeywell’s Experion PKS control system at the Bon Wier plant, with Johnson Matthey also joining as a technology collaborator.

""By utilizing forest thinnings for bioenergy production with carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our integration with technology providers like Honeywell will help us create a fully integrated, alternative fuels solution,"" said Nick Andrews, CEO of USA BioEnergy.

The project is benefiting from approximately $150 million in state, county, and federal credits and tax incentives. Local support includes organizations such as the Texas Forest Country Partnership, Texas Forestry Association, and the City of Newton.

""This advanced-fuels facility development milestone underscores USA BioEnergy’s commitment to the future of aviation and energy security,"" Andrews said in a February statement. ""We also appreciate the opportunity to create good-paying jobs in Newton County, Texas, which has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the state. We are proud this project is a win-win-win for the area, the industry, and our business objectives.""

Once operational, the plant is expected to employ roughly 200 people full-time, alongside several hundred construction jobs during the build-out phase. The facility will also provide a new market for East Texas forestry byproducts, abundant in Newton and surrounding counties.

Despite the land purchase and new technology partnerships, construction has not yet begun. USA BioEnergy says engineering and design work is ongoing, with construction expected to take about two years once it starts. Full operations are projected for 2028 or 2029.

For now, the project remains a mix of anticipation and waiting.

The auto industry’s landscape is shifting fast, and not just because of new models or tech. Donald Trump’s rollback of emissions standards and the elimination of federal EV tax credits have thrown a wrench into the works—especially for companies that bet big on electric vehicles. If you’re wondering who’s winning, who’s losing, and what it means for the cars you’ll see on the road, let’s break it down.

Why Are Ford, GM, and Stellantis Suddenly Saving Billions?

For years, automakers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis had to pay up—big time—if they didn’t meet federal fuel economy targets. The system worked like this: if a company sold too many gas-guzzlers, it had to buy regulatory credits from brands with cleaner fleets, like Tesla and Rivian. According to Bloomberg, GM alone shelled out $3.5 billion on credits since 2022. Ford and Stellantis? Also in the billions.

But with Trump’s rollback, the financial penalty for missing those targets is gone. That means Detroit’s Big Three can focus on their bread and butter—trucks and SUVs—without worrying about writing checks to their rivals. Ford CEO Jim Farley even called it a “multibillion-dollar opportunity,” and the company’s already retooling its Oakville plant to build Super Duty pickups instead of EVs. GM is scaling back EV production, and Stellantis is bringing back the Hemi V8. It’s like the clock just turned back a decade.

What’s the Fallout for Tesla, Rivian, and Smaller EV Startups?

Here’s where things get dicey. Tesla and Rivian didn’t just make money selling cars—they made a killing selling those regulatory credits. With that revenue stream drying up, Tesla could lose over $1 billion a year, according to industry estimates. For startups, the picture is even bleaker. Take Slate, for example. Their affordable electric truck was counting on the $7,500 federal tax credit to stay competitive. Now, with a sticker price near $30,000 and no tax break, their business model looks shaky at best.

It’s not just about lost profits. The end of tax credits makes EVs less attractive to buyers, especially in a market where price is king. Smaller brands that don’t have the deep pockets of Ford or GM may struggle to survive. We could see some names disappear before they ever really get started.

Is the EPA Abandoning Its Own Mission?

This is where the story takes a twist. The Environmental Protection Agency’s mission is crystal clear: protect human health and the environment. Yet, by supporting the rollback of emissions standards, the agency is doing the opposite. The EPA’s own website debunks myths about EVs—like the idea that they’re worse for the climate or will crash the power grid. In fact, J.D. Power and other analysts have shown that EVs are cheaper to own over the long haul when you factor in fuel and maintenance.

So why the about-face? Critics argue that the EPA is now prioritizing political directives over its stated mission. The result? Automakers are free to build more polluting vehicles, and consumers lose out on billions in potential savings. It’s a head-scratcher, especially when the science on emissions and public health is so clear.

What Does This Mean for Consumers and the Environment?

If you’re in the market for a new car, you’ll notice the difference. Expect more choices in trucks and SUVs, fewer affordable EVs, and less incentive to go electric. For the environment, the stakes are even higher. The rollback could lead to higher emissions, more fuel burned, and a slower transition to cleaner transportation.

But here’s the thing—change in the auto industry is never a straight line. Consumer demand, state-level policies, and global trends still matter. California and several other states are pushing ahead with stricter standards, and the global market for EVs is growing, especially in Europe and China. Automakers who ignore those trends do so at their own risk.

The big takeaway? Navigating the new rules of the road isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end. Whether you’re a car buyer, an industry insider, or just someone who cares about clean air, staying informed—and flexible—will put you in the driver’s seat.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trump-emissions-rollback-reshapes-auto-industry-winners-and-losers.avif,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:31.825683

According to Canary Media, leaders in the state's energy sector filed an urgent request Aug. 22 asking regulators to expedite approvals for new renewable projects. Just five days later, the utilities commission approved an accelerated timeline for permitting and construction, a rare move for state energy regulators.

The plan would finalize approvals by mid-2026 for 4 gigawatts of new wind and solar power, 200 megawatts of thermal power, and 300 megawatts of battery storage. Colorado already has 5 gigawatts of wind and 4.5 gigawatts of solar installed, meaning this expansion could significantly boost the state's capacity to deliver affordable, reliable clean energy before the Trump administration's new energy-constraining laws take effect.

The clear threat of higher energy prices caused by the administration's policies has created a rare alignment of interests among utility providers and ratepayer advocates to take advantage of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits right now.

Colorado's largest utility provider, Xcel Energy, stated that the accelerated plan could save customers $5 billion over the next two decades, providing critical relief as electricity demand rises faster than it has in decades. More clean power means less reliance on volatile coal and gas prices, helping protect residents from future price spikes.

Wind, solar, and storage projects can also significantly reduce planet-overheating pollution, lower air pollution from dirty energy plants, and make communities more resilient as demand for power surges from electric vehicles and costly data centers.

Colorado's push is being watched closely across the country. California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a similar executive order to help projects meet expiring federal deadlines.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis urged authorities to ""eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks for renewable projects,"" adding that ""getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers; by maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they're available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the State can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.""

The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies.
This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.
The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.
""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement.","The Trump administration has unveiled a pilot program to accelerate the use of electric air taxis, a move aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in airspace technology.

The Department of Transportation on Friday said the Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop ""new frameworks and regulations for enabling safe operations"" and form partnerships with private sector companies as well as with state and local governments.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement on Friday. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. That means more high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity.""

The program will include at least five pilot projects and will run for three years after the first project is up and running, the department said. The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies. The aircraft will also be used to test their effectiveness in emergency situations, such as airlift and medical transport.

The program would allow the testing of aircraft both unmanned and piloted, and which may be capable of carrying passengers, before they complete FAA certification, a process that can take years. Aircraft must have FAA certification before carrying cargo or passengers when flying commercially, according to federal regulations.

This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.

In June 2023, the FAA greenlit a plan from Joby Aviation, a California-based aviation company, to begin test flights of an electric flying taxi prototype. The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.

""We've spent more than 15 years building the aircraft technology and operational capabilities that are defining advanced aerial mobility, and we're ready to bring our services to communities,"" Joby's chief policy officer Greg Bowles said in a statement. ""We look forward to demonstrating our aircraft's maturity and delivering early operations in cities and states nationwide.""

Another company, Archer Aviation, also said Friday that it plans to participate in the program.

""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement. ""These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.""

The FAA said it is accepting proposals and a minimum of five participants will be selected, according to an unpublished federal notice about the program that is set to become public on Tuesday.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business.
Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?
While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.
Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.","With the federal government rolling back billions of dollars in incentives for renewable-energy development, experts have sounded the alarm over a widely overlooked yet highly likely impact: rising insurance costs.

What's happening?

In addition to ending significant tax incentives previously available to projects ranging in scale from home solar installations to massive wind farms, increased tariffs also have made it more expensive to purchase necessary materials, Canaan Crouch, the executive vice president and environmental broker at Jencap Specialty Insurance Services, told Insurance Business.

As a result, investors have significantly scaled back on renewable-energy development in the United States. According to BloombergNEF, in the first half of 2025, such investments dropped a staggering 36% from just a year prior, a loss of more than $20 billion in funding.

Crouch warned that the impact on consumers likely would be even greater and more immediate than on utility-scale projects.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business. ""So, consumers are probably seeing a bigger impact.""

On top of these direct effects, Crouch cautioned that these industry-wide changes also would have important secondary impacts, such as in the insurance market.

For example, when a homeowner decides to install solar panels on their roof, they must find an insurance carrier that is willing to cover the project's risks. The rising cost of even such small-scale projects has made insurers more hesitant to do so.

""Stay informed about what's happening with subsidies, tariffs, and inflationary pressures, because those are the factors that directly shape the risks we're insuring,"" cautioned Crouch, per Insurance Business.

With fewer carriers willing to insure such projects, prices for such coverage will inevitably increase, Crouch predicted.

While the market has yet to reflect such pressures, Crouch warned, ""If I had to read the tea leaves, there's going to be an increase in price.""

Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?

The impact that government policies have on insurance prices, and the ability to get insurance coverage at all, has been an overlooked yet significant aspect of the current administration's recent changes.

If individuals and companies are unable to insure renewable-energy projects, or if the cost of doing so rises significantly, fewer homeowners will be able to install solar panels, and fewer utility-scale renewable-energy projects will be built.

The result will not only hinder efforts to transition the U.S. economy toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy but likely will harm the nation's economy as a whole.

Even as renewable-energy investments in the U.S. cratered by more than one-third, such investments globally reached record highs, per BloombergNEF. This has put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage and puts the country at risk of falling behind in the energy revolution taking place throughout much of the world.

While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

Simply put, renewable-energy investors put off by recent changes in U.S. policy have found other countries to invest in.

As companies and countries around the globe continue to race for supremacy in artificial intelligence, powering the massive, energy-hungry data centers that make AI possible has become a key distinguishing factor. If the U.S. continues to fall behind on building the power sources of the future, it could significantly hurt the country's ability to compete in the AI race.

What's being done about it?

For the U.S. to once again shift course and regain its momentum in the transition toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy will require change at the political level.

To help make this happen, you can use your voice by contacting your elected representatives and letting them know where you stand on issues like renewable-energy tax incentives and tariffs on materials used in renewable-energy development. And, when election season rolls around, you also can make a difference by voting for candidates who share your views.

Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.

EnergySage offers free online tools that make it easy to compare quotes from local solar installers and to take advantage of available incentives.

Gavin Newsom has championed as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks is in the hands of state lawmakers.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature is slated to vote Saturday on whether to extend the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013. It allows major greenhouse gas emitters to buy emission allowances from the state, with fewer available over time. Money from the sales fund climate change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution - all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said after striking the deal this week.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature will vote on another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

Cap and trade is an important cost-effective tool for curbing carbon emissions, said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, the California state director for the Environmental Defense Fund.

“Supporting this program and making this commitment into the future is extremely important - now more than ever,” she said.

But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn’t go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Council for Justice and Accountability.

Critics have also said it will increase the cost of living.

“This moving forward, instead of lowering costs, it makes California even more expensive,” Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland said. “They’re raising the price of energy and gas and goods and services.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It’s played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would streamline permits for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The state could refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers will also vote on a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/California_Legislature_93316_c0-370-7547-4772_s1200x700.jpg?92f64011319994b084bf1a50ddc7b2baf746a509,N,,2025-09-14 00:58:39.504362

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would see industrial facilities like coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, and steel mills no longer have to track and report the amount of carbon dioxide, methane, and other emissions they emit—a requirement that had been in place since 2010.

The agency said that U.S. businesses could save as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over the next decade as a result of the change. Some experts have argued that the societal costs of emissions from companies in the U.S. could run into the tens of trillions by 2050.

The EPA in its release said that requiring facilities to report emissions had “no material impact on improving human health and the environment.” It comes after months of work by the Trump administration to dismantle various federal programs designed to combat climate change and cuts to research funding to study the phenomenon.

The administration’s efforts to pull back on climate change is at odds with the broad scientific consensus that human-driven warming is linked to extreme weather and health risks. A study published in Nature this past week, for example, showed that 180 of the world’s biggest fossil fuel and cement producers made 213 extreme heatwaves between 2000 and 2023 more likely and more dangerous.

What does greenhouse gas reporting do?

Since 2010, the greenhouse gas reporting program has collected emissions data from about 8,000 of the largest industrial facilities in the U.S. from 47 different source categories. In turn, this information has historically been shared with the United Nations, but for the first time in nearly 30 years, the Trump administration missed an April deadline to submit data on U.S. climate emissions.

As part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required industrialized countries to reduce their emissions to combat climate change. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on his first day in office that the U.S. would withdraw from this agreement for the second time (Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement during his first term).

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, said in a statement. “Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

“Unlike other mandatory information collections under the Clean Air Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment. By reducing the overall regulatory burden, current regulated parties will be able to focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits,” an EPA spokesperson told Fast Company in a statement.

Certain oil and gas facilities will still be required to report emissions data as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although the EPA’s proposal would allow these facilities to suspend reporting until 2034.

Critics point to cost of losing data

Environmental advocates criticized the proposal as hampering future policy making.

“With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policymaking,” a former EPA official under the Biden administration told The New York TImes.

The proposal would eliminate data that the public, states, and local policymakers have depended on for more than 15 years, leaving Americans “in the dark” about where pollution is coming from, David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, told The Associated Press.

Before this proposal is finalized, the EPA will hold a virtual public hearing and accept public comments for 47 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-91404426-EPA-to-stop-recording-emissions.jpg",N,,2025-09-13 20:01:20.590584

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said.
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind.
His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.
Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines.","Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.

The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.

Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.

The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature.

Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.

Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.

Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.

“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”

The future of cap and trade reinforced

At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.

The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.

The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”

The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.

Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.

Questioning the affordability premise

The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.

At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.

“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”

Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”

Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”

Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.

Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.

A ‘giveaway to big oil’?

At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there.

The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”

Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”

“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.

Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.

Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern.

The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.

Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels.","The Danish wind giant Ørsted is fighting for its survival after United States President Donald Trump introduced a barrage of orders limiting the growth of the wind power sector. After declaring an energy emergency in the U.S. upon entering office in January, Trump has spent the past eight months introducing executive orders and legislation to strengthen fossil fuel production and limit the expansion of the renewable energy sector. This has led to greater investor uncertainty and has caused project delays and financial harm to green energy producers.

In January, Trump ordered a review of offshore wind permitting and leasing, and in the months since he has introduced a host of orders and laws aimed at curbing wind energy development, which have led to the halt of several major projects, In August, Europe’s largest wind power company, Ørsted, released a statement blaming President Trump for derailing its business model after its market value dropped by nearly a third. It is now fighting to get its business on track.

Ørsted received approval from shareholders for its $9.4 billion rights issue in early September. The company was forced to raise new capital after its profits fell in recent months due to project delays and investor uncertainty, among other factors. The Trump administration halted work on Ørsted’s 704-MW Revolution Windfarm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut in August, despite the company holding project permits and works being around 80 percent complete.

This led Ørsted to sue the Trump administration in September, in a bid to get the project moving again. Orsted requested that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismiss the stop-work order, saying it was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and “issued in bad faith”. Orsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables have already invested $5 billion in Revolution Wind, a project which is expected to provide power for over 350,000 homes in the region.

Norway’s wind giant Equinor was one of the companies to support Ørsted’s search for capital, offering $1 billion in funding to help keep it afloat. In a bid of confidence, Equinor said it planned to retain its 10 percent ownership of Ørsted, which it completed last December, making it the second-largest shareholder after the Danish government. The Norwegian firm said it was confident in Ørsted’s underlying business and the competitiveness of offshore wind in the future energy mix. As part of the move, Equinor plans to nominate a candidate to Ørsted’s board of directors.

Ørsted’s shares have fallen in recent months in the face of various challenges, mainly centred around U.S. policy decisions. The firm’s share prices have decreased by around 90 percent from the 2021 peak. The support from Equinor has made some in the industry question whether the two companies could be heading towards a merger.

It is not just Ørsted that has been hit hard by Trump’s attack on the renewable energy sector. President Trump has long hailed the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the most far-reaching climate policy to date, a “Green New Scam. Greatest scam in history, probably.” His blatant attack on green energy from the moment he entered office, and even before, on his campaign trail, has led to greater investor uncertainty in the sector. Many renewable energy producers and cleantech companies now fear cuts in funding and project delays, after several years of high investment and the rapid acceleration of green energy deployment.

In September, the Trump administration instructed around half a dozen government agencies to draft plans to restrict U.S. wind energy development, as Trump labelled wind farms as ugly, expensive, and inefficient. Agencies that have traditionally had little to do with wind energy have been called upon to support efforts to restrict the development of offshore wind farms. At the Health and Human Services Department, officials are now assessing whether wind turbines are emitting electromagnetic fields harmful to human health, while the Department of Defence (War) is probing whether wind projects could pose a threat to national security.

Following the instruction, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. said he was working with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth as part of a “departmental coalition team” to assess the risks from offshore wind farms. “We’re all working together on this issue,” Kennedy said during a cabinet meeting.

Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels. The move will build on previous actions by the Trump administration to curb U.S. wind energy development in favour of oil, gas, and coal, as President Trump looks to largely undo the groundwork laid by the Biden administration for a green transition.

Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said after striking the deal this week.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the extension balanced the state’s ambitious emission-reduction and affordability goals. The Democrat called cap and trade “the cornerstone of our climate strategy.”

But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn’t go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.

GOP lawmakers say cap-and-trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/09/68c5f1c4d41f06.27666104.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-13 19:00:44.176473

The development of a next-generation thermal fluid, called Shell EV-Plus, promises to recharge batteries from 10% to 80% in less than 10 minutes without compromising safety or cell life.

Shell fluid accelerates electric car charging

The breakthrough was made possible by a joint venture between Shell Lubricants and RML Group, a British company specializing in automotive innovation. Together they designed a 34-kWh battery pack that incorporates this thermal fluid based on gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology. (GTL) TECHNOLOGY. This combination allows higher charging currents to be tolerated with precise thermal control.

Under optimal conditions, a light, aerodynamic vehicle consuming 10 km/kWh could recover up to 24 km of range for every minute connected to the charger. This figure far exceeds the 5 km per minute typical of many current models, representing a significant improvement in range per charge time.

The key to performance lies in the ability of the Shell EV-Plus fluid to fill all spaces within the battery pack, maximizing contact with each cell and ensuring efficient heat transfer. Its non-conductive nature allows it to maintain electrical electrical safety while managing the heat generated during fast charging.

Safety and more compact design

In addition to shortening charging times, this breakthrough makes it possible to design more compact battery packs with fewer components and greater thermal stability. This translates into propulse and safer battery packs, suitable for the next generation of electric vehicles.

Shell will showcase this innovation in October during The Battery Show North America in Detroit, one of the most relevant events in the industry. The initiative reinforces Shell’s commitment to the electrification of transportation and the development of solutions that drive the mass adoption of electric vehicles worldwide.

And several new projects in Europe have started the process of eliminating our reliance on oil and gas. The fact that it is right beneath the sea only makes this new development more exciting. TotalEnergies and Air Liquide plan to develop two projects that will deliver about 45,000 t/year of green hydrogen for our ever-growing energy needs. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and only requires some special attention to become the fuel of the future.

The Netherlands has become the home of renewable energy production

That can only become a reality when the system comes online, and like Skynet in the Terminator, it could change the world forever, only this time in a positive way. TotalEnergies has signed agreements with Air Liquide to develop two projects that could aim to tap into the natural reserves of hydrogen sitting in the sea just waiting for us to find them.

The power will be generated mostly by the OranjeWind offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea, and plans to transport the green hydrogen via a pipeline inland towards the Hydrogen Network Rotterdam grid. It forms part of the new trajectory that the Netherlands is heading towards in sustainable energy solutions that meet and exceed the world’s energy needs.

The joint venture plans to construct and operate a 250-MW electrolyzer near the Zeeland refinery in the southern Netherlands, which could be commissioned in 2029, and reduce the site’s CO2 emissions by up to 300,000 t/year. Those are some impressive numbers that will surely drive the world’s big oil companies absolutely insane.

The world is pivoting towards hydrogen as the fuel of the future

Our reliance on fossil fuels needs to end; we are all acutely aware of that truth. Uncomfortable as it may be, the truth hardly spares a moment to consider how we might feel. But the new joint venture is a step towards a sustainable future that all of us, and our descendants, can enjoy and be an active part of. The project has been given the green light and has the world eagerly awaiting the first phase.

To make the deal even sweeter, TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW to be dedicated to producing 15,000 t/year of green hydrogen for the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. So the project is aiming to enter the rest of Europe as well. How will the Europeans react to a whole new mode of energy production that comes from the sea?

While the Netherlands is a small country, they have significant interests in renewable and sustainable energy production, and no matter who you ask, hydrogen is the most viable fuel source for the world’s needs. We just need a practical method of extraction and storage, and then we are off to the races, as they say. It’s a promising sign to see some of the world’s largest energy companies making significant investments in sustainable energy.

The elimination of federal tax credits for electric vehicles is a major move on its own. Paired with the removal of penalties for missing fuel economy targets under CAFE regulations, the result is a playing field with entirely new rules.

The immediate winners are the combustion-heavy brands that can now focus on selling trucks and SUVs without financial punishment. On the other side, Tesla, Rivian, and other EV specialists stand to lose billions, not because demand for their cars will collapse, but because a critical source of revenue has been pulled out from under them. At the center of the storm is an Environmental Protection Agency that appears to be working against the mission printed on its own website.

Cash Flow Reversal

Since 2022, GM has spent some $3.5 billion buying regulatory credits, says Bloomberg. Ford and Stellantis have spent billions as well. That cash went to brands like Tesla and Rivian, which had plenty of credits to sell since their cars emit zero emissions. With the end of EV tax credits and CAFE fines for breaking regulations, Ford, GM and Stellantis can pour the money they would’ve spent on credits back into their own piggy bank.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the policy shift has the “potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity,” noting that the Blue Oval is already retooling its Oakville, Ontario, plant to build Super Duty pickups instead of EVs.

GM is also cutting back on EV production, opting to overhaul factories for gasoline-fueled models. Stellantis, meanwhile, has gone so far as to revive the thirsty Hemi V8 engine, something previously thought dead in the age of electrification. With all of these changes, death might now be coming for some EV brands.

Trouble Ahead For EV Startups

Not only does the end of tax credits make purchasing an EV less palatable for many, but it also means that brands which used to benefit from selling tax credits now need to readjust to the new reality. Smaller brands, though, might be in big trouble. For example, Slate’s trucklet looks almost pointless with a starting price near $30,000 as the EV tax credit was vital to its success.

Even larger brands like Tesla and Rivian have leaned on the pure profit they’ve gained by selling regulatory credits. That money likely won’t be coming back anytime soon and that’s because the EPA seems willing to do just about anything the Trump Administration deems reasonable.

A Mission Ignored

It states plainly that its mission is “to protect human health and the environment.” Love them or hate them, electric vehicles are probably better at that than combustion cars. In fact, the EPA itself has an entire page dedicated to debunking the myths so many like to perpetuate surrounding them.

Things like “EVs are worse for the climate than gas cars,” “EVs are unreliable,” and “EVs will collapse the power grid.” Furthermore, J.D. Power is one of many sources that indicate that when all costs are considered, EVs are cheaper to buy, maintain, and own long-term when compared to combustion cars.

No one argues that people should be forced into one type of car. Choice matters. The government shouldn’t force anyone into a specific car or truck. But supporting policies that improve human health and the environment is what the EPA literally says it’s supposed to do.

By supporting Trump’s rollback of strict fuel economy standards and regulations, the agency is doing the exact opposite of its own mission statement. It’s clearing the way for automakers to build more polluting vehicles, burn more fuel, and erase billions in total consumer savings. If the EPA won’t uphold its own mission, it seems that nobody will.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs - likely for the biggest power users - to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast - twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data - and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/Big_Tech-Electricity_Cutoffs_30745_c0-167-4000-2500_s1200x700.jpg?309b4467e1f3a2a8ff765db9a91ebeb327dbd582,N,,2025-09-13 18:00:39.404137

This package of proposals will bring electricity rates down by improving coordination and efficiency across regional energy markets, reducing interest rates for large-scale transmission projects and redirecting credits from the Cap-and-Invest program to directly reduce the price of electricity for consumers. The new initiatives also support California’s clean energy transition, which requires transmission upgrades and investment to continue advancing.

Below is a statement by Daniel Barad, Western states senior policy manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“While the Trump administration’s fossil fuel fealty continues to exacerbate the climate crisis, the California legislature affirmed its commitment to a clean energy future. Today's sweeping actions will also make energy more affordable for ratepayers at a time when people are struggling to cope with rising costs of living.

“Lowering energy prices for the long haul requires forward-thinking investments in the electricity grid to benefit all Californians. Improving coordination across western energy markets will create a cleaner, more efficient and more reliable grid for decades to come. This will enable California to export more of its excess solar energy to neighboring states while cutting electricity prices at home.

“The reauthorization and restructuring of Cap-and-Invest's climate credits will lower electricity rates for all Californians and incentivize broader electrification, representing an important new chapter for the program.

“Expanding long range, high voltage transmission is essential to bringing additional clean energy projects online and retiring costly, outdated fossil fuel plants. To date, California has struggled to complete these critical projects on time. Public financing of transmission will support acceleration of these projects at a lower cost, leading to increased savings and improved electricity reliability for California ratepayers.

With the 2025 tax filing deadline set for April 15, 20252025 Holidays - United States[ 1 ], the window to claim these credits is rapidly closing. For those seeking to optimize their financial strategy, understanding the interplay between timing, eligibility, and broader economic trends is critical.

The Clock is Ticking

The IRS has not yet published granular details on the 2025 EV credit application process, but the general tax filing deadline remains fixed. According to the IRS's official guidance, individuals must use their online accounts to track eligibility and submission requirementsOnline account for individuals | Internal Revenue Service[ 2 ]. This lack of specificity underscores the importance of acting swiftly. Delays in purchasing or filing could result in missed opportunities, particularly as the labor market evolves under AI-driven disruptions and green transition initiatives[ 3 ].

Strategic Purchase Timelines

While exact credit amounts and eligibility criteria for 2025 remain unclear, historical data from the IRA's implementation in 2023 suggests that credits are contingent on factors such as vehicle price, battery sourcing, and domestic assemblyInflation: Why is it rising across the world and will it stay that way[ 4 ]. Investors should prioritize purchasing qualifying EVs before the end of 2025 to ensure they meet the April 15, 2025, filing deadline. Those who delay risk overlapping with 2026's tax cycle, which may feature revised credit parameters due to inflationary pressures or policy adjustmentsIn charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum[ 5 ].

Broader Economic Considerations

Global inflationary trends, as highlighted by the World Economic Forum, complicate tax planning. Rising prices erode the real value of tax credits over time, making early claiming a prudent strategy. For instance, a $7,500 credit in 2025 may carry less purchasing power in 2026 if inflation persists. Additionally, skill inflation—where demand for specialized labor outpaces supply—could drive up costs for EV-related services, further incentivizing early action.

A Call for Proactive Planning

Businesses and individuals must treat EV tax credits as a dynamic asset rather than a static benefit. This means:

1. Monitoring IRS updates via online accounts to stay ahead of procedural changesOnline account for individuals | Internal Revenue Service[ 2 ].

2. Aligning purchases with projected income levels to maximize credit utilization.

3. Factoring in macroeconomic risks, such as interest rate fluctuations, which could affect borrowing costs for EV financing.

Conclusion

The April 15, 2025, deadline is not merely a regulatory marker but a strategic

for EV investors. By combining timely purchases with an awareness of macroeconomic shifts, stakeholders can secure tax advantages while navigating the uncertainties of a post-pandemic, AI-driven economy. As the IRS and policymakers continue to refine the IRA's implementation, proactive planning remains the cornerstone of tax-advantaged investing.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757794607154.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-13 19:00:16.053172

Under SB 787, state agencies, labor unions, environmental organizations, and clean energy industries will coordinate supply chain development for three key sectors: batteries, offshore wind, and building-decarbonization technologies.

“The Trump administration is denying climate change and torpedoing clean energy projects nationwide. California can step up and continue to grow its global leadership in the fight against climate change,” said Sen. McNerney, D-Pleasanton. “SB 787 will help California meet our clean energy goals while also creating family-supporting manufacturing jobs, accelerating the deployment of affordable clean energy, and advancing economic development goals across every region of the state.”

The state Senate early today approved SB 787 on a 29-8 vote, after the state Assembly voted 53-9 in favor of the bill on Friday evening. SB 787 now goes to the governor’s desk for consideration. If signed into law, SB 787 would take effect March 1, 2027. The legislation is sponsored by the United Auto Workers (UAW).

“UAW is committed to an equitable vision for decarbonizing California’s economy. Part of that vision is growing good union manufacturing jobs in the industries of the future, while accelerating clean energy deployment and bringing down the price of energy for working class Californians,” said Mike Miller, director of UAW Region 6, which represents 100,000 members across various industries in California. “With SB 787, we’ve sponsored a bill championed by Senator McNerney that will go a long way towards reaching these critical goals in an affordable manner. We’re proud to be joined by a broad coalition of unions, environmentalists, businesses, community groups, counties, utilities, and other organizations who have linked arms in supporting this commonsense measure.”

California has established ambitious goals for building a green economy that accelerates the deployment of affordable clean energy and provides quality jobs. However, the state lacks a comprehensive approach to building the clean energy supply chains and workforce needed to achieve its goals.

If combined with strong planning and implementation policies, these clean energy goals could also support strong economic growth and quality jobs across the state. According to the CEC’s SB 525 Offshore Wind Strategic Plan, California has the potential to reach 11,280 supply chain jobs by 2045 for offshore wind alone. The state’s GDP could grow upwards of $5 billion.

SB 787 formalizes partnerships between state agencies, labor, environmental organizations, and clean energy industries to coordinate supply chain development for of batteries, including electric vehicle and grid-scale batteries, along with building decarbonization technologies and offshore wind.

Conclusion The U.S. climate policy landscape remains a mosaic of federal incentives, state-level innovation, and international uncertainty.","The U.S. climate policy landscape in 2025 is defined by a dual trajectory: aggressive domestic decarbonization efforts and an ambiguous stance on international climate diplomacy, particularly as the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, approaches. While federal and state-level initiatives have accelerated clean energy adoption, the absence of explicit U.S. policy statements on COP30 participation or the ""honest dialogue"" framework—implied to address gaps in climate action—has created uncertainty for investors. This analysis explores how evolving policy dynamics could reshape subsidies, renewable infrastructure, and ESG-aligned equities, while identifying sectors poised for disruption or growth.

The Domestic Climate Momentum: A Foundation for Growth

The Biden administration's climate agenda, bolstered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has injected over $369 billion into clean energy projects, including tax credits for solar, wind, and electric vehicles (EVs) 2023 Annual Report | All Hands on Deck - U.S. Climate Alliance, [https://usclimatealliance.org/report/2023-annual-report/][ 1 ]. According to a 2024 Rand Corporation report, these incentives have catalyzed private-sector investments, with the U.S. Climate Alliance—encompassing 25 states—projected to meet its 2025 emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ]. This momentum has directly fueled demand for renewable infrastructure, with solar and wind capacity expected to grow by 12% and 8%, respectively, in 2025 U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

However, the uneven pace of state-level action remains a risk. While California and Iowa have emerged as leaders in clean energy adoption, states like Texas continue to prioritize fossil fuels, creating a fragmented market. For investors, this disparity highlights the need to scrutinize regional policy risks and opportunities, particularly in grid modernization and storage technologies.

COP30 and the ""Honest Dialogue"": Implications for Global and Domestic Markets

Though no direct U.S. policy statements on COP30 strategy changes have been identified, the conference's focus on the ""Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T""—aiming to scale international climate finance to $1.3 trillion annually by 2035—could indirectly influence domestic subsidies. If the U.S. shifts toward a more critical ""honest dialogue"" on climate finance, as suggested by COP30's emphasis on transparency and accountability, it may reevaluate its contributions to global funds or demand stricter reporting from recipients. Such a pivot could redirect federal funding toward domestic projects, particularly in disadvantaged communities, amplifying the IRA's existing equity-focused provisions U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

The logistical challenges facing COP30—such as Brazil's accommodation crisis and infrastructure controversies—also underscore the risks of delayed global climate finance. For U.S. investors, this could mean heightened volatility in ESG-aligned equities, particularly in firms reliant on international partnerships or carbon credit markets.

Sector-Specific Opportunities and Risks

Renewable Infrastructure and EVs: The IRA's tax credits and state-level cap-and-invest programs are likely to sustain growth in solar, wind, and EV manufacturing. However, supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures remain near-term headwinds.

Energy Storage and Grid Modernization: With the U.S. Climate Alliance targeting 100% clean electricity by 2035, investments in battery storage and smart grid technologies are critical. Federal grants under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will play a pivotal role in scaling these solutions U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

ESG-Linked Equities: A potential ""honest dialogue"" on climate action could lead to stricter ESG reporting standards, pressuring underperforming firms while rewarding those with verifiable decarbonization strategies. Sectors like green hydrogen and carbon capture may see renewed interest if policy clarity emerges post-COP30.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Diversify Exposure: Prioritize companies with diversified revenue streams across domestic and international markets to mitigate risks from shifting climate finance priorities.

Monitor Policy Signals: Track state-level climate initiatives, as they often serve as precursors to federal action. For example, California's Advanced Clean Trucks rule has already influenced national EV adoption trends.

Engage in ESG Due Diligence: As COP30 emphasizes accountability, firms with transparent emissions data and robust sustainability frameworks will likely outperform peers.

Conclusion

The U.S. climate policy landscape remains a mosaic of federal incentives, state-level innovation, and international uncertainty. While the absence of direct statements on COP30 strategy complicates near-term forecasts, the underlying momentum in clean energy suggests that long-term investment opportunities outweigh risks. Investors who align with the IRA's market-driven incentives and prepare for potential shifts in global climate finance will be well-positioned to navigate this evolving terrain.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd24f7700bc002.png,N,,2025-09-13 15:59:36.846040

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

""Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency's statutory obligations,'' he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/environment_AP_25255740590738_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 21:59:25.420098

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

""Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency's statutory obligations,'' he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/environment_AP_25255740590738_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 18:00:29.206785

Expanding Renewable Energy Within a Diverse Generation Mix

Georgia Power is seeking additional renewable resources to continue to build a reliable, diversified generation portfolio through competitive RFP processes, which help maintain flexibility amid changing market conditions and enable the company to continue to provide more carbon-free energy to customers.

The CARES 2025 RFP, also approved in the 2022 IRP Final Order, was recently issued with bids due in August. CARES 2025 RFP bidders were asked to submit utility-scale solar or solar plus storage bids to meet a target of up to 2,000 MW of utility-scale solar including any remaining unfilled utility-scale resources from the CARES 2023 RFP program. These utility-scale solar projects are expected to have commercial operation dates as early as 2028.

Georgia Power’s 2025 IRP, approved in July, highlights the additional procurement of a total of up to 4,000 MW of renewable resources by 2035, with an initial target of 1,100 MW of new renewable resources sought through competitive utility-scale and distributed generation procurements. The company anticipates issuing RFPs in 2026 for these new resources, which would expand the company’s renewable resource portfolio to approximately 11,000 MW by 2035.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/griceconnect/sports/georgia-power-cares-solar-panels.png;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-09-13 15:00:00.693981

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs - likely for the biggest power users - to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast - twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data - and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/Big_Tech-Electricity_Cutoffs_30745_c0-167-4000-2500_s1200x700.jpg?309b4467e1f3a2a8ff765db9a91ebeb327dbd582,N,,2025-09-13 19:01:05.250478

Final Thoughts Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise to revolutionize the way we power electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, and renewable energy systems.","The most solid alternative to widely used lithium-ion batteries, with the benefits of improved safety, higher energy density, longer lifespan, and faster charging, is almost here.

This promising alternative is solid-state batteries (SSBs), which replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes, thereby eliminating the fire risk and allowing for more compact designs, as well as supporting more charge cycles before degradation.

A recent study1 from the University of California reviewed the technology and found it capable of transforming not just electric cars but also consumer electronics and energy storage. The key to it all is chemistry and engineering.

“By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires.”

– Lead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR

Unlike the liquid in traditional lithium-ion batteries, which degrade over time, pose fire risk, and limit charging speed, the solid material used in solid-state batteries offers a more stable and safer environment, enabling more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.

With its superior qualities compared to current lithium-ion batteries, SSBs have been gaining a lot of traction among companies, but so far, the technology remains in the development stage. Not for long now, though.

Real-World Validation: Solid-State Batteries in EVs (QS/VW Demo)

This week, solid-state battery developer QuantumScape (QS +12.43%), along with its business partner PowerCo, made a live demonstration of its energy-dense solid-state lithium-metal batteries powering a vehicle.

PowerCo is the battery business of the Volkswagen Group, one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and the largest carmaker in Europe. VW is the owner of brands like Audi, Bentley, CUPRA, Ducati, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, and Škoda. The company also produces light commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles like MAN and Scania, while CARIAD is the software and technology unit for all Volkswagen Group vehicles.

VW Group and PowerCo have been long-term investors in QuantumScape’s solid-state technology and have been testing their prototype cells for years.

Now, for the first time, QuantumScape, PowerCo, and Volkswagen Group have showcased the new tech at IAA Mobility in Munich, one of the world’s largest mobility trade fairs.

Pulling the black sheet off the vehicle, they revealed a modified, fully electric Ducati V21L race motorcycle, which is wholly powered by QSE-5 solid-state cells.

The solid-state cells in the motorcycle were assembled using QuantumScape’s proprietary manufacturing platform (Cobra production process), which allows for faster heat treatment, requires less floor space, and eliminates certain material steps. The first-of-its-kind battery system, meanwhile, is designed by specialists at Audi, specifically for QS SSB cells.

The demonstration marks a big achievement not just for the companies involved but also the electric vehicle (EV) sector, as it was the first time that QuantumScape’s anode-free cells moved from the manufacturing plant into an actual vehicle for the world to see.

“Today we’ve crossed the threshold from possibility to reality.”

– QuantumScape CEO and president Dr. Siva Sivaram

The company’s partnership with PowerCo, he noted, positions QuantumScape to scale its transformative technology to gigawatt-hour (GWh) production, and together they will “help usher in a new era of electrified transportation.”

According to the official announcement, the world’s first live demonstration of QS solid-state lithium-metal batteries powering an EV represents a significant advancement in battery technology and a big step towards commercializing solid-state EVs.

With this tech, the goal is to help advance the EV revolution, which PowerCo CEO Frank Blome says “is the biggest transformation the automotive industry has ever seen.”

SSBs will redefine what’s possible for high-performance, premium vehicles with the demonstration being just the beginning, he added.

QuantumScape’s Roadmap For Prototype to Production

With traditional lithium-ion batteries reaching the limits of their possible energy density and safety as portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy grids become more widespread and demanding, QuantumScape has turned to solid-state batteries to provide greater energy density, faster charging, and enhanced safety to support the transition to a lower-carbon future.

It is currently leading the global race of solid-state battery development, all set to bring its full-fledged solid-state cells to the EV market at scale in the near future.

The recent demonstration of its tech for the world to see actually sent the share prices of the $5 billion market cap company surging. At the time of writing, QS is trading at $8.85, up a whopping 70.52% YTD, though it is still far off its all-time high (ATH) of $132.73 hit late in 2020.

QuantumScape has an EPS (TTM) of -0.91 and a P/E (TTM) of -9.76.

As for the financial outlook, it reported capital expenditures of $8.3 million in Q2 of 2025. The expenses mainly supported facilities and equipment purchases as QuantumScape prepared for higher-volume QSE-5 B1 sample production during this period.

Its GAAP operating expenses were $123.6 million, GAAP net loss was $114.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA loss was $63 million.

The company ended the quarter with $797.5 million in liquidity and extended its guidance for cash runway into 2029.

QuantumScape actually expects to ship its sample cells for testing soon, with commercial production expected to begin in the next couple of years, depending on manufacturing scaling and regulatory approvals.

The B-sample cell called QSE-5 is the first planned commercial product of QuantumScape, which is designed to meet the EV sector’s need for batteries that must excel in five crucial battery performance metrics: cost-effectiveness, energy density, charging speed, safety, and lifespan.

The innovation here is the anode-less cell design, which simplifies manufacturing and lowers material costs while delivering high energy density. Paired with advanced separators, the design gives QuantumScape advantages in safety and efficiency.

It has replaced the organic separator with a nonflammable and noncombustible solid-state separator that provides more safety. Meanwhile, eliminating the graphite/silicon anode host material increases volumetric and gravimetric energy densities.

QuantumScape claims its QS technology has an 844 Wh/L energy density and 10C continuous discharge. Also, the lithium-metal solid-state battery takes just over 12 minutes (12.2 min) to charge from 10-80%.

If the technology is scaled successfully, it could become a standard for next-gen EVs as well as other energy storage solutions. The world premiere of the technology this month marks a big milestone towards that goal, which comes after a series of achievements.

Scaling QSE-5: From Pilot Lines to GWh Manufacturing

In order to bring QSE-5 to the real-world EVs as soon as possible, QuantumScape and PowerCo have been working together for three years now. The partnership combines QuantumScape’s talent with PowerCo’s manufacturing expertise.

Just a few months ago, the two expanded their strategic partnership to accelerate the development of the QSE-5 battery, which is currently being manufactured on QuantumScape’s San Jose pilot line, marking a major step forward in the industrialization of SSB technology.

This was the result of an agreement the two reached last year, under which QuantumScape gave PowerCo a non-exclusive license to mass produce the solid-state technology.

It allows PowerCo to produce up to 5 GWh of QSE-5-based cells annually in addition to the previously agreed 40 GWh with the option to expand up to 80 GWh, including for customers outside the VW Group. The expanded capacity is reportedly enough to equip about one million EVs with solid-state tech per year. The agreement also gives it the right to license certain future QS technology.

As a result, PowerCo will be contributing an additional $131 million over the next two years in exchange for QuantumScape prioritizing QSE-5 cells. The capital will help QS in scaling its manufacturing and making higher-volume prototype cell deliveries to the battery company.

QS first made its 24-layer solid-state cells available to Volkswagen Group for testing, back in Dec. 2022. The following year, it reported surpassing performance targets during testing. Early last year, PowerCo also ran its own endurance tests on QS cells and reported “very encouraging results.”

The Volkswagen Group’s battery arm confirmed that QS’s solid-state battery cells achieved over 1,000 charging cycles with more than 95% capacity retention.

The tests were conducted at PowerCo’s Salzgitter battery labs in Germany. The tests showed that an electric car with a WLTP range of 500-600 km (311-373 miles) outfitted with QS cells can drive about 500,000 kilometers (more than 310,000 miles) without losing range.

With these impressive results, Volkswagen aims to become “a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” but there’s still a long way to go before it can commercialize a marketable solution.

That could take the rest of the decade despite the recent promising showing. That’s because the first electric motorcycle presented at the IAA Mobility was extensively modified with the battery system designed specifically to fit the needs of the solid-state batteries, allowing the Ducati to be equipped with up to 980 QSE-5 cells.

Nevertheless, Volkswagen is committed to seeing this through and will be taking “the next step towards series production,” said Thomas Schmall, Group Board Member for Technology. With Volkswagen’s unified cell concept already suitable for QS cells, the focus will now be on refining and scaling the manufacturing processes.

Schmall noted that with their new in-house unified cell, they “have created the perfect match” as it is “solid state-ready” and enables rapid technology transfer to the company’s vehicles, as soon as the solid-state battery is ready.”

Ready to make its debut in upcoming small electric cars from VW, Cupra, and Skoda, the unified cell has an energy density of around 660 Wh/l and an entirely new design where the cells are installed directly into the pack.

At the event, Volkswagen said that the unified cell will be used in up to 80% of its own EVs in the future. While the cell type will stay the same, the cell chemistry may vary, allowing it to be “equipped with various cell chemistries from LFP and Sodium-Ion to NMC and Solid-State.”

PowerCo and QuantumScape are currently working on integrating solid-state technology into the unit cell and thus into the car. At the same time, a race-ready motorcycle will be developed for testing on the racetrack.

The Global Race Towards SSB Breakthroughs

Volkswagen is clearly making a lot of strides in leading the solid-state battery technology, but it isn’t alone in this endeavor. This week, Mercedes-Benz also announced records of its own.

A ‘lightly modified’ Mercedes EQS packed with a solid-state battery covered a distance of 1,205 km (748.7 miles) on one charge. After travelling from Stuttgart, Germany to Malmo, Sweden, it still had 137 km (85.12 miles) range left.

This new record broke the previous one set by the Vision EQXX by three kilometres. The road testing has been part of the company’s comprehensive validation program for solid-state battery technology under real-world conditions on public roads.

“The solid-state battery is a true game-changer for electric mobility. With the successful long-distance drive of the EQS, we show that this technology delivers not only in the lab but also on the road. Our goal is to bring innovations like this into series production by the end of the decade and offer our customers a new level of range and comfort.”

– Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes‑Benz Group AG, Chief Technology Officer, Development & Procurement

For its battery, Factorial Energy provided the company with lithium-metal cells that are based on Factorial Electrolyte System Technology.

The Porsche-co-owned Croatian company, Rimac, is yet another one to showcase that SSBs can boost power, bring down weight, and solve the range issues that current batteries are facing. The new battery is developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi Chemical Group and ProLogium.

Presented at Munich’s IAA Mobility 2025, Rimac claims that its pouch-cell SSB has a power density of 1,000 watts per pound, weighs 847 pounds, and retains over 95% of its energy at -20 degrees Celsius (-7 F).

Among others working on advancing the tech is Toyota (TM -0.76%), which first revealed the world’s first prototype EV that ran on SSB back in 2020, only to share a couple of years later that a Toyota hybrid is more likely to get an SSB than an EV.

The best-selling automotive brand worldwide is actually expecting to begin the mass production of its first solid-state battery by 2027-2028. Toyota claims that its solid-state battery will deliver a 20% increase in cruising range and could charge from 10-80% in under 10 minutes.

Then there’s Honda (HMC -1.27%), whose solid-state battery pilot production line is already up and running. Located in Sakura, Japan, the automaker has invested about 43 billion yen, or about $290 million, in the facility to support next-generation EV battery development.

Its solid-state cells, according to Honda, could potentially be 25% cheaper, 35% lighter, and 50% smaller than current lithium-ion batteries. The Japanese automaker aims to start mass production of all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) in the second half of this decade.

The $46.8 bln market cap Ford (F -0.68%) is yet another auto manufacturer that is actively developing solid-state batteries. For its SSB efforts, Ford has partnered with startup Solid Power.

The company first invested in Solid Power in 2019 before making an additional equity investment in 2021 to help accelerate the development of technology. In that investment round, BMW Group also participated and became an equal equity owner with Ford.

“Solid-state batteries are showing great promise,” noted the carmaker at the time, adding, “they also can be made on today’s lithium-ion battery lines, allowing Ford to reuse about 70 percent of its capital investment in lithium-ion manufacturing lines.”

Ford EV partner SK On is also researching the technology with a number of Korean universities and institutions. It is developing two types of ASSBs, one with a polymer-oxide composite and the other being sulfide-based, with their commercial prototypes not expected until 2027 and 2029, respectively.

The Chinese technology company Huawei, meanwhile, reported a breakthrough, which is based on a nitrogen-doped sulfide SSB. It can reach energy densities between 400 and 500 Wh/kg, which is two to three times more than that of conventional lithium-ion EV batteries.

The solid-state EV battery from Huawei promises a driving range of up to 3,000 kilometers (1864 miles) on a single charge. Moreover, it has the ability to be fully recharged within five minutes.

Final Thoughts

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise to revolutionize the way we power electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, and renewable energy systems. With their higher energy density, faster charging speeds, superior safety profile, and longer lifespans, they make for an ideal successor to lithium-ion technology.

But despite billions of dollars in investments from industry giants, significant hurdles remain. From reducing costs to scaling up manufacturing and ensuring long-term reliability on the road, challenges continue to persist. And that’s why solid-state cells are still largely in the development phase, requiring extensive testing and validation before they can be deployed in the real world at scale.

Latest advancements, however, paint a promising picture. QuantumScape’s live demonstrations, PowerCo’s endurance tests, and record-setting long-distance drives from Mercedes-Benz signal that the industry is finally moving closer to overcoming these barriers.

So, as partnerships grow, pilot production lines expand, and innovative designs continue to emerge, solid-state batteries look ready to become mainstream this decade, unlocking a new era of electric mobility and sustainable energy solutions.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

Solar energy is for everywhere and everyone, and its future is in our hands.
Reno's Sun Day Solar Festival will be held from noon to 4 p.m. on Sept. 21 at Idlewild Park.","Recent months have brought sobering news for people who want to lower their energy bills with solar. The Solar for All program is on the chopping block, and tax credits that made renewable energy more accessible to working families are being repealed. These setbacks affect real people — families who were counting on solar to reduce their electricity bills, small business owners planning to invest in renewable energy and communities working toward energy independence.

But federal policy changes can't squash the power of local action.

We still have renewable energy initiatives and climate goals in municipalities across Nevada. At the state level, utility commissioners and legislators directly impact whether solar owners can earn fair credit for the electricity they generate, and whether community solar projects expand or remain stagnant. These are regulators and legislators whose decisions we can influence. We need to use our power to ensure they prioritize policies that benefit working families and local communities.

This is precisely why events like Reno's Sun Day Solar Festival on Sept. 21 are so important. Part of a nationwide movement held on the fall equinox, Sun Day will bring communities across the country together to demonstrate the power of grassroots solar advocacy. But Sun Day is also deeply local — a reminder that the renewable energy transition happens one neighborhood, one rooftop, one informed voter at a time.

Held in Idlewild Park, Reno’s Sun Day Solar Festival will offer families a chance to see solar technology in action, learn about community solar options and understand how renewable energy can reduce household expenses while supporting local jobs. Kids can participate in hands-on art projects while parents explore practical questions: How much could solar save on monthly utility bills? What financing options exist? How can residents influence local energy policies?

Federal setbacks are discouraging, but they're not the end of the story. The sun rises every day, technology improves continuously and communities that organize effectively can achieve remarkable things. Local action builds resilience that no single election can undo.

Solar energy continues to grow because it makes economic sense. Renewable energy costs have plummeted, making them competitive with traditional sources, even without subsidies. But growth isn't guaranteed to benefit everyone equally. Without thoughtful local policies, the solar energy transition could leave behind the very communities that need economic relief most.

If you're concerned about the future of solar energy — whether for economic, environmental, or energy security reasons — the most powerful response isn't to despair about federal politics. It's to show up locally, learn practically, and engage consistently.

As a solar owner, I’ve seen firsthand how solar can benefit our community. I love my rooftop solar system. With net metering, it supplies enough energy to power my home all year round with the knowledge that I am using pure renewable energy from the sun. And any excess is used by my neighbors so that they are greener, too!

Take action on Sun Day. Solar energy is for everywhere and everyone, and its future is in our hands. I’ll see you in Idlewild Park on Sept. 21.

At the price point of $69,990, it was the cheapest Cybertruck variant launched in April this year. Tesla stripped down several features and options from this cheaper RWD Cybertruck.

As the September 30th deadline for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit is closing in, the electric automaker has removed the Cybertruck Long Range RWD variant from its online car configurator.

Now, only two Cybertruck trims, i.e., Long Range AWD and the top-tier Tri-Motor Cyberbeast are available for sale. It’s hard to tell if and when the Cybertruck RWD will be put back on sale.

Although Tesla offered a more affordable version of the Cybertruck, it did not add a significant number of sales units to the second quarter. The trimmed-down single-motor RWD Cybertruck most probably didn’t create the appeal that the automaker was expecting with the launch.

The mid-tier Cybertruck AWD is the most value-for-money option and most of the Tesla customers are most probably opting for this variant. Cybertruck AWD’s MSRP is $79,990. After the Federal EV Tax Credit deduction of $7,500, the price of the electric pickup truck goes down to $72,490.

Existing Tesla owners can also benefit from transferring their Full Self-Driving (Supervised) package to their new Cybertruck AWD. The Cyberbeast performance variant’s price of $114,990 includes the FSD package.

Tesla Full Self-Driving (Supervised) package costs $8,000 additionally on the AWD Cybertruck. By transferring it from the previous vehicle, you can save another $8K on it if you’re eligible for it (see FSD transfer eligibility criteria below).

Buying the Cybertruck AWD Long Range version also gives you the benefit of a 0% APR (annual percentage rate). With a down payment of $5,000, the Cybertruck on financing costs $1,291 per month (60-month term with Federal Tax Credit and the FSD bundle).

Although Tesla said that the 0% APR offer would end in June, the automaker is still offering it on the Cybertruck AWD.

Tesla also discontinued the RWD variant of the Cybertruck because, after the tax credit and 0% APR offer, the Cybertruck AWD costs just a bit more with an all-wheel drivetrain, additional features, and better specs (comparison here).

Eligibility for FSD Transfer to Cybertruck

To be eligible for this offer, you must:

Have your new Tesla vehicle delivered on or after April 24, 2025, but before the program ends;

Be the legal owner and registrant of the current vehicle with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) purchased outright until Tesla can remove the FSD (Supervised) from the vehicle (about 48 hours after delivery of your new vehicle);

Have the current vehicle and the new vehicle on the same Tesla Account; and

Agree to all additional terms and conditions prior to delivery of the new vehicle

Note: The Full Self-Driving (Supervised) Transfer Program is subject to change or end at any time and cannot be applied retroactively. FSD (Supervised) cannot be transferred from a Model Y Launch Series or a vehicle under an active lease. Business, commercial and pre-owned vehicle orders are not eligible. The transferring vehicle cannot be the subject of a pending cancelation or buyback request or have any delinquent liens or balances. Additional terms and conditions apply and will be provided prior to delivery.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.” The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/09/12221540/AP25255740590738-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:39.383245

The disbanding was first reported by CNN and now NPR has confirmed that Wright wrote a letter on September 3rd to the five hand-picked members of the group, thanking them for their service.

The decision to disband the CWG came as a hearing was held this week in a lawsuit that the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists had filed against the Trump administration. As NPR reported previously, the suit alleges that Energy Secretary Chris Wright ""quietly arranged for five hand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change"" to compile the government's climate report and violated the law by creating the report in secret with authors ""of only one point of view.""

Wright wrote in the letter that the purpose of the group and its report was ""to catalyze scientific and public debate"" and that the result ""exceeded my expectations."" Wright concluded that with that goal met the CWG could now be dissolved.

The CWG consisted of four scientists and one economist who have all questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses huge threats to people and ecosystems and who sometimes framed global warming as beneficial.

The report was drafted to support a Trump administration effort to stop regulating climate pollution. The DOE report was cited multiple times by the Environmental Protection Agency in its recent proposal to roll back what's known as the endangerment finding, which is the basis for federal rules regulating climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry.

""The Climate Working Group was convened in secrecy, and it created a clandestine report – in brazen violation of federal law – that is being used to weaken protections against the climate pollution that makes life less safe and less affordable for all Americans,"" Erin Murphy, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a statement.

The environmental groups want a court to throw out the CWG report, but at a conference in Belgium Friday, Wright praised the document for prompting ""open, back and forth dialogue.""

""That's what we want is to bring people that have different perspectives or disagree to dialogue together and argue it out,"" Wright told the crowd.

For all but a small segment of scientists, the debate Wright wants to prompt has already been settled.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, coordinated the response from climate experts. He says unlike the DOE report, climate reports from groups such as the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change feature the work of hundreds of global scientists and require multiple rounds of peer review.

""When well-established scientific conclusions are challenged by arguments that ignore or contradict decades of solid evidence, these debates don't advance our understanding,"" Dessler wrote to NPR in a statement.

Bowing to the bear For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight.","California is once again at the center of the nation’s automotive and energy policy debate. With federal electric vehicle tax credits set to expire this September, the state is considering whether to create its own replacement program.

This would not only affect car buyers but could also reshape the national conversation on emissions rules, vehicle affordability, and the balance of power between state and federal regulators.

With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt — whether they’re ready or not.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a report on August 19 recommending that the state consider “backfilling” the federal credits with its own point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other incentives to keep EV sales moving.

The details remain vague, but the intention is clear: California wants to keep its aggressive zero-emission vehicle goals on track, even as Washington scales back related programs.

Emissions mission

But California has been here before. This is not the first time the state has clashed with the federal government over vehicle regulations — and it likely won’t be the last.

California has a unique history when it comes to vehicle emissions. Decades before the federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency, California was already regulating air quality in response to its smog problem.

When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, California was granted a waiver that allowed it to set its own stricter emissions standards. Other states were given the option to adopt California’s rules, and some states have done so. Today, 11 states follow California’s lead.

This waiver authority has made California an outsize force in shaping vehicle propulsion. Automakers cannot ignore a market of this size, which means California’s rules often become de facto national standards.

Better red than fed

California’s regulatory independence has not always sat well with Washington. Under different administrations, the federal government has either supported or resisted the state’s authority. During the Obama years, California partnered with the federal government to create a unified fuel economy and emissions program, giving automakers a single set of national rules.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA rolled back certain emissions standards, sparking legal battles with California, which insisted on enforcing its own tougher rules. The state formed alliances with other states and even some automakers to defend its position.

Today, with federal EV tax credits expiring at the end of September and policy focus shifting, California is again stepping into the driver’s seat by proposing its own financial incentives. These ongoing disputes highlight a deeper question: Should environmental and automotive policy be driven by national uniformity or by one state acting as the policy leader?

Forever ZEV?

The discussion over tax credits cannot be separated from California’s ZEV mandate. Under CARB’s plan, automakers must steadily increase the percentage of EVs they sell, with the ultimate goal of phasing out new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035.

This is one of the most ambitious policies in the country, and automakers are scrambling to meet the targets. Some states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have pledged to follow California’s lead, while others remain skeptical. For consumers, this means that vehicle availability will increasingly be shaped by government mandates and not by market demand. Even if gas-powered cars remain popular, automakers will need to balance that demand with regulatory compliance.

Different strokes

The CARB report suggests that any new program would differ from the federal credits in key ways. Instead of tax credits, buyers could receive point-of-sale rebates, allowing them to benefit immediately rather than waiting until tax season.

Incentives may also vary depending on income level, vehicle type, or price, so luxury EVs could receive lower rebates while affordable models get more support.

Additionally, any new program would be tied to yearly funding availability, meaning that if budgets tighten, rebates could shrink or disappear. This approach could make the system more flexible, but it also introduces uncertainty for buyers trying to plan their purchases. In the past, the state of California and other states have run out of money in the EV fund and left buyers with nothing.

Electric slide

The promise of continued incentives may be welcome news for some California drivers, but the reality is more complicated. EVs still come with challenges beyond sticker price. Even with rebates, EVs are often thousands of dollars more expensive than comparable gasoline cars.

California has built more chargers than any other state, yet many regions remain underserved, and home charging is not always an option, particularly for renters.

EVs also tend to depreciate faster than gas vehicles due to rapid advances in technology and concerns about battery life. Insurance rates are higher on electric vehicles as well.

And let’s not forget a major expense: Electricity rates are rising at double the rate of inflation.

One of the key criticisms of EV subsidies is that they often benefit wealthier households. Data from federal programs has shown that a large percentage of credits went to buyers in higher income brackets because these households are more likely to purchase new cars, and EVs remain disproportionately concentrated in the premium market segment.

California may attempt to address this with scaled incentives, but questions remain about whether the system can truly deliver benefits to everyone. Meanwhile, working-class families who rely on affordable used cars may find themselves subsidizing programs that they cannot realistically take advantage of.

Bowing to the bear

For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight. The state accounts for nearly 12% of U.S. auto sales, and when you include the other states that follow its rules, the market share becomes impossible to ignore.

Manufacturers that fail to meet California’s requirements face penalties, while those that comply can earn credits to sell or trade. This system has created an uneven playing field, favoring companies with strong EV lineups.

Tesla, for instance, has profited significantly from selling ZEV credits to competitors in the past. If California establishes a robust new rebate system, it could further tilt the market toward EVs, encouraging automakers to prioritize them even more, take greater losses on each vehicle.

Off the market

At its core, this debate is about whether government policy should drive technology adoption or whether the market should dictate the pace.

California argues that aggressive incentives and mandates are necessary to address climate goals and push the auto industry forward. Critics counter that these policies distort the market, forcing automakers and taxpayers to shoulder costs that may not align with consumer demand. They also warn of unintended consequences, such as reduced affordability, lack of charging stations, and strained electrical infrastructure.

California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator.

With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt — whether they’re ready or not.

For some wealthier car buyers, this could mean continued financial support when purchasing an EV, but it also raises questions about long-term effectiveness. For taxpayers, it means another debate about where funds should be directed and increased taxes for residents. For the auto industry, it underscores more losses on vehicles that are designed by one state’s demands.

As history shows, when California moves, the rest of the country often feels the impact. The next few months will reveal whether the state can successfully design a program that keeps EV sales going without overburdening its citizens with more increased taxes. But one thing is certain: California still has significant power over the U.S. auto industry.",https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/california-may-defy-trump-with-new-statewide-ev-credits.jpg?id=61596754&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C80%2C0%2C80,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:17.340403

Generally speaking, we expect EV sales to then drop after September 30, because those financial incentives will be gone and people who were thinking of buying an EV soon-ish rushed to buy one before October 1.
Without that manufactured surge of 2nd quarter 2025 EV buyers, perhaps it would take longer for those next-wave buyers to go electric.
The counterargument might be that keeping the tax credit would lead to more EV buyers quarter after quarter, resulting in those word-of-mouth sales coming slightly slower but for a longer period of time and more consistently.
I’m open minded and, for example, don’t know which would actually lead to us getting to 50% EV sales sooner.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

This is actually a simple one, so I’ll keep it quick. I’m not sure if we’ve ever presented this argument at all, and certainly not as a standalone article. Because it’s a clear sequence of points, I’m going to use a numbered list to get rolling.

In the United States, the $7,500 tax credit for purchasing new electric vehicles and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing used electric vehicles are about to end.

That is leading to a surge in EV purchases this quarter.

Generally speaking, we expect EV sales to then drop after September 30, because those financial incentives will be gone and people who were thinking of buying an EV soon-ish rushed to buy one before October 1.

However, we’ve also argued for years that the benefits of electric vehicles for EV owners and drivers are significant and will naturally lead to more and more people switching from gas-guzzling cars to electric cars they can conveniently charge at their homes and workplaces.

So, when this surge of Q2 2025 EV buyers get their electric vehicles, love them, and discover how much better they are than their gas cars ever were, they are going to talk to their friends, family, and coworkers about this. (This happens time after time after time with new EV owners.)

As a result, even without the financial subsidies, that wave of new EV owners is going to lead to many more people becoming more aware of EVs, aware of their advantages, and open to getting EVs themselves. That could be a very large portion of the “early majority” that switches from not thinking about or genuinely considering an EV to being intrigued and attracted to going electric (like their friend, family member, or coworker did).

Some percentage of those people are going to then go on to buying an electric car.

Perhaps that last part won’t happen quickly. People need some time to let their thoughts simmer and seep in, and need some time to plan such a big purchase. Also, they may feel like they shouldn’t buy an EV right away since that would be conceding that they could have bought one a month or two earlier and gotten a big discount on it — and people often don’t like to admit that they made a mistake, even with the timing of a purchase. However, creating a surge of EV buyers thanks to the ending of two tax credits should eventually lead to a second and third wave of people influenced by them buying EVs as well.

Without that manufactured surge of 2nd quarter 2025 EV buyers, perhaps it would take longer for those next-wave buyers to go electric. The counterargument might be that keeping the tax credit would lead to more EV buyers quarter after quarter, resulting in those word-of-mouth sales coming slightly slower but for a longer period of time and more consistently. I would say I agree with that. However, there is the possibility that the net benefit of accelerating many EV purchases by even a couple of quarters is stronger since those word-of-mouth sales grow faster at a fairly high scale and then snowball and accelerate the transition. I don’t really have a strong opinion either way on this. I’m open minded and, for example, don’t know which would actually lead to us getting to 50% EV sales sooner. Of course, the best of all worlds would be phasing out the subsidies, benefiting from this surge of sales, and then getting a change of power that brings back the tax credits. Some people will disagree that this boom-&-bust-&-boom cycle would be better, and maybe they are right, but I do think this would accelerate adoption the most.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Chevy-Blazer-EV-SS.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:21.357244

""If Americans can be convinced of the real advantages of EVs, there's nowhere to go but up,"" EnergySage concluded.","With federal tax incentives for electric vehicles on the brink of their end date, a popular marketplace detailed myths about the clean automobiles. It noted that the United States is well behind other countries in adopting EVs.

In Norway, 90% of new vehicle sales are electric. That figure is 63% in Sweden and around 30% in the United Kingdom and China, EnergySage reported. The U.S. is at 9%.

""There's a stigma against EVs here that doesn't exist in other places, and a lot of it may stem from fossil fuel propaganda,"" the site stated. It added: ""It's time to debunk these myths once and for all.""

Big Oil, of course, has much to lose if EVs win. EnergySage noted lobbyists spent $7 million in 2021 just to work against a proposal to limit vehicle pollution from new cars, which was not set to begin until 2027.

EnergySage interviewed a trio of automobile industry experts, including Jonny Lieberman, who hosts Driving with Jonny (@drivingwithjonny). He cited people who have no interest in EVs and fear problems, such as fires, in saying, ""Every time one of those is brought up, it just strikes me as propaganda by Chevron, Shell, or the petroleum industry.""

Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, who created Transport Evolved (@transportevolved), called it a ""perfect storm of political misinformation and fossil fuel lobbying — lobbyists in America are very, very powerful.""

To counter four myths, the independent clean energy platform laid out how EVs are not much more expensive than gas-powered cars. It noted that states, municipalities, utilities, and manufacturers also offer incentives similar to the federal tax credits — $7,500 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one — that will expire Sept. 30. Home charging and the absence of regular maintenance needs help EV drivers break even after a few years, Gordon-Bloomfield said.

Range anxiety is also mostly a thing of the past, as today's EVs can travel 300-400 miles on one charge. The average American drives 29 miles in one day, according to the Department of Transportation. And ""even in the absolute worst conditions,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said, the charging time to reach 80% battery maxes out at 90 minutes.

EVs are far less prone to catch fire than their counterparts, with 25 blazes per 100,000 EVs sold. The rate is over 60 times higher for gas-powered vehicles, at 1,530 per 100,000. Batteries also last for 10-12 years, State of Charge (@StateOfChargeWithTomMoloughney) host Tom Moloughney told EnergySage, and they can be 80-90% efficient. Internal combustion engines are 20% efficient, with the remaining 80% of dirty energy use producing waste heat and noise, per Lieberman.

Finally, the EV industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence, per the experts. Despite their instant torque, high-tech features, and quiet cabins, electric vehicles are not as trendy as gas-powered vehicles in the eyes of consumers.

""In other countries, cars are sold very differently. In America, cars are very often seen as a status symbol, they're seen as an extension of the self,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said. ""We're buying more on image than we are on actual substance.""

In fact, EVs are converting drivers from India to France to the U.S. And almost all of them say they will never go back.

This pilot is possible through the California Energy Commission’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program Option 3.

“Silicon Valley Power is committed to exploring innovative solutions that keep our community powered reliably and affordably,” said Nico Procos, Electric Utility Director of Silicon Valley Power. “This pilot demonstrates how collaboration with industry leaders like Nissan and ChargeScape can help to strengthen grid reliability, support local businesses, and benefit our customers.”

Silicon Valley is one of the world’s data center hotspots. The rise of AI has caused a surge in electricity demand coming from data centers, which many power grids were not designed to withstand, a news release noted.

“Forward-thinking utilities such as Silicon Valley Power are seeking innovative ways to quickly increase power supply to meet this new demand, in order to ensure grid reliability for all customers,” the news release added.

At Nissan’s Advanced Technology Center in Silicon Valley, this pilot will use energy stored in EV batteries from Nissan electric vehicles, managed by Fermata Energy’s bidirectional chargers, to export power during periods of grid strain. ChargeScape will coordinate with market partner Leap to discharge power from Nissan vehicles and free up supply for data center loads.

The pilot is part of ChargeScape and Leap’s broader California Virtual Power Plant.

“Through this collaboration, we’re showcasing how electric vehicles can reinforce our communities’ electrical needs and deliver meaningful benefits to drivers,” said Rich Miller, Vice President of Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan U.S.

“AI is a fundamental component of American Dynamism, and our nation’s power grids must quickly adapt to supply data centers with the energy needed to maintain America’s competitive edge in places like Silicon Valley,” said Joseph Vellone, CEO of ChargeScape. “Integrating Nissan’s EV batteries into Silicon Valley Power’s grid is a crucial first step to shoring up long-term grid reliability and rewarding the EV drivers who are part of the solution.”

“At Fermata Energy, we are demonstrating how AI-enabled V2X optimization can transform electric vehicles into intelligent grid resources,” said Hamza Lemsaddek, Chief Operating Officer of Fermata Energy. “By pairing our platform with bidirectional chargers at Nissan’s Innovation Lab, we’re proving that EVs can strengthen data center reliability, support utilities like Silicon Valley Power, and deliver real economic value back to drivers and communities.”

“Our work with ChargeScape has shown the powerful potential of harnessing the EVs already on the road today to tackle urgent grid reliability challenges,” said Jason Michaels, CEO of Leap. “Activating these vehicles as flexible, dispatchable grid resources is a game-changing tool to help utilities manage higher loads and unlock economic growth while putting dollars back in the hands of ratepayers. We look forward to expanding our partnership with ChargeScape to serve more communities.”",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:24.856317

Enter Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), a long-duration storage solution that promises to bridge the gap between intermittent renewables and grid reliability. While MIT's models on

scalability and economic viability remain elusive, industry trends and technological fundamentals suggest that LAES is poised to play a pivotal role in the next phase of energy infrastructure.

The Case for LAES: Clean, Scalable, and Economically Viable

LAES operates by compressing air to a liquid state using excess renewable energy, storing it in insulated tanks, and later expanding the liquid air to drive turbines and generate electricity. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, LAES avoids critical mineral dependencies and offers near-limitless scalability, as it relies on abundant, non-flammable materials like air and salt caverns for storage. According to a 2023 report by BloombergNEF, long-duration storage technologies like LAES are projected to account for 30% of global storage capacity by 2040, driven by their ability to stabilize grids with high renewable penetration.

Economically, LAES is gaining traction due to its declining costs. A 2024 analysis by Wood Mackenzie found that the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for LAES could fall below $0.05/kWh by 2035, rivaling pumped hydro and outcompeting flow batteries in duration-sensitive applications. This aligns with the growing demand for 10–100-hour storage solutions, which are critical for seasonal balancing and extreme weather resilience.

Decarbonization Scenarios and Strategic Integration

Under aggressive decarbonization scenarios, LAES's role becomes even more pronounced. For instance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights in its 2023 Net Zero Roadmap that long-duration storage will be indispensable for achieving 90% renewable grids by 2040. LAES's ability to leverage existing infrastructure—such as decommissioned gas plants for liquid air storage—further enhances its economic appeal. In the UK, a 50 MW/250 MWh LAES pilot project by Highview Power has already demonstrated 85% round-trip efficiency, validating its technical feasibility.

Market Dynamics and Investment Opportunities

While academic models like MIT's remain absent from public discourse, corporate activity signals strong confidence. Startups like LAES Co. and established players like Siemens Energy are scaling prototypes, with over $2 billion in global investments announced in 2024 alone. Meanwhile, policy tailwinds, including the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's 10-year tax credits for long-duration storage, are accelerating deployment timelines.

For investors, the key is to identify enablers of LAES adoption. For example,

Corp (ticker: LAES), a semiconductor firm specializing in secure microcontrollers for smart energy systems, underscores the growing intersection of hardware security and grid modernization. Though not directly involved in LAES, SEALSQ's growth—projected to hit $20 million in FY 2025 revenue—reflects the broader demand for technologies that underpin reliable, decentralized energy networks.

Now Is the Time to Position

The convergence of technological maturity, falling costs, and policy support positions LAES as a strategic long-duration storage solution. While MIT's research on its scalability remains unverified, the industry's momentum is undeniable. For forward-looking investors, exposure to LAES—whether through direct infrastructure investments or enablers like secure grid technologies—offers a compelling hedge against the volatility of short-term energy markets.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd264379cbc001.png,N,,2025-09-13 15:59:46.506152

In Detail : The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is reportedly considering tax incentives for investors in green bonds. The proposal aims to boost private sector participation in renewable energy and climate-focused projects across India.

Green bonds are financial instruments used to fund environmentally sustainable projects, including solar, wind, and energy efficiency initiatives. Incentivizing investment in these bonds could channel more capital into the clean energy sector.

By offering tax benefits, the MNRE intends to make green bonds more attractive to retail and institutional investors alike. This could increase demand and liquidity in the green bond market, supporting project financing.

The move aligns with India’s broader climate and sustainability objectives, including achieving net-zero emissions targets and expanding renewable energy capacity. Mobilizing private capital is critical to meet these ambitious goals.

Industry experts believe that fiscal incentives could accelerate the adoption of green finance mechanisms. By reducing investment costs, such measures can encourage participation from banks, funds, and individual investors in renewable energy projects.

The MNRE’s proposal also signals government commitment to developing a robust ecosystem for green financing. Incentivizing green bonds can complement other initiatives like the Renewable Energy Development Fund and carbon credit markets.

Increasing green bond investments can help fund large-scale solar, wind, and hydro projects. The additional capital inflow will also support distributed renewable energy solutions, energy storage, and decarbonization technologies.

Tax incentives could further enhance investor confidence in long-term sustainable projects.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

""Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency's statutory obligations,'' he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/environment_AP_25255740590738_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:44.989431

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

""Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency's statutory obligations,'' he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/environment_AP_25255740590738_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 12:03:43.324981

This focus on sustainable resources is part of the company's strategic initiatives in tyre manufacturing.

The company has reported that, in 2024, around 26% of its materials were derived from these sources, setting the stage for a steady increase by up to three percentage points by 2025.

Ultimately, Continental aims to integrate at least 40% sustainable materials by 2030.

“We’re closing the loop: Continental is ramping up its commitment to a circular economy and mapping out its path for the future,” says Jorge Almeida, Head of Sustainability at Continental Tires.

“Innovative solutions enable us to use more sustainable raw materials, such as synthetic rubber made from used cooking oil or resins based on certified renewable feedstocks originally derived from vegetable oil.”

Enhanced energy efficiency in tyres

Remaking the tyre compound involves resins that improve elasticity, grip and rolling resistance.

Continental chooses circular resins from ISCC PLUS-certified sources, incorporating products from TotalEnergies Cray Valley.

The use of resins from derivatives of vegetable oil and used cooking oil allows the company to maintain high-performance standards with a lower ecological impact.

Adjustment in tyre's elasticity affects energy demand during use, enhancing rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption in combustion vehicles and increase range in electric vehicles.

Additionally, Continental has pioneered the use of ISCC PLUS-certified TMQ, an antioxidant developed by LANXESS.

This additive includes bio-circular acetone sourced from waste cooking oil, and life cycle assessments highlight a 30% reduction in carbon footprint compared to conventional counterparts.

Implementing mass balance in production

To promote renewable and recycled input scalability, Continental employs a mass balance approach throughout its production process.

This methodology merges fossil, renewable and recycled sources within a unified process, meticulously tracing each component’s contribution along the value chain.

“The mass balance approach enables us to efficiently manage the complexity of the raw materials portfolio and track how these raw materials are used at multiple production sites in a wide range of markets,” explains Matthias Haufe, Head of Material Development and Industrialisation at Continental Tires.

“In this way, we can steadily increase the share of renewable and recycled materials in our tyre production – and transparently document the progress we make.”

Installed capacity, which stood at just 15.4 GW (excluding large hydro) in 2010, has surged to 188 GW by July 2025. Costs have also fallen dramatically. Renewable energy is no longer an indulgence from climate change considerations; it has become the rational economic choice.

A little over a decade ago, renewable energy sources were still struggling to find a meaningful place in India’s electricity supply basket on cost considerations. Solar electricity tariffs, just a decade ago, were of the order of US $0.15 (Rs 13) per unit (at an exchange rate of 1 USD = Rs 88), significantly higher than the price of new coal-based electricity.

Policymakers, utilities, and even sections of society questioned whether it made sense for a developing country to lock itself into high-cost electricity when coal was abundantly available to produce electricity at affordable tariffs. That debate now feels distant.

The cost factor

Solar electricity tariffs in India have fallen to USD 0.028 (Rs.2.50) per kWh, with record lows that are not only far less than the price of electricity from new coal-based plants but also undercut even the cheapest existing coal plants.

Wind energy tariffs after witnessing a declining trajectory untill 2017-2018, touching USD 0.028 (Rs 2.43) per kWh before rising close to USD 0.043 (Rs 3.75) per kWh.

This transformation was driven by global technology improvements, economies of scale, and appropriate policy choices—ranging from clear short and long-term targets, aggregation of demand and competitive auctions to facilitating regulatory support.

The resolution of the “cost equation” marked a turning point. As costs declined, however, other concerns came centre-stage.

Land and environmental concerns

During 2016–2024, record low tariffs were discovered for mega-solar parks in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka. While solar parks gave a thrust to large-scale renewable energy capacity addition, it gave rise to a number of concerns in view of their large areas.

The stakeholders’ concern is about loss of land — a reliable asset and source of permanent income. Large solar parks involve displacement of communities and an impact on biodiversity and fragile ecosystems.

Decentralised renewable energy, dual-land use renewable energy options such as agrivoltaics which combine agriculture and solar energy generation, floating solar, and building integrated photovoltaics are emerging as promising options to reduce pressure on land.

Rooftop solar which was not progressing at the required pace got a fillip through PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana. A good number of AgriPV pilots’ projects are providing learning for scaling them up.

Variability and round-the-clock power

Coal power plants provide round-the-clock, dispatchable generation, while solar and wind are variable and intermittent. “What happens when the sun doesn’t shine, or the wind doesn’t blow?” became the next critical concern.

Green energy transmission corridors were developed to make full use of renewable energy by facilitating its delivery to demand centres. Hybrid renewable energy projects combining wind and solar, reaping the benefit of their complementarity, offered a better bouquet.

Time-of-day tariffs and enhanced flexibility of conventional power plants assumed importance. And most importantly, energy storage found a place in the discussion in a big way.

This phase underscored an important reality: the transition to clean energy is not merely about clean energy generation, but also its utilisation matching the demand profile across the year.

The energy storage imperative

Today, the dominant concern in the context of integration of renewable energy are energy storage and reliability of supply. Critics argue that without affordable energy storage, India risks overbuilding renewable capacity that cannot be fully utilised.

Just as solar costs were once thought to be prohibitively high but fell rapidly with scale, energy storage is also expected to follow a downward cost trajectory as it finds use for various applications with recognition of the value proposition BESS offers, new technologies mature, and innovation accelerates.

Global battery prices are declining faster than anticipated. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) costs in India have declined 80 percent since 2015. The standalone BESS prices fell significantly from US $ 0.11 (Rs. 10.18) per kWh in 2022 to US $ 0.025-0.05 (Rs. 2.21 – 4.41) per kWh in 2024.

The viability gap funding announced by the government in June for developing 30 GWh of BESS capacity is expected to address the affordability concerns.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Domestic manufacturing is being incentivised in the country through the Production Linked Incentive for advanced chemistry cell battery storage and high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules. Cost-effective long-duration energy storage is the next frontier.

Beyond technology: People and transition

Alongside cost reduction and technological advancement one of the most critical concerns remains to be addressed: the human dimension of the energy transition. As coal-dependent regions confront the reality of declining coal production, concerns of jobs, livelihoods, and regional development loom large.

A “just transition” approach—ensuring that workers, communities, and vulnerable segments are not left behind—has begun to shape policy and public discourse. This shift signals the recognition that technology alone cannot drive the change; it must be embedded in a people-centric framework.

The turnaround and the outlook

India’s renewable energy journey began in the 1980s with early wind projects in Tamil Nadu. The small-scale solar applications were supported by the then Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources. The real turning point came with the launch of the National Solar Mission in 2010, which brought solar to the centre stage and became the heart of India’s energy development and transition strategy.

From these modest beginnings, the country has now built one of the world’s largest renewable energy markets, with solar leading the way.

The scale has, in a matter of 15 years, dramatically tilted towards solar power as compared to coal-based power. Solar power had to be bundled with thermal power to make it an attractive proposition for the DISCOMs. This is no longer the case. The tariff of electricity from ground-mounted solar power plants and wind is of the order of US $ 0.028 (Rs. 2.50) per kWh and US $ 0.039 (Rs. 3.50) per kWh, respectively.

The cost of electricity from hybrid wind-solar plants in recent years has ranged from US $0.038-0.039 (Rs. 3.35 to Rs. 3.45) per kWh. A combination of solar-wind hybrid (to be used alternatively when either sun or wind are not available) along with storage is making round the clock renewable energy achievable at attractive tariffs – US $ 0.048 and 0.056 (Rs. 4.00 to 5.00) per kWh during 2023-2025.

The falling costs of storage, along with low-cost hybrid plants, make renewable electricity not only cheaper but also more reliable—helping India’s energy transition by reducing dependence on fossil fuels while ensuring round-the-clock power.

Looking ahead, solar power with longer-duration energy storage is expected to become cost-effective, emerging as an economically viable option for consumers as well as energy distribution companies. Skilling and re-skilling of workforce which is directly or indirectly dependent/ engaged in coal mining and transportation is a prerequisite for effective clean energy transition.

Data from industry trackers revealed that EV registrations soared to 146,000 units, capturing nearly 10% of the overall new-vehicle market share—a milestone that underscores accelerating consumer adoption amid policy uncertainties. This surge, driven by a rush to capitalize on expiring federal tax credits, highlights how incentives continue to shape buyer behavior in an industry grappling with infrastructure challenges and competitive pressures.

Analysts point to a confluence of factors fueling this boom, including aggressive pricing strategies from legacy automakers and a broadening array of models appealing to mainstream buyers. General Motors, for instance, reported its highest-ever monthly EV sales, propelled by models like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which climbed into the top sellers list. Meanwhile, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E also posted strong numbers, contributing to a diversified field where non-Tesla brands claimed a larger slice of the pie.

Rising Competition and Tesla’s Slipping Grip

Yet, this record-breaking month came with a notable asterisk: Tesla Inc., long the undisputed king of the EV realm, saw its market dominance erode further. According to a report from Electrek, Tesla’s sales dipped as rivals like GM and Ford gained ground, with the company’s share slipping below 50% for the first time in recent memory. This trend reflects broader industry maturation, where Tesla’s once-novel appeal faces headwinds from improved offerings by competitors, including better range, faster charging, and more affordable entry points.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from industry observers echoed this sentiment, with users like energy analyst Jesse Jenkins highlighting August’s plug-in vehicle sales hitting 145,000 units and battery EVs achieving an 8.6% share—figures that debunk narratives of stalled EV growth. Such social media buzz underscores real-time enthusiasm, though it also reveals concerns about sustainability without ongoing subsidies.

Policy Shadows Looming Over Future Growth

The August rush appears tied directly to the impending expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, set to phase out by month’s end as the incoming Trump administration signals a pullback on EV support. A piece in The Washington Post warns that this policy shift could trigger a sharp sales decline in the fourth quarter, with analysts forecasting a potential 20% drop as affordability takes a hit for middle-income buyers.

Beyond incentives, infrastructure remains a critical bottleneck. The International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 notes that while charging networks have expanded, rural and urban disparities persist, potentially capping long-term adoption. Recent web searches confirm global contrasts: worldwide EV sales grew 25% through August, per Startup News, but North America’s 6% increase lags behind Asia’s boom, where China alone saw NEV market share exceed 50%.

Market Diversification and Consumer Shifts

Drilling deeper, the sales data from Argonne National Laboratory’s monthly updates illustrates a maturing ecosystem, with plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and battery EVs (BEVs) both contributing to the record. Hybrids, in particular, surged as a bridge technology for range-anxious consumers, comprising a growing portion of electrified sales. Cox Automotive’s Q1 2025 report, which tracked a 10% year-over-year EV growth, set the stage for August’s peak, though it also flagged Tesla’s early declines.

Industry insiders whisper of strategic pivots ahead. Automakers are ramping up domestic production to qualify for any remaining incentives, while investing in battery tech to reduce costs. A IEA analysis projects that by 2030, EVs could claim 30% of U.S. sales if infrastructure investments accelerate, but regulatory rollbacks pose risks.

Sustainability Challenges and Long-Term Outlook

Environmental advocates celebrate August’s figures as a win for emissions reduction, yet supply-chain vulnerabilities loom. Rare-earth mineral dependencies and recycling hurdles could inflate prices, as noted in Virta’s global market overview. On X, posts from accounts like The Electric Viking amplify optimism, sharing videos of record-smashing sales, but they also caution against overreliance on Tesla’s ecosystem.

As the dust settles, August 2025 stands as a high-water mark, but the road ahead demands innovation beyond incentives. Automakers must navigate political winds, consumer skepticism, and technological leaps to sustain momentum. For now, the numbers speak volumes: EVs are no longer niche—they’re mainstream, if precariously so.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-212d8ec6-7fbd-47c3-91e8-66777baa6b2c.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:54.690330

Econergy plans to add a 68-megawatt battery energy storage system to the Oradea site. The system will make the project more valuable by storing excess power, helping balance the grid, and optimizing electricity sales. Phoenix Holdings partnered with Econergy on the project and has invested more than 225 million euros in renewable projects in Romania and Poland.

Eyal Podhorzer, CEO of Econergy, said: ""This achievement underscores our ability to deliver large-scale renewable projects while advancing our strategy of integrating storage solutions to maximize value for our stakeholders.""

Solar farms like Oradea are part of a wider trend reshaping energy worldwide. Similar projects in community solar and rooftop solar are giving people more ways to save money and contribute to a cleaner environment.

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack because it can bring your cost of energy down to at or near $0. EnergySage provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

Going solar also makes using other money-saving electric appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper to run. Mitsubishi can help consumers find the right affordable heat pump for their home.

Other projects are reshaping energy in similar ways. In Minnesota, Xcel Energy is turning a former coal plant site into the Sherco solar and storage facility, set to become the largest in the Upper Midwest by 2026.

In California, Avangrid's Camino Solar will power about 14,000 homes, while Lehigh University in Pennsylvania has added a solar thermal concentrator to supply clean energy on campus and support student research.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uHLpGGOWAO5epECJqkGIWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/513981ea74abfa3e59299b6a309d92be,N,,2025-09-13 13:59:58.005212

This flies in the face of the EPA's core mission—to protect the environment and public health.""
""The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available,"" he noted.","Citing US President Donald Trump's anti-climate executive actions, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Friday unveiled a proposal to end a program that requires power plants, refineries, landfills, and more to report their emissions.

While Zeldin claimed that ""the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" experts and climate advocates emphasized the importance of the data collection, which began in 2010.

""President Trump promised Americans would have the cleanest air on Earth, but once again, Trump's EPA is taking actions that move us further from that goal,"" Joseph Goffman, who led the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration, said in a statement from the Environmental Protection Network, a group for former agency staff.

""Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,"" he explained.

As The New York Times reported:

For the past 15 years, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has collected data from about 8,000 of the country's largest industrial facilities. That information has helped guide numerous decisions on federal policy and has been shared with the United Nations, which has required developed countries to submit tallies of their emissions.

In addition, private companies often rely on the program's data to demonstrate to investors that their efforts to cut emissions are working. And communities often use it to determine whether local facilities are releasing air pollution that threatens public health.

""By hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health,"" Goffman said. ""It's a further addition to the deliberate blockade against future action on climate change—and yet another example of the administration putting polluters before people's health.""

Sierra Club's director of climate policy and advocacy, Patrick Drupp, stressed Friday that ""EPA cannot avoid the climate crisis by simply burying its head in the sand as it baselessly cuts off its main source of greenhouse gas emissions data.""

""The agency has provided no defensible reason to cancel the program; this is nothing more than EPA's latest action to deny the reality of climate change and do everything it can to put the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters before people,"" he added. ""The Sierra Club will oppose this proposal every step of the way.”

Margie Alt, director of the Climate Action Campaign, similarly said that ""the Trump administration's latest pro-polluter move to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is just another brazen step in their Polluters First agenda.""

Responding to the administration's claim that the proposal would save businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs, Alt said that ""under the guise of saving Americans money, this is an attempt on the part of Trump, Lee Zeldin, and their polluter buddies to hide the ball and avoid responsibility for the deadly, dangerous, and expensive pollution they produce.""

""If they succeed, the nation's biggest polluters will spew climate-wrecking pollution without accountability,"" she warned. ""The idea that tracking pollution does 'nothing to improve air quality' is absurd,"" she added. ""If you don't measure it, you can't manage it. Hiding information and allowing fossil fuel companies to avoid accountability are the true goals of this rule.""

BlueGreen Alliance executive director Jason Walsh declared that ""the Trump administration continues to prove it does not care about the American people and their basic right to breathe clean air. This flies in the face of the EPA's core mission—to protect the environment and public health.""

""The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available,"" he noted. ""Everybody in this country deserves to know the air quality in their community and how their lives can be affected when they live near high-emitting facilities.""

“Knowledge is power and—in this case—health,"" he concluded. ""The administration shouldn't be keeping people in the dark about the air they and their neighbors are breathing.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56530290&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C407%2C0%2C407,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:49.834565

While the Energy Department's CWG is now disbanded, the case continues over whether its report will be included in EPA's decision on regulating climate pollution.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright has disbanded the Department of Energy's controversial Climate Working Group (CWG), which wrote a report that prompted dozens of independent scientists to issue a joint rebuttal saying the report was full of errors and misrepresented climate science.

The disbanding was first reported by CNN and now NPR has confirmed that Wright wrote a letter on September 3rd to the five hand-picked members of the group, thanking them for their service.

The decision to disband the CWG came as a hearing was held this week in a lawsuit that the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists had filed against the Trump administration. As NPR reported previously, the suit alleges that Energy Secretary Chris Wright ""quietly arranged for five hand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change"" to compile the government's climate report and violated the law by creating the report in secret with authors ""of only one point of view.""

Wright wrote in the letter that the purpose of the group and its report was ""to catalyze scientific and public debate"" and that the result ""exceeded my expectations."" Wright concluded that with that goal met the CWG could now be dissolved.

The CWG consisted of four scientists and one economist who have all questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses huge threats to people and ecosystems and who sometimes framed global warming as beneficial.

The report was drafted to support a Trump administration effort to stop regulating climate pollution. The DOE report was cited multiple times by the Environmental Protection Agency in its recent proposal to roll back what's known as the endangerment finding, which is the basis for federal rules regulating climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry.

""The Climate Working Group was convened in secrecy, and it created a clandestine report – in brazen violation of federal law – that is being used to weaken protections against the climate pollution that makes life less safe and less affordable for all Americans,"" Erin Murphy, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a statement.

The environmental groups want a court to throw out the CWG report, but at a conference in Belgium Friday, Wright praised the document for prompting ""open, back and forth dialogue.""

""That's what we want is to bring people that have different perspectives or disagree to dialogue together and argue it out,"" Wright told the crowd.

For all but a small segment of scientists, the debate Wright wants to prompt has already been settled.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, coordinated the response from climate experts. He says unlike the DOE report, climate reports from groups such as the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change feature the work of hundreds of global scientists and require multiple rounds of peer review.

""When well-established scientific conclusions are challenged by arguments that ignore or contradict decades of solid evidence, these debates don't advance our understanding,"" Dessler wrote to NPR in a statement. ""Instead, they can muddy the waters and distract from more productive scientific inquiry.""

Dessler says the CWG report mimics the doubt-sowing strategy the tobacco industry used to prevent regulation of its harmful products.

While the Energy Department's CWG is now disbanded, the case continues over whether its report will be included in EPA's decision on regulating climate pollution. The judge has scheduled a hearing on September 23rd for the Trump administration's motion to dismiss part of the case.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

""We're going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,"" said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. ""Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.""

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs—likely for the biggest power users—to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast—twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data—and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

""Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,"" said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation's largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

""This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM's footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,"" the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a ""bring your own generation"" requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

""And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said. ""Or is there a better way to do it?""

Although the time has passed for newly contracted solar energy systems to be fully installed by 2025, there are still multiple ways to maximize savings and reduce home energy costs through Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg before this fall’s enrollment deadline for the program.

Launched this summer by a local partnership consisting of the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, the Town of Davidson, and Centralina Regional Council, the limited-time campaign offers benefits uniquely geared to making renewable energy for homes, businesses and nonprofits more affordable locally.

Among the multiple reasons going solar via Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg can provide savings and resiliency:

Group Discount of up to 20%: Group-purchasing discounts have already reached a new Second Tier of progressively lower pricing.

Free and Trusted Evaluations: Those who sign up without obligation by Oct. 31 get a no-cost custom proposal as well as qualify for group discount pricing. All evaluations include projected bill savings over the next 25 years and financial analyses that include payback times and return on investment.

System-Size Discounts: Additional discounts are available for larger system sizes of up to 30 cents per watt.

Community Support: Via Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, property owners are not “going it alone.” Campaign organizers bring over a decade of solar experience to help ensure projects meet expectations.

Duke PowerPair Program: Offering up to $9,000 for qualifying solar and battery systems for a limited time. Additional incentives from Duke are also projected to be at capacity within the next 30 days.

Duke Bridge Rate: A hybrid net metering rate plan will be available only through 2027.

Under the Solarize model, which has been successfully offered through governmental involvement in other North Carolina communities this decade, the more property owners who buy together, the greater the savings for everyone.

As a community-based group-purchasing program, Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg utilizes a “tiered” pricing structure. The more participants who buy a system, the lower the price for all. Those who act early may be eligible to receive a rebate from Renu Energy Solutions (the locally headquartered installer selected through vetting) at the end of the campaign. This structure makes the final price per watt the same for every buyer.

So far, more than 225 property owners have signed up to receive a solar energy system proposal through the campaign. Participants who signed contracts to make a purchase have already combined to buy 244.8 kW in system power, which equals 507,952 lbs. of CO2 avoided locally.

Batteries have also been added by many of these homeowners to complement their new systems. A total of 364.5 kWh in battery storage has been produced through the campaign.

The overall no-obligation signup deadline for Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg remains Oct. 31. Following this, the deadline for residential contracts to be signed is Dec. 31, 2025. (Property owners considering a system for their business or nonprofit organization through the program have later deadlines due to the time needed to consider a larger-scale system.)",https://mecktimes.com/files/2023/08/meckfavicon.webp,N,,2025-09-13 11:02:40.074774

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

First launched in 2002, the Sierra Denali redefined expectations for full-size pickups. With a 6.0-liter Vortec V8 engine, opulent leather interior, woodgrain accents, and the groundbreaking Quadrasteer four-wheel steering, it proved that trucks could deliver both muscle and refinement. The example used for comparison, preserved at the GM Heritage Center, remains a pristine reminder of the nameplate’s original promise.

Fast-forward to 2026, and the Sierra EV Denali carries that legacy into the electric age. Equipped with up to 760 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque in Max Power mode, the truck boasts a GM-estimated 478-mile driving range on a full charge. Advanced features like 4-Wheel Steer with CrabWalk, Super Cruise hands-free driver assistance, and cutting-edge infotainment mark a new era of capability and convenience.

“The influence of the original Denali pickup is immediately visible in the 2026 model,” noted GM News editor Bob Sorokanich. “Where the vintage truck offered Quadrasteer for nimble handling, today’s Sierra EV Denali takes it further with CrabWalk and autonomy-ready technology.”

The side-by-side test drive, led by GM’s Shad Balch, underscored just how far Denali luxury has come—from pioneering V8-powered toughness to all-electric sophistication designed for modern drivers.

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the SPEED Act proposes significant changes to NEPA’s key provisions.
He also pointed to actions by the Trump and Biden administrations that leveraged the existing permitting process to favor certain types of energy projects.
“One top-line message against the SPEED Act is that it’s a permitting process written by and for fossil fuel polluters and extractive industries,” Golden said.
On his first day in office, Trump issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this summer underscored deep partisan divides on energy and the environment, with critics decrying it as a handout to fossil fuel interests while President Donald Trump’s supporters heralded it for securing America’s “energy dominance.”

Given the tumult over the bill’s passage, one could be forgiven for assuming that congressional Democrats would balk at working with their Republican colleagues on the GOP’s upcoming priorities.

But that’s exactly what some legislators—and key voices in the energy industry—are trying to do following the summer recess.

Their focus in the coming weeks is permitting reform, a variety of proposals to speed up the process of approving and building major infrastructure and energy projects across the nation, such as wind and solar farms, power transmission lines and fossil fuel pipelines.

The process for those approvals can stretch on for years, significantly delaying the rollout of new energy projects. According to a 2024 fact sheet from the American Clean Power Association (ACP), it currently takes an average of 4.5 years for an energy project to get the required permits needed to build, and 7.5 years for a transmission project.

Those delays impact green energy and fossil fuel industries alike, according to Xan Fishman, vice president of the Energy Program at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

“The process is neither good for businesses in the economy, nor is it good for the environment, because in order to achieve good environmental outcomes, we actually do need to build,” Fishman said.

Frank Maisano, senior principal at the lobbying firm Bracewell, echoed that sentiment.

“Whether it’s a gas pipeline, whether it’s a natural gas combined cycle plant, whether it’s a transmission line, whether it’s a solar or a wind project, it’s absurd that you should have to spend that long trying to get a permit so that you can produce power for people at a time when we need every electron we can find or get,” Maisano said.

Now, as permitting reform comes back on the agenda, an alliance of strange bedfellows is pushing more lawmakers to tackle the issue.

When Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and then-Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.V.) introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act in 2024, both ACP and the American Petroleum Institute (API)—trade associations for the renewable industry and oil and gas industry, respectively—endorsed the bill as a welcome step toward meeting the growing demand for electricity and strengthening American energy security.

That bill never received a floor vote in the Senate, but there now appears to be renewed interest from the energy sector and legislators to try again.

The most significant bipartisan effort currently before Congress is the SPEED Act, introduced by Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and committee member Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine).

The bill would make significant changes to how the federal government conducts environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

That 1970 law has been described as the bedrock of environmental law. It requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them, providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects those projects could have.

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the SPEED Act proposes significant changes to NEPA’s key provisions. Among those measures, the bill limits what projects would be subject to NEPA review and the scope of those reviews; raises the bar for courts to overturn the decisions of federal agencies overseeing those reviews; and establishes a 150-day deadline to sue federal agencies over their permitting decisions—a drastic reduction from the current 6-year statute of limitations.

In a committee hearing for the bill on Wednesday, Westerman said the changes the bill proposes would bring needed reform and certainty to the permitting process. He also pointed to actions by the Trump and Biden administrations that leveraged the existing permitting process to favor certain types of energy projects.

The Trump administration has taken steps to streamline permitting for fossil fuel projects in recent months, while introducing obstacles for the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects.

Under the Biden administration, the opposite was true—officials introduced rules meant to speed up the process for renewables while adding additional hurdles for projects expected to harm the climate.

“This is an opportunity for Congress to exert their Article One authority and to create a system that doesn’t change when an administration changes,” Westerman said. “A system that’s fair, a system that allows access for all projects, and a system that’s blind to the project that is being proposed.”

Golden emphasized that improvements to NEPA would benefit all forms of energy development, including renewables.

“One top-line message against the SPEED Act is that it’s a permitting process written by and for fossil fuel polluters and extractive industries,” Golden said. “This ignores the reality that wind, solar and other clean energy projects face significant delays because of NEPA litigation.

“These problems with NEPA can cut both ways, and so too should be the solutions.”

But while that message resonated with Republicans and some Democrats in the hearing, other members—including Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—cast doubt on whether the benefits of any permitting reform bill, even a technology-neutral one, would be felt equally across the energy sector.

“I am personally deeply skeptical that we can negotiate in good faith right now to try to accelerate permitting of any kind, while there is an ongoing bad faith attack against solar and wind,” Levin said during the hearing.

That sentiment was echoed by more of Levin’s colleagues, including Rep. Emily Randall (D-Wash.), Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-Md.), and Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), all of whom referenced the administration’s attacks on renewables as obstacles to their support for the bill.

On his first day in office, Trump issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration has also taken the unusual move to issue stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already fully permitted and under construction.

To some critics such as Marlyn Twitchell, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, those moves could mean that fossil fuel interests disproportionately benefit from a streamlined permitting process the SPEED Act would create, while renewables see few tangible benefits.

“Given the administration’s war on renewable energy projects, this bill would do little but SPEED the climate crisis and the fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and oppressive heat that have already killed so many Americans and so severely damaged our homes, public lands, and economy,” Twitchell said in a Wednesday press release.

Other environmental groups have also voiced their opposition to the bill, arguing that the act’s provisions don’t address the primary drivers of permitting delays.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said—like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice, said existing legislation from the past several years had already begun to address those needs.

“We had the Inflation Reduction Act—for the first time in history, Congress actually funded the agencies themselves to the tune of a billion dollars to actually do these reviews [and] do them more quickly,” Schima said. “They made statutory changes in the Fiscal Responsibility Act that established deadlines for environmental assessments, environmental impact statements.”

However, he said that recent actions by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans threatened to undo that progress by cutting the federal workforce and clawing back the additional resources that had been provided.

“There’s been this litany of changes, and what we’ve seen on the Republican side … in the passage of [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] is revoking that funding, rescinding the funding that was in the IRA that was actually leading to results,” Schima said.

“What we’ve seen … is a decimation of the staff and capacity at the federal agencies themselves. We need to get the staff back. We need people in the federal government to be doing these reviews and to help shepherd projects through the permitting process.”

Inside Climate News asked Westerman on Wednesday whether he would consider incorporating additional funding and staffing for federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews as part of the SPEED Act.

Westerman suggested that technological advances might allow agencies to make further cuts, instead.

“I’m having people from AI companies tell me we can cut down NEPA permitting just using AI,” he said. “So technology may get us to the point where we don’t even need as many people.”

Even if Westerman and Golden’s bill fails to garner enough support, the appetite for a bipartisan deal on permitting is unlikely to end there.

Turn Forward, a nonprofit advocating for offshore wind energy, hasn’t taken a public stance on the SPEED Act and said that achieving a bipartisan solution on permitting reform is “going to be a lift,” but executive director Hillary Bright said that she was “optimistic” about the odds of success.

And in the Senate, Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) and Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) are in the early stages of discussing another possible bipartisan bill, according to a staffer familiar with the matter.

The staffer said that those efforts won’t be able to move forward without the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but news of the collaboration prompted a positive response from key industry voices.

“It doesn’t surprise me at all,” said Maisano.

“If there’s a guy who … can rally climate activists, that can bring people together and work with the Shelley Moore Capitos and the Lisa Murkowskis of the world … I would never put it past Senator Whitehouse to be in that position to be a broker of hard issues and complex issues to make solutions possible.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2193737930-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 06:58:17.759309

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), launched in 2010, covers more than 8,000 facilities that together account for 85-90 percent of the country's planet-warming pollution.

The programme requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty, which allows officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Experts say the reporting holds companies publicly accountable for their emissions. Since the GHGRP began, the US industry has collectively reported a 20 percent drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

Trump, who received hundreds of millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry during his 2024 election campaign, has heavily promoted new oil, gas and coal extraction while moving to suppress competition from solar and wind.

""Alongside President Trump, EPA continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American Dream,"" Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in announcing the decision, which will undergo a public comment period before being finalised.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.""

A move that could 'blind Americans' to risks of pollution

Although the programme was established through an act of Congress, the EPA argued it is not legally obliged to continue collecting the data, with the sole exception of methane emissions.

But experts say dropping the requirement, as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in US history, risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere would make it tougher to fight climate change.

A climate law passed in 2022 under former Democratic president Joe Biden established a methane fee on oil and gas operations, but Republicans' recently enacted ""Big Beautiful Bill"" requires such reporting only from 2034. Accordingly, the EPA under Zeldin says it will suspend all data collection until then.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

""Again and again, this administration is trying to hide the data to hide the harms,"" Julie McNamara of the Union of Concerned Scientists told AFP.

""If we can't say what a facility is doing, we can't hold that facility accountable,"" she added, warning that the lack of verifiable emissions data would undermine action at local, state, national, and international levels.

Democrats had anticipated the move after they obtained documents in the spring that indicated the change was planned.

""For the past 15 years, the GHGRP has collected facility-level emissions data from over 8,000 facilities, supplying vital information to policymakers, scientists, investors, and the public,"" Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said in May.

""These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting obligations, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies' climate disclosures in the absence of industry-wide methodologies.""

He added that the data had allowed US industry to market itself as cleaner than foreign competitors, and ending the programme would hand an advantage to China.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.

Oklo expects the investment to total up to nearly $1.7 billion and create over 800 jobs.

The initial investment will support a facility that recovers material from used nuclear fuel and fabricates it into fuel for advanced reactors like Oklo's Aurora powerhouse. The company anticipates the site will begin producing metal fuel for Aurora powerhouses by the early 2030s.

The fuel recycling facility serves as the first phase of Oklo’s broader advanced fuel center, a multi-facility campus aimed at supporting recycling and fuel fabrication.

Oklo also plans to explore opportunities with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle used fuel at the new facility and evaluate potential power sales from future Oklo powerhouses in the region. The company said the collaboration would mark the first time that a U.S. utility explored recycling used fuel into clean electricity through modern electrochemical processes.

""By recycling used fuel at scale, we are turning waste into gigawatts, reducing costs and establishing a secure U.S. supply chain that will support the deployment of clean, reliable and affordable power,"" Oklo Co-Founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte said.

According to Oklo, more than 94,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel stored at power plant sites around the country contain considerable reserves of recyclable fuel. The company estimated that recycling this fuel could unlock energy equivalent to about 1.3 trillion barrels of oil.

Oklo has completed a licensing project plan for the fuel recycling facility with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is currently in pre-application engagement with the regulator’s staff.

“We’ve invented a new carbon molecule that will extend the life of the battery by 30%,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Symposium on Friday. It’s a “revolutionary step change in battery performance.”

The invention is being tested by several EV manufacturers, Woods said. Used on the anode side of the battery, the synthetic graphite allows for faster charging, a longer lifespan and longer range for electric vehicles. Exxon this week announced the acquisition of several production assets from Chicago-based Superior Graphite, which will enable the company to scale-up manufacturing, with a goal of commercial production by 2029.

The Texas oil giant doesn’t intend to become a battery maker but it plans to use its refineries, chemical plants and laboratories to produce some of the materials to be used in the energy transition. It also has plans to extract lithium, a major battery component.

“We don’t do wind and solar, we have no issues with wind and solar, but we don’t have capability in that space,” Woods said. “But we do have capability of transforming molecules and there are enormous opportunities in that space to use hydrogen and carbon molecules to meet the growing demand.”

Exxon has long been a player in the vehicle-battery space. The company invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and created the plastic film for the first rechargeable version in 1991. Almost two decades ago, Exxon created a new type of material used to separate battery components.

While Exxon is moving ahead with its battery-material business, the outlook for hydrogen, another targeted growth area, is looking more challenged. The company has warned it may delay a low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, due to a lack of interest from customers.

The shortening of the timeframe available to claim hydrogen tax credits under President Donald Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill may also slow market development, Woods said.

“Our big concern today around low-carbon hydrogen is whether there’s enough time within that bill to incentivize the development of the market,” Woods said.

A viable hydrogen industry based on market forces is essential to supporting multi-billion dollar investments, he said.

“We can’t do it on charity.”

Why It Matters

China has become the undisputed leader in green tech manufacturing and exports, dominating sectors from electric vehicles to solar panels and battery storage.

It has done so through aggressive state-driven industrial policy, massive public spending—totaling $625 billion last year, or nearly one-third of global clean energy investment—and by harnessing its integrated, domestic supply chains in a broader push to reduce reliance on oil imports and claim a lead in emerging technologies.

Newsweek reached out to China's National Energy Administration via email with a request for comment.

What To Know

Fossil fuel consumption in China has effectively plateaued since 2021, both in overall energy use and electricity generation, according to a report by U.K.-based think tank Ember.

Eighty-four percent of the increase in electricity demand last year was met by clean energy sources, including wind, solar and nuclear, per the report.

Wind and solar are leading the surge, with China generating 18 percent of its electricity from those sources in 2024—double the share from 2020, Ember said.

In the first six months of 2025, wind output rose 16 percent over the same period last year, while solar generation soared by 43 percent. Combined output from wind and solar hit 2,073 terawatt-hours by June, surpassing China's hydropower, nuclear and bioenergy output for the first time.

Fossil fuel use for direct end uses—like transportation, heating and industrial combustion—has stalled at just under 150 exajoules since 2018.

China has added 267.53 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first half of 2025 alone—nearly triple the rest of the world combined, according to Ember.

What People Are Saying

Jonas Nahm, assistant professor for energy, resources and environment at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, wrote on X: ""As the U.S. withdraws from green tech industries and pressures allies to follow suit, China is stepping in to power the developing world's energy transition. The scale is staggering.""

Guo Jiakun, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a June news conference: ""This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement. China is always a staunch doer and important contributor to global green development. Working toward peaking carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality is our solemn commitment to the international community.""

Nicholas Janzen is policy and partnerships director at Maine Conservation Voters. Francis Eanes is executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council.

Just a short two years ago, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) proved that tackling climate change and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive. The law unleashed a clean energy boom nationwide, creating thousands of good-paying union jobs, lowering household energy costs, and giving communities the tools to protect themselves from extreme weather.

In Maine, the impact was clear. We’ve surpassed our ambitious heat pump goals and are weatherizing our homes, small businesses are using solar, and we started laying the groundwork for pioneering offshore wind projects that could power our state for decades.

Now, Congress is working to undo that progress. On July 4, lawmakers passed, and President Donald Trump signed, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” More like the “Big Ugly Bill” to us. Instead of lowering costs like clean energy does, this bill drives them up. It’s nothing more than a Republican rate hike on everyday people.

This legislation guts the very programs that made the IRA such a success. The result will be higher home energy bills, lost jobs, and weaker competitiveness for Maine businesses, all while handing out tax breaks to billionaires and polluting oil and gas companies.

The bill phases out wind and solar tax credits unless projects break ground immediately, eliminates incentives for new and used electric vehicles, and ends funding for home energy upgrades, including rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation, all by the end of 2025. By slashing the very incentives that have fueled clean energy growth, it threatens to stall projects, kill jobs, and drive up energy costs for Mainers.

While the IRA fueled innovation, kept energy dollars in-state, and created family-sustaining work, the Big Ugly Bill forces families to pay more while padding the profits of the wealthiest corporations. One builds us up, the other drags us down.

Many solar projects — including a 140-megawatt array in Hartland — have already been put on hold. Union electricians are seeing hours dry up. Maine is projected to lose 1,600 clean energy jobs, and households could pay $80 more per year by 2035.

All of this comes on top of recent electricity rate hikes, driven primarily by the costs of recovering from severe winter storms intensified by climate change.

Yet our organizations know that Maine has always led and will continue to lead on climate. Even as federal policy falters, during the most recent state legislative session we strengthened emergency planning, funded climate adaptation projects, and strengthened clean electricity goals that keep energy dollars local, create union jobs, and help households save. With a new cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources, Maine is building the capacity to guide a clean energy future efficiently and effectively.

But while Maine acts, federal policy is moving in the wrong direction. Many Mainers knew the Big Ugly Bill was bad long before it passed. Dozens of organizations, businesses, labor unions, and community leaders successfully advocated to Maine’s congressional delegation, urging them to reject these clean energy rollbacks.

And while it wasn’t enough to prevent passage, Maine’s entire federal delegation heeded that call and voted against the legislation.

Even as the Big Ugly Bill drives up costs, cuts jobs, and stalls critical clean energy projects, Maine must continue to act on its own to mitigate the damage. By continuing to invest in renewable energy, strengthen climate adaptation, and support families and workers, the state can and will keep moving forward.

Two years after the Inflation Reduction Act showed what’s possible, Maine has proven that fighting climate change, creating good jobs, and saving families money can go hand in hand.

We know we can’t do it all on our own. Federal partnership is essential, but by pressing ahead, staying bold, and keeping communities at the center of our work, Maine can continue to lead.

The Big Ugly Bill is a rate hike on everyday people. Maine’s path is clear: We lead, we build, and we keep costs down for families.",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-47.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-13 04:57:50.590670

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said. ""Or is there a better way to do it?”

Coal-fired power plant reconversion plans

The collaboration will focus on conversion of coal-fired plants to natural gas-fired generation facilities. This solution, which acts as a “crucial bridge” in the energy transition, offers a fast and economically viable response, something that renewables alone cannot yet match in terms of speed of implementation.

The rise of AI and Big Data has created a demand for power not seen in nearly two decades. Data center developers and hyperscalers need immediate, reliable and affordable power solutions. This is where the combined expertise of B&W and Denham comes into play.

“Power response time is a key factor for data center developers,” explained Justin DeAngelis, Global Head of Sustainable Infrastructure at Denham Capital. “This collaboration is a differentiating tool that will allow us to quickly meet the needs of the market.” DeAngelis added that Denham will not only invest substantially in these projects, but will also soon launch a portfolio company dedicated entirely to these solutions.

For its part, B&W brings a wealth of industry knowledge to the table. With nearly 160 years of experience, the company is an expert in converting coal-fired power plants to natural gas. Kenneth Young, president and CEO of B&W, highlighted his company’s unique ability to plan and execute complex projects, combining proven technologies with innovations to meet market demand.

“This alliance brings together two teams with extensive experience to quickly and effectively identify opportunities to leverage underutilized coal-fired power plants and provide affordable, reliable power to large-scale data centers,” Young said.",https://cdn.inspenet.com/Los-planes-de-reconversion-de-las-centrales-electricas-de-carbon.webp,N,,2025-09-13 02:58:29.723365

The new action plan, grounded in the nation’s dual carbon goals, aims to grow the national new energy storage fleet to 180 GW by 2027.
Officials from the National Energy Administration emphasized that energy storage is now essential for stabilizing the power system and meeting growing electricity demands.
Earlier this year, China scrapped a national energy storage mandate – a policy that had previously driven as much as 75% of the country’s storage deployment.
Key measures include: Promoting the joint participation of “new energy + energy storage” in electricity market transactions as a single bidding entity.","China aims to add more than 100 GW of new energy storage (primarily battery storage, excluding pumped hydro) by 2027, according to a new action plan presented by authorities on Friday.

The “Special Action Plan for Large-Scale Construction of New Energy Storage (2025-2027)” released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) outlines a roadmap to scale up energy storage to support the country’s rapidly expanding renewable energy capacity. The plan is expected to drive CNY 250 billion yuan (approximately $35 billion) in sector investment over three years.

China has already outpaced its previous targets. The country reached its 2025 goal of 30 GW two years early and saw explosive growth in 2024 alone, adding 37 GW / 91 GWh of new energy storage – more than doubling total capacity year-on-year. As of June 2025, China’s new energy storage fleet had surpassed 100 GW, overtaking the pumped hydro additions for the first time, according to data from the China Energy Storage Alliance (CNESA).

The new action plan, grounded in the nation’s dual carbon goals, aims to grow the national new energy storage fleet to 180 GW by 2027. It responds to the urgent need for flexible energy regulation amid rapid renewable energy expansion. Officials from the National Energy Administration emphasized that energy storage is now essential for stabilizing the power system and meeting growing electricity demands.

The plan also comes at a critical moment. Earlier this year, China scrapped a national energy storage mandate – a policy that had previously driven as much as 75% of the country’s storage deployment. Introduced in 2022, the mandate required most new solar and wind projects to include co-located storage. Over 20 provinces implemented their own mandates, with some increasing their required storage ratios from 10% to as high as 20%.

The new plan envisages a more comprehensive and market-oriented approch to scaling up new energy storage. The plan outlines strategies for expanding application scenarios and improving the utilization efficiency of storage systems. It also aims to promote application of innovative projects and strengthen the development of a comprehensive standardization system.

Finally, the plan seeks to imrpove market mechanisms for the new energy storage by promoting their participation in the wholesale and anciliary service markets and accelerating the development of a dedicated pricing mechanism.

Application scenarios and market mechanisms

The Action Plan considers the needs of building a new power system and focuses on three main areas: the power supply side, the grid side, and other emerging application scenarios.

On the power supply side, the focus is on large-scale base energy storage, integration with new energy sources, and support for coal-fired power plants. These measures aim to improve the ability of coal plants to adjust output and enhance the overall grid integration of renewable energy.

On the grid side, the emphasis is on deploying storage at key grid nodes and within distribution networks. The plan encourages the development of energy storage facilities that can serve as alternatives to traditional grid infrastructure, as well as broader use of grid-based storage solutions.

For other applications, the plan targets fast-growing areas such as industrial parks, data centers, distributed solar systems, and telecom base stations. Innovative storage models will be promoted to improve energy efficiency and support stable power supply in these scenarios.

To support the integration of new energy storage into a unified national electricity market, the Action Plan calls for accelerating the development of market mechanisms. Key measures include:

Promoting the joint participation of “new energy + energy storage” in electricity market transactions as a single bidding entity.

Encouraging regions to develop auxiliary services – such as ramping and inertia support – based on local power system needs.

Improving capacity pricing mechanisms to better reflect the value of regulatory resources like energy storage.

In addition, the Plan urges all regions to speed up the development of medium- and long-term electricity markets as well as spot markets. It also calls for market price formation mechanisms to ensure that the pricing of energy storage charging and discharging is fair and market-driven.

Looking ahead, the NEA will guide provincial and regional energy authorities to follow national planning guidelines, accurately assess their local regulatory capacity needs, and clearly define the scale and layout of new energy storage and other flexibility resources.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/China.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 02:58:34.418558

California accounts for 857 EV tax credit claims (new and used) per 100,000 returns — far above the U.S. average of 320.","The federal electric vehicle tax credit, designed to encourage EV purchases by making them more affordable, is set to expire Sept. 30. While it was initially due to expire in 2032, its brief run helped new-car buyers save $3.3 billion in tax year 2023 alone.

A recent analysis by LendingTree looked at where consumers will miss out the most when the credit ends.

In tax year 2023, Americans filed 487,990 returns claiming the new EV tax credit, totaling $3.3 billion, and 28,180 for the preowned EV credit, totaling another $95.6 million. The average credit was $6,709 for new EVs, which are eligible for up to $7,500, and $3,392 for used EVs, eligible for up to $4,000.

Based on results from tax year 2023, California stands to take the biggest hit when the credit ends.

LendingTree analysts predict Californians could miss out on an estimated $1.1 billion in EV tax credits in the tax year following the end of the credits. That includes credits for new and used EVs. Californians submitted 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit in tax year 2023, or 32.2% of U.S. claims. For used EV credits, California also led, accounting for 23.2% of U.S. claims.

California accounts for 857 EV tax credit claims (new and used) per 100,000 returns — far above the U.S. average of 320.

Behind California, Texans could lose an estimated $272.7 million in potential savings, and Floridians stand to lose $201.4 million. Texas and Florida were also next in claims at a far lower 38,870 and 30,090.

Washington (571) and New Jersey (506) also have high per-capita claim rates. Conversely, Mississippi (44), North Dakota (51) and Louisiana (57) have the fewest claims compared to the number of individual tax returns.

Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst, said those credits are big, especially when considering how expensive vehicles are today.

“That these credits could often be taken at the point of sale makes them even more significant,” he said. “It’s one thing to have to wait until the following spring to get a rebate with your tax refund. It’s something else to be able to knock thousands of dollars off the price of a vehicle from the start. I have no doubt that those credits inspired people who may not otherwise have considered an electric vehicle to at least think about them.”

Schulz said the end of the credits means “an awful lot of potential buying power will go away for consumers.”

However, while the federal EV tax credit is phasing out, many states offer substantial incentives for EVs, including the top-ranking California and Texas.

Nationwide, only 1.7% of light-duty vehicles registered in 2023 were electric — an increase from 1.2% in 2022. California leads again, with EVs comprising 4.5% of registered vehicles. The District of Columbia (3.8%) and Hawaii (3.0%) follow. Meanwhile, just 0.2% of light-duty vehicles in Mississippi and North Dakota are electric.

New EV sales totaled 310,839 in Q2 2025, a 6.3% decrease from Q2 2024. The top three EVs sold in Q2 2025 were the Tesla Model Y (86,120), Tesla Model 3 (48,803) and Chevrolet Equinox EV (17,420). However, year-to-date Q1 and Q2 sales reached 607,089 — up 1.5% from the same period last year.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2024/EV_sales_full.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 09:58:51.137194

I’m also a sea kayak instructor and during the Camp Fire, I was in South Carolina for a training.
I have triplet daughters who were attending Butte College at the time, and they needed to be evacuated.
That’s why I thought we need a little bit of a buffer in Paradise and some protection around the community.
But in so many places, these events are foreseeable; we’re just not wired to think about them or prepare for them.","In order to better understand how communities can build back smarter after — or, ideally, before — a catastrophic fire, I spoke with Efseaff about his work in Paradise and how other communities might be able to replicate it. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Do you live in Paradise? Were you there during the Camp Fire?

I actually live in Chico. We’ve lived here since the mid-‘90s, but I have a long connection to Paradise; I’ve worked for the district since 2017. I’m also a sea kayak instructor and during the Camp Fire, I was in South Carolina for a training. I was away from the phone until I got back at the end of the day and saw it blowing up with everything.

I have triplet daughters who were attending Butte College at the time, and they needed to be evacuated. There was a lot of uncertainty that day. But it gave me some perspective, because I couldn’t get back for two days. It gave me a chance to think, “Okay, what’s our response going to be?” Looking two days out, it was like: That would have been payroll, let’s get people together, and then let’s figure out what we’re going to do two weeks and two months from now.

It also got my mind thinking about what we would have done going backwards. If you’d had two weeks to prepare, you would have gotten your go-bag together, you’d have come up with your evacuation route — that type of thing. But when you run the movie backwards on what you would have done differently if you had two years or two decades, it would include prepping the landscape, making some safer community defensible space. That’s what got me started.

Was it your idea to buy up the high-risk properties in the burn scar?

I would say I adapted it. Everyone wants to say it was their idea, but I’ll tell you where it came from: Pre-fire, the thinking was that it would make sense for the town to have a perimeter trail from a recreation standpoint. But I was also trying to pitch it as a good idea from a fuel standpoint, so that if there was a wildfire, you could respond to it. Certainly, the idea took on a whole other dimension after the Camp Fire.

I’m a restoration ecologist, so I’ve done a lot of river floodplain work. There are a lot of analogies there. The trend has been to give nature a little bit more room: You’re not going to stop a flood, but you can minimize damage to human infrastructure. Putting levees too close to the river makes them more prone to failing and puts people at risk — but if you can set the levee back a little bit, it gives the flood waters room to go through. That’s why I thought we need a little bit of a buffer in Paradise and some protection around the community. We need a transition between an area that is going to burn, and that we can let burn, but not in a way that is catastrophic.

How hard has it been to find willing sellers? Do most people in the area want to rebuild — or need to because of their mortgages?

Ironically, the biggest challenge for us is finding adequate funding. A lot of the property we have so far has been donated to us. It’s probably upwards of — oh, let’s see, at least half a dozen properties have been donated, probably close to 200 acres at this point.

We are applying for some federal grants right now, and we’ll see how that goes. What’s evolved quite a bit on this in recent years, though, is that — because we’ve done some modeling — instead of thinking of the buffer as areas that are managed uniformly around the community, we’re much more strategic. These fire events are wind-driven, and there are only a couple of directions where the wind blows sufficiently long enough and powerful enough for the other conditions to fall into play. That’s not to say other events couldn’t happen, but we’re going after the most likely events that would cause catastrophic fires, and that would be from the Diablo winds, or north winds, that come through our area. That was what happened in the Camp Fire scenario, and another one our models caught what sure looked a lot like the [2024] Park Fire.

One thing that I want to make clear is that some people think, “Oh, this is a fire break. It’s devoid of vegetation.” No, what we’re talking about is a well-managed habitat. These are shaded fuel breaks. You maintain the big trees, you get rid of the ladder fuels, and you get rid of the dead wood that’s on the ground. We have good examples with our partners, like the Butte Fire Safe Council, on how this works, and it looks like it helped protect the community of Cohasset during the Park Fire. They did some work on some strips there, and the fire essentially dropped to the ground before it came to Paradise Lake. You didn’t have an aerial tanker dropping retardant, you didn’t have a $2-million-per-day fire crew out there doing work. It was modest work done early and in the right place that actually changed the behavior of the fire.

Tell me a little more about the modeling you’ve been doing.

We looked at fire pathways with a group called XyloPlan out of the Bay Area. The concept is that you simulate a series of ignitions with certain wind conditions, terrain, and vegetation. The model looked very much like a Camp Fire scenario; it followed the same pathway, going towards the community in a little gulch that channeled high winds. You need to interrupt that pathway — and that doesn’t necessarily mean creating an area devoid of vegetation, but if you have these areas where the fire behavior changes and drops down to the ground, then it slows the travel. I found this hard to believe, but in the modeling results, in a scenario like the Camp Fire, it could buy you up to eight hours. With modern California firefighting, you could empty out the community in a systematic way in that time. You could have a vigorous fire response. You could have aircraft potentially ready. It’s a game-changing situation, rather than the 30 minutes Paradise had when the Camp Fire started.

How does this work when you’re dealing with private property owners, though? How do you convince them to move or donate their land?

We’re a Park and Recreation District so we don’t have regulatory authority. We are just trying to run with a good idea with the properties that we have so far — those from willing donors mostly, but there have been a couple of sales. If we’re unable to get federal funding or state support, though, I ultimately think this idea will still have to be here — whether it’s five, 10, 15, or 50 years from now. We have to manage this area in a comprehensive way.

Private property rights are very important, and we don’t want to impinge on that. And yet, what a person does on their property has a huge impact on the 30,000 people who may be downwind of them. It’s an unusual situation: In a hurricane, if you have a hurricane-rated roof and your neighbor doesn’t, and theirs blows off, you feel sorry for your neighbor but it’s probably not going to harm your property much. In a wildfire, what your neighbor has done with the wood, or how they treat vegetation, has a significant impact on your home and whether your family is going to survive. It’s a fundamentally different kind of event than some of the other disasters we look at.

Do you have any advice for community leaders who might want to consider creating buffer zones or something similar to what you’re doing in Paradise?

Start today. You have to think about these things with some urgency, but they’re not something people think about until it happens. Paradise, for many decades, did not have a single escaped wildfire make it into the community. Then, overnight, the community is essentially wiped out. But in so many places, these events are foreseeable; we’re just not wired to think about them or prepare for them.

Buffers around communities make a lot of sense, even from a road network standpoint. Even from a trash pickup standpoint. You don’t think about this, but if your community is really strung out, making it a little more thoughtfully laid out also makes it more economically viable to provide services to people. Some things we look for now are long roads that don’t have any connections — that were one-way in and no way out.

Coal Power Declines In China China often draws criticism for its embrace of coal-fired generating stations, and it is true that so far this century, it has built more of them and consumed more coal than any other nation.

In a report released on September 9, 2025, Ember said: “China’s surge in renewables and whole economy electrification is rapidly reshaping energy choices for the rest of the world, creating the conditions for a decline in global fossil fuel use.” Put another way, China is now the global leader in transitioning away from burning fossil fuels, and making the US mania for dirty fuels that waste three quarters of their available energy look sillier every day.

In the foreword to the report, Ember wrote: “The world stands at a pivotal moment. Climate change, energy security, and economic development are no longer separate challenges. Increasingly, they are interwoven — and so too must be our response. For too long, emerging economies have faced what seemed like a stark trade-off between growth and sustainability. As this report highlights, China’s green ascent challenges that assumption.

“Through scale, innovation and long-term planning, China is demonstrating that decarbonization can go hand in hand with industrial upgrading, job creation, and improved quality of life. These lessons carry significance not only for China, but for the broader region — especially Southeast Asia, where energy demand is rising and development needs remain pressing.”

Let’s unpack that a bit, shall we? In the US, the belief among the fossil fuel ideologues who have now captured the government is that renewable energy simply cannot be the basis of a robust economy because, as they tell us all the time, the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow. They refuse to acknowledge that energy storage technology is now so advanced that renewables absolutely can supply reliable, dispatchable electricity to homes and businesses. What China is doing gives the lie to all that fossil fuel twaddle.

Coal Power Declines In China

China often draws criticism for its embrace of coal-fired generating stations, and it is true that so far this century, it has built more of them and consumed more coal than any other nation. But the difference between China and the US is that it has always viewed coal as a means to an end — the creation of a modern manufacturing economy — not as an end in itself.

In fact, according to Bloomberg, China’s increase in coal power peaked in 2021 and fell significantly in 2022. Then it ticked up again in 2023, but is down by 2 percent so far this year.

Ember says China invested a staggering $625 billion in renewable energy in 2024 — nearly a third of all clean energy funding in the entire world. “China’s surge in renewables and whole-economy electrification is rapidly reshaping energy choices for the rest of the world, creating the conditions for a decline in global fossil fuel use,” Ember said. If current trends hold, “it’s likely that the world’s fossil fuel demand will be in structural decline by 2030.”

An Economic Restructuring

“China has embarked on this transition for a variety of reasons. Interviews with experts conducted for this report reveal that within China there is a realization that the old development paradigm centered on fossil fuels has run its course, and is not fit for 21st century realities. The government’s aim to establish an ‘ecological civilization,’ which simultaneously delivers on economic, social and environmental goals, is the response, embedded in the Constitution since 2018,” Ember said in its report.

“The clean energy transition is constraining China’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, reducing energy costs, stimulating growth and jobs and creating export markets. In 2024, investment and production in clean energy contributed 13.6 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion) to the national economy — a sum equivalent to about one-tenth of China’s GDP, or the total GDP of Australia — and the sector is growing three times faster than the Chinese economy overall. The depth of buy-in within business is reflected in research, development, and innovation — Chinese companies now account for about 75% of global patent applications in clean energy technology, up from just 5% in 2000.

“These investments in the clean energy future are driving dramatic cost reductions across the world in key technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, storage batteries and electric vehicles. The benefits are increasingly being felt in emerging markets, many of which are overtaking OECD countries in wind and solar generation share and in electrification.”

China was responsible for most of the global growth in fossil fuel use for a decade, but that is no longer the case, Ember said. In its view, “the implications for governments basing their economic growth plans on exporting coal, oil and gas are plain to see,” as demand for fossil fuels falls.

As China Goes, So Goes The World

That last part is prescient. My colleague Michael Barnard this week explored the Canadian government’s decision to prioritize LNG exports from its West Coast terminals. The US is also dumping billions of dollars into building new LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. But Barnard sees trouble ahead for both. In 2025, China and India signaled that LNG will not be central to their futures.

“India is showing that renewables will crowd gas out of the generation mix. China is diversifying away from LNG with massive renewables, transmission and storage, domestic production and Russian pipelines. These shifts matter because together the two countries represent the largest block of potential demand growth. If they are going in reverse, the market outlook for LNG becomes far weaker,” he wrote.

That parallels what the Ember report said. In its concluding paragraph, Ember wrote, “The scale, pace, and depth of China’s transition raises questions about the future of fossil fuel production globally. China has been the main ‘swing state’ for global fossil fuel demand for a decade.

“Its energy related fossil fuel consumption is likely to begin falling soon due to the twin trends of clean generation and end-use electrification, and made-in-China electro-technologies are displacing fossil energy across the world. The implications for governments basing their economic growth plans on exporting coal, oil and gas are plain to see.”

Cutting fossil fuel use is necessary to reducing carbon emissions and avoiding the worst consequences of a hotter planet, Bloomberg said. But the path to net zero has been complicated by various factors — from indifference and even hostility to the energy transition in some countries like the US, to concerns over the costs of its implementation in others. That has put a huge onus on the world’s biggest polluter — China — to prove to the world that clean energy is the most logical and most effective path forward not only for China but for other nations as well.

“China is disproving the notion that green goals and economic growth are at odds, according to the report,” Bloomberg said. “Instead, it has taken a path that has allowed the two to reinforce each other and create ‘self-sustaining momentum.'”

Disrupting Self-Sustaining Momentum

The fossil fuel industry established “self-sustaining momentum” decades ago, and it is the fear that anything different will send the whole world economy into a tailspin that makes people afraid to transition away from it. If China can show that clean energy and economic growth can be partners, then that fear will disappear. Once that happens, the changeover could happen swiftly.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DALL·E-2025-02-20-09.11.24-A-panoramic-image-of-a-map-of-China-covered-in-solar-panels-wind-turbines-and-transmission-lines-depicted-in-the-style-of-an-ancient-Chinese-paint-800x457.png,N,,2025-09-13 03:57:48.119301

A 100% renewable energy system in Africa could save up to $5 trillion by 2050 and create millions of jobs.","Rabat – A new report, The Renewable Energy Investment Case for Africa, has hailed Morocco’s NOOR Complex as one of Africa’s most important success stories in renewable energy.

The report highlights the remarkable progress Morocco has made in recent years in terms of clean energy transition. It describes the country’s solar plant as a “world-class utility-scale solar complex” and an example of how Africa can attract private capital to power its clean energy transition.

The NOOR Complex is one of the largest concentrated solar power plants in the world. With a total capacity of 582 megawatts, it combines concentrated solar power (510 MW) and photovoltaic technologies (72 MW). Its ability to store energy in molten salt allows Morocco to produce electricity even after sunset, which helps the country meet peak demand.

The report explains that the project was made possible through a public-private partnership between Morocco’s Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) and a consortium led by the company ACWA Power

International financial institutions, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank, provided concessional loans that lowered the project’s costs by up to 25%.

According to the report, “NOOR’s success demonstrates that for pioneering, capital-intensive technologies like CSP, a cohesive national vision can be effective at mitigating project risk and scaling infrastructure.”

Since its launch, NOOR has had a strong impact on Morocco’s energy sector. It provides electricity to more than 1.1 million people and accounts for around 5% of the country’s power supply.

It also reduces Morocco’s reliance on imported energy, a key issue for a nation that used to import over 97% of its energy. In addition, the project offsets about 690,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. The project also created thousands of jobs during construction and spurred new training programs and infrastructure in the Ouarzazate region.

However, the report notes some challenges, especially water use in the arid area where the complex is built. Later phases of the project adopted dry cooling technology to reduce this problem.

The NOOR Complex is central to Morocco’s long-term energy ambitions. The country aims to produce 52% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and solar energy plays a major role in that plan.

The report, jointly produced by Enzi Ijayo Africa Initiative (EIAI) and Africa Climate Insights (ACI), also places Morocco’s achievement in a wider African context. Despite holding 60% of the world’s best solar resources, Africa added less than 1% of global renewable capacity in 2024.

Financing is the biggest obstacle for the continent. “Africa must triple its annual growth rate to meet the Nairobi Declaration goal,” the report warns, referring to the 2023 pledge by African leaders to increase renewable energy capacity from 56 GW in 2022 to 300 GW by 2030.

If successful, this transition could transform the continent’s economy.

The Ontario government says it will contribute $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund to help fast-track construction.
Early this year, German tech giant Siemens announced a $150-million EV battery research hub in Ontario.
Sheldon Williamson, a professor at Ontario Tech University who focuses on EV battery systems, said the refinery is a strategically important step.
“Building North America’s first battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery on Ontario soil fills a clear gap in the battery supply chain,” he said.","Ontario is backing a $100-million investment to build North America’s first battery-grade cobalt refinery, aimed at supporting the country’s electric vehicle production at a time when the industry is struggling with slowing sales and a deepening trade war with the US.

Led by Toronto-based Electra Battery Materials, the plan is to build the refinery in Temiskaming Shores about 250 kilometres northeast of Sudbury.

The Ontario government says it will contribute $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund to help fast-track construction. Once completed, the facility would produce 6,500 tonnes of cobalt sulphate a year — enough to support production of up to one million EVs.

Electra CEO Trent Mell said the project is essential to reducing reliance on offshore suppliers, particularly China, which currently refines more than 90 per cent of the world’s cobalt. It will also help safeguard economic and energy security, and ensure Canada plays a leading role in the global energy transition, he added.

The province says, once completed, the facility would produce 6,500 tonnes of cobalt sulphate a year — enough to support production of up to one million EVs.

EV market under pressure

Canada’s $100 billion EV-sector development strategy faces turbulence. Sales growth has slowed, federal EV mandates are being revised and auto-sector investments are under strain from US tariffs. Earlier this year, Swedish battery-maker Northvolt collapsed, underscoring risks in the sector.

Both Ontario and Ottawa have pledged billions to secure critical mineral projects as a counter to US trade threats, arguing it will create jobs and strengthen economic sovereignty.

The province has promised $500 million for mineral processing, while Ottawa has invested $3.8 billion in exploration, refining and recycling. Early this year, German tech giant Siemens announced a $150-million EV battery research hub in Ontario.

Still, a report from the Canadian Climate Institute warned Canada could lose out on a $12 billion-a-year critical minerals market by 2040 without at least $30 billion in new mining investment. Global demand for copper, nickel, lithium, graphite, cobalt and rare earths is expected to hit $770 billion by that year.

Experts welcomed the cobalt announcement but raised concerns about execution and market realities.

Ian London, executive director of the Canadian Critical Minerals and Materials Alliance, an industry advocacy group, said the project sounds positive but questioned whether there are buyers lined up given the struggling EV market. “Where is the customer? Who has committed to buying the cobalt and at what price?” he asked. “Otherwise, this feels like a supply-push model rather than demand-pull. You can say the refinery will support EV battery plants, but unless Volkswagen or another automaker is lined up, there’s no customer.”

London said $100 million is likely not enough to build a refinery of this scale and Ontario’s $17.5-million contribution is only a term sheet — a non-binding agreement that sets out intentions but does not guarantee funding. He cautioned while the plan sounds positive, the real question is whether the plant will actually be built.

He added the refinery could make sense if Ontario secured markets abroad, such as European battery plants, which would reduce dependence on US buyers.

London also stressed that critical mineral investments should be tied to real industrial demand. He pointed to the federal government’s “nation-building” projects, such as high-speed rail, nuclear power and energy infrastructure, that will require large amounts of copper, steel and aluminum, as areas where investment may be more urgently needed.

A recent report from the Financial Accountability Office warns Ontario’s auto industry, a key pillar of the province’s economy, could lose thousands of jobs this year because of the US trade war. The sector makes up $36 billion of Ontario’s $220.5 billion in exports, with 85 per cent of goods headed to the US and most of the 1.54 million vehicles built last year sold to American consumers.

Sheldon Williamson, a professor at Ontario Tech University who focuses on EV battery systems, said the refinery is a strategically important step. The project could strengthen Ontario’s role in the global EV supply chain by making the province more attractive to battery-makers, recycling plants and automakers looking for reliable local suppliers.

Williamson says most cobalt refining currently takes place in Asia, mainly China, leaving North American supply chains exposed to trade risks. “Building North America’s first battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery on Ontario soil fills a clear gap in the battery supply chain,” he said.

The project shows Ontario is serious about building a domestic battery supply chain, but its success will depend on customers, partnerships and how fast the EV market evolves, he added.

The proposed rule would require that only the oil and natural gas industry continue to report GHG emissions, as this is specifically required by the Clean Air Act (PDF).
“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution,” Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA, says in a statement.
The chemical industry emitted 181.2 million tCO2e, and the oil and natural gas industry emitted 322 million tCO2e.
According to the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, the total US greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 5,960.80 million tCO2e, which was 11.25% of the global total.","In another strike against US climate policy, Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin announced on Friday afternoon that the agency is proposing to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

This program, stemming from a law signed in 2007 by President George W. Bush, requires that all facilities in the US annually report greenhouse gas emissions above a certain threshold so that scientists and lawmakers have accurate data with which to predict future climate and enact appropriate policy to mitigate any dangers. If the EPA’s proposal is finalized, the agency says, “most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 [sic] injection sites” would no longer have to report their emissions.

The proposed rule would require that only the oil and natural gas industry continue to report GHG emissions, as this is specifically required by the Clean Air Act (PDF). However, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald J. Trump in July, the Clean Air Act now says that the oil and natural gas industry doesn’t need to report its emissions again until 2034.

Criticisms of EPA’s move came quickly.

“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution,” Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA, says in a statement. “Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

Goffman further notes that “by hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health.”

According to the EPA’s news release, the GHGRP “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.” Zeldin says in the release that the program doesn’t improve air quality and “is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

The proposal is part of a wider effort by the agency to roll back regulations and spending on climate change and other areas.

By 2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that direct health costs from climate change will be between $2 billion and $4 billion per year. In addition, the WHO projects that climate change will cause about 250,000 additional deaths a year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.

According to the publicly available GHGRP data for 2023, the latest available, power plants in the US emitted 1,471.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). The chemical industry emitted 181.2 million tCO2e, and the oil and natural gas industry emitted 322 million tCO2e. According to the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, the total US greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 5,960.80 million tCO2e, which was 11.25% of the global total.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-GHG-reporting-rollback---172737:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-09-12 22:01:10.997352

Entergy expects its electric sales will grow by about 13% per year for the next few years, driven by data centers coming online in its service territory, Drew Marsh, Entergy chairman and CEO, said Wednesday at an energy forum hosted by Tulane University.

In recent years, Entergy’s industrial sales have spurred roughly 5% annual sales growth, according to Marsh. Ultimately, New Orleans-based Entergy’s sales could triple or quadruple by 2050, he said.

Meta plans to build a data center complex in Louisiana’s Richland Parish with an initial 2 GW of “compute,” which doesn’t include electricity for cooling and ancillary services, Marsh said. Entergy has agreed to build roughly 2 GW of gas-fired, combined cycle generation to serve the data center’s initial phase, at a cost of about $2 billion, he noted.

Under the plan approved Aug. 20 by the Louisiana Public Service Commission, Entergy Louisiana will build two generating in Richland Parish, which the company expects will be online in late 2028. A third facility will be built at the utility’s Waterford site in St. Charles Parish, which Entergy expects will be operating a year later. The power plants will total 2,262 MW and will be built to handle future carbon capture and sequestration technology, according to the company.

Meta’s data center complext could be expanded to 5 GW and Entergy may add up to 2 GW of solar to support it, Marsh said.

Meta will pay for the new generation and transmission upgrades needed to bring the data center online as well as its ongoing share of Entergy’s costs, according to Marsh. Those upgrades will boost grid reliability in the area, he said.

Entergy’s utilities serve about 3 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

The additional gas-fired generation for the Meta data center project will make it challenging for Entergy to meet its goal of cutting its carbon dioxide emissions by 50% below 2000 levels by 2030, Marsh said. However, Marsh expects Entergy will be able to meet its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, noting that Meta has agreed to explore carbon capture and storage options for the gas-fired capacity.

Entergy is “very focused” on sustainability, “but by and large, the world is not focused on sustainability — less so today than it was two years ago, to be sure,” Marsh said.

Marsh said he expects interest in sustainability will swing back around. “These are things that cycle around, and certainly younger generations have a very different expectation of what that should be, and I expect that over time, sustainability is going to move up in that pecking order,” Marsh said.

Currently, Entergy’s top priority is electricity affordability, followed closely by reliability and resilience, according to Marsh.

The United States needs more nuclear power plants and must retain its existing ones, said Marsh, who noted he is chair of the Nuclear Energy Institute.

However, building nuclear power plants is “a little bit of a challenge,” Marsh said, noting that the two new units at the Vogtle power plant in Georgia cost about $30 billion, up from an $8 billion initial estimate, and were about seven years behind schedule. “That’s not ideal.”

While nuclear safety is “very important,” it’s been “overdone” by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Marsh. As a result, using equipment that meets certain NRC standards can be extremely expensive and time consuming to acquire, he said.

Marsh called for “a more truly risk-based standard that is not so stringent.”

Marsh said he supports emerging small modular reactor technology, but that its name may lead to misconceptions. “They’re not necessarily small and they’re not necessarily modular,” he said.

Ontario Power Generation’s SMR project, for example, required a 10-story hole in the ground, according to Marsh.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BGm0Jg5e2WJ7M-pff5qSvRT_CqOJRjVlZiPK40HwSWs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzE2Mi5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-09-12 22:01:16.380428

According to the government, the proposed National DMAP and PPS accelerate the country’s offshore renewable energy ambition via a plan-led framework guiding Ireland’s future development.

The documents set out information on the scope of the overall plan, timeframes, and the required steps in the development of the DMAP over the next two years. Public and stakeholder consultation on the proposal will take place over the course of 2026 and 2027.

The National DMAP is expected to be completed in 2027 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.

“This Proposal, along with the Public Participation Statement, sets out what we will do, and how we will ensure your voice is heard. The PPS will provide information for environmental and fisheries sectors as to how they, and indeed all stakeholders, can take part in the process,” said Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Climate, Energy, and the Environment.

The National DMAP for ORE will designate renewable energy sites around Ireland’s coast that are suitable for offshore wind development, including fixed-bottom, floating, and floating demonstration locations.

It builds on the South Coast DMAP for ORE, approved by the Oireachtas in October 2024. The first of four sites within the South Coast DMAP, Tonn Nua, is planned to be auctioned in November to procure 900 MW of capacity.

“The National Designated Maritime Area Plan for Offshore Renewable Energy supports our decarbonisation efforts and our offshore renewables ambition of 20GW by 2040. Having a single National DMAP for ORE in place to follow on from the Phase One projects and the South Coast DMAP for ORE published last year will provide greater certainty for our marine stakeholders and the renewables industry,” said O’Brien.

Challenge: Merging modern sustainability on a heritage site Castle & Key saw the bottling expansion as the perfect opportunity to operate more sustainably.
The distillery partnered with local installer Solar Energy Solutions (SES) to engineer and construct the on-site system.
This in-house approach ensured accountability and coordination across the fast-moving Castle & Key build.
This case study is a collaboration among Castle & Key, SES and Weidmuller USA.","With roots dating back to the early 1800s by one of the forefathers of the American spirits industry, Castle & Key Distillery, located in the heart of Kentucky’s bourbon country in Frankfort, is known for more than its craft spirits.

Built in the late 1800s in a style meant to align with European architectural designs, the property features a castle, springhouse and sunken garden. It has been painstakingly restored to honor that heritage, and, since its reopening in 2018, distillery leaders have earned a reputation for forward-looking, innovative and modern sustainability practices.

As it was planning to construct a new bottling operation adjacent to its warehouse in nearby Versailles, the distillery decided to invest strategically in a large-scale solar PV project. In addition to reducing Castle & Key’s carbon footprint and lower long-term energy costs, solar power would set a precedent for renewable energy adoption in Kentucky’s spirits industry. But integrating PV services into a historic property presented unique hurdles, from aesthetic considerations and preservation requirements to the practical realities of power generation for a production facility.

The journey from concept to completion required strategic planning, close collaboration with partners and creative problem-solving. Timing was critical, as a $2 million grant from the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) would expire at year-end.

Challenge: Merging modern sustainability on a heritage site

Castle & Key saw the bottling expansion as the perfect opportunity to operate more sustainably. Currently served by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, two utilities that rely heavily on coal and natural gas, the distillery recognized that producing its own electricity could deliver both cost stability and meaningful environmental impact.

The distillery partnered with local installer Solar Energy Solutions (SES) to engineer and construct the on-site system.

From the outset, the project faced challenges due to aggressive deadlines. The first half of the solar array needed to be installed, energized and inspected by Dec. 31, 2024, to qualify for tax credits and maximize REAP grant funding. The timeline pressure meant that delays at any stage — whether in design, component availability or utility approval — could jeopardize millions in financial incentives.

Technical hurdles also needed to be addressed. The PV system had to be carefully engineered to integrate with the distillery’s operations, then connected to the utility grid under strict safety standards — particularly given the flammable spirits stored at the site. Permission to operate could only be granted once inspectors confirmed the system met all codes. In addition, Castle & Key wanted the system to be robust enough to perform reliably for decades, which required careful attention to component durability, maintenance needs and scalability for a second construction phase.

Solution: Leveraging proven expertise and suppliers

With 20 years in the business, SES leveraged its strengths as a vertically integrated engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm to deliver a turnkey solution. This in-house approach ensured accountability and coordination across the fast-moving Castle & Key build. Rather than a closed system, the distillery opted to remain connected to utility lines, allowing it to sell excess power generated and ensure it still had power to operate during adverse weather, such as cloudy skies or snow.

A key part of the SES solution was a partnership with Weidmuller, which has supplied PV components to the international market for 15 years. The U.S. arm, Weidmuller USA located in Richmond, Virginia, was called on to meet the year-end deadline and provide the required PV DC combiner boxes that could be delivered quickly and installed without delay. Weidmuller USA ensured SES had the necessary enclosures on-site to complete wiring, connection and testing before the critical year-end energization.

These combiner boxes bundled multiple DC strings from the solar panels, protected them with integrated fuses and surge protection, and provided a single aggregated feed to the inverters. By streamlining the system design, the Weidmuller equipment not only saved time but also provided a durable solution — coupled with a five-year warranty — built to last.

SES and Weidmuller’s technical teams coordinated closely on design specifications, which included adapting the number of strings and configurations. The boxes’ modular format allowed flexibility between this initial phase and the next-stage build-out, ensuring the system could be expanded smoothly. While this initial installation did not include string monitoring, used widely in Europe and Latin America, Weidmuller offers retrofit options that can be added later if Castle & Key wants more detailed performance monitoring. Given that solar panels are exposed to extreme weather conditions over their lifetime, string monitoring is advantageous in helping to pinpoint faulty panels or malfunctioning modules.

Results: Running on clean energy

Sized at 1.2 MWDC, Castle & Key’s initial solar project is designed to deliver 960 kWAC of clean power to run its spirits production. A second-phase project is in development to generate an additional 600 kW for the distillery.

By managing the timeline, providing robust equipment and ensuring seamless integration with the grid, SES delivered a system that positioned Castle & Key to achieve both sustainability goals and financial incentives.

The program's data are used to guide federal policy, and the data also help companies demonstrate they're hitting emissions-cutting benchmarks for the public, shareholders and investors.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in the release that the plan would save American businesses as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs but would still comply with the Clean Air Act. He first raised the idea of ending the reporting program in March.

""Unlike other mandatory information collections under the CAA, the GHGRP is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,"" Zeldin said in the release.

He said it would be ""a significant step toward streamlining operations, cutting unnecessary red tape, unleashing American energy, and advancing EPA's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

Certain fossil fuel facilities would be required to keep reporting emissions if the rule is ended, including some natural gas and offshore oil facilities, under the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted during the Biden administration. The EPA has proposed a delay of nearly a decade in implementing the data collection requirement, though, putting it off until 2034.

But environmental experts say ending the program would prevent the public from knowing how much major industrial polluters are emitting into the atmosphere.

""Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,"" said Joseph Goffman, who served as assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration, in a statement.

Groffman now works with the Environmental Protection Network, a volunteer organization of former EPA employees.

Health experts are also concerned that ending the program could jeopardize public health.

""Measuring and reporting climate pollution is a critical step in reducing the deadly impacts of climate-driven extremes that cause more pollution, catastrophic weather events, health emergencies, and deaths. Ignoring this reality is a deadly choice, and not one that EPA should be making for American families,"" Will Barrett of the American Lung Association said in a statement.

Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to cut support for climate research and will make it more difficult to produce studies on the economic and societal impact of greenhouse gas emissions.
