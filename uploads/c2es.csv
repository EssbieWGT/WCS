In some situations you would be mistaken, says Offshore Oil Services, Inc. v. Island Operating Company, Inc.

The facts

Fieldwood and Island Operating entered into a MSC through which Island performed production services on Fieldwood’s Gulf of Mexico platforms. Most of the categories of “Work” identified in the MSC were those traditionally associated with production activities. Fieldwood contracted with OOSI for marine transport of equipment and Island’s workers on the platforms.

In the MSC Island agreed to indemnify third-party contractors such as OOSI against claims resulting from injuries to Island employees.

Fieldwood and Island agreed to a work order in which Island would fill “A Operator” positions. These operators would conduct BESE compliance testing and a host of other activities.

Island employee Felix sustained injuries while disembarking from a vessel. OOSI filed a Complaint for Exoneration From and/or Limitation of Liability and Felix filed a personal injury claim. OOSI demanded indemnification from Island.

The question for the court

Did federal Maritime law or Louisiana law govern the dispute? The question was whether transportation vessels would play a substantial role in the performance of the MSC and whether the parties expected as much.

There was no question that the indemnity provision required Island to indemnify OOSI for Felix’s personal injury claims; however Island argued that the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act rendered the indemnity provision unenforceable. OOSI said federal maritime law controls. The trial court granted summary judgment for Island, concluding that the LOAIA governed the dispute based on a finding that the MSC did not provide that the vessels would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract and that the parties did not expect vessels to play such a role.

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the take-nothing judgment against OOSI. The court applied the choice of law analysis in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Whether federal maritime law applied of its own force to the MSC depended on the answer to two questions:

Was the contract to provide services to facilitate the drilling or production of oil and gas in navigable waters? The answer was “yes”. Then the court asked if the contract provided or did the parties expect that the vessel would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract? To this question the court said “no”. The result of that “no” was the MSC was a non-maritime contract. There was not a direct and substantial link between the contract and operation of the ship, it’s navigation or its management afloat.

The result was based on the testimony of the parties. A Fieldwood employee testified to the effect that they typically don’t use equipment associated with a vessel but it had been done. Island’s president testified that operators perform no work on vessels. The provision relating to marine transportation concerned transporting workers to the platform and was not a description of actual work the MSC contemplated.

The trial court, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, ruled that OOSI take nothing. The MSC was not maritime in nature. Thus, the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act controlled, nullifying Island’s indemnity obligations. (OOSI agreed that if the LOAIA applied, the indemnity obligation would be null, rendering discussion of that question unnecessary).

ON THE ROAD: Gov. Gavin Newsom hasn’t forgiven car companies for helping nix California’s electric vehicle sales mandate, but the state’s top transportation lawmakers aren’t spending time looking in the rearview mirror.

While Newsom and other lawmakers traveled to New York for Climate Week, Assemblymember Lori Wilson and Sen. Dave Cortese — the respective chairs of their chambers’ transportation committees — were in Detroit meeting with Ford and General Motors executives as they attempt to chart a path forward for the state’s EV market.

The trip, organized by SoCal labor leader and former Michigan state Rep. Jon Switalski, took place amid the inauspicious backdrop of Newsom bashing General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he singled out by name as aiding the Trump administration’s successful maneuver to have Congress revoke California’s authority to enforce national-leading vehicle emissions standards.

“Mary Barra sold us out,” Newsom said during a Climate Week press conference late last month. “The Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump‘s leadership, but the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen. GM led that effort.”

Wilson said the policy disagreements made the talks awkward.

“It was an elephant in the room,” she said.

But she also said she was sympathetic to automakers’ dilemma.

“They feel like they’re being beat up by China,” she said. “They would like to see a voluntary collaborative transition that’s led by the market and allows them to stay competitive.”

The episode illustrates how raw the emotions are for Newsom and clean vehicle advocates who’ve watched the Trump administration systematically dismantle EV incentives, including the $7,500 federal tax credit for car buyers and HOV lane access, both of which expired last week. GM spent the most of any automaker — $11.5 million — lobbying the federal government through June. (That’s more than double the spending from Toyota, which also vocally opposed EV rules.)

“They didn’t spend as much as the oil industry, but were clearly part of the offensive,” said Matt Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters.

Cortese and Wilson, who were joined by Assemblymembers Rhodesia Ransom, Juan Carrillo and LaShae Sharp-Collins, said they walked away optimistic that the American auto giants won’t abandon their EV ambitions.

“The theme of both Ford and GM is, ‘We’re not going backwards,” Wilson said. “‘Despite the conversation happening, despite the advocacy, we’re committed to a zero-emission future.’”

Whether that means the companies are prepared to actively work with lawmakers and state regulators to advance California’s EV agenda is an open question. Cortese said he left the meetings with a sense that neither automaker was rushing to offer policy concepts to bolster the state market after the flurry of federal action.

“It isn’t very comforting from the transportation chair standpoint,” Cortese said. “It just seems like, if anything, they’re in a wait-and-see mode.”

However, both lawmakers said the looming specter of the Chinese electric vehicle market, which has rapidly developed into the largest in the world, has Ford and GM spooked and reluctant to step away from electrification completely.

“It’s no joke that there are very competent competitors elsewhere,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, which analyzes auto markets. “We must continue developing and producing because if we don’t, someone else is going to eat our lunch.”

It will take creative lawmaking from Cortese and Wilson to take advantage of that opening without the state’s EV sales targets and with an anticipated budget deficit that has already caused Newsom to back away from his commitment to backfill federal tax incentives with a state-run program.

Their agreed-upon target for next session is one of the trickiest knots in the EV space — exponentially increasing the number of home chargers for millions of California renters, with little available funding to encourage landlords to install new infrastructure.

“That’s the missing piece,” Wilson said. “There’s still nothing like people going home, plugging in their vehicle and waking up in the morning knowing they can drive.” — AN

BOTH WAYS: While it’s been an awkward EV autumn between American carmakers and California officials, a Japanese motor company rolled out a high-tech new partnership with one of the state’s largest utilities.

Honda is partnering with Southern California Edison on an initiative to push forward the ability of electric vehicles to power homes, reports David Ferris for POLITICO’s E&E News. The idea has been around for more than a decade but has sputtered getting off the ground. As of now, some EV models are able to feed energy back to a home during a blackout, but that’s limited to when the house is disconnected from the electric grid.

Owners of the Acura RSX will be able to push the envelope further. In SCE’s territory, the grid will be able to actually turn the task of powering appliances like the dishwasher, induction stove and lighting over to the car during periods of high energy demand.

It’s a baby step toward the eventual dream of so-called bidirectional charging for EVs: Using the cars to send power directly to the grid, using them like a miniature, local version of a wind farm or natural gas plant. That is the possibility that most excites vehicle-to-grid experts. Americans drive their cars on average only an hour a day, leaving them idle 95 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“We would love to run, but we are crawling first,” said Chanel Parson, Edison’s director of clean energy and demand response. “We want to master crawling quickly so we can get up and walk quickly.” — DF, NB

NO CIGAR: Veto season is in full swing, and Newsom shot down a series of bills aimed at energy affordability Friday evening. How come? Concern that the proposals could actually cause ratepayer costs to climb.

That was the fate of SB 541, by Senate Energy Chair Sen. Josh Becker. If signed, the bill would have required the California Energy Commission and California Public Utilities Commission to evaluate the economics of “load shifting,” a practice in which utilities incentivize customers to use less energy during high-demand hours so as to reduce the strain on power plants and transmission lines.

Newsom concluded that piling more work on state agencies could backfire.

“At a time when electric bill affordability continues to be a pervasive challenge, it is important that we consider the workload and cost impacts on the CEC and CPUC, some of which are ultimately borne by electric customers, to avoid further compounding the costs embedded in customer electric bills,” Newsom wrote in his veto letter.

It was a similar story for AB 1408, by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, which aimed to expedite clean energy projects while saving ratepayers money by requiring the state to make it easier to plug new projects into the grid where spare space already exists.

“This bill risks constraining energy resource procurement and interconnection options, likely increasing electric costs and undermining electric grid reliability,” Newsom wrote.

Advocates for so-called virtual power plants also took a knock with the rejection of AB 740, which followed the veto of AB 44 earlier last week. AB 740 would have required the CEC to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan, a boon to the companies creating technology that pools energy by adjusting devices in homes, such as batteries and thermostats, to boost the grid during periods of high demand.

Supporters of the vetoed bills expressed a mix of frustration and surprise at the rejection.

“I’m disappointed in this veto of SB 541. This bill was about affordability,” Becker said in a statement, citing a study commissioned by analysis firm GridLab that found the state could avoid $13.7 billion in grid upgrades through 2030 by doubling its load-shifting target. “Next year this area will be a focus of the clean energy community — clearly we have some educating to do.” — NB

SMOLDERING: The U.S. Forest Service has paused planned prescribed burns during the government shutdown, an employee told Marc Heller at POLITICO’s E&E News after a staff meeting last week. The pause comes as the beleaguered agency is falling behind its 10-year average for number of acres on which it’s actively reduced wildfire risk through thinning, prescribed fire and related actions.

As of mid-September — about two weeks before the end of fiscal 2025 — the agency had treated about 2.2 million acres for the year, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, well behind the more than 4 million acres treated in the last year of the Biden administration. — MH, CvK

FOLLOW CALIFORNIA’S LEAD: California’s heat safety regulations are paying dividends for the state’s workers.

The five states, including California, that had heat protections in 2023 saw their odds of workplace injuries increase 8 percent during heat waves that year, while the risk in states without rules was double that, according to a study released Monday by Harvard University and the George Washington University.

The study found that almost 28,000 work injuries occur in the U.S. annually because of heat exposure, but protections like access to water, rest and cool places significantly reduce risk, Ariel Wittenberg reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

The new data comes after the Workers Compensation Research Institute released a study last week that found California’s heat standard reduced workplace injuries by more than 15 percent on hot days in “high-exposure” industries like construction, agriculture and transportation. — AW, AN

RECLAIMING THE LEAD: Scott Cameron will take over as acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, shifting titles at the Interior Department while he maintains his role as the Trump administration’s lead official in negotiations over the future of the Colorado River, as Jennifer Yachnin reports for POLITICO’s E&E News. The decision comes in the wake of Trump’s decision Sept. 30 to withdraw his nomination of Ted Cooke, a former top official at the Central Arizona Project, to be Reclamation commissioner. David Palumbo, a veteran career official at Reclamation overseeing operations in the West, had previously served as acting commissioner.

House Bill 4183 passed early Friday morning with a provision that significantly raises registration costs for EVs. As a result, annual fees for EV drivers will rise by $100, making the cost $260. That increase makes Michigan No. 1 in the nation for the highest, most punitive fees on EVs. A similar increase will be imposed on plug-in hybrids, from $60 to $110.

This outcome is deeply troubling, but it is not irreversible. It is up to the Legislature to solve the problem they created by lowering EV and plug-in hybrid fees to more closely reflect what comparable gasoline-powered vehicles pay. That approach would ensure EV drivers contribute their fair share, while protecting Michigan from being the costliest state in the country for EV ownership.

This fix is essential, because the new policy places a disproportionate burden on a small group of drivers who, according to our research, are already contributing more toward road funding compared to similar gasoline vehicles.

According to the state’s budget estimates, the newly passed measure would only generate $8.3 million in additional road revenues. That amount is negligible in the context of Michigan’s multibillion-dollar transportation budget, but it would create the nation’s highest financial barrier for families who choose to drive electric.

Michigan has built an economic strategy on becoming a hub for clean mobility and electric vehicle manufacturing. Automakers, suppliers, and communities across our state have and are investing in the transition. But the transition hasn’t been easy, and has come under strain by increased foreign competition, tariffs, and the elimination of federal tax incentives.

By increasing EV registration fees, lawmakers risk further undercutting the state’s clean mobility strategy and sending the wrong signal to businesses that are creating jobs in our state.

The costs of this decision, of course, fall on Michigan families. These high fees make it more expensive to own and operate an EV, hitting hardest the households already burdened by high transportation costs and looking to EVs as a way to save money and breathe cleaner air. Instead of supporting these benefits, the state is discouraging adoption and slowing progress toward transportation electrification.

Michigan has a proud legacy as the auto capital of the world, and our future depends on leading the shift to clean mobility. Raising EV fees to the highest in the nation takes us in the wrong direction, punishing families who are part of the solution.

It is now up to lawmakers to correct this imbalance and enact an approach that keeps Michigan competitive, supports innovation, and ensures all drivers contribute fairly to our roads.

— Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 6, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a time when it’s rare to find an issue that unites Americans, energy production, date security, information privacy and national security bring voters together. A new national survey conducted by the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy finds broad, bipartisan agreement among likely voters that America’s energy and data infrastructure must remain secure, independent, and domestically powered.

A national survey conducted on September 28, 2025, among 2,010 likely voters found that Americans across party lines view domestic energy production and data security as essential pillars of both economic strength and national security.

Key Findings:

- 96% of voters say it’s important that Americans’ personal data not be stored in Chinese data centers, with 82% calling it extremely or very important.

- 94% of voters believe it’s important that the energy powering U.S. data centers is generated exclusively from domestically produced sources.

- 70% agree that the United States is in a technological arms race with China, and 81% say energy security is a key component of national security.

- 71% support reducing regulatory burdens to make it easier to build new data centers and energy infrastructure within the United States.

- 79% of respondents would prefer the United States—not China—lead the world in installing new energy projects, even though a plurality (39%) believe China is currently moving faster on energy development.

- A majority, 83%, agree that data centers serving American consumers and companies should be based in the United States.

“These findings make clear that voters understand the connection between energy, technology, and national security,” said Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow at the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

The survey also underscores strong support for pro-growth energy and infrastructure policies, with nearly three-quarters of voters calling for the U.S. to expand its energy capacity and data infrastructure to compete against China and other foreign adversaries.

“Americans want to see more domestic production, less reliance on foreign adversaries, and smart policies that empower innovation here at home,” said Sarah Hunt, President of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy.

This week, elected officials, energy experts, technology innovators, and policy leaders from across the country will gather at the Joseph Rainey Center’s LAMP National Summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss these issues, focusing on how to strengthen America’s energy independence, secure its data infrastructure, and keep the nation competitive in the global race for innovation and security.

If this sounds familiar, that’s because it is, the government shut down for a record 35 days in 2018 under Trump’s leadership. As political blame circles in Washington D.C. and the media alike, one of our biggest concerns as a grassroots environmental nonprofit is the vulnerable position this puts our blue-green planet, and the communities who depend on it, in. We work every day to protect marine and endangered wildlife, and promote climate resilience. But we rely on strong public institutions to uphold it. When Congress fails to fund the federal government, the agencies that safeguard our oceans and coastal communities are forced to close their doors, furlough their scientists and halt critical protections. This isn’t just a political gridlock, it’s a direct threat to the ocean, fisheries and the people who depend on healthy marine ecosystems.

An Avoidable and Manufactured Crisis with Real Consequences

Instead of coming together to fund the government responsibly, extremists in Congress are pushing a Continuing Resolution that would lock in an 11% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the long-standing agency we depend on for hurricane forecasts, fisheries management and coastal restoration. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is using the shutdown as cover to accelerate mass layoffs and “Reductions in Force” (RIFs) at environmental and scientific agencies. These actions have already stripped away thousands of years of expertise and data, leaving our nation less prepared for climate disasters and more vulnerable to pollution and habitat loss.

NOAA: Our First Line of Defense Against Climate Disasters

When NOAA is shut down, we all lose and are in danger. Their mission is simple but essential — to protect lives and livelihoods through science, forecasting and stewardship. Without a skilled workforce and technologies the following is possible…

Hurricane forecasting delays: With fewer staff and reduced capacity, communities will receive slower and less accurate warnings just as we enter the height of hurricane season. Every hour counts when lives and homes are at stake.

Fisheries management on hold: A shutdown halts stock assessments and enforcement, creating uncertainty for coastal economies and jeopardizing sustainable seafood supplies.

Climate and ocean research stalled: NOAA’s research vessels will be forced back to port, and its laboratories will go dark. Critical studies on ocean warming, coral bleaching, and shifting marine ecosystems will be delayed or lost entirely.

Public resources offline: Communities rely on NOAA’s Climate Resilience Toolkit and open data platforms to plan for flooding and sea-level rise. A shutdown would cut off access when these tools are needed most.

Wildlife response curtailed: Marine mammal rescue and stranding programs will be scaled back, leaving endangered species like sea turtles and dolphins without critical emergency response support.

The Coast Guard: Working Without Pay and Burning Out

The U.S. Coast Guard, one of NOAA’s closest partners in protecting marine life and coastal safety, must continue operations during a shutdown but without pay. Tens of thousands of service members will still conduct rescues and patrol our waterways under immense strain. Training, maintenance and inspections will be suspended, reducing readiness and increasing risk. Port safety checks will be delayed and pollution monitoring will weaken, all while crews work unpaid to keep the nation’s coasts secure.

Offshore Enforcement Vanished: BOEM and BSEE

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) oversee offshore drilling operations and enforce safety standards that prevent oil spills. When these agencies are shut down, safe inspections stop, leaving oil rigs and pipelines dangerously unmonitored. Also, environmental reviews are frozen which give fossil fuel companies a free pass operate without oversight… a terrifying new reality. We’ve seen what happens when offshore drilling goes unchecked — from Deepwater Horizon to smaller spills that quietly devastate ecosystems. A shutdown puts us on that path again.

U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Paused Protections = At Risk Wildlife

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) plays a key role in protecting endangered marine species and managing coastal habitats that buffer against storms. During a federal government shutdown the following occurs:

Protections for endangered species like sea turtles, whales and sharks are delayed.

National wildlife refuges may close or operate with skeleton crews, harming local tourism and leaving habitats vulnerable.

Restoration projects are halted, weakening natural storm defenses.

Community partnerships and grants freeze, cutting off support for local conservation and coastal resilience initiatives.

Every day of inaction means more lost time for restoration, more risk for wildlife and more hardship for the people who depend on these ecosystems. Healthy oceans and strong environmental protections are not partisan luxuries, they are essential to our survival. Every delay in research, every missed inspection, every suspended rescue mission erodes our ability to adapt to the climate crisis and protect the living planet we share. We need a government that works for people and the planet, not one that shuts down when politics get tough.",https://i0.wp.com/seaturtles.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ant-rozetsky-q-DJ9XhKkhA-unsplash-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-06 22:00:51.539689
,Indiana American Energy ,2025-10-07 00:19:34+00:00,The Daily Reporter - Greenfield Indiana,"Solar and wind power has grown faster than electricity demand this year, report says",The Associated Press,,,,,https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2025/10/06/solar-and-wind-power-has-grown-faster-than-electricity-demand-this-year-report-says/,"Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.
India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand.
“This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.” But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation.
The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

INSKEEP: Robinson Meyer of Heatmap News, thanks so much.","STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

A Florida man named Al Salvi noticed something recently. The electricity bills are rising in Pembroke Pines. And he told our colleague, Scott Horsley, that he pays up to $500 per month.

AL SALVI: Seniors down here that are living check to check, now we've got to decide whether we're going to pay electric bill or we're going to buy medication.

INSKEEP: Why is this happening? We called Robinson Meyer, who is executive editor of the climate and energy site Heatmap News. Welcome to the program.

ROBINSON MEYER: Thank you for having me.

INSKEEP: OK, so we hear politicians say that higher electricity prices are about the kind of energy we use, fossil fuels versus renewables, whatever fits their agenda. But it seems you've been focusing on some other factor in electricity prices. What is it?

MEYER: That's right. So I think the biggest driver of the run-up in electricity prices we've seen over the past four or five years, because electricity prices really shot up since the pandemic - they've been rising twice as fast as overall inflation - is the grid itself. And not only the grid itself, it's actually the most local part of the power grid, like that last mile from substations to your house or business.

INSKEEP: I don't automatically get that because the wires are already there and have been there for generations. Why would that get more expensive?

MEYER: In some cases, it's because they've had to be rebuilt because of a natural disaster. And in some cases, they are just getting old. It's actually exactly the fact that they've been there for generations. They're getting old and they need to be replaced. And in some cases, it's because maybe a wildfire burned through an entire area, especially out west. And now the utility has to go in, and not only does it have to rebuild that grid in the local area, it also has to rebuild it in a way that's not as likely to cause a wildfire in the future.

INSKEEP: This is sounding like an unseen cost of climate change.

MEYER: It is, I think, a cost of climate change. I mean, I think it's just that we've had the grid for a long time. I mean, in many places, it's 90 or 100 years old. And it's time for those systems to be replaced. And unfortunately, they're beginning to be replaced at the same time as we're seeing rising electricity demand for the first time in the U.S. in basically a generation.

INSKEEP: What is increasing the demand for electricity?

MEYER: So it's a few things. I think the headline driver is this boom in data center construction and AI, of course. And that is having big effects in certain parts of the country. The other things driving electricity demand are population growth and economic growth. You know, people are getting richer and they're using more electricity. There are people switching to EVs. You know, if you think about going from gasoline to EVs, you got to plug in your car. And then the last thing is something that I think everyone across the political spectrum wants to see, which is more U.S. manufacturing. As factories have gotten built here, that drives higher power demand, too.

INSKEEP: Is it inevitable then that as AI expands, and if the U.S. succeeds in reshoring some manufacturing that I'm just going to pay more and more for electricity?

MEYER: Well, it shouldn't be. And this is one dynamic that I think regulators and state leaders are grappling with right now. In the New Jersey governor's race, electricity prices have become a huge deal. And while I don't think electricity prices are increasing in most areas right now because of AI, I do think there is a good case that AI is driving some of the electricity prices in New Jersey specifically, and data centers specifically. Historically, kind of the way it's worked is that the utility builds out the grid to meet demand from everyone. And then everyone kind of foots the bill for that expansion. I think right now, given that just a few customers are driving so much more electricity demand, utilities and states are trying to figure out how we can, you know, meet that demand while not having absolutely everyone else pay much higher cost to build the infrastructure needed to service those facilities.

INSKEEP: Robinson Meyer of Heatmap News, thanks so much.

MEYER: Thank you for having me.

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

Those discussions, extended through mid-year, ultimately concluded without resolution, returning the case to court and leading Northern Dynasty to request a summary judgment schedule.
""We are pleased to have filed the Summary Judgement Brief and to simultaneously be continuing our settlement discussions with the government to remove this illegal veto,"" said Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen.
The summary judgment briefs submitted by the plaintiffs argue that the EPA exceeded its legal authority when it vetoed the Pebble project.
""The facts cited by EPA in its veto decision are directly contradicted by the Final Environmental Impact Statement, the official factual record in this proceeding.""","Northern Dynasty, Alaska, Native corps seek ruling to overturn EPA block.

Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. Oct. 6 announced that it, along with the state and two Alaska Native village corporations, has filed summary judgment briefs in Alaska Federal Court challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's veto of the Pebble project, asserting that the action was unlawful and should be withdrawn immediately.

After more than a decade of federal review, regulatory reversals, and court challenges, Northern Dynasty's Pebble project culminated in a 2023 Clean Water Act veto issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which effectively nullified years of permitting work and barred development across 309 square miles of Alaska state land in the Bristol Bay region.

The decision, taken despite completion of a multi-year Environmental Impact Statement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that found the project could be developed without measurable harm to downstream fisheries or water quality, marked the first time the agency had used its Section 404(c) authority to preemptively block a mine on state land designated for resource development.

Following that decision, Northern Dynasty and its Alaska-based subsidiary, Pebble Limited Partnership, filed suit alongside the state of Alaska, arguing that EPA's action unlawfully exceeded its statutory authority, conflicted with federal findings, and undermined the Alaska Statehood Act's guarantee of resource management rights over state lands.

Over the next two years, the case moved through a series of pauses and procedural shifts as successive administrations reviewed the matter and federal agencies sought additional time to fill key positions and reassess their litigation strategy.

By February of this year, Northern Dynasty agreed to a 90-day pause requested by EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, granting new leadership an opportunity to review the record and evaluate a potential settlement to withdraw the veto.

Those discussions, extended through mid-year, ultimately concluded without resolution, returning the case to court and leading Northern Dynasty to request a summary judgment schedule.

With settlement efforts at a stalemate, the company now seeks a ruling on what it argues are fundamental issues of law, maintaining that the veto imposes significant economic and legal consequences for Alaska and the United States and contradicts both the conclusions of the project's Environmental Impact Statement and the state's constitutional authority to develop its own resources.

Positioned once again before the court, the case has entered a decisive stage as Northern Dynasty, the state, and two Alaska Native corporations – Iliamna Natives Ltd. and Alaska Peninsula Corp. – seek judicial resolution rather than administrative reconsideration.

""We are pleased to have filed the Summary Judgement Brief and to simultaneously be continuing our settlement discussions with the government to remove this illegal veto,"" said Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen. ""We believe we have a strong case and, along with our fellow plaintiffs, are confident that we will win.""

The latest filings lay out a comprehensive challenge to EPA's authority and interpretation of the Clean Water Act, framing the dispute not only as a matter of permitting but as a test of how far federal agencies may reach in restricting development on state-designated mineral lands.

The summary judgment briefs submitted by the plaintiffs argue that the EPA exceeded its legal authority when it vetoed the Pebble project.

Among the central claims is that the agency's 2023 determination disregarded the official record and the findings of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Final Environmental Impact Statement, which concluded the project could be developed without measurable harm to downstream water or fisheries.

The plaintiffs also argue that the veto imposed substantial economic costs on Alaska and the United States, conflicting with lands specifically designated for mineral development under the Alaska Statehood Act and Cook Inlet Land Exchange.

In addition, they assert that the EPA's conclusions relied on speculative rather than substantiated findings of environmental harm, and that recent U.S. Supreme Court clarification of Clean Water Act jurisdiction shows much of the Pebble deposit area no longer qualifies as federally regulated wetlands.

""And, frankly, we think the filing of this brief will help in our discussions with the government because it clearly highlights agency overreach of its mandate and interference in a project that is on state land which was designated, by statute, for mineral exploration and development,"" said Thiessen. ""The facts cited by EPA in its veto decision are directly contradicted by the Final Environmental Impact Statement, the official factual record in this proceeding.""

As court proceedings advance, the federal government has moved to temporarily halt the case, submitting a motion to stay all deadlines considering the partial shutdown of federal operations that began Oct. 1.

The request, filed after the plaintiffs' summary judgment submission, seeks to pause the court's briefing schedule until the government reopens and its legal teams can resume full activity.

""We object to this request because it is our strong preference to keep to the court ordered briefing schedule, which would require the government to respond by January 2, 2026. We have waited a long time for our day in court in this case, and we should not have to wait any longer to vindicate our rights,"" said Thiessen.",https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/0/0/9300/s_top,N,,2025-10-06 20:02:30.726842

That transaction, which occurred during the Serzh Sarkissian administration, was seen as dubious, since the sale of that particular power plant—bordering Azerbaijan—required parliament approval, but was completed in 2015.

Welcoming this initiative, Papoyan said that the deal demonstrates the long-term and stable presence of American investments in Armenia and proves that the Vorotan HPP Cascade serves as a guarantor of the country’s energy security.

“The fact that Armenia’s largest bank, Ardshinbank, is able to provide $135 million in funding for such a strategic project speaks to its ability to strengthen the banking sector, comply with international standards, and serve large investors,” Papoyan said in praise of the deal.

“This is a message that Armenia is not only open to investments, but also has strong local partners who can support their implementation,” he added.

According to the report, the new policies could eliminate 130,000 potential jobs in the EV sector by 2030, with the majority in battery manufacturing.","Back in January, a massive fire ripped through Vistra Corp’s (NYSE:VST) giant battery storage facility in Moss Landing in Northern California, leading to the evacuation of hundreds of people after toxic fumes polluted the air. While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, a key factor that has so far been identified is the failure of the fire suppression system, which allowed the fire to spread rapidly. The building that housed 300 megawatts of battery capacity was completed five years ago, around the time the U.S. utility scale lithium-ion battery storage sector was taking off, with battery safety standards having been updated multiple times since. And now the sector is having to deal with the fallout of the accident, with a growing number of leaders now strongly opposed to the construction of battery storage facilities in their localities.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, after passing a moratorium in July for a battery storage system proposed near the village line. In August, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York and complained that the state was rushing approvals to meet “delusional” clean energy goals. New York has set an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage over the next five years, equivalent to half of its large-scale systems.

“This is more than a fire, this a wake-up call for the industry. If we’re going to be moving ahead with sustainable energy, we need to have a safe battery system in place,” said Glenn Church, Monterey County Supervisor.

Battery moratoriums refer to a temporary halt on the approval and construction of new Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), often a local or state measure enacted to address public safety concerns related to fires and other hazards associated with lithium-ion batteries. These moratoriums gained traction starting in 2023 and 2024, driven by community opposition to proposed BESS projects near homes and schools, high-profile fires, and a perceived lack of comprehensive safety standards for the technology.

However, the experts have pointed out that BESS detractors could be overreacting, and the nascent industry is merely going through teething problems. “This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ofodike Ezekoye, a mechanical engineering professor and combustion expert at the University of Texas at Austin, said.

Fire risks and growing opposition are just some of the headwinds facing the U..S. battery storage sector. A recent analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), coupled with cuts to other climate policies, could slash U.S. battery production by ~75% by 2030 to 250 GWh from the previously projected 1,050 gigawatt-hours, and EV sales by 40%. According to the report, the new policies could eliminate 130,000 potential jobs in the EV sector by 2030, with the majority in battery manufacturing. Following the passing of the IRA in 2022, companies have announced a total of 128 U.S. facilities for battery manufacturing, with more than half yet to begin construction. Red and purple states including Texas, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia, would be the most adversely impacted.

Interestingly, even Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, home to Hyundai’s new $5.5B EV and battery manufacturing plant, threw his weight behind the bill, calling it “fantastic.” According to estimates by the experts, the project will create $4-5 billion in fresh investments in Bartow County as well as 3,500 new jobs. Over the past five years, EV-related projects in Georgia have created ~$17 billion in investments and more than 22,800 new jobs.

Meanwhile, the pivotal solar sector would face setbacks under OBBBA. According to a study by the Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the solar sector has recorded more than $160B in large solar and battery storage projects since the IRA was passed three years ago, marking one of the sector’s most productive periods in recent times. Solar and battery storage have been the fastest growing energy source in the U.S., with the pair expected to account for 81% of new power additions to the grid in the current year.

OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

Losing streak ends Stellantis' 6% gain in the third quarter marks the company's first positive sales quarter in nearly two years.","Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat, posted its first sales gain since the second quarter of 2023.

Chrysler and Jeep brands posted double-digit gains.

Dodge, Ram, Fiat and Alfa Romeo posted decreases, though the company noted positive trends taking place in the Dodge and Ram lineup.

Stellantis' U.S. sales rose 6% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, as the brand sold 324,825 vehicles. To keep momentum, the company announced it would take on the cost of the now-expired electric vehicle tax credit through the end of the year while supplies last.

The upswing in Stellantis' sales stands in contrast to the company's performance in recent memory. In the previous quarter, sales fell 10% compared with the same time period in 2024. First-quarter sales this year dropped 12% from the same quarter last year. That followed a 2024 overall decline of 15% year over year.

Despite a tumultuous 12 months — marked by tariff anxiety and an expiring electric vehicle tax credit that led to a massive rush for buyers to cash in on EVs — Stellantis' sales report is good news for the international automaker.

Company officials told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, the offer will continue on the now-expired IRS tax refund on EV sales, following a similar move from competitors Ford Motor Co. and General Motors. Unlike Ford and GM, which are offering credit by preemptively making down payments on vehicles, Stellantis is offering a $7,500 credit through a bonus cash incentive on existing dealer inventory.

According to the numbers, Jeep and Chrysler posted double-digit gains in sales compared with the third quarter of 2025, while Ram posted a slight loss overall, with strong retail sales nonetheless, as the newly retooled HEMI pickups hit the shop floor with orders exceeding production. Dodge, too, underwent a decrease, though the popular Durango — which comes standard with a HEMI — soared to a 44% increase over the model's performance in 2024's third quarter.

Here's how the brands performed in sales compared with 2024's third quarter, according to company data:

Jeep increased by 11%.

Ram decreased by 5%.

Chrysler increased by 45%.

Dodge decreased by 2%.

Fiat increased by 2% (which represents a difference from 316 vehicles in 2024's third quarter, compared with 321 in 2025's second quarter).

Alfa Romeo decreased by 21%.

Stellantis did not report data on its luxury offering, Maserati.

Losing streak ends

Stellantis' 6% gain in the third quarter marks the company's first positive sales quarter in nearly two years. Since May, when Stellantis hired its new CEO, Antonio Filosa, the brand has been on a campaign to revitalize its reputation and status in the American market.

Filosa, a native Italian with more than two decades of experience in the Stellantis family of automakers, replaced former Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares, whose rocky tenure fractured relationships with the UAW and dealers alike.

Under new leadership, Filosa has frequently indicated an intent to revitalize the U.S. sector of the company.

Though Stellantis ended its losing skid, the company turned in poorer sales numbers than its Detroit Three competitors, GM and Ford, which both reported gains.

GM and Ford reported sales on Wednesday, Oct. 1, with GM boasting an 8% increase compared with 2024's third quarter, and Ford's sales also rising about 8% over the same period a year earlier.

The biorefinery is expected to be operational in 2028.

Eni on Sept. 23 announced has received approval from the Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security to convert selected units at the Sannazzaro refinery into a biorefinery. The company said it has now started the authorization process and has filed an application for the environmental impact assessment (VIA).

As part of the planned biorefinery project, Eni will convert the existing hydrocracker unit using Ecofining technology and construct a pre-treatment unit for waste and residue feedstocks. Hydrogen will be sourced from existing plants.

Once fully operational, the biorefinery is expected to have the capacity to process 550,000 metric tons of feedstock annually.

According to Eni, the planned conversion project supports the company’s commitment, through Enilive, to increase biorefinery capacity from the current 1.65 million metric tons per year to more than 3 million metric tons in 2028 and over 5 million metric tons in 2030, with the potential to produce up to 2 million metric tons of SAF annually by 2030.

Enilive already produces biofuels at its facilities in Venice, Italy; Gela, Italy; and Chalmette, Louisiana. The company is expected to begin operations at a biorefinery in Livorno, Italy, in 2026. Enilive is also developing biorefinery projects Priolo, Italy, as well as Malaysia and South Korea.

The program was ""expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs,"" according to the complaint.

The group of plaintiffs -- made up of solar energy companies, labor unions and homeowners -- filed the lawsuit in federal court in Rhode Island. They accused the EPA of ending the program, in violation of federal law, that would have helped them save on energy costs.

Solar for All was ""expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills during and after the five-year program, providing energy bill relief for more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote.

The program was ""expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs,"" according to the complaint.

Solar for All was established with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $27 billion to make buildings more energy efficient and to install electric vehicle charging stations.

In Monday's complaint, the plaintiffs accused the Trump administration of trying to recapture the billions of congressionally approved dollars in climate funding that was approved during the Biden administration. They are asking a jury to issue an injunction and force the EPA to reinstate the Solar for All program.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said Trump's domestic policy bill, passed in July, canceled ""billions of green slush fund dollars"" for Solar for All.

""The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" Zeldin added.

The plaintiffs also claim Trump's EPA has violated the separation of powers by blocking congressionally approved funding.

""EPA has taken steps to close out grants and claw back obligated funds,"" forcing layoffs, the complaint states.

""It's not just a one-two punch to the workforce that I represent,"" said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.

(Snark aside: If Big Tech can afford to blow $350 billion on AI capex this year, it can spare some for not frying the grid.)","OPINION:

Oh, the irony of our artificial intelligence overlords: Silicon Valley’s geniuses, busy conjuring chatbots that can write your grocery list or compose bad poetry, are quietly sucking the life out of our electric grids. While Big Tech rakes in trillions of dollars, everyday Americans are left holding the bag — literally, in the form of skyrocketing utility bills.

The data centers powering AI are devouring electricity like a kid with an unlimited candy stash, and it’s high time we force these cash-hoarding behemoths to build their own power plants or buy directly from generators. With more than $368 billion in collective cash reserves — yes, that’s Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia lounging on mountains of money — they can certainly afford it.

Instead of leeching off the public grid and driving up costs for the rest of us, let them generate their own juice and sell back the excess, easing the strain on consumers. It’s not rocket science; it’s basic fairness.

Let’s crunch the numbers, shall we? AI data centers are energy vampires on steroids. In 2023, they guzzled about 4.4% of U.S. electricity, a figure the Department of Energy projects could triple to 12% by 2030.

Globally, the International Energy Agency warns that demand from these facilities could more than double by 2030, hitting 945 terawatt-hours, enough to power entire countries.

In the U.S., electricity consumption from data centers is slated to surge 130% by 2030, accounting for up to 44% of new demand and necessitating costly grid upgrades.

Who’s paying? You and me. Utility bills are already climbing, thanks to the Biden-era shuttering of reliable coal plants and the addition of huge amounts of part-time wind and solar. AI data demand is growing steeper as AI’s thirst grows.

One report calls it a “sharp rise” in bills, courtesy of infrastructure strains that hit households hardest.

This isn’t just about affordability; it’s about reliability too. AI demands 100% uptime. Those servers can’t afford a hiccup, lest your virtual assistant forget how to boil water. Grids are buckling under the load, risking blackouts and shortages. Deloitte estimates that U.S. AI data center power needs could hit 123 gigawatts by 2035, a thirtyfold jump, compromising grid stability.

Recent analyses show that data centers are doubling their consumption, forcing utilities to scramble and pass costs to consumers via rate hikes.

In states such as Virginia and Georgia, where data centers cluster, residents are already grumbling about inflated bills subsidizing tech giants.

Here’s the fix: Mandate that Big Tech build or buy its own electricity “before the meter.” Be their own generators, strike deals with producers, whatever; just don’t dump demand on the public pool or take away our needed supply. With Big Tech’s $368 billion war chest (and that’s conservative; quarterly revenue alone tops $100 billion for some), they could fund solar farms, wind arrays, natural gas and even nuclear reactors faster than you can say “ChatGPT.”

Then, let them sell excess power back to the grid, relieving pressure and potentially lowering rates for us plebs. In exchange, they get backup during maintenance shutdowns because even their shiny plants need tuneups.

Oh, and make them pay for grid interconnections. Why should ratepayers foot the bill for Big Tech’s reliability crutches?

This calls for legislative muscle. States such as Texas and California, already feeling the pinch, should lead with laws requiring data centers over a certain size to self-generate at least 80% of their power.

Congress could tie federal tax incentives for AI to energy independence mandates, or the Department of Energy could enforce grid-impact fees. A push for an Energy Department study on AI’s toll is a start, but we need action: bills that prioritize consumer wallets over corporate profits. (Snark aside: If Big Tech can afford to blow $350 billion on AI capex this year, it can spare some for not frying the grid.)

Enough with the free ride. Lawmakers, wake up. Enact these changes now, or we’ll all be paying premium for AI’s endless appetite.

“Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development for the Coastal Plain Venture,” Exxon said in an emailed statement.
John Titas, president of the Victoria Economic Development Corporation in nearby Victoria, said he didn’t think Exxon’s decision was related to the tax break fight.
Another firm, Expert Market Research, expects overall plastics markets to grow 51 percent in that time.
As soon as she heard about the new Exxon project, in December 2024, she said she leapt into action, involving herself in the various public processes she’s come to know about, including the school district tax break agreements.","Exxon Mobil will postpone its plans for a large new plastics production plant on the Gulf Coast of Texas, according to the company. Construction was initially planned to begin next year on the $10 billion facility in rural Calhoun County.

“Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development for the Coastal Plain Venture,” Exxon said in an emailed statement. “We’re confident in our growth strategy, and we remain interested in a potential project along the US Gulf Coast and in other regions around the world.”

Six weeks prior, a county district court judge invalidated the local school board’s decision to negotiate a tax break agreement with Exxon, following a lawsuit from Diane Wilson, 77, and her group, San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper.

On Aug. 19 the judge ordered the school board to redo its public hearing on Exxon’s tax break after Wilson alleged the district provided inadequate notice of the meeting in “a deliberate attempt to avoid public opposition.” Wilson, an internationally known environmental advocate, promised to bring a large audience for the repeat hearing.

“I think it definitely played into it,” Wilson said of Exxon’s pause. “I think if everybody had just rolled over for them, if they got exactly what they wanted and there wasn’t a big fight, there would be no delay.”

Exxon, which reported nearly $34 billion in profits in 2024, was seeking a 50 percent reduction in its property taxes to the rural Calhoun County Independent School District for 10 years, beginning in 2031, when the project would come online.

The world-scale plastics plant was planned to produce up to 3 million tons per year of polyethylene pellets for export, primarily to Asia, according to Exxon’s December 2024 tax abatement application.

John Titas, president of the Victoria Economic Development Corporation in nearby Victoria, said he didn’t think Exxon’s decision was related to the tax break fight.

“I think they’ve been very thankful for the support they received in the community,” he said. “It’s economics. To justify an investment of that magnitude, you’ve got to make sure the market will provide a return.”

In Exxon’s latest statement, first reported last week by Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, an industry news service, the company maintained the possibility of resuming the project in the future. “We’re maintaining good relationships with community leaders and contractors, so we are ready to reevaluate the project’s status when market conditions improve,” it said.

Exxon didn’t specify which market conditions would need to change. Most projections forecast strong growth in plastics demand over coming years.

The economic intelligence firm Precedence Research expects markets for polyethylene, which the Exxon plant would produce, to grow 64 percent between 2024 and 2034, according to a June 2025 assessment. Another firm, Expert Market Research, expects overall plastics markets to grow 51 percent in that time. According to the Plastics Industry Association, “The global plastics industry continues to accelerate, backed by strong demand.”

Wilson said the project’s delay marked the best news she’d heard since 2019, when she found out that her lawsuit against another nearby petrochemical giant, Formosa Plastics, would end with a settlement worth more than $100 million in penalty payouts, facility upgrades and cleanup projects.

A retired shrimper and mother of five, Wilson learned her tactics of resistance over decades of radical activism in defense of Texas’ coastal bays, where four generations of her family have fished for a living. In 2023 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize, the leading global award for environmental activism.

As soon as she heard about the new Exxon project, in December 2024, she said she leapt into action, involving herself in the various public processes she’s come to know about, including the school district tax break agreements.

“How a community reacts is extremely important and it’s extremely important that you do it in the beginning,” she said. “Move fast and don’t let up.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0482-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 19:01:52.801588

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials said they would go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/10/Coal.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 19:01:30.822585

KEARNEY INTRODUCES ABBY'S LAW State Sen. Tim Kearney, D-Delaware County, has officially introduced Abby's Law in the Pennsylvania Senate as Senate Bill 1008.","(TNS) — The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) this week announced the opening of the state's 20th federally-funded Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station — putting Pennsylvania in the lead nationally for the number of stations built using funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and representing a total federal investment of approximately $11.5 million.

The new station is located at Sheetz in Pittsburgh on Freeport Road along Interstate 76 (Exit 48).

Since the first NEVI-funded station opened in PA, the charging stations have delivered more than 30,000 charging sessions, powering over 3.5 million estimated miles driven and reducing CO2 emissions by more than 1.7 million pounds.

Additionally, PennDOT announced that it is the first state to receive a Full Build-Out Certification under the new federal NEVI guidance issued in August. The build-out certification allows a state to move beyond the initial phase of the NEVI program, which focused on building charging stations on the core network of interstate highways. This enables PennDOT to begin the next stage of the NEVI program — Corridor Connections — which will be released on or before Oct. 7.

""Thanks to our team's diligent work in 2023 and 2024, and Gov. Josh Shapiro's persistent efforts to secure Congressionally appropriated funding, we're in a position to continue making EVs more accessible for PA travelers,"" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. ""That quick action ensured Pennsylvania could adapt to national program changes while locking in investments for Pennsylvania.""

Per NEVI guidance issued Aug. 11, PennDOT submitted an updated Pennsylvania NEVI State Plan and a second request for Full Build-Out Certification to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on Aug. 27. The next phase will begin projects that connect communities.

The NEVI State Plan was approved on Sept. 5, and PennDOT received Full Build-Out Certification on Sept. 22, 2025. Having received approval, the Shapiro Administration is moving forward with the community phase of the NEVI program, beginning with the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity.

The Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity focuses on implementing EV charging stations along major roadways to strengthen long-distance travel outside of previously designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.

PennDOT anticipates soliciting about 24 projects through the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity, with up to $20 million in available funding.

The submission period will close at 5 p.m. on Jan. 30, 2026.

PENNDOT WELCOMES PROPOSALS

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Office of Public-Private Partnerships (P3) announced this week that it is accepting unsolicited proposals for transportation projects from the private sector through Oct. 31.

Instructions on how to submit a project and information on the unsolicited proposal review process can be found on the state's P3 website. PennDOT holds an unsolicited proposal period in April and October each year.

The submission period applies to PennDOT-owned projects, infrastructure, and services. During this period, the private sector can submit proposals offering innovative ways to deliver transportation projects across all modes, including roads, bridges, rail, aviation, and ports. Proposals can also include more efficient models to manage existing transportation-related services and programs.

The private sector may also submit applications for non-PennDOT-owned assets directly to the P3 board during this time. Transportation entities outside of the governor's jurisdiction, such as transit authorities and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, may establish their own timelines or accept proposals year-round.

The state's P3 law allows PennDOT and other transportation authorities and commissions to partner with private companies to participate in delivering, maintaining, and financing transportation-related projects.

As part of the P3 law, the seven-member Public Private Transportation Partnership Board was appointed to examine and approve potential public-private transportation projects. If the board determines a state operation would be more cost-effectively administered by a private company, PennDOT would issue a Request for Proposals and start a competitive procurement as defined by the P3 law.

The next unsolicited proposal acceptance period will occur in April 2026.

PENNDOT INVITES YOU TO SHARE FEEDBACK

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) is accepting feedback on construction and maintenance services through an online survey.

The public can take the survey through October 21 by visiting — 2025 PennDOT Construction/Maintenance Customer Satisfaction Survey.

PennDOT has been hard at work improving Pennsylvania's roads and bridges throughout the year, improving more than 2,600 miles of road, including over 900 miles of paving, and beginning work to repair, replace, or preserve more than 230 bridges from January through August of this year, officials said.

""The PennDOT team is serving Pennsylvanians every day, and each year we look for feedback on what we're doing well and could improve,"" Carroll said. ""The survey also lets the public tell us how they receive roadway information and helps us find potential educational opportunities.""

The 22-question survey asks participants how they receive PennDOT roadway information and how often PennDOT meets or exceeds expectations in construction and maintenance activities. Respondents are also asked about experiences with reporting concerns to the department, and whether or how they use the state's 511PA traveler information services.

KEARNEY INTRODUCES ABBY'S LAW

State Sen. Tim Kearney, D-Delaware County, has officially introduced Abby's Law in the Pennsylvania Senate as Senate Bill 1008.

The legislation is named in memory of 12-year-old Abigail Gillon, who tragically passed after an e-scooter crash in June 2025 in Aston.

Since announcing his intention in July to introduce the legislation, several serious e-scooter crashes have occurred in the region, underscoring the urgent need for safeguards.

Municipalities have also taken action to underscore Pennsylvania's current laws — Marple Township voted to ban e-scooters outright, while Haverford Township recently passed an ordinance requiring children under 16 to wear helmets when riding e-bikes.

Kearney's proposal has drawn national attention, with safety groups and media outlets across the country highlighting the legislation and its intention.

Kearney's office has been working closely with Abby's family and a wide range of stakeholders to shape the bill so it can move quickly through the legislative process.

""Abby's loved ones have experienced an unimaginable loss,"" Kearney said. ""This is not just about policy. It is about protecting our children and creating commonsense measures that keep pace with changing technology.""

While most other states have legalized e-scooters and set rules for their operations, e-scooters are not recognized under Pennsylvania's Vehicle Code, leaving riders without any clear rules or standards.

To address this gap in regulation and prevent further tragedies, Kearney introduced Abby's Law as a step forward to improve safety on public streets.

This legislation would:

Set an age minimum of 16 for e-scooter riders, and require helmets for 16- and 17-year-old riders

Set a statewide speed limit of 20mph for e-scooters

Prohibit more than one rider on an e-scooter

Require e-scooters to follow bicycle traffic rules

Provide for rider and driver education and awareness

Governor Shapiro’s Administration is setting records, creating more opportunity for Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth.

Harrisburg, PA – Under Governor Josh Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is emerging as a national model for economic development — delivering real results that position the Commonwealth to compete and win, attract investment, and create opportunity in communities across the state. As the Governor speaks to the PA Chamber of Commerce & Industry’s Annual Dinner this evening, Pennsylvania is winning major economic deals.

From day one, Governor Shapiro has prioritized making Pennsylvania more competitive — launching the Commonwealth’s first economic development strategy in nearly two decades, securing $550 million for site development, Main Streets, workforce training, innovation and small businesses, and streamlining permitting, licensing, and certification processes to help projects get built faster.

“Pennsylvania is competing again — and we’re winning,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re building new industrial sites, revitalizing our Main Streets, and supporting small businesses across the Commonwealth. We’ve cut permitting times and taxes, reduced backlogs and waitlists, and made government move at the speed of business. As a result, we’re winning historic deals including the largest private sector investment in our history and we’re attracting more companies to grow here and create good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians. The Commonwealth is open for business — and we’re just getting started.”

The Shapiro Administration has secured a record $25.6 billion in private-sector investment and created nearly 12,400 new jobs since taking office — transforming communities and positioning Pennsylvania for sustained, long-term growth.

Governor Shapiro has also cut taxes, modernized government, and expanded funding to prepare more sites for business expansion — helping Pennsylvania earn the title of #1 State in the Northeast for Regional Economic Competitiveness from Site Selection Magazine. These reforms have also helped attract the largest private-sector investment in Pennsylvania’s history: a $20 billion initial investment from Amazon to build new AI and cloud computing campuses across the Commonwealth, creating thousands of high-tech and construction jobs.

Cutting Red Tape and Moving at the Speed of Business

Under Governor Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is reforming government and delivering faster, more predictable permitting and licensing processes that give businesses the certainty they need to invest and grow.

When the Governor took office, business filings could take up to eight weeks to process. Now, entrepreneurs can receive approvals in as little as one day. The Department of Environmental Protection has eliminated 98 percent of its permit backlog and processed over 20,000 labor-intensive permits this year.

Governor Shapiro has transformed how Pennsylvania does business by making government more efficient and responsive:

Launched the Office of Transformation and Opportunity (OTO) to coordinate permitting and business support, assisting over 200 companies in 2024.

Created the PA Permit Fast Track Program, the first in the nation for multi-agency coordination to expedite major projects — now supporting 7 public-facing projects.

Introduced PAyback, a money-back guarantee for timely permit and license processing — with over 40 million applications processed and only five refunds issued to date.

Securing Historic Investment and Growing Pennsylvania’s Economy

Governor Shapiro’s focus on competitiveness and reform has led to record-breaking private investment across Pennsylvania.

In June, the Governor announced Amazon’s $20 billion investment to establish high-tech cloud computing and AI innovation campuses – the largest private sector investment in Pennsylvania history – creating at least 1,250 high-paying, high-tech jobs in Westmoreland and Bucks Counties. The Shapiro Administration also committed $10 million for workforce development to expand vo-tech programs, add new CTE classes, and build training centers that prepare Pennsylvanians for these jobs of the future.

Companies like Excelitas Technologies, which moved its headquarters from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh, and Adare Pharma, which relocated its headquarters to Northeast Philadelphia, are choosing Pennsylvania as their home for growth.

Across the Commonwealth, manufacturers like B. Braun in the Lehigh Valley and Joseph Machine Company in York County are expanding their facilities, creating hundreds of new jobs, and strengthening Pennsylvania’s industrial backbone.

These efforts are driving new investments across the Commonwealth — from revitalizing Downtown Pittsburgh with $60 million in state capital that’s leveraging $600 million in private investment, to strengthening the Commonwealth’s main streets and small businesses that anchor local economies through the Main Streets Matters program.

Building the Energy Economy of the Future

Governor Shapiro reaffirmed his commitment to an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that keeps costs low, supports Pennsylvania jobs, and ensures reliable power for businesses and families.

Under his leadership, Pennsylvania is producing more energy than ever before – including restarting operations at Three Mile Island and converting former coal-fired power plants into natural gas facilities that will generate an additional 5 gigawatts of power for the regional grid.

Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan — supported by a bipartisan coalition of industry and environmental leaders — will create jobs, lower energy costs, speed up permitting, and expand energy generation right here in Pennsylvania.

Last month, the Governor convened the first-ever state-led PJM Governors Collaborative, bringing together representatives from 13 states to push for regional action to improve grid reliability, reduce costs, and accelerate clean energy deployment for 67 million customers.

Investing in Infrastructure, Innovation, and the Workforce

Through Governor Shapiro’s 2024–25 bipartisan budget, the Shapiro Administration invested $500 million in site development, including $400 million for the PA SITES Program to make more locations shovel-ready for business investment.

To date, 18 projects have been awarded $74.6 million, helping communities across Pennsylvania compete for new job-creating opportunities.

The Governor’s 2025–26 budget proposal builds on this momentum with major investments in innovation, workforce, and tax reform:

$50 million for scientific and technological innovation — including $30 million for life sciences and $20 million for large-scale research and development.

$10 million for the new AdvancePA Tax Credit to attract and retain high-quality jobs.

$12.5 million for WEDnetPA to close workforce gaps.

Accelerated Corporate Net Income Tax cuts to reach 4.99 percent by 2029, and streamlined and modernized tax credits to focus on high-impact growth industries.

Governor Shapiro’s leadership is delivering results: faster government, stronger communities, and an economy built for the future. The Shapiro Administration continues to move quickly and efficiently to process permit applications, get businesses answers, and land major deals that benefit the people of Pennsylvania.

There, the plan for the future includes a $55 million fund, through an agreement between Washington State and the coal plant owner, to help the Centralia community transition.","The last coal-fired power plant in New England, Merrimack Station, has stopped running.

With the closure of that facility, the region is poised to become the first in the United States without a coal plant on its grid (though New York state, which has its own regional grid operator, stopped burning coal in 2020).

Granite Shore Power, the company that owns the coal plant in Bow, New Hampshire, said they ceased commercial operations September 12th, about a year and a half since they announced they would retire their facility by 2028 as part of a settlement agreement with environmental groups.

“For nearly three quarters of a century, Merrimack Station has reliably served the energy needs of families and businesses across New Hampshire,” the company wrote in a statement.

The facility still has two kerosene-fired generators that will continue running. It has been struggling to keep its coal-fired generators in compliance with state regulations for more than two years.

“I’m so glad that we are not going to burn any more coal in New Hampshire,” said Kendra Ford, a climate organizer with 350 New Hampshire. “I know that this is hard on people who work there, and I know that the town of Bow may also be a little caught off guard by it closing at this moment, so I hope that lots of things can be done for those folks.”

Merrimack Station and another plant owned by Granite Shore Power, Schiller Station, are the last two coal-fired plants connected to New England’s regional electric grid. Schiller Station has not burned coal since 2020. In Maine, a paper mill burns coal to power their own operations.

Mary Cate Colapietro, a spokesperson for New England’s regional grid operator, said the organization has not received a formal retirement request from Merrimack Station, but the region does not depend on the facility for the grid’s reliability.

“Coal generation accounted for only 0.22% of power in the region in 2024,” Colapietro said.

Colapietro said there is no way to track what kinds of fuel are being used to generate the electricity that is imported from other regions, meaning it’s not a given that New Englanders are using coal-free power.

But with Merrimack Station shutting down, there will no longer be coal burned in New England to power the grid.

Granite Shore Power said they would provide assistance or placement services to employees who lost their jobs, and that they were considering “all opportunities” for redevelopment at the site of the plant.

Local transitions

Merrimack Station opened in the 1960s. It generated power for the regional grid – and had a major impact on the community that hosted it, the town of Bow.

“Back when it was built, it was the largest taxpayer in town by far,” said David Stack, Bow’s town manager.

The amount of revenue that Bow got from property taxes on the coal plant allowed the town to keep tax rates low, leading to a boom in residential development. The impact was especially profound because New Hampshire towns depend heavily on property taxes, Stack said.

But the value of the plant, and how much they should pay in taxes, has been the subject of yearslong conflict between Bow and the owners of Merrimack Station – first Public Service of New Hampshire and Eversource, and more recently, Granite Shore Power.

The conflict led to a lawsuit, in which Bow had to pay Eversource millions of dollars, after the New Hampshire Supreme Court found they had charged the company too much in taxes. Stack says that as the value of the plant has continued to drop, Bow has felt the economic impact.

Over the last 15 years, Stack says, Bow has tried to adapt. Officials have worked to become friendlier to developers, changing zoning rules. Firms like DHL and Coastal Forest Products opened distribution centers in town. But other than mixed-use developments that are primarily residential, Stack says there aren’t a lot of new opportunities.

“As far as manufacturing, you don’t really see that anymore,” Stack said. “I just don’t know if big commercial ventures beyond Amazon are that successful.”

A few years ago, the taxes from new commercial developments surpassed the taxes the power plant was paying – a major turning point for reducing Bow’s reliance on the plant. But despite the town’s preparation, the news of Merrimack Station’s closure came as a surprise.

“We realized we were going to get to this point eventually,” Stack said. “I thought they had a little more time.”

Stack says Granite Shore Power has never sat down with officials in Bow to talk about the future. The company has said publicly that they’re hoping to turn Merrimack Station and Schiller Station into “renewable energy parks,” with batteries and solar. Jim Andrews, the head of Granite Shore Power, said in 2024 he wasn’t planning to include natural gas as part of the redevelopment. But, he said, it’s not off the table.

“We’re concerned with the valuation. But we don’t know exactly what technology they’re looking at putting there,” Stack said.

National shifts

In the opposite northern corner of the country, other communities are also preparing to leave coal behind. Oregon and Washington are planning to eliminate coal from their generation portfolio by the end of this year, when the Centralia, WA coal plant is scheduled for retirement.

There, the plan for the future includes a $55 million fund, through an agreement between Washington State and the coal plant owner, to help the Centralia community transition.

Coal still makes up about 8% of the generation capacity in the Northwest, including Idaho and Montana. Next door, in California, coal still made up a small fraction of the state’s power production as of 2024.

Nationally and globally, coal has been on its way out for years. Coal plants account for the largest share of retiring energy generators in the country.

Research shows coal has become more expensive than other fuel options. And it’s one of the most carbon-emitting fossil fuels, creating emissions that can harm the health of people nearby and that fuel climate change.

Still, coal accounted for about 16% of the U.S.’s power generation in 2023. Some plants are delaying retirements. The Trump Administration has announced several efforts to expand the industry, including putting millions of dollars towards re-opening or modernizing coal plants, opening millions of acres of federal land for coal mining, and relaxing federal environmental rules that affect the burning of coal.

For Kendra Ford, the climate advocate, Merrimack Station’s closure seems to be another sign of the industry in decline, despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to revive it.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a3322f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+230/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F36%2F733bea6a4cf69221e0b9b8ed0e2f%2Fbowcoalprotest0612.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 18:02:55.214070

October 6, 2025 (Washington) – Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) along with the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), Lawyers for Good Government (L4GG), and the Lawyers Committee for Rhode Island, filed a legal challenge in federal court on behalf of a coalition of businesses and nonprofits to reverse the Trump administration’s illegal termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Solar for All represents a generational opportunity to cut skyrocketing power bills, create new good jobs, and equip our communities to address the causes and consequences of a changing climate. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to unlawfully terminate the program.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at CLF. “This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat. Stripping those benefits away is unlawful and betrays communities. We will not let it stand.”

Plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a statewide organization of trade unions representing more than 80,000 people. EPA’s attempt to terminate Solar for All deprived their members of opportunities for apprenticeships and job training that would have been crucial for a clean energy future.

Solar United Neighbors is also joining the challenge as a nonprofit working in multiple states on projects like creating solar-powered homes that can serve as a refuge for neighbors during power outages in Texas.

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All. This popular program was poised to bring more solar to our communities, provide jobs for the small businesses installing those projects, and help families get cheap, clean power,” said SELC Senior Attorney Nick Torrey. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

“EPA’s termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program is a betrayal against a million American families and communities who need access to clean, affordable energy. By terminating the Solar for All program while simultaneously ending clean air protections, this administration is sending a clear message: they will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry. We will not allow this administration to trample the legal rights of Americans, and we will keep fighting for a clean, affordable future for the people and the planet,” L4GG Vice President of Climate Change and Environmental Justice Jillian Blanchard said.

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” said Amy Romero, Chief Legal Counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island. “EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program. The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

Background

In 2024, through Solar for All, EPA awarded $7 billion in grants to organizations nationwide to provide energy bill relief to over 900,000 households. All that funding is intended to get affordable solar power to more people through new leasing and power purchase programs, multifamily installations, workforce development and more.

About 28 million households across the country face a high or severe energy burden, meaning they spend a high percentage of their income on energy bills. Solar for All rooftop and community solar programs are helping to alleviate these burdens with a guaranteed 20% savings on electricity bills for participating households. Nationwide, the program is expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills and generate 200,000 new jobs alongside workforce training programs. In addition, the SFA program is a source of immediate, cost-effective energy for strained electric grids across the country.

Chuck Coppa, APG's CEO/CFO, will be representing APG along with multiple industry executives spanning vehicle and engine manufacturers, servicers, suppliers, fuel producers and providers as well as multiple industry trade organizations. Mr. Coppa will be discussing APG's practical, affordable, and proven alternative fuel solution to convert existing Class 8 diesel trucks with APG's vehicular Dual Fuel System. With no loss of power and torque, the Dual Fuel solution provides the ability to realize meaningful net fuel savings through the substitution of up to 60% natural gas including low-carbon and negative-carbon renewable natural gas. According to the American Trucking Association, 95.8% of all carriers operate 10 or less trucks and 99.7% operate 100 or less trucks which makes APG's Dual Fuel solution so appealing as we believe most fleets are either just hesitant of change or do not have the financial resources to completely swap out their entire diesel fleet for cleaner burning vehicles.

Mr. Coppa noted, ""Regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, reducing on-road transportation related operating costs and emissions while using readily available cleaner burning domestic fuel sources should be a top priority and is an important step in America's goal of achieving energy dominance and independence. I am excited to represent APG alongside so many high-profile industry executives.""

The EV maker and its rivals are bracing for a sharp drop in sales in the last three months of the year without the $7,500 in credits. While some have cut prices and found mechanisms to extend the benefits of the credit, others have cut production plans in anticipation of a slump.

The EV industry has already been grappling with high tariffs on imports of vehicles and auto parts into the U.S.

While Lucid makes its vehicles in the U.S., it imports some parts from abroad. Lucid vehicles did not qualify for the tax credits on cash purchases, but it used the credits to offer attractive leases.

Lucid handed over 4,078 vehicles in the quarter, compared with estimates of 4,286 deliveries seven analysts, on average, were expecting, according to Visible Alpha. This compares with 2,781 vehicles delivered a year ago.

EV giant Tesla posted record quarterly deliveries on Thursday, while Rivian also beat sales estimates as consumers rushed to buy EVs ahead of the incentive’s September 30 deadline.

The company has put in place offers and discounts to boost the appeal of its luxury Air sedans to attract consumers who have pared back big-budget spending because of high interest rates.

The EV maker has been aggressively striking deals with North American companies to domestically source critical minerals used in manufacturing.

The company’s fortunes rely heavily on the success of its newly launched Gravity SUV and the upcoming mid-size car, which targets a $50,000 price point, as the company looks to expand its consumer base.

The department has evolved its services over time to include technology strategy and design services, application development, and managed security services. In 2017, DIR began offering public cloud services, starting with Azure and AWS, and recently added Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. The goals are to avoid vendor lock-in, which limits technology choice, and provide access to the latest innovations and best-of-breed solutions.

“Texas is a big state, and we have a lot of government entities with varying missions. At DIR, we strive to always offer our customer agencies the choice of what would be best for their applications and ultimately, what would be the best value for Texans and the taxpayers of this state,” Crawford says.

Through the DCS program, public cloud use has climbed to 30% since 2017, with private cloud at 70%, Ward says. The program now serves 121 state and local government agencies and educational institutions, including 29 state agencies that are required by law to participate and 18 others that have joined voluntarily.

Agencies are increasingly adopting public cloud to modernize or build new applications, taking advantage of Platform as a Service and the ability to scale services up or down as needed, Ward says.

DIR offers four public cloud services to give agencies choice, because no two clouds are the same, she says. Their choices are based on the best fit for their application or their existing expertise.

“There are business and technology reasons why one platform would be better for a particular need,” Ward says. “It could be that an agency is an AWS shop or an Azure shop. That’s what they know, and that’s what they want to keep using.”

Modernizing Applications to Improve Public Services

The Office of the Texas Secretary of State uses DIR’s traditional data center services but has also adopted AWS, Azure and other public cloud services to modernize applications, says Dan Teczar, the office’s CIO.

“The economies of scale we achieve through DIR with the buying power of the state is a great resource, especially for a smaller agency like the Secretary of State’s office,” he says. “In addition to cost, we benefit greatly from the contract vehicles, services and expertise offered by DIR’s internal staff and vendor partners.”

The agency took advantage of DIR resources when it recently modernized its Texas Register and Notary Public applications in the public cloud, resulting in more streamlined business operations and better customer service, Teczar says.

The SoS modernized its 30-year-old Texas Register system, where agencies publish public notices and new rules, using a cloud-native, low-code platform hosted in AWS.

The new Texas Register application cut editorial preparation time by up to 75%, reduced security vulnerabilities by 70% throughout the agency and allowed the public to see rule updates almost immediately, Teczar says.

SoS also modernized its Notary Public software, making 95% of filings paperless and saving staff over 700 hours per month through automation.

Overall, public cloud services have enabled the Secretary of State’s office to pursue digital transformation that delivers faster, smarter services, Teczar says.

“By combining modern tools, inclusive engagement and relentless focus on public value, we are turning outdated processes into high-performing digital services that restore trust and reduce burden,” he says.

Scaling Resources Across Departments

Texas Health and Human Services (HHS), which provides IT services for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), migrated to the DIR DCS program in 2007 and began utilizing public cloud services in 2019.

DSHS chooses public cloud services based on individual application requirements, primarily using AWS (with a smaller presence in Azure), while also using DIR’s private cloud resources. Before the 2007 DCS migration, HHS mostly used on-premises data centers operated by the Texas Facilities Commission.

The DCS program’s public and private cloud services offer advantages over traditional data centers. Both cloud options use a pay-as-you-go model that can provide cost efficiencies.

Because the program’s management structure (which includes private cloud operations and the DCS public cloud manager) handles maintenance and updates, HHS IT staff have more time to focus on core business activities, an HHS spokesperson says.

“With the cloud platforms’ scalable, flexible and agile resources, HHS can quickly adjust capacity based on demand, make timely system changes and reduce downtime,” the HHS spokesperson says. “The platforms also offer higher performance, reliability, built-in disaster recovery, and tools and infrastructure for superior security controls.”

Building Data Center Services

To manage this hybrid environment, DIR has contracted with a multisourcing services integrator that oversees vendors and cloud companies and provides overall governance. DIR uses reference architectures to optimize cloud operations, ensuring each public cloud environment is deployed consistently and securely and meets industry best practices.

“Reference architectures are established to ensure standards and compliance. Customers don’t have to create them,” Ward says. “Health checks are run. Vulnerabilities are managed. All of this is tightly controlled to ensure that we minimize – as much as we can – the opportunity for a breach.”

Public cloud deployments include financial controls to prevent cost overruns. Agency leaders must approve projects and set cost limits. Agencies are notified if they reach a spending threshold, she says.

Previously, state agency leaders were reluctant to fully embrace public cloud, but these operational, security and financial controls have addressed their concerns, prompting increased adoption, Ward says.

To deploy public cloud services, agencies submit a ServiceNow ticket with their requirements, Ward says.

A vendor that serves as the state’s public cloud manager holds a joint application development session with the agency. The vendor scopes out the architecture, Platform or Infrastructure as a Service options, and storage requirements. The public cloud manager creates a cost proposal, and upon approval, spins up the cloud services and turns it over to the agency for testing and final sign-off, Ward says.

Agencies that want to use a private cloud go through a similar process. They submit a ticket with their requirements and automatically spin up virtual instances. DIR uses a variety of technologies in its data centers and most recently began deploying Dell PowerFlex hyperconverged infrastructure.

“It’s very much like what you would see in the public cloud: very easy and not laborious,” Ward says.

Texas’s shared services for public and private cloud offerings are a smart strategy that eliminates government waste, says IDC Analyst Ashish Nadkarni.

DIR’s use of reference architectures provides a standardized blueprint for implementing infrastructure and applications, which eliminates one-off implementations that can be costly and difficult to manage, and that could potentially create security vulnerabilities, he says.

“Creating a reference architecture makes it more cookie-cutter, makes it more scalable,” Nadkarni says. “It takes the guesswork out, streamlines implementation of services and eases the burden on administration and IT teams.”

Satisfying Statewide Demand

Ward expects the current 70-30 split between private and public cloud to even out slowly in the future, possibly reaching 50-50 in the next decade.

Overall, DIR’s IT leaders feel the state’s data center consolidation and mix of private and public cloud services have been successful. State, local and educational institutions spent $546 million in data center services in fiscal 2024, with 97% customer satisfaction, Crawford says.

The technical piece is huge, but change management and relationship management are also critical, she says.

“We hit 100% customer satisfaction for many months. But we did not start out that way,” Crawford says. “It came through a lot of hard work, and it continues to be a lot of hard work. We’re continually evolving our program, so that we can be ahead of the curve and meet the needs of where Texas is going and where technology is going.”

Technology Guide for State Agencies

The Texas Department of Information Resources serves as a technology guide, says Texas CIO Amanda Crawford, assisting agencies in their public cloud and data center initiatives. Those efforts include:

Innovation and testing at DIR’s Texas Innovation and Education Center, where agencies can text new technology in a secure lab to see if it’s a good fit for them

Education and training provided by DIR through conferences, webinars and education days

Dear Editor,

Is there time for climate policies to be political?

The evidence is there–melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather. Climate change is accelerating, but instead of taking action, we have attached party identities to the issues and are now facing the consequences of political polarization. Party issues create swings between administrations–these frequent reversals are what make our system of government unique.

But unlike some domestic policies where this ""swing"" can be healthy, we cannot treat climate action as a partisan issue when there are global consequences.

I graduated from high school this spring, and while I just began studying political science, I am no expert yet. Already in my lifetime, I have noticed environmental changes in Iowa: frequent flooding, record temperatures, and extreme storms.

That’s why I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), a volunteer organization seeking bipartisan climate solutions through grassroots advocacy. CCL’s neutral approach bridges many perceptions and concerns about climate policies, and one opportunity to exercise this is through lobbying. Thanks to fundraising led by Northeast Iowa’s CCL Chapter Leader Leslie Sand and a generous grant from the Northeast Iowa Peace and Justice Center, I have had the opportunity twice now to lobby Iowa’s members of Congress for bipartisan climate action.

During meetings with Representatives Hinson and Feenstra and Senator Grassley, our focus was on the role of clean energy and the global ""clean energy race."" But policy compromise still felt out of reach because of a major national barrier: political parties. Political polarization has national leaders trapped in rigid agendas.

One reason for this could be because political identities have become a defining factor in political decisions and voting patterns through political polarization, both at an individual and party level, which encourage party-line votes. But another reason could be political pressure from party leaders or administrations to vote and act certain ways.

This is a big problem, especially for climate policies.

Climate policies are urgent, but as work continues to find bipartisan solutions, our leaders seem to be drifting farther apart.

Climate change does not care how you vote. It is our responsibility to remind our leaders to work together and prioritize bipartisan climate action. Despite divisiveness within our current political environment, I remain optimistic. My conversations locally and in D.C. have changed how I approach climate change, and I believe that by working together, we can protect our future

Participants will be joined by subject matter experts for a full day of policy discussions on Tuesday, October 7th, including a deep dive on RNG fleeting policy priorities, extending the $0.50/gallon Alternative Fuel Tax Credit, establishing a $1.00/gallon Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Fuel Tax Credit, and preserving RNG viability in EPA's regulatory programs such as the Phase 3 GHG Rule and the Renewable Fuel Standard. On Wednesday, October 8th, participants along with Transport Project staffers will be meeting on Capitol Hill to lobby Members of Congress and senior staff on industry issues.

Chuck Coppa, APG's CEO/CFO, will be representing APG along with multiple industry executives spanning vehicle and engine manufacturers, servicers, suppliers, fuel producers and providers as well as multiple industry trade organizations. Mr. Coppa will be discussing APG's practical, affordable, and proven alternative fuel solution to convert existing Class 8 diesel trucks with APG's vehicular Dual Fuel System. With no loss of power and torque, the Dual Fuel solution provides the ability to realize meaningful net fuel savings through the substitution of up to 60% natural gas including low-carbon and negative-carbon renewable natural gas. According to the American Trucking Association, 95.8% of all carriers operate 10 or less trucks and 99.7% operate 100 or less trucks which makes APG's Dual Fuel solution so appealing as we believe most fleets are either just hesitant of change or do not have the financial resources to completely swap out their entire diesel fleet for cleaner burning vehicles.

Mr. Coppa noted, ""Regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, reducing on-road transportation related operating costs and emissions while using readily available cleaner burning domestic fuel sources should be a top priority and is an important step in America's goal of achieving energy dominance and independence. I am excited to represent APG alongside so many high-profile industry executives.""

Research over two decades has found “intractable” problems that have made carbon credits in most big programmes poor quality, according to the study. While the industry and diplomats have made efforts to improve the system, it found much-awaited rules agreed at a UN climate summit last year “did not substantially address the quality problem”.

“We must stop expecting carbon offsetting to work at scale,” said Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Smith School and co-author of the study, in Annual Reviews. “We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed.”

Carbon offsets are a tool to cut emissions efficiently by crediting rich polluters for financing cheap climate action abroad while pumping out the same amount of planet-heating gas at home.

In theory, the practice could lead to lower levels of global heating by funnelling money to the places where it will do the most good as soon as possible. But voluntary carbon markets have long been plagued by “junk offsets” that overstate their impact.

The researchers said the worst problems were with issuing additional credits for projects that were already in the pipeline, such as building a windfarm that would have gone up anyway; impermanent projects, such as planting trees that later burn down in a wildfire; projects with leakage, such as protecting part of a forest but effectively pushing loggers elsewhere; and double-counted projects, such as restoring a peatland but letting the seller and buyer claim the drop in emissions.

“An offset may be robust on three of these four dimensions, but if it lacks in the fourth, it may represent a far lower emissions reduction than was credited – or no real reduction at all,” the study warned.

A meta-analysis published in Nature Communications last year found that less than 16% of the carbon credits investigated showed real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

The lead author, Benedict Probst, founder of the Net Zero Lab at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, who was not involved in the new paper, said it provided a “valuable high-level overview of the well-documented problems plaguing existing carbon crediting projects”, despite not providing a critical appraisal of the underlying studies.

“This study echoes the main conclusions of our own research, but it provides a broader picture across the carbon crediting landscape,” he said.

Probst added that the study identified some of the root causes of over-crediting, such as information gaps, but warned of other systemic factors such as the small constituency advocating for high-quality projects, conflicts of interest when drafting standards, and “chronically understaffed” regulators.

There are efforts under way to clean up the market. In response to recent criticism, industry-led initiatives such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) have gone through the latest scientific research on which offsets are effective, only approving schemes that meet strict requirements. Separately, so-called “ratings agencies” for carbon offsets now provide buyers with information on whether offsets are likely to represent real-world emission reductions.

The review authors recommended urgently phasing out offsets that did not actively suck CO2 from the atmosphere and shifting the focus of offset markets to high-quality carbon dioxide removal and storage. Instead of financing other meaningful climate projects through carbon offsets, they called for a contribution-based scheme that did not allow donors to claim it negated their own emissions.

But they also found some types of projects that currently suffer from over-crediting could still be remedied, such as issuing cleaner cookstoves and capturing gas from landfill.

“We don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” said Lezak. “There are a couple of important domains where it is important to highlight success, or the potential for it.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395b935b2a9343572a2440bcf535c0fac4d37e5c/281_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db06ef948976f5a39c505ae894309ce1",N,,2025-10-06 17:05:50.389567

The model, according to the LSU executive, Robert Twilley, could be the LSU Ag Center's and LSU Sea Grant's decades-old cooperative extension services.
""The key part of the extension service is that people live in these communities,"" Twilley said during the LSU Energy Research Symposium on Friday.
On Monday, Tara Smith, LSU executive associate vice president and director of the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service at LSU AgCenter, said she wasn't aware of a formal plan to implement the idea.
Hensgens asked if having the extension services step into the current ""messy"" energy debate would harm the trust people have put in the services.","Pumping and permanently storing carbon dioxide under vast stretches of Louisiana forest and farmland has triggered grassroots opposition, as the reality of more than 30 such proposed projects has taken hold over the past two years.

Companies proposing to convert hundreds to thousands of acres of farmland into solar farms have faced similar opposition from pockets of rural Louisiana, including in the state's sugar cane growing regions.

The ""energy transition"" that some officials and business leaders say has arrived in Louisiana is bringing uncomfortable change and conflict to a state with nearly 125 years of history with oil and gas.

During a recent energy symposium, a top LSU executive floated the concept of having the state's flagship university create a new cooperative extension service that could serve as an unbiased mediator and science-based information source on energy. The concept, however, may step into a potentially sensitive area for LSU, with some having previously raised concerns over whether the university has too close a relationship with the carbon capture and energy industries.

The model, according to the LSU executive, Robert Twilley, could be the LSU Ag Center's and LSU Sea Grant's decades-old cooperative extension services. LSU Ag Center includes the popular Louisiana Master Gardener Program.

Twilley, LSU vice president for research and economic development who formerly led the LSU Sea Grant program, said creating a cooperative extension for energy would match a trend happening in some other land grant universities to expand extension services beyond agriculture.

The cooperative extension services, which have the mission of bringing new research to the public, so the public can apply it, have a physical presence in all 64 parishes that could serve as the home for a new energy cooperative extension, Twilley suggested.

Combined with the recently formed LSU Energy Institute, the effort could tap into the university's expertise to address the multi-disciplinary questions energy raises and, Twilley argued, fulfill an obligation that a public research university has to serve as a trusted source of information.

'Informed, trusted agent'

Twilley told the forum audience that early discussions have occurred, including an idea, as a first step, to give agents an ""Energy 101"" class so they can field some questions and direct people to more expert LSU sources.

""The key part of the extension service is that people live in these communities,"" Twilley said during the LSU Energy Research Symposium on Friday. ""That's really critical because they're trusted individuals, and they are trained in how to actually deal with being the informed, trusted agent.""

On Monday, Tara Smith, LSU executive associate vice president and director of the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service at LSU AgCenter, said she wasn't aware of a formal plan to implement the idea.

Smith, who sat on the forum panel moderated by Twilley, said there would have to be ""a lot of future discussions"" at the ""highest levels to make something like that happen.""

Among those challenges, according to Twilley, is finding the people and money.

At the forum, he floated the idea of the U.S. Department of Energy providing the dollars to avoid the inevitable credibility questions industry funding might generate.

Other concerns existed for some. State Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, who attended the forum and grew up in a family of rice farmers, remarked on the credibility the agricultural extension service had with his grandfather.

Hensgens asked if having the extension services step into the current ""messy"" energy debate would harm the trust people have put in the services.

'Not take sides'

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies who has spoken at some community forums to provide information on carbon capture, has already faced criticism. Upton is also interim director of the new Energy Institute.

But Smith and another forum panel member, Rex Caffey, an LSU natural resource economics professor and director of the Sea Grant marine extension, explained they believed the cooperative model could stay above the fray.

""Our stock and trade is to get involved in controversial issues and the way we protect ourselves is to bring science-based information and to not take sides.

Americans don’t expect and really don’t want the government to run the economy. Instead, they hope it will create conditions in which jobs are created, wealth expands, and new businesses not only survive but also thrive.

Achieving this state has been one of President Trump’s primary objectives. So far, he has kept his eye on the ball. In his first term, he cut taxes, slashed red tape and put the interests of working Americans ahead of those of multinationals and money movers who had closely aligned themselves with Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden.

Mr. Trump’s second term began auspiciously, with the White House focused on securing favorable trade deals to enable American industry to prosper. Some in Congress, unfortunately, have other ideas and have kowtowed to well-heeled special interests at the expense of working men and women.

That must change, and Mr. Trump must take the lead. One of the American system’s significant innovations is the respect built into it for the individual’s right to property. It is mentioned in the Constitution, as the Founders believed the success of the nation rested in many ways on the ability of people to secure rights to the property gained through their labor.

After more than 200 years, the definition of property has expanded, and it now encompasses not only tangible things but also intangible ideas. The recognition and protection of intellectual property, the products of human thought, are even more critical now that the global economy runs as much on zeros and ones as it does on fossil fuels and ball bearings.

For some time now, what used to be referred to as “Detroit” has flexed its power in the marketplace and on Capitol Hill, pushing independent mechanics and parts suppliers out into the cold, leaving them unable to access the thousands of bits of information involved in fixing cars and trucks. It has created an auto repair monopoly for vehicle dealerships. The people who build our cars and trucks also want to be the only ones who can service them. From the free market perspective, that’s not fair.

A bipartisan measure making its way through Congress addresses the issue effectively. The REPAIR Act makes the distinctions necessary to protect the rights of innovators producing new products that are truly cutting-edge while preventing auto companies from using IP law to stifle competition from local small businesses that service vehicles and often serve as a gateway to the middle class for working Americans.

This is about the foundation of the U.S. economy. The vehicle supplier industry, which supplies the parts needed for vehicle repair, is the largest piece of the nation’s manufacturing sector. It involves more than 4.8 million Americans, mostly working-class individuals or small-business owners and operators. They’re also Trump voters whose interests are of great concern to the White House.

If Congress fails to step up, this economically essential network of manufacturers, mechanics and suppliers remains at risk. If current trends continue, by 2035, consumers could face additional costs of $34 billion on top of what they should be paying for car and truck repairs. Even now, they are paying the price.

Today, more than 60% of independent repair shops experience weekly, if not daily, difficulties making routine repairs. Just over half of independent repair shops report sending as many as five vehicles each month to a dealer for repair because of data restrictions imposed by “Detroit.” It’s a perversion of the concept of property rights, which means consumers have fewer options, face longer wait times and pay higher prices.

You would think that the restrictions might lead to safer vehicles on the road, but you’d be wrong. In testimony before Congress, Jonathan Morrison, named by Mr. Trump to lead the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, explained that the hoarding of data has a deleterious effect on the nation’s automotive fleet.

“The ability of vehicle owners to service and maintain their own vehicles, or have their vehicles serviced or maintained at the facility of their choice, is important to ensure safety,” he said, promising to support efforts such as the REPAIR Act that, in his words, “provide consumers with secure access to data necessary to maintain or service their vehicles.”

It’s not just about keeping the nation’s vehicle fleet running safely. It’s about what’s best for consumers. Independent shops can perform the same work as dealerships, just as well, if not better, for about two-thirds the cost. Forcing commercial vehicle operators to use the more expensive option by involving nebulous IP concerns drives up costs for essential goods and services.

This is precisely the kind of anti-competitive behavior the Trump administration wants to eliminate. Mr. Trump believes in free markets, intense competition and empowering the American worker rather than compromising with monopolistic entities that squeeze consumers and strangle small businesses.

That’s why the REPAIR Act is necessary. It restores balance by ensuring that independent repair shops and aftermarket parts manufacturers have access to the critical data needed to perform their jobs.

The Trump movement is about shaking up the status quo to deliver results. The REPAIR Act is a textbook example of how to achieve this, leading to lower prices, increased competition and support for jobs in America in an environment that promotes growth rather than protectionism.

PEORIA — Two Peoria-area manufacturers are set to lose millions of dollars in federal funds following President Donald Trump's move to cancel billions of dollars in energy projects, mostly in Democrat-run states.
Caterpillar is set to lose a $3.2 million in U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood's district, while Komatsu is slated to lose $2.5 million in funding in U.S. Rep. Eric Sorensen's district.

""At Komatsu, sustainability is not just a goal — it’s a fundamental part of how we do business,"" Komatsu's website says.","Caterpillar and Komatsu could be impacted by the federal energy project cuts.

The Trump administration moved to cut nearly $8 billion in projects from blue states.

PEORIA — Two Peoria-area manufacturers are set to lose millions of dollars in federal funds following President Donald Trump's move to cancel billions of dollars in energy projects, mostly in Democrat-run states.

Illinois was one of 16 states to have energy projects funding, totaling $7.6 billion, terminated last week by the Trump administration in a move that targets blue states during a government shutdown which Trump and his allies have pinned on Democrats. In total, Illinois will lose $752,301,434 in funding.

The project terminations, which were announced by Trump's director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought, will impact the Peoria area.

Caterpillar is set to lose a $3.2 million in U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood's district, while Komatsu is slated to lose $2.5 million in funding in U.S. Rep. Eric Sorensen's district.

Sorensen, a Democrat from Illinois's 17th District, said the projects, which were already appropriated by Congress, were designed to ""lower energy costs, create jobs, and boost American innovation.""

“This is a political stunt that puts working families last. This reckless decision means more than $54 million in lost investment that would have created good-paying jobs, supported clean energy technology, and kept our communities competitive,"" Sorensen said in a statement. “This isn’t about saving taxpayer dollars. The funding was already approved. This is about politics, plain and simple — and our families will pay the price.”

Vought, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, said in a statement on X that the projects were part of the ""Green New Scam"" and ""fueled the Left's climate agenda.""

Komatsu declined to comment for this story.

Caterpillar and LaHood's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sustainable energies and technologies has been a focus point of Caterpillar's in recent years following the launch of its ""Pathways to Sustainability"" program.

Under the electric power sustainable energy and technology section of its website, Caterpillar says: ""For Caterpillar, sustainability is not a new concept. It’s part of who we are and what we do every single day. From lower carbon intensity fuels to solar power, Cat Electric Power puts sustainability in action by delivering a wide range of power solutions that make your operations more efficient and help to meet your sustainability-related goals.""

Komatsu, too, according to its website, has made sustainability a focus in recent years and has even made a pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

""At Komatsu, sustainability is not just a goal — it’s a fundamental part of how we do business,"" Komatsu's website says. ""We aim to create value through manufacturing and technology innovation to empower a sustainable future where people, business and our planet thrive together.""

Trump has routinely targeted programs and rhetoric focused on curbing climate change, including solar power and electric vehicles, during his presidency. While speaking to the United Nations last month, Trump called climate change a ""con job.""

“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said at the United Nations. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”","https://www.pjstar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/19/NJOS/86248967007-091925-catevent-08.JPG?crop=6783,3816,x0,y313&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-06 17:04:59.428703

What This Means for Data Center Developers Over the next several years, the structure of power procurement deals for data centers is likely to evolve significantly.","Over the last 18 months or so, the energy generation industry and its public utilities have been significantly impacted by the AI data center boom. It has been demonstrated across North America that the increase in demand for power, as driven by the demand for hyperscale and AI data centers, greatly exceeds the ability of the industry to actually generate and deliver power to meet the demand.

We have covered many of the efforts being made to control the availability of power. In response, utilities and regulators have begun rethinking how to manage power availability through means such as: temporary moratoriums on new data center interconnections; the creation of new rate classes; cogeneration and load-sharing agreements; renewable integration; and power-driven site selection strategies.

But the bottom line is that in many locations utilities will need to change the way they work and how and where they spend their CAPEX budgets. The industry has already realized that their demand forecast models are hugely out of date, and that has had a ripple effect on much of the planning done by public utilities to meet the next generation of power demand.

Most utilities now acknowledge that their demand forecasting models have fallen behind reality, triggering revisions to Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) and transmission buildouts nationwide. This mismatch between forecast and actual demand is forcing a fundamental rethink of capital expenditure priorities and long-term grid planning.

Spend More, Build Faster

Utilities are sharply increasing CAPEX and rebalancing their resource portfolios—not just for decarbonization, but to keep pace with multi-hundred-megawatt data center interconnects. This trend is spreading across the industry, not confined to a few isolated utilities. Notable examples include:

Duke Energy raised its five-year CAPEX plan to $83 billion (a 13.7% increase) and plans to add roughly 5 GW of natural gas capacity by 2029 to meet accelerating data center and industrial load growth.

Dominion Energy lifted its five-year capital plan to $50.1 billion, citing data centers as a primary driver while warning of potential rate pressure from grid modernization and capacity expansion.

NV Energy’s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan explicitly models about 5.9 GW of bundled-service data center requests by 2033, supported by new gas, storage, and renewable additions.

Salt River Project (Phoenix) is advancing a mixed portfolio of peaking gas and clean capacity, including the Coolidge Generating Station Expansion—a 575-MW project approved and now under construction—with additional peak resources under review.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is moving forward on advanced nuclear for long-duration firming, including a BWRX-300 small modular reactor application for the Clinch River site, and a power purchase agreement with Kairos Power’s Hermes-2 test reactor expected to support Google data centers around 2030.

These CAPEX expansions fund both new generation capacity in the form of modern combined-cycle and combustion-turbine plants, nuclear pilots, and renewables, and grid-side investments to move bulk power to where data centers are locating. This demand is now an explicit planning driver in utility integrated resource plans (IRPs) and board approvals. It’s important to note that these investments encompass both generation and transmission infrastructure.

New Rate Designs and Risk-Transfer Contracts Shift More Responsibility to Data Centers

Utilities are retooling tariffs to protect existing ratepayers and de-risk megawatt-scale customers. With a goal of protecting consumer rate payers, a number of different tariff designs have been put forth.

The goal is to ensure that the cost of new capacity and infrastructure upgrades falls primarily on large commercial users - particularly data centers -rather than being spread across residential and small-business customers. Several new tariff structures explicitly define data center capacity obligations and cost recovery terms. Examples include:

New data center rate class: Dominion Energy has proposed a dedicated rate category for customers ≥25 MW with ≥75% load factor, featuring 14-year take-or-pay–style commitments to cover stranded-cost risk and ensure “full cost of service.”

Take-or-pay / minimum-take provisions: Duke Energy is pursuing minimum-take contracts (requiring payment regardless of utilization) and up-front contributions for network upgrades tied to data center interconnections—part of a broader shift toward “contribution in aid of construction” (CIAC) requirements.

Standby and curtailable service riders: Large-load customers are increasingly directed toward standby-generator and curtailable-service schedules to formalize flexibility. Dominion’s Schedule SG and Schedule CS are examples under their targeted sector programs.

The net effect of these evolving tariffs is that utilities are socializing less risk from speculative or timing-uncertain AI loads, while providing greater queue certainty for data center developers willing to shoulder their share of capital costs.

Changing the Relationship Between Data Centers and Utilities

A major shift is underway: load flexibility is becoming a formal part of interconnection agreements. New legislation and regulatory frameworks across multiple regions are requiring data centers to demonstrate the ability to adjust or curtail power consumption during grid stress events.

From on-site cogeneration and load balancing to demand-response participation and remote-curtailment capabilities, utilities and regulators are increasingly embedding flexibility requirements into contracts and permitting. Examples include:

Under Texas SB 6, ratified in June 2025: Beginning December 31, 2025, new large-load customers (≥75 MW) must be able to remotely curtail load or switch to on-site generation during emergencies. ERCOT will also begin procuring demand reductions from major customers. Interconnection agreements are expected to include fees, disclosure of backup power systems, and cost-sharing provisions as standard components.

PJM and SPP: Both grid operators are fast-tracking policies to curtail or manage large loads during scarcity events. The SPP “HILL/CHILL” framework establishes a 90-day expedited interconnection path when large-load customers pair with generation resources, defining curtailable service classes for planning and market participation.

Voluntary demand-response partnerships: To preempt mandatory curtailment mandates, some hyperscalers are signing voluntary flexibility agreements. Google, for instance, has reached demand-flexibility deals with Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to shift or reduce AI workloads during peak grid demand—an emerging model for bridging near-term capacity gaps.

Collectively, these developments signal a new era of active coordination between utilities and data centers, in which grid reliability, flexibility, and cost allocation are shared operational priorities.

Upgrading Power Transmission: Accelerate, Reconductor, Right-Size

Serving today’s multi-gigawatt data centers and campus-scale developments requires both new transmission lines and rapid capacity upgrades along existing corridors. With data center interconnection queues expanding across nearly every regional transmission organization (RTO), utilities and regulators are under pressure to streamline approvals and unlock capacity faster.

PJM approved $5.9–$6.7 billion in near-term transmission projects in 2025, explicitly citing data center–driven load growth and resource shifts as key justifications.

Advanced conductors: Google and CTC Global have partnered with utilities to reconduct existing lines using ACCC® (Aluminum Conductor Composite Core) technology, boosting transmission capacity in months rather than years. Priority is being given to reconductoring lines that unlock capacity for new data center sites.

Aggressive planning upgrades: PJM’s evolving Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) process aims to “right-size” near-term fixes for long-term needs. The DOE and NREL have identified Grid-Enhancing Technologies (GETs) such as Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) and topology optimization as practical, near-term pathways for unlocking transmission capacity without lengthy new-build timelines.

Federal rulemaking: Two FERC orders are reshaping how utilities and RTOs plan for both new generation and surging load growth:

FERC Order 2023 (2023): Requires cluster-based interconnection studies with enforceable deadlines and penalties, designed to reduce the interconnection backlog and expedite capacity additions.

FERC Order 1920/A/B (2024–2025): Mandates 20-year regional transmission plans, state involvement in cost allocation, and greater transparency, giving utilities a framework to plan around structural load growth driven by AI and industrial electrification.

Process innovation: SPP is implementing a 90-day fast-track path for “high-impact large loads” paired with new generation under its HILL/CHILL policy framework.

Together, these measures reflect a system-wide acceleration of transmission modernization, combining new lines, smarter planning, and digital tools to move power where AI and hyperscale demand is rising fastest.

Green Tariffs and “Bring-Your-Own-Clean-Power” Programs Are Changing How Data Centers Source Energy

Utilities are expanding subscription-based renewable programs and custom clean-energy constructs that enable data centers to meet sustainability and carbon-reduction goals within regulated tariffs. For large-scale operators, the challenge lies in navigating a fragmented landscape: each utility administers its own program, requiring project-specific power purchase agreements (PPAs) and regional tailoring to reflect local policy and grid conditions.

Examples of key programs include:

Duke Energy – Green Source Advantage (GSA / GSA Choice, North and South Carolina): Allows large customers to contract utility-backed renewable projects through long-term agreements. The program was expanded in 2024 to add new capacity and greater flexibility for participants.

Georgia Power – CRSP / CARES: The Clear and Renewable Energy Subscription Program offers 1,000–2,100 MW of utility-procured renewables for large-customer subscription. QTS Data Centers subscribed to approximately 350 MW under CRSP for its Atlanta-area facilities.

Dominion Energy – Schedule RG / Schedule CFG: Provides utility-sourced carbon-free and renewable energy options for large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. Schedule RG (approved in 2018) and the newer Schedule CFG (for projects ≥1 MW) are voluntary programs that allow customers to directly procure renewable generation through Dominion-backed assets.

A growing number of utilities are evolving from pass-through energy suppliers to active counterparties, developing or contracting clean-energy assets that are directly matched to data center load profiles. This integrated approach (where power buyers participate in generation planning) aims to improve efficiency, transparency, and reliability in how large loads source renewable energy.

Regional Utility Responses Are Diverging

Not all power generation, and not all regulatory response, is created equal. Across the U.S., states and regional transmission operators (RTOs) are adapting to data center–driven load growth in markedly different ways, reflecting local politics, resource mixes, and grid constraints.

Virginia (PJM): Data centers now account for approximately 25% of statewide electricity consumption, according to Dominion’s filings and state reports. Dominion’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and new large-load rate class proposals formally recognize data centers as the primary driver of load growth and cost allocation debates. Transmission capacity remains the chokepoint, making advanced conductor pilots and PJM’s RTEP expansion windows key to sustaining growth.

Texas (ERCOT): Senate Bill 6 (2025) effectively resets the social contract for large loads—requiring operators to flex or face emergency curtailment—and is expected to push wider adoption of on-site generation, energy storage, and hybrid PPAs. Other utilities and cooperatives across the state are expected to mirror ERCOT’s flexibility protocols in their own tariffs.

Arizona (SRP / APS): Rapid regional growth is driving a buildout of gas peaker plants paired with battery storage, alongside stricter queue management and prioritization. Salt River Project’s Coolidge Expansion exemplifies a reliability-first strategy, with clean-energy components layered in to support long-term decarbonization goals.

Midwest (MISO / Indiana): The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) has approved new large-load interconnection rules, while utilities such as Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) are signing demand-response agreements—including with Google—to mitigate peak load. Policymakers are advancing cost-sharing requirements for new generation supporting big-load customers.

SPP (Plains states): The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) is actively marketing the region to High Impact Large Load (HILL) customers through accelerated interconnection studies and firm/curtailable service classes, aiming to attract data center development away from saturated hubs like Virginia and northern Texas.

Regional differences in regulation and resource strategy are now shaping the geography of new data center investment, rewarding jurisdictions that can align policy agility, grid capacity, and clean-power availability.

What This Means for Data Center Developers

Over the next several years, the structure of power procurement deals for data centers is likely to evolve significantly. Utilities will increasingly require greater up-front financial participation from customers, shifting capital and risk onto large-load developers. Expect to see:

Contribution-in-aid-of-construction (CIAC) payments or similar up-front contributions to fund new substations, network upgrades, and capacity expansions.

Minimum-take or take-or-pay obligations to guarantee long-term revenue recovery for utilities.

Extended contract terms—typically 10 to 15 years—to secure capacity and protect other ratepayers from stranded-cost exposure.

Flexibility will become a baseline requirement. Interconnection agreements may now mandate curtailment capabilities, demand-response participation, and certified backup generation. In ERCOT, for example, new large loads ≥75 MW must be equipped for remote disconnection or on-site generation under Senate Bill 6 (2025).

Transmission-friendly regions will rise in priority for new site development. Locations within PJM subregions or along SPP’s HILL corridor, where reconductoring and RTEP upgrades can unlock capacity quickly, will gain competitive advantage as interconnection bottlenecks persist elsewhere.

Data center developers will also need to maintain ongoing visibility into utility and regulatory planning cycles, tracking updates from individual utilities, regional transmission operators (RTOs), and federal agencies such as FERC. Understanding how generation mix, transmission planning, and tariff reform interact will be essential to long-term siting and investment strategy.

In short, the path to power is becoming more capital-intensive, flexible, and policy-dependent, requiring data center developers to act as active partners in the evolving utility ecosystem.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/09/68cac843484992e78987ed82-gettyimages2194154654.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-06 16:04:19.116980

A new Rainey Center poll shows rare unity among voters as Americans agree energy and data must stay secure, independent, and powered by U.S. innovation.

The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

— Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 6, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a time when it’s rare to find an issue that unites Americans, energy production, date security, information privacy and national security bring voters together. A new national survey conducted by the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy finds broad, bipartisan agreement among likely voters that America’s energy and data infrastructure must remain secure, independent, and domestically powered.

A national survey conducted on September 28, 2025, among 2,010 likely voters found that Americans across party lines view domestic energy production and data security as essential pillars of both economic strength and national security.

Key Findings:

- 96% of voters say it’s important that Americans’ personal data not be stored in Chinese data centers, with 82% calling it extremely or very important.

- 94% of voters believe it’s important that the energy powering U.S. data centers is generated exclusively from domestically produced sources.

- 70% agree that the United States is in a technological arms race with China, and 81% say energy security is a key component of national security.

- 71% support reducing regulatory burdens to make it easier to build new data centers and energy infrastructure within the United States.

- 79% of respondents would prefer the United States—not China—lead the world in installing new energy projects, even though a plurality (39%) believe China is currently moving faster on energy development.

- A majority, 83%, agree that data centers serving American consumers and companies should be based in the United States.

“These findings make clear that voters understand the connection between energy, technology, and national security,” said Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow at the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

The survey also underscores strong support for pro-growth energy and infrastructure policies, with nearly three-quarters of voters calling for the U.S. to expand its energy capacity and data infrastructure to compete against China and other foreign adversaries.

“Americans want to see more domestic production, less reliance on foreign adversaries, and smart policies that empower innovation here at home,” said Sarah Hunt, President of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy.

This week, elected officials, energy experts, technology innovators, and policy leaders from across the country will gather at the Joseph Rainey Center’s LAMP National Summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss these issues, focusing on how to strengthen America’s energy independence, secure its data infrastructure, and keep the nation competitive in the global race for innovation and security.

This remarkable market action saw EOSE's stock price soar, reflecting heightened investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory and the broader potential of the burgeoning energy storage sector. The unusual volume in call options suggests that a significant portion of the market is betting on a substantial upside for EOSE, despite the inherent volatility of emerging technology companies.

The options market, often a barometer of investor sentiment and speculative interest, signaled a decisive shift for EOSE. The dramatic increase in call options volume, particularly on a day marked by significant corporate news, highlights the market's immediate reaction to what is perceived as a transformative development for the company. While the energy storage sector is known for its high growth potential and capital intensity, this specific options activity indicates a focused belief in EOSE's ability to capitalize on the increasing global demand for reliable, long-duration energy solutions.

A Deep Dive into the Options Tsunami and Key Catalysts

The options market for Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) witnessed extraordinary activity on Monday, October 6, 2025. Investors acquired a staggering 134,256 call options, marking a 92% increase over the average daily volume of 69,806 call options. This surge propelled the total options market activity to 199,000 contracts, more than doubling the usual daily average. The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment was further underscored by an exceptionally low put/call ratio of 0.14, significantly below the typical level of approximately 0.22. Concurrently, EOSE's implied volatility (IV30) climbed by nearly 11 points to around 120.24, anticipating a daily price fluctuation of $1.08, reflecting the market's expectation of substantial movement.

This options frenzy did not emerge in a vacuum but was the culmination of several strategic developments and market catalysts. The most immediate and impactful event was the announcement on October 6, 2025, of a strategic partnership with Unico. This collaboration is poised to enhance Eos Energy's storage solutions, promising improved performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby acting as a powerful catalyst for positive market sentiment. Earlier in the year, EOSE had already garnered attention with its inclusion in the Russell 2500 Growth Index, effective June 30, 2025, following successful capital raises in early 2025, including a $75 million common stock offering and a $200 million convertible senior notes offering, which bolstered the company's financial position.

Despite mixed financial results—missing Q1 2025 revenue expectations in May and Q2 2025 revenue expectations in August, while reaffirming an ambitious full-year 2025 revenue outlook of $150M-$190M—the company highlighted substantial manufacturing expansions and operational resilience. The appointment of John Mahaz as COO in August 2025 was also viewed positively, aimed at streamlining operations and supply chain efficiency. While some share offerings and insider selling in late September/early October and May 2025 raised concerns about potential dilution, the overall market reaction to the Unico partnership demonstrated a strong focus on future growth prospects.

The initial market reaction on October 6, 2025, was unequivocally positive. Following the Unico partnership announcement and the heavy call options activity, EOSE's stock price surged, trading up $1.25 to reach $13.85 during the day, marking a 9.9% increase. By market close, the stock had climbed an impressive 18.2% to $14.89. Share trading volume also dramatically increased to 22,625,168 shares, significantly exceeding its average of 11,675,751. This robust performance indicates that investors are placing substantial bets on EOSE's ability to execute its growth strategy, leveraging new partnerships and operational improvements.

Winners and Losers: Implications for EOSE and the Energy Storage Sector

The unusually high options trading activity in Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) and its strategic partnership with Unico present a clear potential win for EOSE itself. The immediate surge in stock price and overwhelming bullish sentiment in the options market reflect increased investor confidence, which can translate into easier access to capital for future expansion and R&D. The Unico partnership, focused on enhancing Eos Energy's storage solutions, is expected to improve product performance and cost-effectiveness, strengthening EOSE's competitive edge in the rapidly expanding energy storage market. This could accelerate the company's journey towards profitability, allowing it to better leverage its zinc-air battery technology to meet the growing demand for long-duration energy storage. However, EOSE must navigate the delicate balance of capital raises and potential share dilution, which has previously caused investor apprehension, to fully capitalize on this newfound momentum.

For the broader energy storage sector, EOSE's recent developments could be a bellwether. If EOSE successfully integrates the Unico partnership and scales its manufacturing, it could validate zinc-based battery technology as a viable and cost-effective alternative to lithium-ion for grid-scale applications. This success could attract more investment into long-duration energy storage solutions, benefiting other companies developing similar or complementary technologies. Conversely, companies heavily invested in alternative long-duration storage chemistries might face increased competitive pressure if EOSE's solutions gain significant market share due to improved performance and cost.

The event also highlights the dynamic nature of the renewable energy infrastructure market, where technological advancements and strategic alliances can rapidly shift market perceptions and valuations. Companies that are agile in forming partnerships, innovating their products, and demonstrating a clear path to commercialization and scalability are likely to be the winners. Those that lag in innovation or struggle with operational execution might find themselves at a disadvantage, especially as capital flows towards perceived market leaders.

While the Unico partnership is a clear positive, the financial health of EOSE remains a critical factor. The company's mixed Q1 and Q2 2025 financial results, despite reaffirming ambitious annual guidance, underscore the challenges of scaling an emerging technology company. Sustained operational improvements, successful manufacturing ramp-up, and eventually, achieving consistent profitability, will be crucial for EOSE to convert speculative options activity into long-term shareholder value. The ability to manage costs effectively and deliver on large backlogs will determine if EOSE can solidify its position as a leader rather than just a high-potential player.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Energy Storage Landscape

The dramatic options activity surrounding Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) is more than just a company-specific event; it resonates with broader industry trends and the accelerating global transition to renewable energy. The increasing demand for grid-scale energy storage is a foundational trend, driven by the intermittency of renewable sources like solar and wind. EOSE's focus on zinc-air battery technology, designed for long-duration storage, positions it squarely within a critical segment of this market, where lithium-ion batteries often fall short in terms of cost-effectiveness for extended discharge periods. The market's bullish response to EOSE's strategic moves signals a growing recognition of the necessity and potential profitability of these long-duration solutions.

The ripple effects of EOSE's success or struggles could significantly influence investment and development across the energy storage ecosystem. If the Unico partnership proves successful in enhancing EOSE's offerings, it could spur further innovation and competition in zinc-based and other non-lithium battery chemistries. This could attract more venture capital and institutional investment into emerging storage technologies, potentially diversifying the market away from its current heavy reliance on lithium-ion. Competitors, both established giants and other startups, will be closely watching EOSE's execution, potentially adapting their own strategies to either compete directly or explore complementary niches. For instance, companies like Fluence Energy (NASDAQ: FLNC) or Stem (NYSE: STEM), while focusing on different aspects or technologies, might see increased market attention on the long-duration segment they also serve.

Regulatory and policy implications are also significant. Governments worldwide are implementing policies and incentives to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including energy storage. Breakthroughs and successful commercialization by companies like EOSE can influence future policy decisions, potentially leading to more favorable tax credits, grants, or mandates for specific types of energy storage that demonstrate superior performance or cost advantages. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, for example, already provides significant incentives for domestic clean energy manufacturing and deployment, which EOSE aims to leverage. A thriving domestic energy storage industry, bolstered by companies like EOSE, could further solidify national energy independence and security.

Historically, emerging technology sectors often experience periods of intense speculative interest, characterized by high options trading volumes and significant stock volatility. Comparisons can be drawn to early stages of the solar or electric vehicle industries, where companies with promising technologies saw rapid valuations, often preceding sustained profitability. While the underlying technology and market dynamics differ, the pattern of investor excitement driven by strategic partnerships and future growth potential, despite current financial challenges, is a common theme in disruptive industries. This suggests that while EOSE's current trajectory is exciting, it also carries the inherent risks associated with pioneering new technologies in a competitive landscape.

What Comes Next: Navigating Growth and Challenges

Looking ahead, the short-term focus for Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) will be on the successful integration of its strategic partnership with Unico and the tangible benefits it brings to product performance and cost. Investors will be closely monitoring upcoming earnings reports for evidence of improved financial metrics, particularly revenue growth and progress towards profitability, which remain critical hurdles. The company's ability to effectively scale its manufacturing operations and fulfill its substantial backlog will also be a key indicator of its operational execution in the coming months. Any delays or setbacks in these areas could temper the current bullish sentiment.

In the long term, EOSE's trajectory will depend on its capacity to sustain technological innovation, achieve economies of scale, and establish a dominant market position in long-duration energy storage. The energy storage market is fiercely competitive, with both established players and new entrants constantly vying for market share. EOSE must continue to differentiate its zinc-air battery technology through superior performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Potential strategic pivots might include expanding into new geographical markets, diversifying its product offerings, or forming additional partnerships to strengthen its supply chain and distribution networks.

Market opportunities that may emerge for EOSE include capitalizing on the accelerating retirement of fossil fuel power plants and the increasing need for grid stability solutions. The growing demand for industrial and commercial energy storage, alongside utility-scale projects, presents vast opportunities. However, challenges such as intense competition from other battery chemistries (e.g., flow batteries, solid-state batteries), raw material price volatility, and the continuous need for significant capital investment will persist. Regulatory shifts and geopolitical factors could also introduce new complexities.

Potential scenarios for EOSE range from becoming a leading provider of long-duration energy storage, consistently delivering innovative solutions and achieving sustained profitability, to facing ongoing financial pressures if operational execution falters or competition intensifies beyond expectations. A mid-ground scenario could see EOSE carving out a strong niche in specific applications or regions, becoming a key, albeit not dominant, player in the broader energy storage market. The next few quarters will be crucial in determining which path the company is likely to take.

2) Driving an Unbiased Dagger into our Hearts Claim: “EPA cannot prejudge the outcome of this reconsideration process.” EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Okay, sure.
Also, let’s be clear: climate change isn’t a religion.
It’s science.
As in, 99.9% of peer-reviewed studies agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity.","On July 28, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made a big announcement: the agency plans to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding. That might sound like something out of a Marvel movie, but it’s actually the cornerstone of U.S. climate policy. The Finding legally establishes that greenhouse gas emissions, from new motor vehicles, threaten public health and welfare. It gives the EPA the power to regulate these emissions not just from cars, but from power plants, factories, and other major pollution sources.

Without it? The EPA’s hands are tied when it comes to regulating emissions. This move raises eyebrows and questions, and the agency released a one-pager explaining their decision. We read it. We checked it. Here’s our fact check of their one pager HERE and here’s the highlights:

1) Making it Easy… or Not?

EPA Claim: “Through this reconsideration, EPA will give the public a chance to weigh in on the science, law, and policy choices at issue in the Finding”.

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: While the EPA says it’s opening the floor to debate, the federal government is cutting off the tools that make public comment more accessible; specifically, the API (Application Programming Interface) that allows people to submit comments through third-party platforms instead of directly through their Regulations.gov website.

In other words, yes, you can weigh in, but only if you go through the official portal, which many grassroots campaigns and advocacy orgs can’t easily access anymore. So it’s like being told you can speak… but only if you do it exactly the way they want.

2) Driving an Unbiased Dagger into our Hearts

Claim: “EPA cannot prejudge the outcome of this reconsideration process.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Okay, sure. But if the EPA isn’t prejudiced, why did Administrator Zeldin recently declare: “”We are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion…” That’s not exactly a “wait and see” kind of comment. That is clearly a judgment. Also, let’s be clear: climate change isn’t a religion. It’s science. Hard science. As in, 99.9% of peer-reviewed studies agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity.

3) What is the Endangerment Finding & Why Does it Matter?

Claim: “The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the first step in the Obama-Biden Administration’s overreaching climate agenda… That evasion ends today.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Let’s unpack this one, because it’s doing a lot of heavy lifting.The claim here is that the Endangerment Finding kicked off, “trillions of dollars of cost on Americans” and by rescinding it we will save $54 billion in costs annually. Funny how Zeldin doesn’t mention the real price tag Americans are paying: climate change-linked illnesses, death, and pollution-related diseases have been know for over a decade and some studies estimate they will cost the U.S. over $820 billion annually.

Also, those 2027 vehicle emissions standards the EPA now wants to reverse? They were projected to prevent 7.2 billion tons of CO₂ through 2055; that’s four times what the entire U.S. transportation sector emitted in 2021.

4) Duty to Regulate

Claim: “Massachusetts vs. EPA, held that the Clean Air Act’s general, Act-wide definition of “air pollutant” was broad enough to include carbon dioxide. Massachusetts explicitly did not hold that EPA was required to regulate these emissions from these sources.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: The 2007 Supreme Court ruling was very clear: greenhouse gases, such as excess carbon dioxide, are “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act. That means the EPA has a duty to regulate them unless it can show they DO NOT endanger public health or welfare. So unless Zeldin has some groundbreaking scientific discovery to share (spoiler: he doesn’t), the law still stands. The EPA still has a legal obligation to act.

5) By the Books

Claim: “The Endangerment Finding took an unorthodox approach… It never makes a straight-line conclusion that carbon dioxide from new motor vehicles is causing endangerment. It looked at this mix of six gases, from all sources over the world, … to determine that this mix contributed … an unknown amount above zero to climate change, and that climate change contributed … an unknown amount above zero of endangerment to public health. The Finding looked at U.S. vehicle emissions … and said that they were a big enough piece of the pie (some 4 percent of global emissions) to be “causing or contributing” to the mix of six gases—not to the endangerment itself.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: This one reads like a climate denialist word salad, but let’s chop it up. The EPA’s original Finding didn’t go rogue. It followed the law, the science, and the courts. It reviewed research from the International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and U.S. agencies to conclude, based on overwhelming scientific evidence, six key greenhouse gases (CO₂, methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, PFCs, SF₆) collectively contribute to climate change.

Cars emit several of these, the most significant being carbon dioxide. That’s enough under the Clean Air Act. The law doesn’t require proof of direct causation by U.S. cars alone, just a finding that their emissions contribute to the problem. Which they very much do; in 2022, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. came from the transportation sector, the vast majority of which were from cars and truck emissions.

This whole “unorthodox” claim of government overreach is like saying a seatbelt is illegal because it wasn’t designed to stop every car accident. It’s just not how the law, or logic, works.

6) Massachusetts Still Stands

Claim: “These legal issues require fresh scrutiny, particularly in light of major Supreme Court cases… and new developments in science and technology.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Here’s where the EPA throws some legal spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. They cite recent Supreme Court cases, none of which overturn Massachusetts v. EPA.

Loper Bright Enterprises et al. (Loper) overturned the Chevron deference, which used to let agencies like the EPA interpret unclear laws, but not Massachusetts as the case clearly gives the EPA authority to regulate emissions.

West Virginia v. EPA didn’t question whether the EPA can regulate emissions; instead, it said the EPA went too far by trying to shift the entire power industry from coal to cleaner energy without clear permission from Congress. So while the majority in West Virginia may have been skeptical of Massachusetts they did not overrule it.

Also, is Administrator Zeldin seriously claiming that “new science” or “new technology” means we have to reconsider whether greenhouse gases are dangerous? That’s like arguing a better thermometer means we should rethink whether fire is hot.

In fact, the latest science only makes the case for greenhouse gases being the cause of climate change stronger. We’ve seen the impacts firsthand. The climate crisis is no longer hypothetical, it’s happening in real time. So using “technological progress” as an excuse to scrap foundational climate protections isn’t just misleading – it’s backward.

This so-called “reconsideration” of the Endangerment Finding isn’t about science. The Finding has been upheld, reaffirmed, and scientifically validated. What’s changed isn’t the evidence – it’s the EPA’s leadership. Want to make a difference?

Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50% market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives.","WASHINGTON — The electric vehicle and renewable energy industries are bracing for the end of tax credits they had been relying on to rapidly expand the technologies across the U.S.

The phaseout, brought on by the 2025 reconciliation law, hit the EV industry last week with the end of the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit last week he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5% after the tax credit ends from around 10% to 12% now.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller — way smaller than we thought — especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said. “We’re going to find out in a month.”

The tax credit rollback comes on top of the Trump administration’s revamp of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program created by the 2021 infrastructure law. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy suspended the program in February, citing wasteful spending, and later relaunched with pared down standards.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy said in a statement.

In an attempt to soften the blow, automakers Ford and General Motors Co. have plans to use their financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory, allowing the lending arms to qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.

Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and John Barrasso of Wyoming criticized the car companies’ plans, calling on the Treasury to close the automakers’ “loophole” and saying the plans are a “serious violation of Congressional intent.”

“These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off,” they wrote in a letter to the Treasury last week. “[IRS] guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.”

Despite automakers’ efforts to soften the hits to the EV industry, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an interview that the combination of the tax credit phaseout and rollback of other federal programs aimed at boosting battery manufacturing and production fares poorly for the industry.

Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50% market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives. Now, she estimates it will be capped at 30%.

“It looks like the [auto] companies are going deeper into subprime, and that’s always an indication that sales in general are slowing … and they’re looking to keep the sales pace at a rate that allows them to maybe snowplow a little bit on total revenue,” she said. “We’ve seen several announcements now that these companies are delaying the product cycle for EVs.”

Renewables on deck

The 2025 reconciliation law also put new restrictions on renewable energy production and investment tax credits implemented under a 2022 reconciliation law, moving the timeline to qualify up by several years. Previously, projects needed to begin construction by the end of 2032. Now they must do so by July 4, 2026, or be completed by the end of 2027, to take advantage of the federal support.

“This is an extremely tumultuous time,” said Bonnie Angermeier, senior legislative associate for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “There were promises made by the federal government, and there were strong signals for how they were going to support clean energy development.”

“Essentially, the rug got ripped out from under the clean energy industry,” she added.

Projects able to start construction before next July maintain eligibility for the credits for up to four years, Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said. SEIA is the national trade organization representing the solar and battery storage industry.

“The most advantageous position to be in right now is to qualify for that start of construction provision,” Gallagher said. “Companies that can’t qualify for that start of construction — they’ve got to get those projects online by the end of 2027, and so people are working hard to do that.”

Angermeier agreed, noting that companies focused on residential solar are at an even greater disadvantage.

“They have their pedal to the metal trying to complete projects as quickly as possible because they know that the window of that tax credit closes at the end of this year, which was highly unexpected and puts a ton of pressure on them,” she said.

She noted that the changes are “really throwing a wrench” into utility-scale projects as well, which generally rely on longer timelines to move from planning to completion. Some of those have been canceled as a result of the timeline shift, she added.

A solar markets report from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data and analytics for the renewables, energy and natural resources sectors, found that forecasts of new solar deployment through 2030 could be reduced by as much as 55 gigawatts as a result of federal policy changes this year.

Additional grant funding rescissions have also hit the industry hard as billions of dollars of previously allocated funds have been rescinded by the EPA, Department of Energy and other agencies, sometimes after they had already been dispersed.

Angermeier said the changes taken together have led to project cancellations, pauses, layoffs and the cancellation of new jobs that would have come with planned projects.

“We’re going to see a real restriction of new energy supply as a result of both the [reconciliation] bill and the and the administration’s action since the bill was enacted,” Gallagher said. “And of course, we’re seeing this restriction of new supply at a time when energy demand is booming.”

Wind and solar power have recently been among the fastest growing forms of new generation in the U.S., according to an August report from the Energy Information Administration.

While renewables are expected to account for much of the new generation forecast over the next two years, Gallagher said, “the outlook becomes a little bit hazier when you get out to ‘28 and ‘29.”

Even so, he’s not expecting a long-term chilling effect on the industry, because of continued market demand for renewable energy.

The Trump administration says it doesn’t take issue with renewable energy technologies, but with federal subsidies for them.

“Thirty-three years we’ve subsidized wind and solar power in the United States,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a late September press conference. “If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places.”

Wright and other officials say the administration prefers dense, baseload power that they say can respond to increasing energy demand. Wind and solar struggle with intermittency issues and are therefore less reliable than sources of power like natural gas, coal and nuclear energy, they say.

But supporters of renewable energy call that “hypocritical,” noting federal support for oil and gas projects. Renewables subsidies are “really more about creating an even playing field so that we can meet the demand that we have,” Angermeier said.

Gallagher called the administration’s arguments about reliability “tired,” citing the buildout of battery storage to support solar power.

“It was never really a legitimate criticism,” he said. “And it’s all the less so when we have energy storage that can deliver power reliably when the system needs it.”

‘The view from 200 years of history’ Nothing about the story of America’s public lands was inevitable, as Leshy makes clear.
That is partially because America’s public lands are — and have long been — very, very popular, he explains.
But overall Trump is zealously promoting drilling, mining, and logging on many public lands, he says.
Politics are not the only threat to public lands, Leshy cautions: “Climate change is altering how public lands are managed, bringing more species into jeopardy, changing how we manage forests for wildfire, and more — all with uncertain outcomes.","Last June, when United States Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, introduced a provision to sell millions of acres of public lands as part of the domestic policy package known as the “big, beautiful bill,” he might have anticipated pushback from environmentalists opposed to the plan.

Instead, some of the loudest critiques came from self-professed political conservatives — avid outdoorsmen who feared losing access to cherished grounds for hunting, fishing, and camping. Lee, who eventually abandoned the idea, may have been taken aback by the widespread resistance.

But not John Leshy ’69.

“Opinion polls bear this out, time and again: People love public lands,” Leshy says.

He would know. He has spent his life protecting and advocating for the more than 640 million acres of federally owned land in the U.S., first as an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in the 1970s, then as a top attorney at the Department of the Interior during the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and as a law professor and academic. In a 2022 volume, “Our Common Ground: A History of America’s Public Lands,” Leshy, who is now a professor emeritus at UC Law San Francisco, tells the comprehensive story of how this shared resource came to be.

Today, the U.S. government owns more than a quarter of the nation’s total land area, which is managed by four agencies: the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, and National Park Service. From coast to coast, Alaska to Hawaii, this land contains some of the most stunning sights on earth: lakes and rivers, the tallest trees in the world, active volcanoes, caves, canyons, petrified forests, glaciers, and countless types of flora and fauna. Depending on the level of protection granted, some areas are also used for energy production, livestock grazing, or other kinds of resource extraction.

Beyond their sheer size, what makes the nation’s public lands particularly unique, Leshy says, is how accessible they are. “These lands benefit America and humanity in many ways. Generally open to all, for the most part today they are managed primarily for conservation, recreation, inspiration, and education. Every year they offer hundreds of millions of people life-changing encounters with nature, as well as activities that furnish an economic anchor for many communities.”

What Leshy’s book and career make clear is that the existence of America’s public lands is no accident — and it will take ongoing vigilance to ensure that they endure for generations to come.

“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution says we must have public lands. All it takes is an ordinary act of Congress to transfer every last acre out of U.S. ownership, even iconic treasures like the Everglades or Yellowstone,” says Leshy, who received the Harvard Environmental Law Society’s Horizon Award this year. “Each new generation must decide what it wants to do with its public lands.”

‘It pushed all of my buttons’

Leshy’s career began as something of a happy accident. Growing up in rural Appalachia, he spent a lot of time outdoors as a child, but environmental law was never on his mind. In fact, the field didn’t even exist when he was a student at Harvard Law School in the late 1960s, he says.

As a newly minted attorney, Leshy first went to work at the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, focusing on school desegregation cases. Three years later, having long dreamt of living in California, Leshy asked his best friend from law school if he might have any leads on a position there. By chance, the friend connected him with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Leshy helped them open their Western office and discovered his passion — advocating for public lands.

“It pushed all of my buttons,” he says. “It was nature, it was politics, it was interesting law, it was American history,” he says. “When I fell into it, I just decided that this was what I’d like to do with my life.”

Over the next three decades, Leshy worked on or led several historic efforts that expanded federally protected lands by hundreds of millions of acres. In 1977, he joined the Department of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, where he was part of the effort that produced a landmark law that safeguarded 150 million acres of pristine Alaska wilderness, more than doubling the size of the National Park System and tripling the size of the National Wildlife Refuge System.

Later, as the top attorney under Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt ’65 during Bill Clinton’s administration, Leshy oversaw a groundbreaking endeavor to use the Antiquities Act of 1906 — which gives the president the authority to create new national monuments — to expand protections on more than 5.5 million acres of Bureau of Land Management territory.

It was the first time the bureau had been given the responsibility to manage national monuments, which was, Leshy says, “a really important step because it manages the most land of the four major agencies, and this initiative laid the groundwork for future presidents to do the same,” such as Barack Obama ’91.

‘The view from 200 years of history’

Nothing about the story of America’s public lands was inevitable, as Leshy makes clear. “The breadth and character of this national asset are remarkable, considering that respect for private property and a distrust of government, particularly the national government, are baked into American culture and politics.”

Yet, from Ulysses S. Grant’s signing into law the establishment of the world’s first national park at Yellowstone, to Theodore Roosevelt’s vast expansion of publicly protected lands, to Richard Nixon’s signing of the law that created the Environmental Protection Agency, to the actions of Presidents Carter, Clinton, Bush, and Obama, American history is replete with stories of leaders and grassroots advocates from both parties acting to expand or protect this incredible resource, Leshy says.

That is partially because America’s public lands are — and have long been — very, very popular, he explains. “The view from 200 years of history shows the political system working the way it’s supposed to. It produced something the American public overwhelmingly supports.”

Leshy acknowledges that balancing demands for conflicting uses of public lands can be challenging, but he also says that there are ways of achieving these aims strategically without abandoning what makes America’s system special. “Resource extraction can be appropriate on some public lands, and existing law allows the Interior [Department] to sell or transfer parcels of land to state or local governments for various purposes such as affordable housing. That can be and has been done successfully in a small and measured way,” he says.

But in Leshy’s view, recent proposals to sell off large portions of federal lands are akin to “taking a meat cleaver” to the system. President Donald Trump has so far in this term not reduced the size of some national monuments, as he did in his first term, Leshy says, and also did not openly support Sen. Lee’s sales proposal. This, Leshy suggests, may mean Trump is paying some attention to opinion polls showing national monuments’ wide popularity. But overall Trump is zealously promoting drilling, mining, and logging on many public lands, he says. Some in the Trump administration, Leshy believes, are bent on disabling the agencies to try to convince the public that the federal government simply cannot manage the lands and therefore they ought to be transferred out of federal hands.

Politics are not the only threat to public lands, Leshy cautions: “Climate change is altering how public lands are managed, bringing more species into jeopardy, changing how we manage forests for wildfire, and more — all with uncertain outcomes. This is made worse because the Trump administration is hostile to the very idea that climate change is a serious challenge.”

A political success story

To Leshy, a career spent defending and expanding America’s public lands has been personally and professionally gratifying. But it has also helped illuminate an important American political success story that deserves more attention, he says.

“The vast majority of Americans love the fact that we’ve kept these lands, that they’re open to all, and are protected for future generations to enjoy,” he says. “It’s a ‘small d’ democratic thing, and I think that’s an important message, especially in these divisive times.”

Put plainly, he says, it shows that government can work. “There’s so much cynicism about Washington, D.C., and about how our political system is dysfunctional,” he says. “Of course, our government, like all human undertakings, has its flaws, but if we’re going to survive as a society, the political system needs to work. And the public lands show that it can produce a result people revere.”

Americans need to play their part for this success to be maintained, Leshy says. “Cynicism and apathy will change nothing. It is more important than ever for rising generations to engage with the political system that will determine their future, and that includes the future of the public lands.”",https://hls.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JohnLeshyB01-topaz-denoise-sharpen-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:05:23.804020

Millions of households now endure more frequent and prolonged blackouts — disruptions that leave families without lights, refrigerated medication or internet access when they need it most. In response, more homeowners are turning to whole-home battery backup systems as a resilient, sustainable and cost-effective solution.

When wildfires ravaged Southern California earlier this year, Jason Bulquerin's neighborhood was plunged into darkness. He was safely away from the burning regions, but transmission lines delivering power to his area were destroyed by one of multiple fires tearing through Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and other parts of Los Angeles County miles away.

Despite this, the lights never dimmed at Bulquerin's home even as it took days for utility crews to restore service. That's because Bulquerin is among a growing number of Americans using the latest in battery technology to power lights, appliances and entire homes during blackouts due to grid instability and increasingly unpredictable weather, EcoFlow reports.

Why Blackouts Are Here to Stay: From Extreme Weather to Overloaded Grids

Extreme weather is no longer ""extreme."" NOAA forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, and power outages are expected to increase dramatically, with 13 to 19 named storms. Out of those, three to five could be major hurricanes. These aren't isolated events. In 2024, there were 27 confirmed disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to hit the U.S.

Compounding the problem is a power grid weakened by decades of neglect. Federal projections warn that without a major investment in energy infrastructure, power outage hours could rise 100-fold by 2030.

Making matters worse, demand is exploding — driven by AI data centers that guzzle electricity, electric vehicles plugging in by the millions and smart homes that never stop drawing power. AI alone could double U.S. electric demand by 2030, pushing an already overstretched system to the brink. The Electric Power Research Institute reports that data centers could consume 9% of the nation's electricity by 2030 — double their current usage.

What Are Whole-Home Battery Systems? Breaking Down the Technology

At their core, whole-home battery systems are simple: They store electricity (either from the grid or solar panels) and release it when the grid fails. But unlike the noisy, gas-guzzling generators of the past, they’re clean, quiet and nearly maintenance-free. When an outage hits, they switch on automatically, so you might not even notice the grid went down.

Today's systems come in three principal schemes, each tailored to different needs:

Modular, portable systems. These are ""build-as-you-go"" solutions. Start small, powering only essentials (fridge, lights, medical devices) and plugging devices directly to portable batteries. You can add more battery capacity later if you want to cover your whole home.

Panel-integrated systems. These tie directly into your home's electrical panel, so you can pick which circuits to prioritize and track energy use in real time via an app. No more tangled extension cords — just seamless power when you need it.

Solar-plus-storage system. Pair a battery with solar panels on your rooftop, backyard, or balcony, and you’re not just preparing for outages — you’re cutting your monthly bills, too. The solar panels charge the battery with free, renewable energy during the day, so you can use that power instead of buying from the grid.

Industry and government data shows how fast this shift is happening. The share of new residential solar installations including battery storage more than doubled in 2024, from less than 12% in 2023 to 28%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And in wildfire-prone California, the U.S. government reports the rate is even higher at over half as of last year, which includes 40,000 new systems installed between 2023 and 2024.

More homeowners are turning to whole-home battery backup systems to ensure they have access to power during emergencies. While some backup systems don't require an associated rooftop solar system, many buyers pair battery and solar in order to maximize both their solar investments and their backup power duration.

Getting Word Out While Responding to Disaster

Whole-home systems aren't just protecting individual families — they're also making communities more resilient. Nonprofits that lead disaster response are teaming up with tech companies to turn these batteries into tools for collective preparedness and recovery.

Footprint Project, a New Orleans-based nonprofit focused on building disaster resiliency and response to weather events with green energy solutions, partnered with companies like EcoFlow to upgrade emergency response trailers from local fire departments with batteries and solar panels. These trailers can now roll into fire zones in California and hurricane-hit areas of North Carolina to power rescue tools and communications equipment.

In Canada, the Alberta Lions Emergency Response Team (A.L.E.R.T.), is also equipping itself with donated products to power microgrids for rescue and recovery operations.

Battery Systems are a Greener, Cleaner Alternative to Backup Generators

While fuel-burning generators have been traditionally used for power backup during emergencies, battery systems provide a cleaner, quieter solution. Smaller portable batteries can also be used in apartments and condos, whose tenants often cannot accommodate a generator. New products are also coming online to serve homeowners in need of whole-home load handling and flexible capacity systems.

Bulquerin, the California homeowner, said that since experiencing the extended outage during this year's wildfires, his neighbors have been looking to install backup batteries, including residents new to backup power or those wanting to upgrade from gas.",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/09/29/ecoflow-beyond-the-generator.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:06:07.829271

The 47-page complaint submitted in the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island centers on the ramifications of the yanked Solar for All grants for solar panel installation companies, labor unions, homeowners and nonprofit advocates.

“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities Congress intended these funds to benefit,” the complaint states.

The lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government and the Conservation Law Foundation, comes more than two months after the EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program. Originally included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act approved under the Biden administration, the $7 billion program aimed to help low- and moderate-income homeowners and renters access the benefits of solar panels — often too expensive or unfeasible otherwise — while advancing renewable energy use and creating jobs.

Funding was distributed in 2024 to state and local governments, nonprofits and tribal organizations nationwide, including a $49.3 million award to Rhode Island through the state’s Office of Energy Resources.

Rhode Island had spent $89,000 of its share — on employee costs for administration preparation — when the money was clawed back, Christopher Kearns, acting energy commissioner, said in an email Monday.

But development work was well underway, with the state agency in tandem with labor leaders and nonprofit partners intent on maximizing the benefits of its federal windfall. The five-year program was projected to help 900,000 households nationwide save $350 million annually on their energy bills while creating 200,000 new jobs and workforce training programs, according to estimates from the Biden administration.

RI AFL-CIO leads the charge

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO, which represents 80,000 union workers in Rhode Island, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Union leaders helped Rhode Island plan and submit its application to the EPA seeking funding through the program, simultaneously creating and boosting workforce training and apprenticeship programs to prepare for the frenzy of new solar panel installations.

“Because of the requirement for prevailing wages and utilization of apprentices, the hope was that this would end up going to union contractors because we already pay prevailing wages and we always have professional apprenticeships in place,” Patrick Crowley, RI AFL-CIO president, said in an interview Monday.

Meanwhile, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm, increased its staff by 20% — from eight to 10 attorneys — to focus on the state regulations governing solar energy and utilities in preparation for the federal grant, said Jennifer Wood, the center’s executive director.

The Center for Justice is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with a Georgia homeowner who had already applied for a free solar installation, and several businesses and nonprofits involved in solar panel installation, financing and education.

None of the plaintiffs were direct recipients of the Solar for All grants, but all stood to benefit from the funds awarded — and are now “significantly harmed” by the funding termination, the lawsuit states.

“By not having this program, it’s a lost opportunity for hundreds of jobs,” Crowley said.

Kearns, with Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Access issues

Wood lamented the time and resources spent training two new attorneys on the complexities of state utility proceedings that govern the incentives for and implementation of solar energy in Rhode Island. More consequential, though, was the loss for low-income Rhode Island residents already struggling to afford rising energy bills and unlikely to reap benefits of solar energy without the federal aid.

“There are a lot of questions around solar, how it gets implemented, how the infrastructure works, but for our clients, the question is, can they even get access to it at all?” Wood said. “Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”

The Trump administration’s opposition to renewable energy was clear on the campaign trail, and cemented as soon as he took office: halting offshore wind projects, yanking electric vehicle incentives, and freezing access to federal grants and loans for energy efficiency programs and solar panels, among others.

Federal budget cuts signed into law on July 4 canceled $16 billion of clean energy and emissions reductions incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, a move affirmed by an appeals court in D.C. on Oct. 1. But the federal budget cuts only applied to funds not already committed to specific projects or recipients – suggesting the Solar for All funding was preserved, according to the lawsuit.

It alleges that Zeldin ignored the congressional directive and its “unambiguous text” when he announced in a social media video on Aug. 7 that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program — violating the Administrative Procedures Act as well as constitutional protections for legislative authority.

The move drew swift condemnation from Democrats in Congress, including Rhode Island U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Gov. Dan McKee also denounced the news, accusing the Trump administration of “trying to undermine programs that support Rhode Island families” in a statement on Aug. 12.

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” Amy R. Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, said in a statement Monday. “The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

The complaint asks a federal judge to force the federal administration to restore funding for the program, and declare its termination unlawful.

A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in an emailed response on Monday.

The Department of Energy projects that electricity demand from U.S. data centers could triple by 2028, reaching up to 12% of our total U.S. electricity consumption. That growth is already showing up in utility forecasts, interconnection queues, power procurement contracts, and energy prices.

President Trump’s executive orders recognize this challenge and underscore a bold commitment to securing America’s leadership in AI and energy dominance. Delivering on the President’s mandate demands an all-of-the above energy strategy that deploys gigawatts of electrons quickly and builds on U.S. manufacturing supply chains. This is where American-made solar comes in.

In the past few years, the U.S. has reshored a domestic solar supply chain uniquely positioned to meet this moment. We can manufacture over 50 GW – roughly 50 nuclear power plants worth – of American made solar modules each year and the upstream segments of the supply chain are quickly scaling. American-made solar and storage is being used to power the next generation of AI, all while supporting over 40,000 American solar manufacturing workers.

American Made Solar Delivers Speed at Low Costs for Ratepayers

The timelines for AI energy buildouts are measured in quarters, not years. Long permitting and interconnection delays and supply chain bottlenecks are forecasted to delay the use of other generation sources. Utility-scale solar and storage projects can quickly come online in one to two years. AI data center business models depend on speed, and that energy deployment advantage is decisive. Utilities, energy developers, and industry analysts across the board have pointed to utility-scale solar and storage, combined with natural gas, as the near-term solution for meeting AI’s energy needs.

American Made Solar in the AI Pipeline

The deployment of solar from major utilities speaks for itself. Dominion Energy, the utility that serves Northern Virginia’s huge data center market, in its 2024 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) projects 6 GW of gas, alongside 12 GW of solar, 6 GW of offshore wind, and 4.5 GW of storage by 2039. Other major integrated utilities like Georgia Power and Duke Energy are taking a similar portfolio approach, with solar in the lead. The Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is deploying energy to the grid at a significantly higher rate than other markets, led by American made solar deployment. In the past two years, ERCOT decreased prices and increased reliability as it deployed massive amounts of American-made solar. As of January 2025, 28 GW of gas, 38 GW of wind, 153 GW of solar, and 165 GW of storage are active in ERCOT’s interconnection queue.

In its September 30, 2025 forecast (below), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) forecasts 92.6 GW of “high probability additions” solar will come online through July 2028, over four times that of any other resource:

All of the U.S. AI giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI are building out hyperscale facilities with solar. Two examples of U.S. solar manufacturing providing this energy for AI are instructive:

First Solar and the Orion Project

One of the clearest examples of what’s possible with American-made solar is the Orion Solar Belt in Buckholts, Texas. At around 900 MW, Orion is one of the largest solar projects in the country, and it’s designed to power Google’s growing data center operations in Texas. The project used First Solar’s U.S.-manufactured thin-film modules produced in Ohio, domestic steel, and American-made tracking systems. It is among the first large-scale energy projects to source all major components from within the U.S., demonstrating that America can deliver the scale, speed, and reliability that next-generation infrastructure requires.

And Orion is not an isolated case. First Solar’s customers are increasingly pivotal in ensuring that the surge in U.S. data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, can be matched by equally reliable U.S. energy supply. These are exactly the kind of projects that show how energy dominance and AI dominance go hand-in-hand.

Qcells and Meta’s Long-Term Supply Agreemen

In 2020, Qcells celebrated the commissioning of the 102.5 MW Bancroft Station Solar Farm in Georgia, developed to support Facebook’s Newton County data center. The project used more than 350,000 modules, manufactured at Qcells’ facility in Georgia, one of the largest solar manufacturing plants in the Western Hemisphere. In addition, Qcells is soon opening ingot, wafer, and cell lines in Georgia. For Facebook, and its parent company Meta, this partnership has always been about delivery certainty. With major data campuses coming online across the South and Midwest, Meta needed a supplier capable of producing large volumes of product in the U.S. States, on a predictable timeline, without the logistical challenges of overseas sourcing.

SEMA Members Are Built for Scale

First Solar, Qcells, and other Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition members are not just building solar components. They are building the bridge energy needed to support the AI energy demand and American energy dominance. This all supports good-paying American manufacturing careers, not just short-term construction jobs, from Louisiana to Ohio and Michigan to Georgia.

The future of American AI dominance depends on whether the country can build and deliver enough energy infrastructure to support it. That means embracing every tool that we have —and works fast. U.S.-made solar is one of the few tools that can be built fast enough and deployed widely enough to keep pace with this growth. This moment calls for clarity and coordination. If the U.S. wants to lead in AI, it must also lead in energy manufacturing, and that means not picking winners or losers. The tools are here, more factories are opening, and solar manufacturers are hiring. The question is whether America will seize the opportunity.",,N,,2025-10-06 22:00:42.264340

Tesla Inc. has once again captured the attention of investors with its third-quarter 2025 production and delivery figures, marking a significant rebound from earlier setbacks this year. The electric-vehicle giant reported delivering over 497,000 vehicles, surpassing Wall Street expectations and setting a new company record. This surge was largely fueled by a rush of U.S. consumers eager to capitalize on a $7,500 federal tax credit before its expiration, as highlighted in a recent analysis by CNBC. Production numbers also impressed, with more than 447,000 vehicles rolling off assembly lines, while energy storage deployments hit an all-time high of 12.5 gigawatt-hours.

Beyond the headline numbers, Tesla’s performance underscores its dominance in the EV market, even as competition intensifies from legacy automakers and newcomers alike. The company’s mass-market models, such as the Model 3 and Model Y, accounted for the bulk of deliveries, demonstrating sustained demand despite economic headwinds. Investors reacted positively, with Tesla’s stock climbing in after-hours trading following the announcement, reflecting renewed confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.

The Catch: Sustainability of the Surge

However, this stellar quarter comes with a notable caveat: the boost may prove temporary. Analysts point out that the expiring tax incentive created an artificial pull-forward of demand, potentially leaving a void in the fourth quarter. As noted in a detailed report from The Motley Fool, while the deliveries represent fantastic news for shareholders, the underlying trends suggest caution. Tesla’s year-to-date deliveries are still down compared to 2024, and without similar incentives, maintaining this momentum could be challenging.

Moreover, external factors like weakening European sales and increased rivalry from lower-cost Chinese EVs add layers of complexity. Tesla’s energy division, however, offers a bright spot, with record deployments signaling strong growth in battery storage solutions for utilities and homes. This diversification could buffer against automotive volatility, but it remains a smaller revenue slice for now.

Investor Implications and Future Outlook

For industry insiders, these results prompt a deeper examination of Tesla’s strategic pivots. The company is betting big on autonomous driving and robotics, with upcoming reveals like the Cybercab robotaxi expected to drive long-term value. Yet, as Reuters reports, analysts anticipate the tax credit’s end to usher in a period of slower growth, with European weakness persisting into 2026.

Tesla’s ability to innovate and scale production will be key. CEO Elon Musk has emphasized cost reductions and efficiency gains, which could help mitigate demand fluctuations. Still, the quarter’s success, while impressive, highlights the fragility of relying on policy-driven sales spikes.

Broadening Horizons Beyond Vehicles

Shifting focus, Tesla’s energy storage achievements deserve equal scrutiny. The 12.5 GWh deployment not only sets a record but also positions the company as a leader in renewable energy integration. This segment grew robustly, outpacing vehicle delivery growth and contributing meaningfully to overall revenue, according to data from Tesla’s Investor Relations press release.

As global energy transitions accelerate, Tesla’s Megapack and Powerwall products could become pivotal. Insiders note that partnerships with utilities are expanding, potentially insulating the firm from EV market cycles.

Navigating Challenges Ahead

Despite the positives, challenges loom. Tesla faces regulatory scrutiny, supply chain disruptions, and macroeconomic uncertainties that could dampen consumer spending. The company’s stock, up 75% over the past year per Nasdaq insights, reflects optimism around future tech like Optimus robots, but near-term delivery trends will test investor patience.

In summary, Tesla’s Q3 triumph is a mixed bag—celebratory yet cautionary. For investors, it’s a reminder that while short-term wins boost sentiment, sustainable growth hinges on innovation and adaptability in a competitive arena. As the company prepares for its next earnings call, all eyes will be on guidance for the quarters ahead, where the true test of resilience awaits.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-a871ab5b-10c2-4c5f-91a1-1a6ff436be1e.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 20:01:58.739243

This 1978 quote attributed to cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world: indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has,” serves as a ‘north star’ for SACE’s work. Mead is describing what I call a catalytic community, people with passion and vision working together to change their world for the better.

SACE is a catalytic community: a community of people drawn to a vision infused with passion – that people can shape their future by changing the most fundamental choice a society makes: how we produce and consume energy. We refuse to leave this fundamental choice to major corporations that readily sacrifice our long-term health and well-being for short-term financial profit.

The Early Days: Activists Laying the Groundwork

In the late 1970s, a small group of dedicated individuals in East Tennessee came together to challenge the nation’s largest public power utility, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), to listen to and be responsive to the people they serve. Calling themselves the Tennessee Valley Energy Coalition (TVEC), everyday citizens began organizing to speak truth to power. In the mid-1980s, TVA was a massive bureaucracy struggling to find a mission. Having tamed the Tennessee River, built an expansive electric power system, and ridden the growth of the midsouth, TVA had overbuilt its nuclear power program and was facing serious rate hikes on its power customers.

TVA’s massive size bred arrogance. TVEC empowered the public to hold TVA accountable to its public power mission. In 1985, TVEC gained official 501(c)3 status, laying the foundation upon which, over the next four decades, and with the work of many important players, we would eventually build the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

For Four Decades, We’ve Been Fiercely Committed to One Mission…

In the 1990s, TVEC was renamed the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition (TVERC) with a focus on reforming TVA planning and power choices. We successfully advocated for TVA to conduct public planning in the form of an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) that forced the utility’s planning assumptions and internal biases into the open. We have activists and passionate advocates who, in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, laid the groundwork for us to build upon.

Becoming SACE: Expanding Our Geography and Focus

Understanding and engaging utility planning upstream, before decisions harden and become virtually impossible to stop, has become and remains core to our mission. Climate policy, clean air advocacy, and promoting renewable energy became central to our mission in the 1990s.

In 1999, TVERC expanded its footprint beyond the TVA region and became the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), joining forces with other regional groups. Together, we demanded controls on air pollution that was endangering people’s health and threatening treasured places across our region while also promoting clean, renewable energy choices.

From TVA to the Southeast’s Fossil Fuel Industry

From the forested Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, our parks and beaches are diminished by electric power generated from fossil fuels, and our precious places are in peril. From cradle to grave, these fuels — coal, oil, and methane gas — have scarred our lands. Two of the largest fossil fuel industrial disasters in history have happened in our region: the massive coal ash spill at TVA’s Kingston, Tennessee, Fossil Plant in 2008, and the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster of 2010 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. These catastrophes took a significant toll on our people and the environment.

That same year, SACE celebrated its 25th anniversary, continuing our commitment to building a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment for everyone in our region.

SACE’s pioneering work in the late 1990s and early 2000s set the stage for growing clean, renewable energy, such as solar, wind, energy efficiency, and electrification technologies to counter these negative impacts from fossil fuels. We first worked with utilities to offer customers a clean, renewable energy choice (even if the customers had to pay a little extra for it in the form of utility green power pricing programs), and later moved to forcing those same utilities to recognize that solar, wind, and storage are the lowest-cost electric power generating choices and the cleanest and safest to deploy.

Going ‘All In’ On Electric Transportation

As we placed serious pressure on utilities to lower their carbon emissions and adapted our advocacy again, it became clear that transportation and mobility emissions would surpass utility emissions, which they did in 2016. After working on sustainably produced biodiesel, SACE went ‘all in’ on electric transportation and pushed utilities to produce clean, renewable energy for the grid, enabling electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce their emissions.

SACE has become a leading voice for expanding electric mobility options to all populations across our region. Today, our Electrify the South campaign is a leader in education and outreach, bringing folks together to gain real experience with electric vehicles through “ride and drives” and basic EV education. We have collaborated with local governments to secure electric school buses, thereby protecting children, while also partnering with utilities and local and state governments to prepare their infrastructure for the transition to electric mobility.

Standing On the Shoulders of Those Who Came Before Us

I must highlight the amazing people I have been blessed to work with and who have been the cornerstone of SACE’s success. First, the staff members of our organization have been outstanding. Their dedication, creativity, and grit in challenging some of the world’s largest energy companies never cease to amaze me.

Our Board has been a great source of wisdom and insight in some of our toughest battles while trusting our staff to lead. Our supporters, both large and small, have been great partners over the years, making us stronger and raising their voices with ours, allowing us to focus more on the work than on chasing money. These are the members of the catalytic community that are making the change happen.

Why We Do What We Do

The transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy is an ongoing battle, but it’s critical to ensure clean, safe, and healthy communities throughout the Southeast. We are finally seeing some real progress, especially as some of our regional utilities are beginning to truly scale solar by deploying amounts that counter fossil energy. It needs to happen faster, but the arguments in favor of the status quo and prolonging our reliance on fossil fuels grow weaker by the day.

Today’s accelerating climate catastrophes are the ongoing legacies of dangerous energy choices and a long-lived overreliance on coal, oil, and gas. These fossil fuels are the source of the polluting emissions that are raising sea levels and overheating our planet, resulting in increasingly intense climate disasters that are endangering the people and places we love. The massive destruction and tragic loss of life from Hurricane Helene in the Western mountains of North Carolina is but one recent example in our own region.

We are in this work because we know we can make a difference and shape our collective future. The severity of climate disruption can be overwhelming, and the shortsightedness and misinformation of corporate power, focused solely on financial returns, is maddening. However, clean energy technology is scaling at a pace never seen in human history.

The near future isn’t looking too pretty. The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs is expected to send sales plunging in the coming quarters and perhaps years.

But the global auto industry hasn’t given up entirely on EVs. Automakers are continuing to invest in an electric future — even if it’s not all-electric, as they had expected. The auto industry remains uncertain about the regulatory future of gas-powered cars in large parts of the United States as well as other markets around the globe. And they don’t want to fall too far behind China’s massive EV surge.

“They have softened their stance on an all-EV future,” said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. “I do believe Ford, GM, Stellantis, and a lot of other automakers will still aggressively go down the EV path. But they’re more carefully going down the path than they were a few years ago.”

Sharply lower US EV sales ahead

The end of a $7,500 federal tax credit a week ago caused an EV sales surge during the third quarter as interested buyers rushed to grab a car before the discount expired. Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM) all sold more electric cars than they ever had before, with GM in particular selling more than double the number of EVs in America than it had a year earlier. Tesla’s sales jump came after six straight months of declining numbers.

But after the sharp rise, EV sales for the rest of the year will likely come back to Earth with a heavy thud. And it’s unlikely they’ll get back up for a long time afterwards.

While a full 10% of all cars sold in the US in the last quarter were electric, Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month that he expects EV sales to fall to 5% of the US market, which would be down from about 7% of the market last year. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said that his company also expects that “EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously.”

Still placing big bets

But despite the gloomy outlook, Ford announced in August a $5 billion investment in EV production, a move it called its “next Model T moment,” a reference to the Ford car that helped introduce internal combustion vehicles to the mass market more than a century ago.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” Farley said at a recent company event.

Hyundai, also said it is not pulling back from its EV investment plans in the US market, even after immigration officials arrested 475 workers at one of its new EV and battery plants under construction in Georgia.

But Hyundai CEO José Muñoz stressed at a recent investor day event that the plant will be able to shift between building EVs and traditional gasoline powered cars more easily depending on market demand is part of the comapny’s plan.

Changing emissions regulations

Part of what forced automakers to shift to electric vehicles in the first place had been federal regulations from the Biden administration that aimed for EVs to make up 50% of the American new car market by 2030, and would have imposed steep penalties on automakers that didn’t hit the target.

Those regulations have been mostly rolled back under the Trump administration. The steep financial penalties for violating emission limits were also eliminated in the July tax and spending bill passed by Republicans in July.

California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – had also imposed mandates that would have essentially banned the sale of on gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. Between them, those states account for about a quarter of US car sales.

But Congress recently moved to end California and the other states’ abilities to impose their own, stricter, emissions rules. That fight has been taken to federal court, and the battle could take considerable time to resolve – so much time that changes in administrations in the next decade could ultimately bring that ban back into place as soon as 2035. Europe and China are also moving ahead with their own stricter emissions rules that could force electric vehicle purchases.

Automakers were also chasing much higher stock prices with their EV plans. Tesla has a greater market cap by far than any other automaker, even though it sells only a fraction of the cars any of them do. That has been the case for years, even before CEO Elon Musk and the company’s fans on Wall Street started talking about its ambitious-but-yet-to-be-realized plans about robotaxis and robots driving up the value of the company in the future.

Gas cars ‘no longer a four-letter word’

Rather than going all-in on all-electric cars, automakers are focusing on hybrid–vehicles that have both electric motors and internal combustion engines (ICE).

“There’s still an aggressive push for EVs. But ICE is no longer a four-letter word anymore,” Ives said. “They’re going back to their roots.”

And America’s car companies are saying they didn’t see the same market demand for all-electric vehicles as cars powered by gasoline.

The regulations that had been in place under the Biden administration were “putting us in a box that would have ultimately resulted in a significantly smaller US auto industry, because we wouldn’t have been permitted to sell the internal combustion vehicles at anywhere near the volume we would have sold them,” GM CFO Jacobson said at GM’s investors presentation last month.

He said that, despite those regulations and support for EVs, including the $7,500 tax credit, “customers weren’t adopting at the rate that the government wanted.”

But Jacobson said GM still sees longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit and other support for an all-electric future, and that the company is working to meet that growing EV demand.

“We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand,” he said. “That’s going to take a little bit of time. We’ll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.”

EVs remain attractive

Automakers also find EVs attractive for competitive reasons: It takes fewer hours of labor to produce an EV than it does a gasoline powered car – with its complicated engine and transmission – making them potentially more profitable for automakers than traditional gasoline powered cars.

And demand for EVs could start to increase again if the cost of producing EVs, especially the batteries that make up a large part of the cost of electric vehicles, continues to drop. And virtually every automaker is announcing plans for less costly battery technology.

As part of its $5 billion EV investment plan announced last month, Ford said it will soon sell an EV pickup for $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line to build that more affordable EV pickup is due to be up and running by 2027, Ford said last month.

And Ford still thinks the world is changing, even if it’s changing more slowly than people originally thought.

“We took inspiration from the Model T — the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2025/10/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWdmNXNrcHowMDFlM2I2bjJnNnV6b2kx-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZ2YwZmp1bDAwNzAyOHFvY3oxM2RuMG0.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:04:55.054385

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

Standing before the United Nations last week, U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed long-held animosity for the body dating back decades to when his company was apparently rejected for a renovations gig. Trump swore he would have delivered mahogany walls and marble floors to the tower. And now look at the state of the place, he grumbled. “You walk on terrazzo. Do you notice that?”

Something far worse than composite flooring is in store for nations that fail to rally to Trump’s hypernationalism, anti-immigrant fervor, and fawning embrace of fossil fuels. “Your countries are going to hell,” he said, apparently addressing his comments primarily to the “English-speaking world.” In a room filled with heads of state already reckoning with global warming as an existential threat, Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

He dismissed the decades of warnings about an overheating planet and the increasingly frequent and extreme weather events that the World Economic Forum has estimated are costing the world $16M every hour.

It was a do-as-I-say-and-as-I-do lecture, with Trump modeling a domestic climate response that can best be described as ecocidal. He is burning up the evidence of climate crisis while directly attacking renewable energy and other planet-cooling strategies that could keep more people safer the world over. This includes intentionally crashing climate-observing satellites, shutting down a Hawaii observatory that tracks atmospheric changes and a national climate monitoring network, closing federal environmental justice programs serving many of those most impacted by dirty fuels and climate disruption, curtailing federal assistance for disaster-struck communities, and more.

In the wake of the government shutdown, Trump just this week froze an estimated $26B in federal dollars for transportation and renewable-energy projects that had been headed to Democrat-led states, seeking revenge on Democrats who demanded that Republicans restore public healthcare services stripped in the federal budget bill.

Of course, dismantling federal research efforts and denying assistance does nothing to slow climate harms. Instead it both accelerates warming and puts more people at risk of harm. Teams rooting out so-called DEI initiatives during the opening months of Trump’s term have targeted climate efforts tied to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and clawed back $16B granted under the Biden Administration to help local communities fight climate change.

If anything, these attacks only prove the wisdom of initiatives undertaken in partnership with city and county governments and nonprofits, which aim to foster community resilience not only in response to climate destabilization, but also from potentially unraveling governmental support.

In San Antonio, Texas, for example, austerity measures in a tightening economy have already defunded two widely hailed efforts that are putting power—both literally and figuratively—into the hands of the community. But the project design and creative accounting born from legacies of distrust in government will likely see both efforts continue, even in the shadow of federal antagonism and potential local government retreat.

The ‘Beacon’ of Beacon Hill

Afew miles north of downtown San Antonio sits the Beacon Hill neighborhood, one of the earliest “suburban” neighborhoods for relatively affluent residents of a colonial city. Today it’s populated by older and often ornate single- and two-story homes in various states of repair, an area that has captured the attention of those looking for affordable housing as well as those looking to flip rundown homes at a profit. Its strength is in new and established residents, a vibrant homeowners association, and deepening social networks. In many cases, these are residents aware of the needs of their neighbors and already trained in disaster response.

Elizabeth Eichhorn, for instance, knows two businesses within walking distances whose owners have agreed to open as unofficial warming or cooling centers in the event of extreme temperature shifts. She knows who on the block has gas stoves ready and available to cook or purify water if the electricity is knocked out. She also knows which local business always has a minimum of 80 gallons of drinking water set aside for her block in case the water system fails. It’s information her immediate neighbors share also.

Such understandings arose from necessity starting in the hours after power failure during a 2021 winter storm. In February 2021, hundreds of thousands of residents across the city lost electricity, many for several days. Many others also lost water when the gas-powered generators at those water towers also failed.

Sarah Woolsey, founder of the nonprofit Impact Guild, which at the time operated a brick-and-mortar community center in the area, was soon helping residents stage a door-to-door response to the disaster.

“What happened over those next few days changed me,” she said. “Mostly it was neighbors that needed boiled water but also brought a dozen eggs over. It was this really cool few days of mutual aid with people showing up with what they had, and others needing things, and everybody needing things and receiving.”

That outreach taught her something else about her community. She learned that food insecurity was a daily reality for many before the freeze, with many already “hanging on by a thread,” she told Deceleration.

Beacon Hill has since become a showcase community for the City of San Antonio’s Climate Ready Neighborhoods effort, led by the City’s Office of Sustainability. Impact Guild is a key partner in a program that has intentionally put power into the hands of community by helping them first and foremost deepen their social relationships, identify their resources and talents, and negotiate in advance how they will support one another when disaster hits.

The neighborhood’s experiences in 2021 now inform some of the key literature being distributed by Climate Ready Neighborhoods as it seeks to activate “pods” across the city, neighborhood by neighborhood, teaching the power of interdependence at the level of the city block.

“It’s a matter of realizing that the city can’t be everything, so we have to figure out how to take our own responsibility,” Eichhorn told Deceleration. “Taking care of our neighborhood is shared.”

These neighbors weren’t passively waiting for someone in government to help them prepare for the extreme weather of climate change. They started that for themselves, years before the birth of the Climate Ready effort.

It was a natural shift for Eichhorn, who had lived in areas with frequent disruptions before. “I happened to live in Pasadena, California, where you have to learn to live with earthquakes and wildfires. Most every single person has a safety kit or recovery bag,” she said.

In the world of disaster response, the local—that is, the neighborhood—has long been recognized as a determining factor as to whether someone lives or dies in the aftermath of climate shock.

And that’s not lost on Beacon Hill’s City partners either.

“I think I’m really leaning into that aspect [of the project]. It’s just building up the community connections, the social capital, whatever you want to call it—get to know your neighbor and … build those systems,” said Kate Jaceldo, the City of San Antonio Office of Sustainability’s climate adaptation manager.

Even before the Trump administration started regularly rejecting calls for FEMA assistance and lurching toward dismantling the agency entirely, Beacon Hill residents were asking each other: “What can we do as a community?” Eichhorn said. “How do we connect with people who are already suffering? Let’s say they don’t have access to food, water, or shelter. How do we help with that?”

The summers of rising temperatures—and growing awareness of heat deaths in the city—has only validated the wisdom of those efforts. A recent assessment found the largest of the world’s capital cities are now experiencing 25 percent more extreme heat days than they were as recently as the 1990s. That heat is no surprise and likely to blame for more than 260,000 deaths since 2000.

“The human case for climate change adaptation is obvious,” write the authors of the cities study at the International Institute for Environment and Development. “That’s why city administrations should get the funding boost they need to work closely with communities, civil society groups, and health and other policy experts, on solutions to the growing heat problem.”

Gathering Heat Deaths

About 20 years ago, thousands of people died tucked away in their homes without adequate air conditioning or living on the street without access to a cooling center or home to retreat to.

“A week or so into the heat wave, city officials began running out of places to store bodies,” recounts Jeff Goodell, an Austin-based writer, in the online journal Yale360.

All told, nearly 15,000 died from the heat across France. The year was 2003.

Whether Paris, France or Paris, Texas, the heat has continued to rise virtually unabated as atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, continue to increase. In 2024, sustained daily temps of 108 degrees Fahrenheit, which Save the Children said was roughly 16 degrees more than the annual average, shut down schools for more than 30 million children across Bangladesh—for the second year in a row. More than 1,300 taking the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia died the same year after walking in daytime temperatures that ranged between 117F and 120F. In the United States, more than 1,000 heat-related deaths were reported while efforts to secure a federal heat standard for workers floundered.

Such “once in a hundred years” extreme heat events now “need to be expected every 2–5 years in most locations,” due to industrially driven climate change, recent research shows.

Heat-related deaths are just one obvious result of a hotter planet. Another are the sudden storms known as “cloud bursts”or “rain bombs,” which have wreaked havoc across India and Pakistan but are no longer unfamiliar in Texas. The link between climate change and flash flooding is easy to understand if we think of the atmosphere as a sponge. Because warmer air holds more water, climate change means a bigger sponge—and when it finally gets wrung, the accumulation can be disastrous.

This is how hundreds can be swept away in Kashmir in one day. It is how 12 inches of rain can fall in just a few hours in the Texas Hill Country and spark a flood that would ultimately claim more than 130 lives.

Texas this year didn’t blow past our recent summer scorchings, thankfully, although summer temps arrived early and have continued to run hotter than normal, well into the upper 90s, despite the arrival of fall. Around the world, temperatures recorded across land and sea continue to show an Earth moving deeper into unprecedented territory, with some of the hottest temps ever experienced by humans recorded in recent years. In spite of Trump’s slurs against the science, this has all played out as the decades of climate models said it would.

It is for this reason that Trump’s UN climate denialism prompted Ilana Seid, an ambassador from the island nation of Palau and head of the organization of small island states, to call the US reversal on climate under Trump “a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” a sentiment echoed by Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi, who said: “we are endangering the lives of innocent people in the world.”

Some long-committed climate activists see that betrayal too—and have started calling for local communities to take survival into their own hands.

‘Dagger in the Heart’

“It’s too late.”

This pronouncement about averting worst-case climate outcomes by Canadian scientist David Suzuki, also one of the world’s leading environmental activists, shook anyone paying attention to climate.

The basic science behind global warming has been understood since the late 1800s. Exxon’s own scientists understood at least since the 1970s that their products were changing the chemistry of the atmosphere, threatening to dangerously overheat the planet, and stating that humans had “a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”

Shell knew too. In the 1980s its scientists confirmed that “global changes in air temperature would … ‘drastically change the way people live and work.’ All told, Shell concluded, ‘the changes may be the greatest in recorded history,’” as the Guardian recounts.

It would take decades more before any tangible federal legislation advanced to tackle the problem. President Obama got behind a proposal known as “cap and trade,” which—for better or worse—aimed to use market mechanisms to wean the nation off fossil fuels. San Antonio’s Valero Energy helped beat that effort back, warning customers in pumpside placards of the cents it would add to the price per gallon. Another 13 years would transpire before President Biden advanced a federal vision of energy transition that sent an unprecedented hundreds of billions of dollars to the states to reduce energy demand and facilitate the transition to renewable energy and battery systems.

Now, with MAGA’s return to power, we’re facing what Suzuki experienced like a “dagger in my heart.”

Trump’s decision to prize the perceived needs of fossil fuel companies while demonizing and attacking lower-carbon alternatives—power sources credited with keeping the power on in Texas since its near grid collapse of 2021—has “flatlined” US climate pollution rates with an expected 7B tons of additional climate emissions over the coming five years, according to Carbon Brief. (Before Trump’s election, the same publication estimated he would inject 4B tons of emissions into the atmosphere and thereby push beyond reach international climate goals of limiting global warming beneath 1.5 degrees over 1990 levels.)

For those who had been warning for years of a “last call” on climate action, this policy lurch backwards within the largest economy on Earth dashed all hopes that we might avert the so-called “worst manifestations” of industrially driven climate change.

“Trump’s win was the triumph of capitalism and neoliberalism, and he’s going to wreak havoc,” Suzuki told Davis Legree at Canada’s iPolitics in July 2025. “For me, what we’ve got to do now is hunker down. The units of survival are going to be local communities, so I’m urging local communities to get together.”

While not surrendering the struggle to move beyond fossil fuels, Suzuki stressed that local adaptation efforts are now imperative, while citing the efforts of the Finnish government on emergency preparedness in particular.

“Governments will not be able to respond on the scale or speed that is needed for these emergencies, so Finland is telling their citizens that they’re going to be at the front line of whatever hits and better be sure you’re ready to meet it. … You’re going to have to inventory your community, and that’s really what we have to start doing now.”

In San Antonio, the Climate Ready Neighborhoods and another effort rooted on the South Side have been seeking to do just that. Both were defunded by San Antonio’s City Council under the new city budget, with funds from a recently established resilience fund diverted to pay local firefighters. However, the city’s Chief Sustainability Officer Doug Melnick said a week before the budget vote that these programs would continue through 2026 by drawing forward dollars from the previous year’s budget. After that, their future is uncertain.

“2025 dollars will be setting the stage for implementation through 2026,” Melnick told Council members at a budget hearing. “I think it will be a different conversation as we go forward into the future. But this year’s work … will continue.”

Withering FEMA

In South San Antonio, Fuerza Unida’s small office and clothing alterations shop is abuzz with climate activity. Maps on the wall denote zones to be planted with mid-sized trees, jobs for arborists are being advertised, and the last homes being gifted heat pump cooling systems are being checked off.

Although the role of fossil fuels tends to grab most of the attention in discussions of global warming, climate change is also a product of deforestation. Both are the targets of neighborhood-based climate work on San Antonio’s Southside, undertaken beneath the banner of the South San Heat Resiliency Project (PDF).

Here demographics dramatically shift from those of Beacon Hill. The per capita income drops significantly as the number of immigrant families rises. Homes here are mostly not yet buffeted by the waves of would-be gentrifiers prowling other quarters of the city. Instead they bake within the dust, heat, and fumes of ubiquitous scrap metal recyclers and auto salvage yards. Southside residents also persist on the edge of the former Kelly Air Force Base and its toxic legacy that many blame for high levels of cancer in the area, which claimed the lives of beloved community organizers Lupe and Robert Alvarado in recent years.

Led by a team of Latina workers who began collectively working to support local women after aLevi’s factory closedin 1990, Fuerza Unida (“united strength”) has served residents for more than 30 years. The city was never a partner here, said Nancy Parrilla, the organization’s chief financial officer. “[Fuerza] never saw them as an ally before,” she said.

A couple years ago, however, the organization was approached by the Office of Sustainability about a climate resilience project.

“The City came knocking on our door. We didn’t go looking for them,” Parrilla said. “They came and were like, ‘We need a stakeholder in the neighborhood’ because everything they had been trying had been unsuccessful.”

Community meetings followed that sparked interest among local homeowners, where temperatures in some homes—suffering from lack of insulation, cooling, and elevated street temperatures due in part to a lack of green space—routinely topped 100F degrees during peak summer. The effort began building trust and attracted the attention of Austin-based Adaptation International, which bills itself as a woman-owned business helping bridge the gap between climate science and community efforts.

Adaptation International’s work is intended to “identify climate vulnerabilities and develop sustainable cooling strategies that enhance resilience,” the organization writes on their website. “By integrating climate science with local knowledge, the project advances environmental justice and empowers communities to shape solutions through storytelling, research, and collaborative planning.”

This summer the effort was awarded an additional $96,000 from the nation-wide Climate Smart Communities Initiative.

While the project clearly emphasizes climate adaptation, it also promotes the language of “workforce development.” While similar projects have suffered elsewhere under Trump’s targeting of projects rooted in equity concerns, the inclusion of more favorable buzzwords has had no impact on the actual work, said Celine Rendon, a climate resilience specialist with Adaptation International. “That’s not really changing the way that we’re engaging with community members that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis,” said Rendon. “It’s not really stopping the work.”

While the San Antonio Office of Sustainability dodged layoffs this budget, colleagues working elsewhere, including for the City of Denver, didn’t fare as well.

Data released earlier this month by the U.S. Government Accountability Office suggests these sorts of community efforts will be more valuable than ever—especially as FEMA cuts back its operations.

Workforce reductions and loss of training capacity have severely compromised FEMA’s reliability as a partner in disaster response, GAO researchers write. FEMA’s slow mobilization to the July Hill Country floods that claimed more than 130 lives in a few days is well documented. But the GAO makes another fact clear: When the rain began to fall over Kerr County, only 15 percent of FEMA’s incident management workforce were available. That number was a mere 12 percent at the start of the year’s hurricane season, according to the GAO. It’s bad news as the country today moves through peak hurricane season.

As the GAO report concludes:

“Should the U.S. experience a similarly catastrophic peak hurricane season in September and October 2025, as it did in 2024, meeting response needs could be a major challenge. Moreover, no concrete changes to disaster response roles have yet been made. FEMA and other federal agencies spreading a reduced number of staff across the same or higher number of disasters nationwide could reduce effectiveness of federal disaster response for upcoming disasters.”

The government shutdown is not expected to further erode FEMA’s response capacity(such as it is). However: “If the agency required additional funds to respond to serious damage caused by a natural disaster during the shutdown,” Simmone Shah writes at Time, “they would be unable to appeal to Congress.”

Fuerza’s leadership say they have experienced the benefit of partnering with the City and Adaptation International. It’s allowed them to install cooling systems to homes in need. But it also kindled hope among their neighbors and helped them to imagine alternative positive visions of the future, the absence of which had been among the project’s “biggest challenges,” Parrilla said.

“I think the saddest part is that they don’t know that [the wealth] you see on the Northside, it’s because that’s what the city has invested in. And they can do the same over here. They have just chosen not to.”

But the program is being intentionally built to advance with or without a governmental partner. Meetings with fellow community-based organizations have increased. Skills and lessons learned are being shared.

Parrilla said the driving goal behind the heat pump installation project, of advocating for better controls over local sources of pollution, of an ambitious urban forestry project now offering neighborhood youth $18 per hour, is for the community to learn how to be sustainable on their own.

“We cannot depend on outside sources to keep our spaces green, to give us a safe environment,” she said. “When we leave it in their hands, we’re the ones who suffer.”

Adelante Juntos

Since the surge in heat deaths more than 20 years ago, the people of Paris, France, have put a tremendous amount of energy into responding to accelerating heat waves. A report from 2019 documents efforts to pull up pavement, plant thousands of trees, and cultivate networks of interlinked cool “islands” to help residents cool off.

The intentional greening of Medellín, Colombia was also recently cited as inspiration by a Bexar County commissioner, as another example of concerted city-scale efforts that have brought down temperatures for their residents in a time of overheating.

While San Antonio is putting more money than ever into “cool pavement” efforts this year, a practice with debatable results, there is also a burgeoning movement to green the city that is driven largely from the grassroots. Fuerza’s project is just one part of that. What participants in both city programs said they found most useful has been the power of deepening relationships with neighbors.

Some also referenced the skills of flexibility and creativity—about how to be prepared for rapidly changing circumstances—including positive ones, such as when new potential partnerships present themselves.

“There’s still funding and resources available,” said Rendon, “you just have to be strategic and make sure you are ready when it comes.”

In the world of adaptation under stress, partnerships deliver in different ways, added the Impact Guild’s Woolsey. Sometimes it is shared knowledge to help neighborhoods organize themselves, efforts that hinge exclusively on volunteer labor. Sometimes it is a check (whether from a public or private source) that facilitates purchases families couldn’t afford otherwise. Sometimes it is changing policies and large-scale infrastructure investments, which typically require massive public pressure on elected leaders.

“Just the way any ecosystem has a lot of biodiversity, our resources—the more diversity we have in them—the better off we are,” Woolsey said.

In recent weeks, Woolsey has been operating outside of San Antonio, helping families collect the things they need to return to homes abandoned after July’s Hill Country floods. There too, she has found that some of the most valuable assistance is low cost, she said. It is more about organizing and time. “There’s a lot that we’re sourcing that’s in-kind. We need dollars to close the gaps to get people into their homes,” she said. “But also it’s the shared meals, it’s the volunteer hours, it’s people giving the furniture.

“The bigger question we are all holding is like: How can [resilience] be the manpower showing up for one another? … How can it be physical sharing of resources that are more this barter/exchange kind of thing? Then when can it be the dollars, as strategically as possible, to close the gaps where those other things can’t do it?”

Far from the image of social breakdown so often depicted in Hollywood blockbusters, every disaster survived deepens a community’s knowledge of itself. It reinforces and strengthens the relationships people can actually rely upon. Each disaster is also “shared seeds,” Woolsey said. And the lessons that are reaped from those seeds often point toward something new, those interviewed told Deceleration. Lessons that point to deepening and rooting further in place, in belonging, in neighborhood—as the old world, oftentimes literally, washes away.",https://texassignal.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/utility-disconnections-campaign-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 15:09:28.189366

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration's termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program's termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.""

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,"" formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump's assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

As the Trump Administration recklessly slashes over$26 million from clean energy projects in his district and nearly $467 million in critical investments across New York State, Lawler is nowhere to be found.

Lawler’s silence is ironic considering that just last week, he penned an op-ed touting his passion for an “all-of-the-above energy approach” that “build[s] on existing clean energy investments.”

Late last year, Lawler also visited the same IBM research center that was just hit with millions in funding cuts – boasting at the time that he wouldn’t “stop working in Congress to empower our innovators.”

But now that Donald Trump has decided to gut these clean energy projects, it’s crickets from Mike Lawler.

REMINDER: After caving to Trump and voting for the Big, Ugly Bill earlier this year, Lawler admitted he was jeopardizing millions in investments and good-paying jobs in his district and begged Senate Republican leaders to “mitigate” the negative impacts of his own vote.

Politico New York: The good, the bad, the ugly: Federal cuts come to New York.

New York is getting whipsawed by the Trump administration’s aggressive cost-cutting strategy.

About $467 million is being cut from clean energy projects in New York as part of the Trump administration’s Wednesday announcement it would slice about $8 billion in Department of Energy grants in mostly blue states, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s calculations.

Hudson Valley Republican Rep. Mike Lawler is seeing over $26 million cut from his district, with a $19.7 million “methane characterization” project at IBM’s research headquarters being the biggest casualty.

The barrage of energy grant cuts comes at an awkward time for Lawler — he just published an op-ed Monday about his passion for an “all-of-the-above energy approach.”

Last year, he toured the same IBM research center that was ravaged by the recent cuts. “I won’t stop working in Congress to empower our innovators and unleash our potential so that America remains the unequivocal world leader in the 21st Century and beyond,” he said at the time.

Just months after its founding in January, the company went public last week, sparking strong investor demand despite its early-stage status and lack of revenue. Shares surged 55% on their first trading day to close at about $32.50 per share, well above their $21 initial offering price, although they have since declined to levels of about $28 per share currently. Fermi’s market reception highlights surging investor appetite for artificial intelligence infrastructure plays. For a company with no revenue and no operating history, the frenzy around its debut raises the question: what exactly are investors betting on?

Reinventing Data Center Power for the AI Era

At the core of Fermi’s strategy is Project Matador, also called the “HyperGrid,” a hyperscale data center campus in the Texas Panhandle. The company’s model revolves around leasing massive data center space and integrated computing infrastructure to customers such as AI developers, cloud providers, and semiconductor firms. Unlike traditional data centers that depend heavily on strained public utility grids, Fermi plans to embed its own private power supply.

It will operate a mix of natural gas plants, nuclear reactors, solar farms, and battery storage—creating a grid-independent, highly reliable system designed for energy-hungry AI workloads. Fermi brands this approach as HyperRedundant, promising uninterrupted delivery even if the public grid falters. Project Matador is expected to generate 1.1 gigawatts of power by 2026, with a long-term goal of 11 gigawatts and 18 million square feet of space by 2038. For context, CEO Toby Neugebauer claims the site could eventually produce twice as much electricity as all the power plants currently serving New York City.

This ambition reflects the massive energy demands of AI. Training a single large model can consume as much electricity as hundreds of U.S. households annually. As models grow larger and are retrained more often, data center infrastructure must scale dramatically and remain highly reliable, since even brief power interruptions can disrupt AI research and cloud services.

Considerable Risks

That said, the outlook comes with considerable risks. Fermi has no operating history and remains pre-revenue, with construction still in progress. Its plans require massive capital – an estimated $50 to $70 billion over time, including $30 to $35 billion just for nuclear capacity. Financing, construction, and regulatory hurdles remain considerable and a project of this scale could face supply chain bottlenecks, labor shortages, volatile debt markets, and lengthy approval processes for nuclear reactors. Besides this, customer risk adds another layer of uncertainty.

So far, Fermi has signed only nonbinding letters of intent, with no firm tenant contracts. Without binding agreements, demand and cash flows remain uncertain. Finally, demand risk lingers – data center leasing and power revenues depend on broader economic conditions and the pace of AI adoption. While demand appears very strong right now, a slowdown in the pace of advancement of AI tech could hurt long-term growth rates.

In summary, Fermi represents a highly speculative investment opportunity. Valued at approximately $17 billion, the company aims to address AI’s enormous power demands via one of the most ambitious private energy projects ever conceived. That said, the recent stock surge reflects strong investor enthusiasm for the potential of its vision, rather than demonstrated operational success. The company benefits from the credibility and strategic advantages offered by its founders, including former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, which may support regulatory, financing, and policy efforts. This makes the stock a very high risk, high reward type play at the moment.

The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

The DOE specified that 26% of the terminated financial awards, valued at over $3.1 billion, were issued between Election Day and Inauguration Day.

The terminated awards originated from several DOE offices like Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and Fossil Energy (FE).

The decision has ignited significant political controversy, with critics accusing the Trump administration of using the cuts as a political weapon against ""blue states."" White House budget director Russell Vought was explicit about the political nature of the cuts, posting on social media about ""Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,"" and listing the 16 states targeted, all of which voted for the Democratic candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

Among the highest-profile cancellations is the funding for California’s Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES), a major hydrogen hub project that had been projected to support up to 220,000 jobs. U.S. Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Adam Schiff, both from California, called the cancellation ""shortsighted,"" warning it would undermine economic opportunities.

Other affected projects include a $500 million award for the Lebec Net-Zero project in California, aimed at producing carbon-neutral cement, and an $87 million grant to Sublime Systems for low-carbon cement manufacturing in Massachusetts, which was expected to create between 70 and 90 jobs. The cuts also hit major grid and transmission initiatives, including a proposed $464 million in funding for transmission studies across seven Midwest states.

Critics argue the cancellations will result in the loss of tens of thousands of potential jobs, raise consumer electricity costs, and undercut U.S. competitiveness in critical clean technologies, despite the administration's stated goal of boosting American manufacturing.

Last Tuesday, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) announced it received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as a national securities exchange.

The SEC go-ahead means that the stock exchange is gearing up to begin trading in early 2026, according to a news release, joining the sprawling avenues of big-name Fortune 500 companies in Dallas.

The nickname “Y’all Street” — a southern riff on Wall Street — came about in early 2024, after Dallas was named the No. 2 city in the country for financial jobs, second only to New York, according to Bloomberg. Financial big names are flocking to the city: In 2020, Charles Schwab moved its headquarters from San Francisco to Dallas; Deloitte plans to open an expanded new campus there this year; and a $500 million Goldman Sachs facility is in the works.

The growth in financial-sector jobs in the Lone-Star state since 2019 was more than six times the growth in New York and the nation as a whole, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2024.

So is it time to take Y’all Street seriously? Here’s where it stands.

Can Dallas become a financial rival to New York?

Texas Stock Exchange’s founder and CEO James Lee said in a press release last week that the exchange is ready to lead Texas’ pro-business environment.

“Real competition for corporate listings in the United States has finally arrived,” Lee said.

Major national stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange appear to see TXSE as a potential rival: NYSE announced it would move its Chicago branch to Dallas two weeks after the Texas exchange filed for SEC approval in January, the Dallas Morning News reported. Nasdaq also announced in March that it would be opening a new headquarters in Dallas.

And the TXSE’s financial backing is nothing to scoff at: the exchange boasts $161 million in funds from Blackrock, Charles Schwab, and other banking giants, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Republican leaders push back at “woke” stock markets

Republican politicians have also celebrated the promising development of the Dallas-based exchange — and are using it against Democratic rivals.

President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post Saturday about the New York attorney general Letitia James, said that her policies would make few companies want to use the New York Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ.

“The new Texas Exchange will be taking ALL of this business away,” Trump wrote.

Texas Republicans such as Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz shared similar sentiments about the new stock exchange’s potential as an alternative to the New York exchanges.

“If you don’t want a woke stock exchange, and just want an avenue to raise capital, Texas will be the place to do it,” Cruz wrote on X Wednesday. Cruz accompanied the post with a clip of himself on the Fox Business show suggesting that New York politicians, such as mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, were driving business leaders from their state to Texas.

Building momentum: What’s next for TXSE

Texans will have to wait until the end of 2026 to see if “Y’all Street” can truly rival Wall Street. TXSE indicated it will go live at the beginning of the year, with corporate listings in the second half.

The success of the exchange — which will be fully digital — hinges on companies deciding to list themselves, as well as the health of the state’s economy, Sriram Villupuram, a UT Arlington associate professor of finance, told the Texas Tribune. He said that interested investors will be watching closely to see how quickly TXSE can attract its first 50 to 100 companies.

“It gives those that are thinking about listing an idea about what it takes to get on the exchange, and it could snowball from there,” Villupuram said to the Tribune.

Along with the increase in companies moving their headquarters to Texas, the stock exchange could mean something big for Texans.

“What it means for local people, of course, is job creation,” Kirti Sinha, a University of Texas at Dallas assistant professor of accounting, told the Dallas Morning News.",https://thebarbedwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-485990710-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:03:48.300195

⛔ SHUTDOWN

If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again and hope for a different outcome:

The Senate is back in town today with another chance teed up to end the government shutdown. Government funding votes are lined up for this afternoon, but no one expects a different outcome from last week.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told House lawmakers to stay home for another week, knowing the stalemate will continue. Though, Johnson also told House Republicans they would get a 48-hour heads-up if they need to return earlier. “The House did its job,” Johnson argued on Sunday because it passed a government extension, directing the blame to the Senate.

A sign this could drag out for quite some time: President Trump is staying out of it. However, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports that “Trump may come under more pressure to negotiate with Democrats if the shutdown drags beyond Oct. 15, the date when members of the military will miss their first paycheck due to the fight in Washington.”

🪖 STATE WATCH

Portland and Chicago are fighting back:

President Trump’s efforts to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Portland, Ore., against state and local officials’ wishes hit a major snag late last night.

Let me start from the beginning: U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term,blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from sending federal troops to Portland.

The Trump team then tried to send out-of-state troops from Texas to Portland. Immergut then blocked the administration for the second time in two days — and this time, she strongly rebuked Trump as being “in direct contravention” of her order.

Why does Trump think federal troops are necessary?: To quell the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests.

Chicago is also fighting back today: This morning, Illinois and Chicago filed a lawsuit to block Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. Read more

💡 For context on the National Guard: “National Guard forces — largely part-time troops who typically work in civilian jobs full time — are normally under the control of the states, with governors serving as commanders. The troops are often deployed to help after natural disasters or when civil disorder overwhelms local law enforcement authorities, but in some circumstances federal law allows the president to take control of them.” (NYT)

Industries operating without valid permits or violating their permit conditions risk more than financial penalties.
Oteng’s message to AGI members suggests the EPA recognizes that many industries treat permit renewals casually, allowing documents to lapse while continuing operations.
As carbon markets develop, industries will face additional reporting and compliance obligations beyond traditional environmental permits.
Industry association gatherings reach concentrated audiences of decision makers who control permit compliance at their respective facilities.","Industries that fail to renew environmental permits on time will pay three times the standard fee as penalties, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has warned, signaling stricter enforcement of compliance requirements under Ghana’s new environmental legislation.

Samuel Oteng, Greater Accra East (Tema) Regional Director of the EPA, delivered the stern message during the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) Tema Regional annual meeting held recently. His warning comes as the EPA exercises expanded regulatory powers under the Environmental Protection Act 2025 (Act 1124), which replaced the 1994 legislation in January.

Speaking at the meeting themed “Creating a Conducive Business Environment for Industrial Competitiveness: 24 Hour in Perspective,” Oteng emphasized that permit conditions aren’t optional suggestions but legal obligations carrying real consequences. He revealed that violations of permit conditions and failure to renew before expiration attract sanctions, indicating the agency’s determination to enforce compliance.

The EPA director specified that industries must begin the renewal process at least three months before their permits expire, with late renewals attracting penalties equivalent to three times the applicable fee. This timeline requirement aims to prevent last minute rushes and ensure continuous regulatory oversight of industrial operations.

The warning reflects broader changes in Ghana’s environmental regulation landscape. Act 1124 established the EPA with significantly expanded powers compared to its predecessor legislation, giving the agency more tools to monitor and enforce environmental compliance across industries.

Industries operating without valid permits or violating their permit conditions risk more than financial penalties. The EPA can suspend operations, revoke permits entirely, or pursue legal action depending on the severity and nature of violations. These enforcement mechanisms existed under previous law but gain sharper teeth under the 2025 Act.

Oteng’s message to AGI members suggests the EPA recognizes that many industries treat permit renewals casually, allowing documents to lapse while continuing operations. This practice creates regulatory blind spots where industrial activities proceed without current environmental oversight or updated conditions reflecting operational changes.

The three month advance renewal requirement addresses this problem by building buffer time into the system. Industries that begin renewals three months early can resolve documentation issues, address any concerns the EPA raises, and ensure continuity without gaps in permit coverage.

However, the triple fee penalty for late renewals raises questions about proportionality and business impact. For industries operating on tight margins, especially smaller manufacturers, a threefold increase in permit costs could represent significant unplanned expenses that affect operational budgets.

The EPA appears willing to accept this criticism in exchange for stronger compliance incentives. Previous penalty structures apparently failed to motivate timely renewals, leading officials to conclude that financial consequences needed escalation to change behavior patterns across the industrial sector.

Environmental permits serve multiple purposes beyond bureaucratic box checking. They establish baseline expectations for emissions, waste management, resource use, and pollution control specific to each facility. Regular renewals allow the EPA to update these conditions based on technological advances, environmental science developments, or changes in community conditions surrounding industrial sites.

When permits lapse, the EPA loses this regulatory touchpoint. Industries continue operating under outdated conditions that may no longer reflect best practices or adequately protect surrounding communities and ecosystems. The renewal process isn’t just administrative paperwork but rather ongoing environmental management.

Act 1124’s expanded scope includes new regulatory frameworks that didn’t exist under the 1994 legislation. The law establishes the Ghana Carbon Registry to promote carbon credit trading and climate action, implements strict pesticide controls, tightens hazardous waste regulations, and restricts electronic waste imports. These additions increase complexity for industries navigating compliance requirements.

The legislation also creates the Carbon Markets Office hosted by the EPA, giving the agency responsibilities in emerging climate finance mechanisms. As carbon markets develop, industries will face additional reporting and compliance obligations beyond traditional environmental permits.

AGI members attending the Tema meeting heard Oteng’s warnings within broader discussions about creating conducive business environments under the government’s 24 hour economy policy. This context highlights tensions between environmental regulation and industrial competitiveness that define much of Ghana’s development debate.

Industries argue that excessive regulation or enforcement burdens competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors regionally or internationally. Environmental advocates counter that proper regulation protects public health and ecosystems while establishing level playing fields where all competitors meet minimum standards.

The EPA’s stricter enforcement approach tests whether Ghana can balance these competing interests effectively. Too aggressive enforcement risks driving industries toward non compliance or relocation. Too lenient enforcement allows environmental degradation that undermines long term sustainability and public health.

Oteng’s public warning serves notice that the EPA intends to use its expanded powers under Act 1124. Whether industries respond with improved compliance or pushback against perceived regulatory overreach will shape how effectively Ghana implements its new environmental protection framework.

The AGI meeting provided an appropriate forum for delivering this message. Industry association gatherings reach concentrated audiences of decision makers who control permit compliance at their respective facilities. Oteng’s appearance signals the EPA views industry engagement as important even while warning of tougher enforcement.

Seth Twum Akwaboah, AGI Chief Executive Officer, has emphasized that industries need stable, predictable regulatory environments to plan investments and operations effectively. The EPA’s clear communication about permit requirements and penalties arguably serves this goal by eliminating ambiguity about expectations and consequences.

How industries actually respond to the triple fee penalty threat remains to be seen. Some will likely prioritize compliance to avoid financial exposure. Others might gamble that enforcement won’t match rhetoric, particularly if they perceive the EPA lacks resources for comprehensive monitoring across all permitted facilities.

The EPA’s enforcement capacity represents a real constraint on how effectively warnings translate into changed behavior. Ghana’s regulatory agencies historically struggle with limited budgets, insufficient personnel, and equipment shortages that hamper their ability to monitor compliance comprehensively across regulated sectors.

Act 1124’s expanded mandate increases these capacity challenges. The EPA must now oversee carbon markets, strengthen pesticide control, manage hazardous waste more strictly, and enforce electronic waste restrictions while continuing traditional environmental permitting and monitoring responsibilities. Whether the agency receives corresponding budget and staff increases will determine implementation effectiveness.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-10-06 16:03:32.481880

(CA-06) condemned the Trump Administration’s revocation of a $50 million federal grant awarded to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for its Connected Clean PowerCity® project, a major initiative to modernize the electric grid and help the Sacramento region reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.
SMUD has received $8 million in reimbursements for work already completed, but the loss of grant funding disrupts the planning and execution of the project.
“This is a reckless and vindictive decision that punishes Sacramento County families and slows our progress toward a cleaner, more reliable energy future,” said Representative Bera.
### NOTE: This release is amended to reflect that the Connected Clean PowerCity® project will continue despite the loss of federal grant funding.","Sacramento, CA — Today, Representative Ami Bera, M.D. (CA-06) condemned the Trump Administration’s revocation of a $50 million federal grant awarded to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for its Connected Clean PowerCity® project, a major initiative to modernize the electric grid and help the Sacramento region reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.

Funded through the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program in 2023, the grant aimed to reduce outages, empower families to manage their energy use, and build a cleaner, more reliable energy system. SMUD has received $8 million in reimbursements for work already completed, but the loss of grant funding disrupts the planning and execution of the project.

“This is a reckless and vindictive decision that punishes Sacramento County families and slows our progress toward a cleaner, more reliable energy future,” said Representative Bera. “This funding was secured through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to modernize our grid, lower energy costs, and strengthen our resilience in the face of climate change. Pulling the plug now abandons a bipartisan commitment to smart energy policy and puts local jobs, innovation, and community preparedness at risk.”

The cancellation is part of a broader effort by the Trump Administration to withhold and cancel clean energy funding from blue states. On October 1, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced the termination of $8 billion in energy projects, specifically targeting 16 Democratic-led states. That same evening, the Department of Energy confirmed it had canceled 321 previously awarded grants. These terminations will increase energy costs, eliminate jobs, and weaken grid reliability across the country.

With the grant now canceled, Sacramento County will lose out on major investments that would have:

Installed 200,000 next-generation smart meters across the region;

Deployed advanced grid and outage management systems to reduce blackouts during extreme weather;

Added 22,500 intelligent load control devices to help manage demand during emergencies;

Expanded fiber optic infrastructure to improve communication and data reliability;

Partnered with the Wilton Rancheria Tribe of Miwok Indians to support solar, storage, and electrification on Tribal lands.

(ITC), the largest independent electricity transmission company in the U.S.","The nation’s energy grid is transforming at a pace no industry has seen in decades, and it’s fueling a growing career path. For ITC Holdings Corp., the nation’s largest independent electricity transmission company headquartered in Novi, Michigan, careers in energy transmission aren’t just about powering communities — they’re about empowering people. Crain’s Content Studio sat down with Charles Marshall, President of ITC Michigan, and Andrea Gurcsik, ITC’s Director of Total Talent, about the growth in career paths.

Q: Energy is essential to everyone’s daily life. What makes transmission such a reliable and steady part of that picture?

Gurcsik: Transmission infrastructure is really foundational to the energy system. Unlike other sectors that rise and fall, our work is less impacted by market fluctuations. As demand for energy rises, we continue to expand.

Marshall: Stability also comes from the long-term visibility we have into projects. Many take seven to 10 years to develop, so we know the work will be there. ITC has been a growth company for the past 22 years, and we anticipate that to continue for the foreseeable future. Growth brings stability — and frankly, it’s more fun to work for a growing company.

Q: What excites you most about this moment in the industry?

Marshall: The pace of change. Our grid has never been fueled with the resource mix we have today. Just four years ago, solar barely registered; now it’s 10 to 15 percent of the daily portfolio. That kind of shift brings new challenges and new opportunities.

Gurcsik: Employees feel pride and purpose in powering communities. Our engagement scores—world-class according to Gallup—show how strongly people connect to our mission. And innovation is part of our DNA. We have an innovation charter that says ideas can come from anyone, anywhere. Whether it’s a small process change or transforming the grid, being open to innovation and change is part of who we are.

Q: You’ve both emphasized culture. What makes ITC’s workplace different?

Marshall: When people come here, the first thing they often say is, “this feels different.” There’s genuine satisfaction and fulfillment in working at ITC. That culture of belonging is what sustains us. Years later, that feeling remains and is why so many of our employees stay here for the majority of their career.

Gurcsik: Every company says they put people first, but we have the results to prove it — top engagement scores, very low turnover, and leadership that stays close to employees. From welcome lunches to open coffee chats, employees feel supported and heard at all levels of the company.

Q: Charles, you’ve spent your entire career at ITC. What has that meant for you?

Marshall: I’ve worked at ITC throughout my entire career, but I’ve had the chance to reinvent my career multiple times. I’ve moved through engineering, regulatory affairs, stakeholder relations and executive leadership. That’s possible because ITC values curiosity and empowers people to thrive. If you’re willing to learn and grow, doors open.

Q: What career opportunities exist for those looking to join ITC?

Marshall: We’re a technical organization, so many of our employees are engineers. But we also need people with communication skills, perseverance, and the ability to build relationships.

Gurcsik: Beyond engineering, we’re hiring in finance, IT, HR, project management and more. If someone brings transferable skills, curiosity, and collaboration, we can find a place for them.

Q: How are you preparing the next generation of talent?

Gurcsik: Most people get into the energy industry because a family member is in this field. So, exposure is critical. That’s why we run a robust internship program and partner with local schools, such as the Henry Ford Academy. Students get to see how transmission keeps the grid stable—and how meaningful their contributions could be.

Marshall: Showing students opportunities in the energy industry before they set their course in college helps them see this field as a viable and exciting career path.

Q: What advice would you give someone considering a career in energy?

Marshall: We need strategic minds with ambition, creativity and adaptability. Those qualities matter as much as technical expertise.

Gurcsik: Stay curious. Be willing to embrace change and ask why. Those traits make a lasting impact—and they make you a great fit at ITC.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.
It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.
Taking public comments We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel.","We are embarking on a new statewide study to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts surrounding the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel—including measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Our broad statewide studies, also called programmatic environmental impact statements, are required by state law. In June, we released three studies evaluating utility-scale onshore wind and solar energy projects, and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.

As part of the scoping process, we are seeking input from interested parties, including the public, regarding the range of actions and impacts we should study.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

To help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to power aircraft engines. The fuel is derived from low-carbon sources such as biomass, organic waste and clean synthetic feedstocks using a wide range of production methods and technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.

Scoping our study to be impactful and efficient

While these fuel projects are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the state economy, they can still have negative environmental impacts that need to be considered—including ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate those impacts.

Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from a variety of renewable resources and transported using various distribution methods, our study will not be able to evaluate every possible option. This means your input is critical. It will help us determine where to focus our analysis to develop the most useful, timely report that will support the future development of sustainable aviation fuel projects in Washington.

The study will evaluate the potential impacts on natural and built resources at a broad level. Developers and agencies can use the findings to help avoid and reduce impacts through siting and design choices. It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.

What's driving the numbers?",David Brown,,,,,https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/texas-energy-consumption-drivers-population-ai-data-centers/,"This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity: Texas Standard: So the Department of Energy says Texas used twice as much energy as California and three times as much as Florida in 2023.

And the largest percentage of that projected energy demand growth comes from data centers.
It’s not just hinging on these data centers, it’s going to be coming regardless, given the variety of demand pulls going on here.","Over the past 10 years or so, one of the most durable narratives in the current chapter of the Texas story is the explosive population growth we’ve been tracking – a level of growth that’s put added strain on Texas’s infrastructure, that’s to be sure.

That’s especially true for our electric grid, which was set up to operate mostly separate from the national grid. That’s created some issues to be sure, particularly during weather conditions causing demand to outstrip supply.

But there’s another issue related to Texas’ economic growth that promises to put much further strain on the state’s electrical resources.

Matt Smith, head energy analyst at Kpler, joined the Standard for a closer look. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So the Department of Energy says Texas used twice as much energy as California and three times as much as Florida in 2023. That’s astonishing. What seems to be driving this outperformance?

Matt Smith: The first thing is the reason they’re focusing on these three states is because they are the three largest energy-consuming states in the U.S. It’s also important to bear in mind that this is total energy, so it includes transportation as well as electricity generation.

But as you were mentioning, the explosion in the population in Texas has happened over the last few years, but it’s actually outperformance from the industrial demand side of things that is driving demand higher. And so that accounts for about a half of Texas energy demand, where in California and Florida, it’s a much smaller sliver. They’re much more focused on commercial and residential demand, as well as transportation.

Now, just to bear in mind, when we talk about industrial demand, that’s Texas’s energy-intensive chemical manufacturing, oil and natural gas extraction, production, petroleum refining, agricultural industry. So it’s all of the behemoth of industry, right?

Well, yeah, but I thought that you were going to be pointing to something else and that’s the explosive growth that Texas has seen in artificial intelligence and these data centers which have sprouted up all over the state. In fact, it seems like the state is going out of its way to position itself as the capital for AI, or at least the backbone that supports that AI infrastructure, these huge data centers.

Yeah, and so there’s a number of areas across the U.S. that can do this. Texas, Louisiana, Virginia, etc, are kind of obvious ones to locate these data centers, just because of the natural resources available, right? So you have the Permian Basin, etc. So you have access to natural gas, to other resources. And so that’s part of it.

If we kind of take a step back, though, industrial demand in the past [has] been from these traditional sources, right. Going forward, ERCOT, who operates the state’s power grid, they’re predicting energy demand in Texas could double by 2030. And the largest percentage of that projected energy demand growth comes from data centers.

And so, yes, it’s going to be a current and future story as opposed to have been something in the past.

Well, what about the power generation mix for Texas? Is anything changing on that front?

And you know, as you look at these three states, are there any comparisons? Somebody doing it better than than we are right now? And of course, there’s been a lot of focus on the fact that we are not fully integrated with the national grid.

Well, renewables is a big piece for California, right? They’re very environmentally friendly, they’ve been focused on solar so much. It’s the largest generator of solar power in the U.S. But then it’s followed by Texas and Florida, actually, in second and third place.

And then when you talk about wind power, Texas is a leading source for that – accounts for up to a third of total U.S. wind power generation.

But it’s just a story of of size, right? So when we talk about Texas, they consume more coal, natural gas and petroleum than any other state, right, but is also second only to California in terms of renewable energy consumption.

So yes, the mix is changing, but Texas is consuming all of these things – like half of the power generation is met by natural gas right now, about 22% by winds, and 8% by solar, 30% from wind and solar, 12% coal, 7% nuclear.

But Matt, if you step back further – and you were talking earlier about how we’re looking at double the demand by 2030, I think you you were saying… What are the long-term fixes?

It’s got to be everything, right? It’s gotta be a combination of those factors.

The challenge still remains with solar and wind is that it’s not baseload for power generation. So there is much more emphasis going forward here on the solar side of things, but it’s emphasis across these various different commodities I’ve mentioned to meet this need.

One thing to bear in mind, too, is that this demand growth is not just coming from data centers, but is coming from an ongoing increasing population in Texas. Cryptocurrency mining, hotter weather… There’s a number of factors, right?

It’s not just hinging on these data centers, it’s going to be coming regardless, given the variety of demand pulls going on here.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ercot-media-tour_41235273065_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 13:05:08.180171

By 2030, AI data centers could consume nearly 10% of all the electricity produced in the United States.

That’s more power than every home in California and New York combined.

And we’re feeling the strain already.

In Virginia — the epicenter of America’s data center industry — utilities are warning of multi-year delays to connect new projects. And in Georgia and Texas, regulators are scrambling to approve new natural gas plants just to keep up with the demand.

Even Wall Street is on high alert about this issue. Goldman Sachs estimates that power demand from U.S. data centers will more than double by 2030, driven almost entirely by AI.

Yet our power grid is already stretched to its limits.

And if the grid can’t keep up, then how will America power the next generation of AI?

We’ve talked about how nuclear energy might become the ultimate power source for AI…

And how fusion could provide unlimited energy in the future.

But what if I told you that the Earth’s crust holds a surprising energy source that could supply humanity’s energy needs for the next 170,000 years?

Enter Hydrogen

Clean energy proponents usually focus on solar panels or wind turbines.

But without steady backup, they can leave entire regions vulnerable when demand surges or the weather turns.

These energy sources also take up a lot of land, and communities often push back because they don’t want turbines or solar fields hurting their views or property values.

That’s why a different clean technology has started moving into the spotlight…

Hydrogen fuel cells.

Instead of burning fuel, a hydrogen cell splits molecules to generate electricity.

The only byproduct they create is water, and that can be reused for cooling in data centers.

To be clear, this isn’t a new technology. Hydrogen fuel cells have been a niche source of energy for decades now.

They’ve been used as backup power for telecom towers and in experimental buses in California. They’ve even been used in forklifts in Amazon’s warehouses.

But now, they’re being scaled to power some of the most energy-hungry machines on Earth.

The best example sits just outside Houston, where a startup called ECL has built what it calls the world’s first off-grid, hydrogen-powered AI campus.

This pilot facility runs one megawatt of fuel cell capacity. That’s enough to drive racks of NVIDIA’s latest GB300 and NVL72 systems, which are some of the most advanced AI chips on the market.

But ECL isn’t stopping there.

Its next phase calls for one gigawatt of capacity. That’s a thousand-fold jump.

For perspective, that’s the size of a full-scale nuclear plant. Except this facility will be modular, scalable and emission-free.

What makes ECL’s design unique is its efficiency. The data center runs at a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of just 1.1, compared to a typical facility’s 1.5 or higher.

And wastewater from the cells is captured and recycled to cool the data center. That means there’s no need for external water. And that’s going to be critical as droughts continue to hit the American West.

It also shows why hydrogen has recently started getting federal backing.

In late 2023, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced $7 billion in federal funding to launch seven regional clean hydrogen hubs to accelerate hydrogen production, storage and distribution.

These hubs were planned to span regions including the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Appalachia, and were chosen to anchor new hydrogen infrastructure across strategic corridors.

The DOE anticipated that, with the help of private companies, the total investment could rise to nearly $50 billion.

But that hit a snag last week when the DOE announced it would cancel over $7.5 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects.

Among those planned cancellations was funding for proposed hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest.

But if we can get past partisan politics and focus on what’s best for our country’s energy needs, new hydrogen hubs could be a huge boon for both AI and our environment.

Here’s My Take

Until now, hydrogen’s biggest problem has been finding a customer big enough to justify scaling up.

If AI data centers become that customer, the rollout of hydrogen as an energy source could accelerate much faster than expected.

But hydrogen isn’t a silver bullet that will instantly solve our energy needs. And there are still some major issues that need to be solved.

Most hydrogen today is made from natural gas, not renewable electricity. Transporting and storing it at scale is expensive. And hydrogen fuel cells must prove they can run for years without downtime. That’s a non-negotiable requirement for hyperscale computing.

But AI is forcing the U.S. to rethink how it generates and delivers power. And hydrogen is one of the few technologies that can deliver large amounts of electricity, on-site, without waiting decades for new transmission lines.

A recent report indicates that Earth’s crust could hold naturally occurring hydrogen reserves large enough to supply humanity’s energy needs for 170,000 years.

That would mean a cheaper, faster path to off-grid hydrogen data centers…

And a new energy race over who taps those underground reserves first.

But even though this report is promising, most experts see it as a long-shot scenario that’s still years from proving viable at scale.

I’m bullish on hydrogen as the “fuel of the future.”

And with AI demand surging past what the grid can supply, that future might be closer than we think.

The company posted a series of cryptic social media clips over the weekend that drew attention from investors and enthusiasts alike.

One video featured a black, hubcap-like object with the Tesla logo spinning before the numbers “10/7” appeared — likely pointing to an October 7 announcement.

Another showed a car shrouded in darkness, with only its headlights visible.

Tesla shares were up 3% in early trading at ₹443.26, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.

Speculation grows around Tesla’s next model

Tesla’s last major product launch came nearly two years ago with the Cybertruck, a highly anticipated pickup that has since underperformed expectations.

Executives have indicated that a lower-cost version of the Model Y is in development to help sustain sales following the expiration of US electric vehicle tax credits.

Another long-awaited model is the second-generation Roadster, a project first showcased in 2017.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in February 2024 that Tesla was aiming to ship the vehicle this year, but no official timeline has since been confirmed.

The company could benefit from a new model introduction.

Through September, Tesla sold about 1.22 million cars in 2025, down 6% from the same period a year earlier, despite record third-quarter deliveries of nearly 500,000 vehicles.

Analysts on Tesla stock

Tesla stock fell 2.4% last week, even after reporting stronger-than-expected delivery numbers on Thursday.

The muted reaction followed a roughly 40% rally in the month leading up to the report, suggesting the strong results were already priced in.

JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman raised his price target on Tesla shares from ₹115 to ₹150 but maintained an Underweight rating.

He noted that third-quarter deliveries of 497,000 vehicles exceeded forecasts by around 12% but described the strength as a “temporary pull-forward” ahead of the expiration of US EV credits.

JP Morgan expects Tesla to post earnings per share of ₹0.59 for the quarter, about 18% lower than a year earlier.

Analysts are now focused on how Tesla’s demand will hold up without federal incentives.

Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan warned that fourth-quarter deliveries could weaken as Tesla tapers discounts and promotional offers.

He forecast added margin pressure and lower regulatory credit sales, placing his 2025 earnings estimate 29% below Wall Street’s consensus.

Goldman Sachs analysts also flagged the loss of tax credits as a near-term challenge but said the company could find support from seasonal demand trends, new model launches, and upcoming events such as its shareholder meeting on November 6.

At present, investor attention is centred on Tesla’s mysterious October 7 announcement, which could determine whether the company can reignite growth momentum after a subdued year for electric-vehicle sales.

EV market faces sharp decline as tax credits expire

The expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on October 1, 2025, has sent shockwaves through the electric vehicle market, with immediate implications for battery demand. Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that EV market share will plummet by more than half to between 4% and 5% of total sales by year's end, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal.

""We expect a pretty deep fall off,"" Farley stated, while Nissan Americas Chairman Christian Meunier warned that ""October should be the worst market in years for EVs.""

The credit's final month saw a surge in EV sales, with electric models representing an estimated 12.2% of retail sales in September—a record share that now appears unsustainable. Dealers currently hold approximately 134,000 unsold EVs, representing a two-month supply at current sales rates, according to Cox Automotive data cited in the WSJ report.

Consumer sentiment reflects this market uncertainty. A Harris Poll survey found that nearly a third of consumers who were likely to buy an electric vehicle would either be much less likely to consider an EV or won't consider one at all without the federal tax credit. While 54% of these ""EV defectors"" said they'll return to gasoline vehicles, 30% indicated they'd choose hybrids instead—a shift that still impacts battery demand but at reduced scale.

$7.6 billion in clean energy projects axed

The administration's broader assault on clean energy infrastructure became evident with the Energy Department's October 2 announcement canceling $7.56 billion in funding for 223 clean energy projects. The cuts, reported by the Washington Post, disproportionately affect Democratic-led states and include numerous battery storage initiatives.

Among the canceled projects was a $30 million award for battery storage at a California children's hospital and at least $15 million for battery storage and grid upgrades serving Indigenous communities in New Mexico. The cuts also eliminated funding for a project that would have added 28 gigawatts of new energy generation to Minnesota's power grid, mostly from wind and solar—capacity that would have required substantial battery storage integration.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the cancellations, claiming in a statement that the projects ""did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.""

Notably, 26% of the terminated awards—valued at over $3.1 billion—were issued between Election Day and Inauguration Day, suggesting the previous administration's rush to secure funding before the transition.

Strategic investment in the domestic lithium supply chain

Paradoxically, while dismantling renewable energy projects, the Trump administration is simultaneously investing in the battery supply chain's foundation. The Energy Department announced it will take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and its Nevada Thacker Pass mining project, restructuring a $2.26 billion loan agreement from 2024.

""It's in America's best interest to get that mine built,"" Wright told Bloomberg Television, emphasizing that Thacker Pass production could help reduce China's dominance in the lithium market.

The Thacker Pass project, among the largest known lithium deposits in the US, is expected to produce 88 million pounds annually of lithium carbonate for lithium-ion batteries. This investment aligns with broader Trump administration efforts to secure domestic control of critical materials, including similar equity stakes in rare-earths miner MP Materials and strategic positions in the steel and semiconductor sectors.

Industry adaptation and market reality

Automakers are scrambling to adapt to the new landscape. General Motors and Ford have committed to extending EV incentives temporarily, with GM working on dealer programs to effectively continue the $7,500 credit for leases. Hyundai is offering $7,500 discounts on remaining 2025 model EVs and cutting 2026 Ioniq 5 prices by up to $9,800.

However, these manufacturer-funded incentives represent significant financial strain. Ford expects to lose approximately $5 billion in its EV business this year, and CEO Farley acknowledged that promotional programs ""are not going to last forever.""

The fundamental challenge remains cost competitiveness. The average EV sold for upward of $57,000 in August—over $9,000 more than comparable gas-powered vehicles, according to Cox Automotive data from the WSJ report. This price gap, previously bridged by federal incentives, now represents a substantial market barrier.

Battery industry implications

For the battery industry, these developments create a complex operating environment. The elimination of EV incentives and renewable energy projects reduces near-term demand for battery storage systems across transportation and grid applications. The Harris Poll data suggesting that a majority of EV defectors would reconsider with incentives of at least $5,000 indicates that battery demand remains price-sensitive and policy-dependent.

Yet the lithium mining investment signals recognition that battery technology remains strategically important for national competitiveness. The administration's focus on supply chain security over demand stimulation suggests a belief that market forces will eventually drive adoption while ensuring domestic control of critical materials.

This ""one step forward, two steps back"" approach leaves battery manufacturers navigating reduced immediate demand while potentially benefiting from more secure, domestically-sourced raw materials in the long term. The challenge will be surviving the transition period as the market adjusts to new economic realities without federal support for deployment while building toward eventual cost parity and renewed growth.

The administration's contradictory signals reflect the complex politics of energy transition, acknowledging the strategic importance of battery technology while ideologically opposing the policies that would accelerate its adoption. For an industry built on the promise of clean energy transformation, the path forward requires adapting to a landscape where government support flows toward supply chains rather than market development.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltbb8dbb8002daade2/68e3e31d2c719e8cf9599ce6/DOE-Sec-Wright-2223538060.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-06 13:03:54.268634

Four factors ultimately drove Talon’s pivot to TOPCon technology.
First, the realisation that TOPCon cells could serve as effective back cells for future perovskite tandems, maintaining the company’s long-term technology roadmap.
Second, existing US infrastructure was better suited to integrate TOPCon cells into p-type production lines compared to HJT.
Fraunhofer partnership and R&D strategy A key pillar of Talon’s technology development is its partnership with Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE.","“As we went down the road of TOPCon, of course this lawfare that’s happening with intellectual property in the TOPCon space was prevalent,” Tesanovich explains. “So we took a deep dive to look at what IP we could be infringing on. After that analysis, because we’re utilising PVD in our process versus PECVD or other CVD processes, the only IP that we really infringed on was the TetraSun IP from First Solar.”

The TOPCon patent challenge

TOPCon technology has been considered too risky for US manufacturers due to extensive patent litigation between major Asian producers. The technology has been at the centre of what Tesanovich calls “lawfare” – with companies like Maxeon, LG, and Trina locked in patent disputes. Last month, in an interview with PV Tech, the CEO of another US cell production start-up, ES Foundry, expressed his belief that no company can safely produce TOPCon cells in the US without fear of litigation.

But Tesanovich is confident in Talon’s position. By using physical vapour deposition (PVD) rather than chemical vapour deposition (CVD) processes, the company believes it sidesteps most patent issues. The crucial breakthrough came through securing a licensing agreement with First Solar for the TetraSun intellectual property.

“We reached out to First Solar. We’re very aligned on our idea of what the domestic marketplace should look like,” Tesanovich says. “Because of that and also utilising TOPCon cells as back cells and their drive towards perovskites in tandem to supplement their thin film, we really found a great strategic partner in the industry, almost a big brother.”

This partnership makes Talon “the only licence holder in the US that has the ability to produce TOPCon cells that are free and clear of IP”, according to Tesanovich. The company has also engaged directly with other TOPCon IP stakeholders, conducting detailed discussions about potential infringement. “Those conversations have been very positive, and, at this point, we feel that we’re free and clear,” he adds.

From HJT to TOPCon

Talon’s journey began in an unlikely place: the oil and gas industry. Tesanovich and his partners Brandon Dewan and Jared Light built Eagle Group from a small business in 2013 into a major supplier of metallurgical products for hydrocarbon transmission and drilling, serving clients including BP, Repsol, Shell and Chevron.

“A lot of our clients were companies that were getting into renewables, and specifically we saw solar as a great opportunity,” Tesanovich recalls. The team recognised that while the US had lost much of its solar manufacturing intellectual property and footprint to Asia over the past 15 years, there was now “an immediate need for manufacturing here in the US”.

Initially, the company planned to manufacture heterojunction (HJT) cells, attracted by their compatibility with future perovskite tandem technologies. However, market feedback from potential customers proved sobering.

“As we went to market with HJT plans, the initial reception was positive, but as we started drilling down into it and the 45X [tax credit] was kicking in, a lot of the module companies were very hesitant to want to try a new technology,” Tesanovich explains. Module manufacturers would need to adjust stringers and temperatures for HJT cells, creating operational complications they preferred to avoid while benefiting from existing tax incentives.

Four factors ultimately drove Talon’s pivot to TOPCon technology. First, the realisation that TOPCon cells could serve as effective back cells for future perovskite tandems, maintaining the company’s long-term technology roadmap. Second, existing US infrastructure was better suited to integrate TOPCon cells into p-type production lines compared to HJT. Third, HJT technology remained “somewhat unproven in the field”, says Tesanovich. Finally, even Asian manufacturers were “running into difficulties producing HJT cells at a reasonable cost”, Tesanovich says.

The shift also aligned with market constraints in the US caused by ongoing patent litigation. “Having a TOPCon cell is more than good for the US marketplace,” Tesanovich notes.

European equipment, American manufacturing

Talon has made a bold bet on European equipment suppliers, challenging industry conventional wisdom. At Intersolar in Munich two years ago, Tesanovich recalls sitting on a panel where “everybody was saying it’s impossible to utilise European equipment and create a business case that supports the higher capex cost”.

“We took that as a challenge,” he says. The company’s analysis showed that while European equipment requires higher capital expenditure, operational expenses are significantly lower due to reduced power usage, water consumption, downtime and staffing requirements. “You hit parity within two to three years on the higher capex because it saves on opex.”

The European equipment strategy also provides strategic advantages, including local spare parts availability and reduced dependence on Southeast Asian supply chains. Crucially, Talon has “zero FEOC IP” and “zero FEOC investment” in its project, insulating it from Foreign Entity of Concern regulations that have complicated other US solar projects, Tesanovich claims.

Fraunhofer partnership and R&D strategy

A key pillar of Talon’s technology development is its partnership with Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE. Rather than building an R&D facility in Houston, the company decided to invest in a pilot line at Fraunhofer’s Freiburg facility.

“We were going to do our R&D and pilot line here in the US at our facility,” Tesanovich explains. “What we realised is that was going to be a very myopic focus on our current equipment versus a wider vision around what are the next technologies, what are the new advancements that are coming in. Fraunhofer is probably best in class in the world on that. And so we decided that we would put invest in a pilot line with Fraunhofer and our equipment suppliers in Freiburg, Germany.”

The pilot line, coming online in Q2 2026, will produce G12, M10, and larger format cells using identical equipment to Talon’s main production lines. This approach allows the company to dial in formulas and processes before its Houston facility reaches full production, enabling rapid ramp-up while providing training opportunities for US-based teams. Another benefit is that Talon will be able to send its team over to Fraunhofer to train on the same equipment that will be used in the eventual production line.

Importantly, the equipment already has the capability to deposit perovskite tandem layers, a factor that Tesanovich says positions Talon well to have a headstart in this emerging area of PV technology. “What we’re doing is coming together to create a handshake from scalable commercial industrial manufacturing already having that capability in our tools,” he says. “This is a strategy that we’ve deployed to get tandem and perovskite cells out into the marketplace sooner than later.

Policy tailwinds and market demand

Despite the policy uncertainties for the US solar industry following the recent enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Tesanovich sees the regulatory environment as providing “quite a bit of tailwind” for Talon’s project. The combination of manufacturing tax credits (45X) and deployment incentives creates what he calls “carrots and sticks” that benefit domestic manufacturers.

“The majority of developers have already safe harboured their projects for the next four to five years,” he notes, referring to projects that locked in favourable tax treatment before recent policy changes. This provides demand visibility even as some incentive programmes face uncertainty.

The company has also benefited from strong support from AI and data centre companies that have been “very vocal in their support of solar and battery” for powering their facilities. Solar and battery storage represent “the only deployable power source that is short-term,” compared to natural gas projects requiring at least two to three years and nuclear projects taking 10-15 years.

“The only way to win the AI race is via solar and battery, and that has become clear to this administration,” Tesanovich observes.

Supply chain and customer base

Talon has secured partnerships with domestic suppliers including Hemlock and Corning for polysilicon and wafers, as well as Nowegian ingot and wafter producer NorSun as that company develops its capabilities. This domestic supply chain approach aligns with growing demand from independent power producers (IPPs) and developers seeking “non-FEOC supply chain” options.

The company’s facility is “essentially completely booked for the next three to five years, depending on the contract”, with strong demand from IPPs and developers. Tesanovich notes that Talon provides value to various industry participants, including potential competitors, by offering cells that won’t trigger patent litigation for module manufacturers.

Talon expects to begin commercial production in Q1 2027, with its Houston facility already secured, along with necessary permits, power, water and wastewater infrastructure. The company has invested heavily in workforce development, establishing programmes at local high schools and trade schools while partnering with Rice University for advanced technical training.

“We’ve spent a lot of time on the front side of our workforce development,” Tesanovich emphasises, noting strong local enthusiasm for these educational initiatives.

Technology reliability and future outlook

Addressing concerns about TOPCon’s field reliability, Tesanovich points to recent research that has resolved early degradation issues. “By utilising good quality inputs as well as playing with formulas to remove aluminium, the industry has found their way around that,” he explains. “Fraunhofer and others have done extensive research on the degradation in TOPCon, and there is a very clear pathway to not having those issues in the marketplace.”

As Talon prepares to begin production, the company represents a test case for whether US manufacturers can successfully compete in solar cell production using advanced technologies and European equipment partnerships. The industry will no doubt be watching keenly to see if Talon’s strategy of producing TOPCon cells in the US without being dragged into patent battles pays off.

Its success or failure will likely influence whether other US entrepreneurs follow Talon’s path or continue to view domestic solar cell manufacturing as more trouble than it’s worth.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Talon-PV.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 15:07:42.210789

BMW and Stellantis (parent company of Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and other brands) will offer $7,500 discounts on electric vehicles (EVs) now that the federal government no longer does.

The two join General Motors and Ford in finding creative ways to extend a discount to match the faded federal incentive.

The federal government offered a tax incentive of up to $7,500 off the purchase or lease of many new EVs as part of a program meant to encourage automakers to shift factories and supply chains to the U.S. The federal incentive ended when October began, torpedoed by a new law pushed by President Trump.

Automakers sold record numbers of EVs in the third quarter as the deadline approached. But analysts from Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive expect fourth-quarter EV sales to plummet as the discount fades. EV sales will likely find a new level and begin growing slowly sometime next year.

So, some automakers are trying to keep it going — at least until dealers can sell down some of the inventory they currently hold.

BMW’s website shows a $7,500 discount on all of its current EVs, with a note that buyers “must take delivery by October 31st, 2025.”

The Detroit Free Press reports that Stellantis will do the same.

It’s been a tough year for recyclers in the U.S., most of whom are facing various levels of uncertainty related to the interconnected effects of tariffs, labor constraints and consumer confidence.

Though global and domestic economic pressures are expected to continue into next year, there’s reason to be optimistic about longer-term economic trends that could spur future demand for recycled content, said Emily Sanchez, chief economist at the Recycled Materials Association, at the National Recycling Congress at Wichita State University in Nebraska.

“The industry has always thrived on being innovative. They’ve always thrived on being adaptive. Recycling is fundamentally about solving the eternal problem of scarcity, turning waste into resources,” she said.

Sanchez outlined recent economic headwinds and trends during a presentation on Oct. 3.

Tariffs have already reshaped commodity markets and created destabilizing economic conditions for recyclers in the U.S., particularly those who have more of a dependency on exports and those whose businesses are closer to hard-hit industries, she said. “These policy shifts have been making planning really impossible, but recyclers have been just adapting as best as they can,” Sanchez said.

Overarching U.S. labor market trends are also affecting recyclers. There’s a “downshift in growth and job growth that’s underway,” she said, driven in part by higher cost pressures from tariffs, inflation worries and other factors.

During Q2 earnings calls this summer, several major publicly traded waste companies reported a range of these headwinds were affecting their guidance this year. Most reported lower commodity prices were weighing on earnings, combined with higher labor costs and manufacturing softness. But Republic Services CFO Brian DelGhiaccio predicted the macro environment for manufacturing could turn around in coming years.

Immigration policy is also contributing to labor market weakness, Sanchez said. “Changes in immigration policy have reduced the labor pool and in a really big way in certain sectors. And then on the demand side, the demand for jobs has been really soft.”

Meanwhile, consumer spending is expected to slow down as the year goes on, in part because of these job trends, she said. That lower consumer demand means companies aren’t churning out as many new products, including those made with recycled materials.

The Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and indicated that it could again lower rates later in October.

“I’m particularly looking at how that’s going to affect demand in certain markets that impact recycled materials, like in cars, auto parts, houses and [capital expenditures],” Sanchez said. “These capital expenditures might require recycled inputs, or [generate] recyclable materials at some point in the future.”

Sanchez said companies that have delayed major investments this year have had a direct impact on the industry, but such caution may lead to pent-up demand for recycled materials as early as next year. “There were a lot of companies that have just been postponing purchases today, and they’re going to need materials tomorrow,” she said.

Meanwhile, U.S. recyclers are also weathering global economic impacts, such as a slowdown of global growth that likely means less demand for recycled materials, Sanchez said. She estimates global real GDP growth will be about 3% this year, and decrease slightly to about 2.9% in 2026.

“By this point of the year, we’re seeing that goods trade is weak, and that matters a lot, since so much of goods are made with international supply chains, and then there’s just tremendous uncertainty and a lot of unsettled policy risk,” she said.

But despite geopolitical challenges, she sees a silver lining: “The pace of global growth has actually been pretty resilient” this year, she said.

Under the deal, green electricity from two solar farms will be supplied to French national railway company SNCF Voyageurs in a move to accelerate the shift to cleaner, fossil-free public transport.

Developed and constructed by global renewable energy company BayWa r.e. and acquired through Octopus’ Sky fund, the solar farms Greenberry and Fontenet 3 (pictured), are expected to deliver over 100GWh of green electricity each year.

The two solar farms are located on former military bases in central and south-west France. Over the agreement’s 25-year period, these solar farms will produce 2.5TWh of clean electricity – enough to power 15,500 TGV trips from Paris to Rennes each year. It marks BayWa r.e.’s and Octopus’ first agreement of this kind in France.

The move brings SNCF Voyageurs a step closer to its sustainability goals. Since 2018, SNCF Voyageurs has expanded its corporate PPA programme, aiming to source 20% of its electricity through CPPAs.

It comes as Octopus is expanding its footprint in France, now managing over 500MW of solar and wind projects and supplying energy to more than 600,000 homes through its retail business.

SNCF Energie’s managing director Richard Fécamp said: “This is a huge leap forward for SNCF’s ambition to decarbonise and expand rail transport.

“As one of France’s largest energy consumers, we aim to source between 40% and 50% of the electricity consumed by our trains from renewables by 2030, including 20% from PPAs.

“The Fontenet 3 and Greenberry PPAs represent significant progress in our commitment to clean energy transformation.”

BayWa r.e. chief operations officer Daniel Gaefke said: “Completing the negotiation of these two PPAs in just three months – from kick-off to signature – underscores what a perfect match this collaboration is and our commitment to delivering large-scale renewable solutions at pace.

“We’re proud to support SNCF’s green rail ambitions by providing expert technical management to Octopus’ assets and look forward to working together with our valued partners on many more projects to advance decarbonisation across France and beyond.”

Co-head of Octopus Energy Generation Alex Brierly added: “Travelling by train is already one of the cleanest ways to get around, and we’re proud to help put SNCF’s trains on an even greener track. We’ve already invested in over 30 solar and wind projects across France, and we’ll continue to steam ahead to power the country’s green energy future.”",https://renews.biz/media/35198/fontenet-3-solar-farm-credit-baywa-re.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-10-06 13:04:00.807990

This edition of the Projects Weekly highlights several milestones in the world of solar. To start things off, EDF power solutions North America and El Paso Electric announced the start of commercial operations at the Milagro Energy Center in New Mexico. Avangrid has begun install solar panels for the Tower Solar project in Oregon. TurningPoint Energy and Pivot Energy have launched a new solar project in Maryland. Ameresco and the city of Olympia, Washington, have broken ground on a nearly $17 million building retrofit project at the 86-year-old Olympia Armory. X-ELIO has powered on a solar + storage plant in Texas that will supply BASF Freeport operations. A car dealership in Pomeroy, Ohio, flipped the switch on a new solar energy system to power operations. Bearing manufacturer Schaeffler has added a rooftop solar system at its facility in Connecticut. Finally, after years of planning, New Mexico has launched its long-awaited community solar program. And speaking of projects, don’t forget to vote for the 2025 Project of the Year Awards.

EDF and El Paso Electric begin commercial operations at Milagro Energy Center

EDF power solutions North America and El Paso Electric (EPE) have started operations at the Milagro Solar + Storage project in New Mexico with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by 100 guests. The 150 MWdc solar photovoltaic project combined with a 75 MWac / 4-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) will supply electricity to EPE under a 20-year PPA.

“Launching our first solar and storage project in New Mexico is an exciting milestone, and we look forward to supporting EPE as this project delivers long-term price stability, stimulates economic growth, and reduces emissions,” said Kate O’Hair, senior VP of U,S, development for EDF power solutions.

Situated on private land in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, New Mexico, the Milagro Solar + Storage project is designed to store electricity during peak hours for solar generation in a series of batteries. This stored energy is then dispatched when needed to help manage capacity demand, creating a balance between electricity generation and demand. Energy storage can manage evening energy ramps, mitigate curtailment and provide grid stability.

Cool factor: The project created approximately 200 jobs during its peak construction phase, with 100 positions filled by New Mexico residents. Over Milagro’s operating lifespan, it is expected to generate around $18 million in tax revenue for Doña Ana County, and its school districts supported under the Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB).

“This achievement involved 300,000 labor hours dedicated to installing 282,000 solar panels, all completed without a single recordable incident,” said Nick Bergren, project manager for Blattner Energy, which constructed the project.

Avangrid begins panel installation on Tower Solar project

Avangrid Inc. has started to install solar panels at its Tower Solar project in Morrow County, Oregon. When completed, Tower Solar will deliver energy to the Portland General Electric (PGE) power grid and help power a new QTS data center campus that will support Meta’s operations in the region.

“Installing these first panels marks a major milestone for this new solar project in Oregon and adds to Avangrid’s growing fleet of energy facilities across the nation,” said Jose Antonio Miranda, Avangrid CEO. “Tower Solar will bring much needed capacity to the regional electric grid, improving the reliability and availability of electricity.”

Tower Solar is located just west of Boardman, Oregon, and located on about 900 acres of industrially zoned land owned by the Port of Morrow. The project will utilize more than 200,000 solar panels assembled by SEG Solar in its newly built Houston manufacturing facility. Avangrid was SEG Solar’s first utility-scale customer to receive solar modules assembled from its new U.S. facility. The total installed capacity of Tower Solar will be 166 MWdc (120 MWac).

Cool factor: At the peak of construction, Avangrid expects Tower Solar to create more than 200 jobs, the vast majority of which will be sourced from the region. Tower Solar is expected to pay about $20 million in combined PILOTs (payment in lieu of taxes) and property taxes which will support a variety of public services, including education. Tower Solar will deliver energy to PGE’s grid through Green Future Impact (GFI), a voluntary program designed to help large commercial, industrial, and municipal customers meet their ambitious sustainability and carbon reduction goals through the development of new clean energy facilities in our region.

“The Tower Solar project represents a meaningful step in Morrow County’s continued economic diversification,” said David Sykes, Chair of the Morrow County Commission. “By embracing renewable energy, we’re not only creating jobs and strengthening our local economy. We’re investing in a more resilient future for our citizens.”

Powering up Maryland with 16.6 MW solar portfolio near Baltimore

Maryland’s Baltimore region has a new 2.9 MWdc solar farm. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held at the Clarksville (Howard County), Maryland solar site on Sept. 25 to celebrate the energization of the new community solar farm. Distinguished guests, as well as employees from TurningPoint Energy (TPE) and Pivot Energy, joined community members to mark the completion of the solar project.

“In addition to renewable energy benefits, this solar farm will support dual-use solar, sheep grazing, native pollinator planting, and other efforts to ensure the long-term productivity of this land,” said Samantha Frick, director of community relations and impact at Pivot.

The solar farm was developed by TPE, a leading greenfield developer in Maryland, and is owned and operated by Pivot, a national renewable energy provider and independent power producer. This solar farm is the first to go online in a six-project,16.6 MWdc, portfolio developed by TPE, and built, operated, and owned by Pivot.

Cool factor: With construction completed this summer, this project represents a significant addition to the state’s solar generating capacity and will play a role in helping Maryland achieve its 50% renewable electricity goal by 2030. It will generate approximately 4.25 million kWh of affordable renewable energy annually, enough to power the equivalent of up to 370 Maryland homes. The solar array is made up of nearly 5,500 solar modules, enough to fill nearly 10 football fields.

This project is part of Maryland’s innovative Community Solar Energy Generating System (CSEGS) Pilot Program, which expands access to affordable energy. Community solar enables Baltimore Gas & Electric (BG&E) customers to gain access to lower-cost, renewable energy generated locally. Subscribers to this community solar farm will save an average of 10% off their electricity bill each year. Reflecting strong community engagement, the project is now fully subscribed, with 11 unique participants, including a local church, demonstrating local interest in shared renewable energy solutions.

Ameresco breaks ground on building retrofit in Olympia, Washington

Ameresco Inc. broke ground on a building retrofit project that will add a 150 kW solar system at the Olympia Armory, in Olympia, Washington. The approximately $17 million multi-phase adaptive reuse project will start with upgrades to the 86-year-old building that address safety requirements, improve accessibility, and enhance energy efficiency. Improvements to the building and the installation of a solar PV system will proceed in parallel. The solar technology will facilitate on-site energy generation and support ongoing cost reductions.

In total, the project is anticipated to take approximately 18 months to complete. The multiphase infrastructure improvement initiative is being delivered through an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) with Ameresco, who provided price and performance guarantees and helped ensure participation from local businesses and key community stakeholders.

Cool factor: The Olympia Armory was first constructed in 1939, on the same site that was previously home to the city’s primary public school, built in 1890. The Armory served as the headquarters for various army units from World War II onward and hosted a range of events from art exhibitions to car shows. It was acquired by the city of Olympia in 2022, and the city contracted with Ameresco to support plans to repurpose the building as a creative campus and arts center for the community.

“We are excited to bring this next iteration of the Olympia Armory to life, building on the site’s history as a community gathering place,” said Valerie Roberts, Armory building manager. “Ameresco is the perfect partner to help execute our vision. Their expertise and innovative approach provide that the Armory is operating efficiently and equipped with the energy resiliency technology to serve our community in its new form.”

X-ELIO powers on Texas solar + storage plant to supply BASF operations

X-ELIO has launched operations at its Liberty Energy Project in Dayton, Texas. The project combines 72 MW of solar PV capacity with an additional 60 MW of battery storage, marking X-ELIO’s first combined solar PV and BESS project in the United States. With Liberty now operational, 100% of the expected imported power at BASF‘s Freeport site will be supplied by renewable energy.

“The inauguration of the Liberty Project marks an important milestone in our journey toward more sustainable operations and enabling the green transformation of our customers,” said Brad Morrison, senior VP and GM at BASF Freeport. “Thanks to our partnership with X-ELIO, we are able to supply 100% of our expected purchased power at our Freeport site from renewable sources. This project supports our long-term commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and reflects the kind of collaboration needed to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.”

Cool factor: BASF will source 48 MW of electricity from the Liberty Project to help power its Freeport site as part of a 12-year power purchase agreement (PPA) announced in 2022. Freeport is one of BASF’s six global Verbund sites, which takes an integrated approach to manufacturing, raw materials and energy management.

“The Liberty Project represents a major step in our planned expansion in the U.S., a key market for X-ELIO,” said Lluís Noguera, chairman and CEO at X-ELIO. “We are currently developing a pipeline of 2.8 GW of solar PV and 2.1 GW of storage projects to advance competitive energy solutions, support local communities, and power a growing American economy.”

Under the umbrella of its Community & Nature Plan Program, X-ELIO coordinated with local partners on several initiatives to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods. These include the creation of the Dwelling Garden in Liberty, a shared green space for the community to gather; the construction of a boardwalk at Kleb Woods Nature Preserve, improving accessibility for people with reduced mobility, families with children, and all community members; and the restoration of the drainage system at the Liberty Food Bank, enhancing safety and enabling the organization to better serve families in need.

Pomeroy, Ohio car dealership adds 196.7 kW solar array

Mark Porter Auto Group in Pomeroy, Ohio, hosted a “flip-switching” event to celebrate the completion of a new solar energy system at its Pomeroy location. The 196.7 kW solar array, designed and built by Kokosing Solar, will generate more than 70% of the dealership’s annual electricity needs.

“This solar array is a great example of how, in the face of increasing electricity costs, local businesses can benefit from proven, cost-saving technology,” said Roberta Washburn of Kokosing Solar.

Cool factor: The system is expected to produce over 236,000 kWh of electricity each year, covering the majority of the dealership’s power demand and significantly reducing utility costs. By lowering reliance on the electric grid, the system also provides long-term stability against unpredictable energy prices.

Funding for the project came from a combination of federal tax incentives and a USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grant. These tools helped reduce upfront costs, making it possible for a small business in rural Ohio to invest in advanced energy technology.

Schaeffler adds rooftop solar to roller bearing plant in Connecticut

Schaeffler, the Motion Technology Company, announces the successful implementation of its first fully owned rooftop solar energy system in the Americas region at its plant in Danbury, Connecticut, marking a major step forward in renewable electricity generation.

Schaeffler’s Danbury facility specializes in the production of high-precision roller bearings, ball bearings and related components that are critical for various aerospace applications. Installed directly on the facility’s rooftop, the solar system began producing electricity in June.

Cool factor: The 1,154 MWp solar system, installed in partnership with Solect Energy, is now fully operational and is expected to supply approximately 13% of the plant’s annual electricity needs.

“This is a major step forward in our journey toward energy efficiency and on our decarbonization pathway,” said Wendell Fenner, plant manager, Danbury. “We are proud that Danbury is leading the way for the Americas region, setting an example of how clean energy can be integrated into our operations to benefit both the environment and our business.”

New Mexico launches first community solar project

After years of planning, the long-awaited launch of New Mexico’s first-ever community solar project is ready to power up. The Cuidando Los Niños Community Solar Project hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Sept. 30, in Belen, New Mexico.

“This project proves that community solar works,” said Cory Felder, Mountain West regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA). “It delivers affordable power, local investment, and community benefits in a way no other clean energy program can. New Mexico has been working toward this moment for years, and today we’re proud to see the vision becoming reality.”

New Mexico passed its community solar law, SB84, in 2021, but the rollout has been delayed by regulatory proceedings and utility processes. The ribbon-cutting shows that the program is finally moving forward, unlocking a pipeline of projects that will deliver savings and resilience to households statewide.

Cool factor: The project, developed by Affordable Solar, demonstrates the power of community solar to lower bills, expand energy choice, and deliver local benefits. Affordable Solar was awarded seven community solar projects across New Mexico, totaling 35 MW — which cumulatively will offset the energy usage of 15,000 homes. In addition to providing clean electricity to subscribers, the project is supporting Cuidando Los Niños’ mission to break the cycle of childhood homelessness. As part of the celebration, Affordable Solar will present a $45,000 donation to the nonprofit.

“We are honored to bring the state’s first community solar project to life right here in Belen,” said Dylan Connelly, Project Developer at Affordable Solar. “Community solar is about more than clean energy—it’s about putting people first. By helping families save on their bills and supporting Cuidando Los Niños with this donation, we’re demonstrating the wide-ranging impact this program can have across New Mexico.”

The Cuidando Los Niños project is fully subscribed, thanks in part to the efforts of community solar subscription provider Solstice, ensuring that New Mexicans, especially those who otherwise could not install solar, can benefit from renewable energy. Importantly, 50% of the project’s energy production is reserved to support qualified low-income households, directly lowering electricity bills for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents.

Dive Brief:

California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week vetoed several pieces of energy legislation, including AB 740, which passed with bipartisan support and would have required the state to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan.

In a letter to the governor last month, more than a dozen trade and environmental advocacy groups urged Newsom to sign AB 740 into law, claiming VPPs could save Californians $750 million per year in system costs and provide more than 7,500 MW of capacity.

Newsom said in a statement that he supported the aim of harnessing distributed energy resources, but that the bill would have resulted in costs to the California Energy Commission’s primary operating fund, “which is currently facing an ongoing structural deficit.”

Dive Insight:

Newsom last month signed into law a broad package of energy legislation that laid the groundwork for a regional Western electricity market, extended the state’s cap and trade program and added $18 billion to the state’s wildfire fund.

But he rejected several bills that passed, and other initiatives that had been favored by clean energy advocates were left on the cutting room floor of negotiations.

Edson Perez, California lead at Advanced Energy United, said the governor’s vetoes “mark a major setback for California's supposed commitment to leveraging readily-available solutions to tackle real affordability problems.”

“Together, these decisions establish Governor Newsom as the state leader who walked away from billions in potential savings for ratepayers at a critical moment in California’s history,” Perez said in a statement.

In addition to AB 740, Newsom also vetoed SB 541, AB 1408 and AB 44.

SB 541 would have required the CEC and the California Public Utilities Commission to analyze load-shifting strategies and publish reports on load-shifting for each electric retail supplier. Newsom said in a statement that the bill was “redundant” of existing efforts and cost prohibitive for the state.

AB 1408 would have required the California Independent System Operator and utilities to integrate surplus interconnection into their planning. In a statement, Newsom said the bill “risks constraining energy resource procurement and interconnection options, likely increasing customer electric costs and undermining electric grid reliability.”

Newsom also vetoed AB 44, which would have codified load flexibility in state grid planning.

Certain dealers fear the removal of the R135 000 tax credit will leave them burdened with unsold electric vehicles.","Speaking at a Detroit gathering recently, Ford chief executive, Jim Farley, described the development as ""a game-changer"", mere hours before the federal subsidy lapsed.

Farley indicated that he would not be surprised if electric car sales plummeted to just 5% of overall US vehicle sales next month. This figure represents approximately half the August level, a monthly high as buyers hastened to benefit from the credit and would rank among the weakest performances in recent years.

Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas, was equally pessimistic: ""The EV market is going to collapse in October."" Whilst Japan's Nissan continues launching a refreshed Nissan Leaf compact EV in the American market, Meunier anticipates intense rivalry as competing manufacturers battle to secure buyers for their electric vehicles.

""That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is an overabundance of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,"" Meunier remarked in an interview with Reuters.

The R135 000 tax credit was initially authorised by Congress in 2008 for electric car and plug-in hybrid vehicle buyers. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act prolonged the incentive, though it simultaneously restricted eligibility to American-built EVs incorporating specified levels of domestically sourced batteries and components.

US President Donald Trump's tax-reduction and spending legislation, enacted in July, established the 30 September termination date. His administration has implemented additional measures potentially hampering EV momentum, including suspending penalties levied on car companies failing to meet fuel-efficiency standards. During last year's campaign, Trump pledged to terminate former President Joe Biden's ""EV mandate"".

Research conducted jointly by academics from the universities of California, Berkeley, Duke and Stanford in November 2024 suggests electric vehicle registrations could decline by 27% in the absence of the tax credit.

The United States trails other principal automotive markets in EV uptake. In China, the world leader in electric vehicles and battery production, the combined sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have exceeded 40% in recent months. Europe's adoption rate has remained near 20%.

Despite the American tax incentive being available, electric car sales growth had already slowed over the previous two years, prior to this summer's deadline-driven surge. This deceleration occurred notwithstanding manufacturers introducing numerous new EV models.

The German government has begun preparations for the next round of its “climate contract” support scheme for industry decarbonisation. For the first time, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and utilisation (CCU) projects will be eligible to participate, the economy ministry said.

Germany aims to become climate neutral by 2045, but CO2 reductions in basic material industries such as steel, cement, paper, glass and chemicals are difficult to achieve, and entirely new and often expensive production methods are needed. With the help of so-called Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD), the government supports climate-friendly manufacturing by bridging the price gap with current carbon-intensive processes, allowing the companies to compete in international markets.

Companies must participate in the preparatory phase if they want to apply for support in the tender, which is expected to begin in mid-2026, the ministry said. During the preparatory phase, companies will also be consulted on the tender rules.

At the start of their term, the governing parties pledged to continue the pioneering ‘climate contracts’ programme of the previous German coalition government. In a first round, fifteen companies were awarded funding in October 2024.

The previous government had opened the preparatory phase for a second round of auctions in summer 2024, but the scheme was put on hold following the collapse of the coalition.

There were 18 items with some kind of measurable economic impact. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was the main agency of the week, providing the most significant regulatory and deregulatory actions of the haul. Across all rulemakings, agencies published roughly $1.9 billion in total costs and added roughly 228,000 paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 37

Final Rules: 97

2025 Total Pages: 48,012

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$74.8 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$628 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week was the rule from EPA regarding “Water Quality Standards To Protect Aquatic Life in the Delaware River.” In particular, the regulation sets “a designated use of protection and propagation of resident and migratory aquatic life and corresponding dissolved oxygen water quality criteria for the mainstem Delaware River in Zone 3, Zone 4, and the upper portion of Zone 5 (in total, river miles 108.4 to 70.0).” EPA issued the proposed version of the rule in 2023, making it an initiative that dates to the Biden Administration. As such, it is hardly surprising that it falls under the “regulatory” side of the ledger for the purposes of Executive Order (EO) 14192. The agency estimates that the rule’s requirements will involve $185.6 million in annualized costs to affected water safety authorities, or roughly $2.3 billion in present value over a 10-year period.

EPA also had a substantial deregulatory action, albeit, one that had more modest estimated cost reductions. The proposed rule on “Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category-Deadline Extensions,” would – as the title suggests – push back some deadlines established under a 2024 rule on the matter. The schedule of extensions is the following:

EPA projects that, under these implementation delays, “estimated annualized cost savings are $79 million to $215 million.” Taking the midpoint of that range means $147 million in annual savings, or roughly $386 million total across a three-year window.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

The ongoing government shutdown is, of course, more of a fiscal matter than a regulatory one. Nevertheless, it will have some impact on the administration’s broader regulatory policy agenda. With agencies generally shuttered, one can already see administrative actions slow to a crawl in the Federal Register. The length of this shutdown will be the primary determinant of how significant this downturn in regulatory activity will be. For instance, looking back to the weeks-long shutdown across 2018 and 2019, the Federal Register had what is likely the lightest issue on record on January 15, 2019, that amounted to a barely half-page notice extending a disaster relief filing deadline.

The only action on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) front was from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) introducing yet another series of resolutions of disapproval against Trump Administration rules – including one that seeks to repeal the Department of Interior’s rule on “Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness: Gulf of America.” The American Action Forum (AAF) CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 64 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives this week urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize rules that prioritize domestic feedstocks and protect U.S. farmers and renewable fuel producers from foreign competition.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers called on the agency to move forward with its proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and to maintain record-high biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes set out earlier this year. They said the policy changes would strengthen American energy security and bolster farm economies across the Midwest.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks,” the members wrote. “The Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.”

The Import RIN reduction, proposed by the EPA in June, would cut in half the RIN credits available for imported renewable fuels or fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Lawmakers argue the move would help level the playing field for American producers facing competition from foreign sources such as Brazilian tallow and used cooking oil imported from China.

The letter also noted that soybean oil plays a key role in the U.S. biofuel industry — though it represents only 20% of the soybean by weight, it accounts for more than half the crop’s market value. About half of that oil is used to make biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“The EPA’s own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal,” the senators wrote. “It will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities.”

Joining Young in signing the letter were Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran of Kansas, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Rounds of South Dakota, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, among others.

Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives also endorsed the letter, including Indiana’s Jim Baird (IN-04), Erin Houchin (IN-09), Mark Messmer (IN-08), and Rudy Yakym (IN-02).

The senators said finalizing the rule would fulfill the intent of Congress under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritize domestic production and job growth in rural communities.

And while the president gets better marks on handling immigration and crime, both issues present potential problems as many Americans believe his administration is going too far. Focus groups and a limited number of new polls tell us that he has lost some ground among young people and minorities who voted for him. The president’s overall approval rating has been fairly steady recently, but that relative stability masks some worrying undercurrents, especially among political independents.

All this said, however, the Democrats aren’t exactly capturing voters’ hearts and minds. And, they still have trouble with their base. In the latest Economist/YouGov survey, 54% of Democrats approved of the job Senator Chuck Schumer was doing. Sixty-two percent of Republicans gave that response about House Republican leader Mike Johnson. A new Pew Research Center survey found that all four congressional leaders were viewed more negatively than positively. Pew noted that “Democrats now express more disapproval of their party’s congressional leadership than at any time in several decades,” while Republicans are more positive about theirs.

Off-year elections, where voter turnout is key, are still more than a year away, and that is an eternity in politics. But in the Economist/YouGov poll, independents, by a 10-point margin, said they would vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress over the GOP one if the election were being held today, although many said they were unsure or wouldn’t vote.

It is worth looking at what we know about people who call themselves independents. A substantial amount of political science research shows that many in this large group actually lean to the Democratic or Republican parties and that only a small number are pure independents. A new CNN analysis of independents, building on a 2007 analysis from the Washington Post, KFF, and Harvard provides some insights into independents today and some clues about why they may be a particularly problematic group for the GOP as we move toward the off-year elections.

In the CNN analysis, 44% of people self-identified themselves as independents when asked the familiar question: In politics, as of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat or an independent? Of the remainder, roughly equal shares said they were Republicans (28%) and Democrats (27%). When the researchers started looking at the independent group as a whole, they found that 24% were Democratic “look-alikes” and 12% Republican ones. These are people who reject the party labels but actually align closely with one of the two parties. They also vote for candidates of the party they look like. As we have come to expect in recent elections, the Democratic lookalikes are more female than male, and the GOP lookalikes are more male than female. Both are mostly white. Slightly more than half of these soft Democrats call themselves progressives. About a third of the Republicans look-alikes say they align with MAGA.

The “Upbeat Outsiders” were 22% of the independent group. The largest age swath in this group are 30 to 49 years old. They don’t tune into politics and a large number of them say they haven’t voted in a decade. CNN calls them “true independents” and in this analysis, they leaned slightly more to Republicans than Democratic. But most don’t truly lean to either party.

The “Disappointed Middle” are 16% of the independents, and more than the other groups they hold unfavorable views of both parties. They still think it is important to participate.

The four Capstone Green Energy C65 systems, fueled by natural gas, will provide reliable, low-maintenance, and quiet on-site power, an important feature given their proximity to classrooms, the project developers say. The CHP systems will reduce utility costs and support the district’s long-term sustainability and resiliency goals by producing both electricity and heat.

The order was secured by Vergent Power Solutions, Capstone’s distributor for the Midwest and Northeast United States and Eastern Canada; it is expected to be commissioned by the end of October 2025. The project is a collaboration between Vergent and Veregy, a NAESCO-accredited, energy services company (ESCO).

“This repeat order from Veregy shows that microturbines are not just a one-off solution; they are a cornerstone of a long-term energy strategy,” said Justin Rathke, President of Vergent. “Their quiet operation and reliability make them an ideal fit for schools, and their ability to generate on-site power and heat helps clients like Valparaiso reduce costs and build a more resilient energy future.”

In 2020, the two companies partnered to bring a Capstone C65 system to Argos Community Schools in Indiana, which improved energy efficiency, lowered costs, and strengthened resiliency. The project exceeded all of its energy conservation goals after five years, the companies say.

The installations are the foundation of Valparaiso’s Phase 2 $17 million Guaranteed Energy Savings Contract (GESC), which includes solar, retro-commissioning, and other energy efficiency upgrades. The Phase 2 project supports the district’s sustainability efforts, which generated more than $7.6 million in projected energy savings over 12 years using solar arrays, LED lighting upgrades, HVAC enhancements, and real-time utility monitoring.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/10/68e3d222896fa9f3ffe3a07c-valparaiso_high_school_front.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-06 13:05:34.068235

“It is now clear that the energy policy shift in the US not only halts or slows progress on offshore wind projects that were previously greenlit but pushes European wind developers away from US investment.
To remain attractive to investors, Orsted and companies like it must evaluate all options for offshore wind developments and their overall US presence.
“Europe’s wind industry has taken notice, and policymakers are mobilizing to help reduce the reliance on Chinese imports and beef up the domestic wind energy supply chain.
Officials hope such measures will encourage manufacturing buildouts while keeping costs in check,” said Andrea Scassola, vice president of supply chain research at Rystad Energy.","As the US aims to decouple from Chinese supply chains by doubling down on its domestic oil and gas resources, industries such as offshore wind have faced a barrage of economic challenges, from stop-work orders, to tax break rollbacks and rising inflationary costs. Despite unfavorable conditions in the US, Rystad Energy research shows new global offshore wind capacity will reach 16 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2025 due to projects already underway, with two thirds of them being developed in China. By 2030, Rystad Energy forecasts China’s offshore wind projects will claim 45% of the world’s cumulative capacity, making it difficult for the US market to compete in the long term, regardless of policy reversals.

“It is now clear that the energy policy shift in the US not only halts or slows progress on offshore wind projects that were previously greenlit but pushes European wind developers away from US investment. The US-China supply chain may be decoupled, but China’s position as a global renewables leader may have only been strengthened because of it,” said Alexander Fløtre, senior vice president and head of offshore wind research, Rystad Energy.

Some clear effects are already emerging. US renewable energy investments have plunged 36% year-on-year so far in 2025, whereas European investments are rising as companies redirect capital away from the US. Stop work orders were issued for both Orsted’s Rhode Island offshore wind development and Equinor’s New York project, with the latter reaching a deal that lifted the administration’s ban. A federal judge has reversed the order on Orsted’s Revolution project, with the question of a continued legal battle waiting to be answered. To remain attractive to investors, Orsted and companies like it must evaluate all options for offshore wind developments and their overall US presence.

On the flipside, China-based CNOOC stated that it is staging its offshore wind portfolio expansion, with a key project in the 1.5 GW Hainan CZ7 aimed to be commissioned before 2030. The project is approved and is to be the first utility-scale project for CNOOC. For European energy companies with less US exposure, their reliance on China and other nations will only be enhanced.

The chances of creating an alternate, renewables-driven supply chain to compete with China are low, with Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) flocking back to the country’s favorable business environment after fleeing in 2020. The challenge is formidable: an analysis of turbine platforms with IEC-type certification commonly used across Europe, for example, reveals that approximately 25% of the manufacturing sites producing key components for Western OEMs are in China.

“Europe’s wind industry has taken notice, and policymakers are mobilizing to help reduce the reliance on Chinese imports and beef up the domestic wind energy supply chain.

The Embark is built on an EV platform developed exclusively for the THOR family of companies by Harbinger Motors. THOR and Harbinger have been working together to develop the platform since 2022, and released some new technical details in April.

The Embark’s center-mounted 140 kWh battery pack delivers 105 miles of electric range—plenty for shorter trips or daily exploration. For longer hauls, it also incorporates a low-emission gasoline range extender that brings total range up to 450 miles.

Embark’s 800-volt electrical architecture allows for rapid charging at DC fast charger locations. The battery pack can also be charged using the traditional power hookups available at most campsites. The motorhome can serve as a mobile energy backup system to power a home in the case of a power outage.

Standard safety features include a backup camera with dynamic trajectory, front and rear ultrasonic collision warnings, and real-time tire pressure monitoring.

“Electrification will play a central role in the future of mobility, including RVing,” said THOR Industries President and CEO Bob Martin. “This first-of-its-kind [electrified] Class A motorhome reinforces THOR’s innovation leadership and offers unapparelled product differentiation for the Entegra Coach brand.”

Embark is now available for orders, and full production is to begin in 2026. Consumers interested in trying an electrified motorhome will be able to rent an Embark from THL in 2026. Entegra Coach plans to use consumer feedback from THL’s rental fleet to make continuous product improvements throughout 2026.

The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.
As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.
Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50 percent market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives.","The electric vehicle and renewable energy industries are bracing for the end of tax credits they had been relying on to rapidly expand the technologies across the U.S.

The phaseout, brought on by the 2025 reconciliation law, hit the EV industry last week with the end of the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit last week he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5 percent after the tax credit ends from around 10 percent to 12 percent now.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller — way smaller than we thought — especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said. “We’re going to find out in a month.”

The tax credit rollback comes on top of the Trump administration’s revamp of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program created by the 2021 infrastructure law. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy suspended the program in February, citing wasteful spending, and later relaunched with pared down standards.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy said in a statement.

In an attempt to soften the blow, automakers Ford and General Motors Co. have plans to use their financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory, allowing the lending arms to qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.

Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and John Barrasso of Wyoming criticized the car companies’ plans, calling on the Treasury to close the automakers’ “loophole” and saying the plans are a “serious violation of Congressional intent.”

“These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off,” they wrote in a letter to the Treasury last week. “[IRS] guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.”

Despite automakers’ efforts to soften the hits to the EV industry, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an interview that the combination of the tax credit phaseout and rollback of other federal programs aimed at boosting battery manufacturing and production fares poorly for the industry.

Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50 percent market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives. Now, she estimates it will be capped at 30 percent.

“It looks like the [auto] companies are going deeper into subprime, and that’s always an indication that sales in general are slowing … and they’re looking to keep the sales pace at a rate that allows them to maybe snowplow a little bit on total revenue,” she said. “We’ve seen several announcements now that these companies are delaying the product cycle for EVs.”

Renewables on deck

The 2025 reconciliation law also put new restrictions on renewable energy production and investment tax credits implemented under a 2022 reconciliation law, moving the timeline to qualify up by several years. Previously, projects needed to begin construction by the end of 2032. Now they must do so by July 4, 2026, or be completed by the end of 2027, to take advantage of the federal support.

“This is an extremely tumultuous time,” said Bonnie Angermeier, senior legislative associate for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “There were promises made by the federal government, and there were strong signals for how they were going to support clean energy development.”

“Essentially, the rug got ripped out from under the clean energy industry,” she added.

Projects able to start construction before next July maintain eligibility for the credits for up to four years, Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said. SEIA is the national trade organization representing the solar and battery storage industry.

“The most advantageous position to be in right now is to qualify for that start of construction provision,” Gallagher said. “Companies that can’t qualify for that start of construction — they’ve got to get those projects online by the end of 2027, and so people are working hard to do that.”

Angermeier agreed, noting that companies focused on residential solar are at an even greater disadvantage.

“They have their pedal to the metal trying to complete projects as quickly as possible because they know that the window of that tax credit closes at the end of this year, which was highly unexpected and puts a ton of pressure on them,” she said.

She noted that the changes are “really throwing a wrench” into utility-scale projects as well, which generally rely on longer timelines to move from planning to completion. Some of those have been canceled as a result of the timeline shift, she added.

A solar markets report from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data and analytics for the renewables, energy and natural resources sectors, found that forecasts of new solar deployment through 2030 could be reduced by as much as 55 gigawatts as a result of federal policy changes this year.

Additional grant funding rescissions have also hit the industry hard as billions of dollars of previously allocated funds have been rescinded by the EPA, Department of Energy and other agencies, sometimes after they had already been dispersed.

Angermeier said the changes taken together have led to project cancellations, pauses, layoffs and the cancellation of new jobs that would have come with planned projects.

“We’re going to see a real restriction of new energy supply as a result of both the [reconciliation] bill and the and the administration’s action since the bill was enacted,” Gallagher said. “And of course, we’re seeing this restriction of new supply at a time when energy demand is booming.”

Wind and solar power have recently been among the fastest growing forms of new generation in the U.S., according to an August report from the Energy Information Administration.

While renewables are expected to account for much of the new generation forecast over the next two years, Gallagher said, “the outlook becomes a little bit hazier when you get out to ‘28 and ‘29.”

Even so, he’s not expecting a long-term chilling effect on the industry, because of continued market demand for renewable energy.

The Trump administration says it doesn’t take issue with renewable energy technologies, but with federal subsidies for them.

“Thirty-three years we’ve subsidized wind and solar power in the United States,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a late September press conference. “If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places.”

Wright and other officials say the administration prefers dense, baseload power that they say can respond to increasing energy demand. Wind and solar struggle with intermittency issues and are therefore less reliable than sources of power like natural gas, coal and nuclear energy, they say.

But supporters of renewable energy call that “hypocritical,” noting federal support for oil and gas projects. Renewables subsidies are “really more about creating an even playing field so that we can meet the demand that we have,” Angermeier said.

Gallagher called the administration’s arguments about reliability “tired,” citing the buildout of battery storage to support solar power.

“It was never really a legitimate criticism,” he said. “And it’s all the less so when we have energy storage that can deliver power reliably when the system needs it.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/barrasso_BC_202_042925.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:08.124992

Under its Capacity*Connect proposal, Xcel Energy will install up to 200 MW of battery storage resources at strategic locations on the grid by 2028. Deployed in collaboration with Sparkfund, the distributed energy resources will help meet increasing demand for electricity, maintain reliable service for customers, maximize the efficiency of existing infrastructure and support local jobs.

“We’re focused on supporting economic growth and the needs of our communities by building out and modernizing our energy grid,” said Ryan Long, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. “We believe distributed energy resources are an important part of that strategy. They will complement our current plans for additional renewable and firm dispatchable generating resources to meet our customers’ needs.”

Xcel Energy’s approach takes advantage of its integrated system planning processes to determine the best customer locations to install the new battery storage resources. The company will integrate the battery storage into its system operations, charging the batteries during times when energy is inexpensive and dispatching that energy to serve all customers during periods of peak demand.

“By storing energy when it’s cheap, delivering it when it’s needed most and placing assets where they maximize grid value, Xcel Energy is delivering reliable energy to customers today and building a grid that is ready for tomorrow,” said Pier LaFarge, CEO of Sparkfund. “Sparkfund will help Xcel Energy deploy distributed energy resources to meet growing customer energy needs, support economic growth in Minnesota and unlock the full value of the U.S. electric grid.”

Battery storage is an important part of Minnesota’s energy future. Xcel Energy’s recently approved Upper Midwest Energy Plan calls for the installation of 600 MW of energy storage by the end of 2030. The proposed distributed capacity procurement will help achieve that goal, and Xcel Energy is bringing it forward to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission with the encouragement of many stakeholders.

Xcel Energy intends to locate the batteries at local businesses, commercial or industrial sites, or nonprofit organizations. This provides more customers — including those in environmental justice communities — with an opportunity to benefit financially from hosting clean energy technologies. Hosts would receive direct payments for participating in the program. Each site will have approximately 1 to 3 MW of storage (1 MW is about the size of a shipping container).

Xcel Energy, in collaboration with Sparkfund, will scale the deployment so the grid can keep pace with increasing demand while prioritizing local workers and complying with the company’s labor standards. Xcel Energy will operate each battery storage asset to maintain safety and security of the system.

With this approach, Xcel Energy and Sparkfund will closely review performance, costs and customer experience as the program grows, ensuring it is cost-effective while supporting a clean, reliable and safe grid.

“The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.” No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25276658907776.41w1FKiQVM.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 12:09:49.763611

Attorneys for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and Rhode Island Center for Justice (RICJ), along with a group of businesses and nonprofits from across the nation, sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today to reverse the Trump administration’s illegal termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program, a program designated by Congress to save money for Rhode Island’s consumers while providing union jobs for Rhode Island workers.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, challenges the EPA’s decision to terminate all funding for the Solar for All program. Local attorneys representing the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government, and the Conservation Law Foundation filed the suit.

Plaintiffs include the RI AFL-CIO, which was relying on Solar for All to expand renewable and cheaper power while ensuring high-quality union careers for a new generation. RI AFL-CIO invested time and money in developing training and apprenticeship programs to increase the implementation of solar energy. The RI Center for Justice is also joining the challenge as a nonprofit working to lower the high cost of electricity for low-income consumers and to provide sustainable, uninterrupted access to vital electricity in their homes by preventing their utilities from being shut off.

“Solar energy is key to Rhode Island’s march towards a carbon-free economy. The Solar for All program is critical to meeting the mandates of the Act on Climate and could lead to hundreds of good-paying union jobs. That is why the Rhode Island AFL-CIO is happy to join this court action,” said Patrick Crowley, President of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. “Our members want this program back up and running as soon as possible.”

“Our clients are struggling with unaffordable electric bills and facing a cycle of shut-offs that puts the health and safety of utility customers, including those who are elderly and living with disabilities, at risk,” said Jennifer L. Wood, Executive Director of Rhode Island Center for Justice. “Affordable access to solar is vital as part of the long-term solution to meeting the Act on Climate goals in Rhode Island while not leaving low-income Rhode Islanders behind. We need this program reinstated so our clients can be included in the benefits of solar energy ‘for all.’”

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” said Amy R. Romero, Chief Legal Counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island. “EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy security in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program. The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

Before EPA’s abrupt termination of the Solar for All program in August 2025, the EPA obligated $7 billion in grant funding that Congress had directed to provide to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits across the country to develop long-lasting solar energy programs for low-income and disadvantaged communities. According to the EPA, the average low-income household benefiting from the Solar for All grant program would have saved about $400 each year from their electricity bills. Programs funded by Solar for All would have created hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs all across the country. Additionally, the EPA estimated that the Solar for All program would have cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, equal to the emissions of over seven million passenger vehicles.

While a subsequent Congress repealed large parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, it explicitly did not repeal the Solar for All program retroactively, rescinding only “unobligated balances.” Yet instead of distributing the Solar for All funds as Congress mandated, the EPA unlawfully announced the termination of the Solar for All program, which will result in the loss of access to affordable solar energy in nearly a million low-income households and the loss of good-paying, high-quality jobs, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities that Congress intended these funds to benefit.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FJun!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147fd6af-1fbf-4685-b4e7-4c9b9cbfd2ea_1500x844.jpeg",N,,2025-10-06 12:07:49.809630

By Apex Clean Energy

Apex Clean Energy is proud to bring Big Bluestem Wind to Henry County, a project designed to deliver clean, reliable electricity while creating long-term economic opportunity for local families, schools, and communities. And despite recent changes in federal legislation — including the phase-out of tax credits and new executive orders — one thing remains steady: renewable energy is the cheapest form of power generation Americans can put on the grid — with or without subsidies.

Built to Last—With or Without Subsidies

Recent federal actions like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Executive Order 14315 have tightened rules around renewable energy tax credits. But here’s the truth: Wind Energy doesn’t depend on subsidies to succeed.

–Economics First: Wind and solar energy are now the most affordable sources of electricity on the grid—even without federal incentives. According to Lazard, wind has seen a cost reduction of 85% over the last 25 years due to innovations in turbine technology, plus markets of scale and improved siting.

–A Technology Improving for You: It’s not just the cost of wind farms that’s better now. Many of the technological innovations in wind energy have improved the experience of living near a wind farm. Serrated turbine blade edges and variable-speed operation both minimize noise. Fewer, taller turbines declutter the view. And the use of Aircraft Detection Lighting Systems (ADLS), on today’s turbines means you won’t see blinking lights unless a plane flies nearby.

—Not Affected by Offshore or Public Land Restrictions: Executive orders restricting the siting of wind energy only apply to offshore wind and the leasing of federal land. Apex is a private company developing projects by leasing private land in accordance with state and local laws.

Jobs, Revenue, and Local Investment

Renewable energy projects like Big Bluestem Wind can be real, homegrown economic drivers.

–Jobs for Local Workers: Big Bluestem will create hundreds of well-paid construction jobs for Illinois laborers, and up to 12 full-time careers.

–Revenue for Schools and Services: Over its lifespan, Big Bluestem will generate $95 million in property tax revenue for schools, fire districts, libraries, and county services. Over $55 million of that will go to local school districts.

–Reliable Lease Payments: Participating landowners will receive annual payments, helping families plan for the future with confidence.

In Illinois alone, Apex projects in development represent over $7.9 billion in projected investment, $66 million in annual payments to landowners, nearly $1.2 billion in local tax revenue during the first 30 years, and over 3.9 gigawatts of homegrown, pollution-free energy.

Meeting Illinois’s Growing Energy Needs

America needs more power. A 2024 survey of 100,000 Americans by Ernst Young found that two-thirds of Americans could not afford a 10% increase in their energy costs, yet prices for consumers are going up as data centers, AI, electrification, and industrial growth drive unprecedented demand. An “all of the above” strategy is needed to deliver more power to the grid, and renewable energy projects like Big Bluestem Wind are doing their part. 95% of projects in the United States in line to be permitted and built are solar, storage, and wind and according to Time, clean power projects can alleviate price pressure on the grid.

Since then, Politico reports, more than 40 states are in the process of unlocking their NEVI funding—and red states like Texas and Montana lead the way. At least 32 say they have gotten a green light. And Trump's Department of Transportation actually seems to be offering more flexibility on where these chargers can be placed.

The publication calls this ""a major acceleration."" More on why, with emphasis mine below:

The new guidance that DOT issued in August largely kept the Biden administration’s rules but ditched a contentious requirement that chargers be placed every 50 miles along major highways. It also directed states to quickly submit updated implementation plans to access the funds. In the weeks since, at least 44 states and Washington, D.C., have submitted their plans, spokespeople for those states told POLITICO.

In a statement Friday, DOT spokesperson Nathaniel Sizemore said the Biden administration had added requirements to NEVI that were “difficult to understand and implement,” and that the huge amount of money that remained unobligated when the former president left office was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”

“Earlier this year, Secretary Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration launched a review of the program’s guidance to make the NEVI program more efficient,” Sizemore said. “If a [state’s] submitted plan meets the requirements detailed in the updated program guidance, it will be approved and the State’s NEVI funding will be made available for obligation.”

State and industry officials said the rush to access the money was due to both pent-up enthusiasm for the charger cash and a positive reception to the flexibility offered under the new rules.

“We’re already seeing states reengage and move more quickly toward accessing funds,” said David Piperno, chief financial officer at SparkCharge, an EV fleet charging provider. “The overall tone has shifted and there’s a new urgency to put these dollars to work.”

One transportation official told Politico that the strategic placement of chargers in America is about to get better, and at more gas stations and existing stops, because there's no longer this arbitrary 50-mile requirement. That was often very difficult to implement in, say, places like Alaska, which might have 80-mile stretches of rural highway with no communities along the way.

So, to recap: Trump tried to cancel EV charger funding, failed, declined to appeal in court, and has somehow put new rules in place that may actually be cutting red tape around deployment. What a time to be alive.

More from that story:

But it also reflects a growing reality: Millions of EVs are expected to hit the road in the coming years, regardless of Trump’s policies. And their drivers are going to need places to charge.

“If you look at the states that are putting their [charging] plans and their money back into play the soonest, it’s really states that recognize their EV adoption rate is going to continue to climb,” said Joshua Rodriguez, program director for environment at the nonpartisan American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “Red or blue or purple, it doesn’t really matter.”

It's a good sign that, tax credits or no, you can't stop progress.

60%: Stellantis' U.S. Brands Could Get A Big Capital Boost

One major criticism of Stellantis’ former CEO is that he steered capital and R&D investments toward the wrong brands within the European-American conglomerate. American brands like Jeep and Ram make much of Stellantis' revenue, yet they've been dealing with overpriced and aging lineups for years. (I am not saying this magically would've prevented those brands from making lackluster EVs, but it certainly didn't help.)

According to a new report, that could change soon. Bloomberg indicates Stellantis' American brands are about to get a major boost:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants—for re-openings, hiring and new models—in states including Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

[...] The new CEO has started scrapping some European investments, withdrawing support from a joint hydrogen fuel cell venture with Michelin and Forvia SE. Stellantis also is mulling a sale of its Free2move car-sharing business, Bloomberg reported this week. Earlier this year, the automaker hired McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice on Maserati and Alfa Romeo. It has repeatedly denied any plans to sell Maserati.

This U.S. focus makes sense for several reasons. For one, it's Stellantis going where the money is; its sales are lagging in Europe, and it faces severe factory overcapacity there too. And Jeep, Ram and even Dodge are what pay a lot of the bills. Plus, the American investments are necessary at a time when the company is getting hammered by Trump tariffs.

With any luck, this will also mean better U.S. investments into, at the very least, hybrid powertrains. Stellantis can't bet on V8 engines to win the future.

90%: Elon Musk's Turnover Problem

You can't really disrupt an industry the way Tesla did without busting your ass. But one problem within the company is that it still runs at the pace of an early-stage startup, and this has led to rapid-fire turnover that's somehow accelerated in recent years.

The Financial Times (subscription required) has the scoop on the burnout factor at Tesla, which is now endemic to Musk's other companies too:

Important members of Tesla’s US sales team, battery and power-train operations, public affairs arm, and its chief information officer have all recently departed, as well as core members of the Optimus robot and artificial intelligence teams on which Musk has bet the future of the company.

While many left happily after long service to found start-ups or take career breaks, there has also been an uptick in those quitting from burnout, or disillusionment with Musk’s strategic pivots, mass lay-offs and his politics, the people said.

“The one constant in Elon’s world is how quickly he burns through deputies,” said one of the billionaire’s advisers. “Even the board jokes, there’s time and then there’s ‘Tesla time’. It’s a 24/7 campaign-style work ethos. Not everyone is cut out for that.”

Robert Keele, xAI’s general counsel, ended his 16-month tenure in early August by posting an AI-generated video of a suited lawyer screaming while shovelling molten coal. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough,” he commented.

It's certainly not news that working for Musk can be brutal. But this situation is also intertwined with Tesla's apparent pivot away from building newer and cheaper EVs, and more to the unproven spaces of robotics and AI, the story notes:

Tesla has traditionally been the most stable part of Musk’s conglomerate. But many of the top team left after it culled 14,000 jobs in April 2024. Some departures were triggered as Musk moved investment away from new electric vehicle and battery projects that many employees saw as key to its mission of reducing global emissions—and prioritised robotics, AI and self-driving robotaxis.

Employees also perceive Musk’s rivalry with [Sam] Altman—with whom he co-founded OpenAI, before they fell out — to be behind the pressure being put on staff.

“Elon’s got a chip on his shoulder from ChatGPT and is spending every waking moment trying to put Sam out of business,” said one recent top departee.

I suppose we'll see what this era of Tesla is really capable of with tomorrow's reveal of the allegedly cheaper Model Y variant.

100%: How Much EV Charging Does America Need?

If you say ""more than we have now,"" I'd certainly agree there. And I also think the U.S. over-indexes on DC fast-charging when it could stand to have more slower Level 2 charging everywhere, from movie theater parking lots to apartment complexes.

But let's imagine the future when we're past this current moment and EVs are at a tipping point. When do we hit ""enough"" public EV chargers? And what does that even look like?

This milestone marks the transformation of legacy energy liabilities into measurable, bankable climate assets.

This achievement proves oil and gas can lead in measurable, financeable climate action.

Share

The flagship project, centered on the Christopher Facility and a deep gas well in West Texas, followed a rigorous, commodity-grade Plug and Abandonment (P&A) process that permanently eliminated existing emissions and future methane (CH₄) leakage - a greenhouse gas over 25× more potent than CO₂.

All emission reductions were independently verified by a third-party accredited auditor under ISO 14064-3, CORSIA ensuring methodological rigor, transparency, and alignment with international standards.

The insured tokens are created under the Blu Diamond Standard and underwritten by global insurers, combining engineering assurance, technology-backed permanence, independent verification, and financial-grade credibility. Insurance transforms these verified climate outcomes into bankable commodities; unlocking price discovery, preserving value, and integrating environmental assets into capital markets.

Scaling a Repeatable Global Model

As a pioneer in engineered methane avoidance, Last Mile is setting a global precedent for converting oil and gas decommissioning into climate assets. These credits can be recognized in voluntary markets and converted into compliance instruments, tapping demand worldwide.

Through digital traceability, dual-custody verification, rigorous third-party auditing, and AI-driven monitoring, each credit’s lifecycle - from engineering intervention to insurance activation to market transfer - is fully auditable and regulatory-ready.

“This achievement proves oil and gas can lead in measurable, financeable climate action. By integrating digital traceability, we’ve created a repeatable blueprint that converts decommissioning liabilities into globally recognized, insured environmental assets.

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

""We're not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we're not going to take risk,"" said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet ""delusional"" green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That's enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

""This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,"" Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way ""to protect us until we know more,"" said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

""They're banking on nothing happening, but I don't think you can place it where they're proposing and assume nothing's going to happen,"" Sokolowski said. ""It's just too risky if it does.""

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system ""poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.""

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will ""strengthen and modernize our grid.""

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/energy.RcWqRjWyCI.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.55&fp-y=0.38&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:37.836833

Projects totaling $77 billion in capital expenditures plan on making use of 45Q, but companies need to access data from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program to claim the credit.
“Canceling the greenhouse gas reporting program means you can’t get 45Q,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm.
Companies would still need to collect emissions data to comply with state regulations, demands from investors and requirements from countries they export to.","A foundational data source that shapes the work of sustainability professionals across multiple sectors will disappear if the Trump administration goes ahead with plans to scrap the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, critics of the move warn.

The program, run since 2009 by the Environmental Protection Agency, requires around 8,000 oil refineries, power plants and other industrial facilities to submit annual emissions reports to the agency. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin proposed scrapping the program last month, describing it as “nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

Sustainability professionals see it differently.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program matters to everyone, not just the companies that report,” said Sean Hackett, senior manager for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It’s the most comprehensive source of emissions data. It underpins investor confidence, regulatory oversight and supply chain accountability across the economy.”

“The corporate world has built sustainability and investment plans around all it does,” added John Milko, senior managing policy advisor at Carbon180, a carbon removal nonprofit.

Cascading impacts

Ending the program would trigger a cascade of negative impacts, they and others warn, because the program provides a standardized data set that feeds into work across the economy. This includes life-cycle assessments and product-carbon footprints, which rely on emissions data from facilities upstream in the value chain.

In construction, for example, companies building data centers and other facilities are increasingly demanding that low-carbon steel and concrete be used. “We want to move to a system that improves the calculations of that embodied carbon,” said Milko. “Shuttering the largest-scale program that is seeking to standardize that data is counterproductive to the sustainability goals of large corporations.”

The move also places billions of dollars of announced investments in carbon removal in jeopardy, including direct air capture projects and plans to capture and store emissions from industrial facilities. The economics of these projects rely on a tax credit known as 45Q, which was made more valuable in 2022. Projects totaling $77 billion in capital expenditures plan on making use of 45Q, but companies need to access data from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program to claim the credit.

“Canceling the greenhouse gas reporting program means you can’t get 45Q,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm. “Whether this is intentional or accidental, it’s very bad. It will chill investment, cost time and money and impair trade.”

Increased costs and complexity

Zeldin framed his proposal as a move that would save businesses billions of dollars by cutting regulatory burdens, but experts warn of increased costs to businesses that report to the program. Companies would still need to collect emissions data to comply with state regulations, demands from investors and requirements from countries they export to. “Without that federal baseline, companies would face a patchwork of state and voluntary programs that would increase costs, uncertainty and complexity,” said Hackett.

It’s why a new report hinting that Stellantis may be trying to help those brands out is music to my ears. This is good news, and I’m feeling like I need to make The Morning Dump a little more positive after Archie Manning disappointed the Longhorn faithful again this weekend.

Other good news? Well, it sounds like the White House might be considering offsetting tariff costs for manufacturers who build cars in the United States. What’s that going to look like? No one knows! How will that work? See the previous answer.

BYD doesn’t have to worry about U.S. tariffs at the moment, and it can now officially celebrate besting Tesla for four straight quarters in EV sales. In five years, that might look like when the Red Sox beat up on the Astros earlier this season. It doesn’t matter anymore!

And, finally, Genesis has established itself as a real player in the luxury space. The next move? Show it can build a performance identity.

How To Fix Stellantis, Redux

I have never been even partially responsible for a company that’s built a car. When David finishes the Jeep, I suppose that’ll change. Until then, I understand why you’d wonder where I get off telling car execs what they’re doing wrong. Sure. Fair.

Though, in the case of Stellantis, I specifically pointed out all the reasons why I thought the company was in bad shape, even after reporting huge profits. Stellantis shuffled off its CEO less than a year later, for many of the reasons that I identified, and the company has swung from big profits to losses.

I think I like the new guy, Anthonio Filosa, or at the very least, I think he’s saying the right things and deserves some time to try and get it right. According to a new report from Bloomberg, he’s maybe going to get a lot right:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing information that’s not public. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants — including re-openings, hiring and new models — in states such as Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

Stellantis is focused on reclaiming the past success of the Jeep brand and is considering fresh investments into Dodge, which could result in a new Dodge V8 muscle car, and possibly even the Chrysler brand in the long term, some of the people said. Talks are ongoing, no final decision has been made and the amount and targeted projects could still change, the people said.

I guess it’s time to play the “Re-Build Stellantis Plan Waltz” one more time:

Jeep: A top and bottom approach. The most important brand, so give engineers more money and fight back against Bronco with a more modern Wrangler. At the same time, more volume hybrids that looks good.

Ram: I still think putting it under Dodge is smart, but in lieu of that: A midsize hybrid truck, which the company has basically said will happen.

Dodge: Muscle car? Sure. A replacement for the Durango is also key, and an entry-level crossover that can compete with the HR-Vs of the world. Maybe something French?

Chrysler: Literally, anything that’s not a van. More specifically, make it your luxury brand, build a luxury car and a luxury SUV. And, when you do that, you should also…

Kick The Italian Brands Out Of The US: You can’t do everything at once. Sergio’s dream was a great dream, but it wasn’t implemented properly. Sell Maserati (I know, I know, “it’s not for sale,” but sell it). Keep Alfa for Europe. Keep Fiat for Europe. I don’t care what you do with Lancia.

Keep Peugeot And Citroën, Dump DS: I love the French brands, and I can’t pretend like I don’t (I probably am emotionally invested in Lancia’s outcome a little). The French government owns a big chunk of the company, so there’s really no choice here. I’d dump DS, but if you get rid of Maserati then maybe DS can do what Chrysler is going to do in the United States (no V8s for Europe, though).

Leapmotor: Seems fine!

This gets way more complicated in practice.

Obviously, the UAW loves this plan. The White House is going to love this plan. The Italian government is going to hate it. You can’t make everyone happy, and Stellantis doesn’t have unlimited money.

After a lot of back-and-forth, the Tavares-run Stellantis committed itself to spending more in Europe. But with the company cutting back across the continent due to overcapacity, I don’t get how that’s going to work.

It sounds like Filosa is going to meet with the Italian unions later this month. Oh, to be a mosca on that wall.

The Anti-Inflation White House Allegedly Wants To Address Car Price Inflation

Inflation became such a bad word that President Biden named his signature piece of legislation the Inflation Reduction Act. I’m not sure how much reduction of inflation actually occurred, and it’s clear that the price of eggs had a lot to do with the election of President Trump.

Tariffs are historically inflationary, and it’s only a matter of time before companies raise prices to offset tariffs. Unless, unless… the White House does something to reverse or offset them.

Here’s Senator Bernie Moreno–a car dealer–explaining how this might work in a Reuters exclusive:

“The signal to the car companies around the world is look, you have final assembly in the U.S.: we’re going to reward you,” Moreno said in an interview. “For Ford, for Toyota, for Honda, for Tesla, for GM, those are the almost in order the top five domestic content vehicle producers – they’ll be immune to tariffs.”

[…]

Moreno added automakers with significant final production in the United States should get tariff breaks: “Look, at the end of the day, they’re doing exactly we want them to do – paying employees in America well and doing final assembly in the United States with the cars that they sell here.”

Asked for comment on the proposal, a White House official told Reuters that Trump and the administration “are committed to a nuanced and multi-faceted approach to securing domestic auto and auto parts production. Until any official action is signed by the president, however, any discussion about administration policymaking is speculative.”

I love the “almost in order” there. I guess it depends on which measure you’re looking at, but I assume somewhere in Senator Moreno’s mind he was aware that this is not the correct order. It doesn’t really matter because the concept is sound. If you want more manufacturing in the United States, then the automakers who build here should get some sort of tariff relief.

What this means in Realityville is another question.

The biggest sticking point is probably Canada and Mexico. President Trump clearly doesn’t love that there’s production in those places, but he was the one who wrote the most recent treaty (USCMA) that continued to make it efficient for companies to do so…

Will automakers like Toyota and Honda get a 1:1 discount on imported cars for every car built here? Or are automakers going to get a break if there’s “final assembly” and that means some parts made in Canada are fine? One of the biggest obstacles to building cars efficiently in the United States is the steel and aluminum tariffs, so will automakers get a break from that?

Again, the form that this takes is extremely important.

I’m torn on how to think about some of this. On one hand, President Biden and the Democrats have made a big deal out of bringing manufacturing back to the United States, and no small portion of the plants that carmakers are bragging about are ones that were already going to be built because of Biden-era policies. On the other hand, Democrats seemed mostly content to let the USMCA status quo continue (they might argue that one way to slow cross-border immigration is improve Mexico’s economy and allow more jobs there).

It likely makes sense for automakers to shift as much manufacturing here from overseas as they can because Democrats will probably take credit for the plants being built/planned if they somehow win back the White House in a few years. You think any Democrat President, on the off chance it happens, is going to ship the jobs back?

BYD Beats Tesla For Fourth Straight Quarter

Tesla v. BYD is potentially not the best framing for the Chinese car market over the long term, but it has some value in the moment. The fact that BYD has now gone a year straight selling more electric cars globally is a not-small detail, especially given that BYD doesn’t have the same market access that Tesla has.

It’s also interesting because Tesla and BYD both seem in trouble in China according to this Bloomberg article:

BYD is losing momentum in its home market, where policymakers are increasingly concerned about destructive competition. Tesla will have trouble replicating last quarter’s showing now that the US has phased out federal tax credits supporting EV purchases.

China’s government has sought to temper cutthroat competitive practices in the world’s biggest car market, where manufacturers have waged a relentless price war since early 2023. BYD has been at the fore of the discounting trend and in late August reported a surprise 30% drop in quarterly profit.

Both BYD and Tesla are more than capable of overcoming these challenges, although only BYD seems truly interested in building better cars. Tesla seems more into robots right now.

‘Driving Control, Precision, And Confidence’ Will Define The Future Of Genesis Performance Cars

I’ve written about this before, so I will try not to retread too much.

The larger automaker known as Hyundai went on a bit of a buying spree about a decade ago, bringing on some of the best designers and engineers from peak-era Germany. It’s how we ended up with the guy behind the best M cars tuning Velosters, and the guy who designed some of the best Audis, transforming Genesis into a real luxury player.

The Hyundai N cars are never quite the fastest, but damn if they don’t just feel right.

Genesis also has a host of highly competitive vehicles (I encouraged a friend to test one, and he fell in love), but it’s apparently not enough to merely make nice cars. What’s missing, according to the company, is a sense of true performance. That’s where the company’s Magma performance brand comes in.

BTW, let’s please recognize how metal that name is: MAGMA. I’m pretty sure I saw them open for Rob Zombie at L’Amour.

A big part of MAGMA’s mission will be planned by Manfred Harrer, head of the Vehicle Development Technology Unit at Hyundai (and ex- of Porsche, BMW, Audi, Apple…). Here’s what he told Automotive News what’s key to making this work:

“In my eyes, we have one gap with the brand and the brand image, and that’s the performance part,” Harrer said in a separate interview at the automaker’s Namyang R&D center south of Seoul.

“And this should be covered by our new Genesis Magma lineup.”

Part of the Magma proposition will be raw power and torque, acceleration and top speed, Harrer said. But the differentiator, he said, will be driving control, precision and confidence.

“This is the philosophy, from an engineering standpoint,” said Harrer, who previously worked on Apple’s discontinued electric vehicle project and earlier at Porsche, BMW and Audi. “It’s the preciseness and controllability of the powerful engines in these powerful cars.”

I like the way that sounds. Pure power is getting super boring, and while it’s not like AMG is just handing out 1,000 HP cars (that’s what SRT is for), I think N is a good example of Hyundai prioritizing feel over numbers.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

If you don’t have a daughter or, maybe, you don’t have ears, you may be unaware there’s another Taylor Swift album that just dropped on Friday. I don’t love it. I respect that she puts out a bunch of music and tries things. It’s also not really for me, sure, but as an enjoyer of the odd pop tune, I don’t think it’s doing anything new. Both the latest Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX album feel like they’re doing a lot more.

Oh, right. Sabrina Carpenter shows up on this album on the titular track and is predictably one of the better ones. The best song on the album thus far is probably “Actually Romantic.” People who care more than I do seem to think this is about Charli XCX, and I think that’s probably right (inasmuch as the song is about any one person and not about a few individuals, like the people in New York Magazine).

I suppose Charli fired the first shot with “Sympathy is a Knife,” but that song feels like less of a diss track and more just an artist sharing her own feelings of inadequacy? This kinda feels like punching down. Also, it’s pop music, it doesn’t matter.

Additionally, the rollback of the federal EV tax credit, which offered consumers up to $7,500 in tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, is expected to decrease EV sales in the short term.
Despite uncertainty, BloombergNEF forecasts U.S. EV passenger vehicle sales to more than double by 2030, representing 27% of total passenger car sales.
The network balances flexibility with critical needs for battery supply chains, including: • Fire suppression and environmental monitoring systems designed specifically for lithium-ion risk and aligned with upcoming regulatory changes.","ITS Logistics, one of North America’s fastest-growing third-party logistics providers, has announced the launch of its Battery Logistics Hubs, a dedicated network of integrated distribution space and transportation solutions that provide greater flexibility within the heavily-regulated lithium-ion battery sector. With demand trends and supply chain challenges putting pressure on the electric vehicle (EV) industry, ITS aims to offer manufacturers and Tier 1 automakers safe, compliance-ready, and scalable operations tailored to today’s market.

“The EV transition is still accelerating, but companies are now facing headwinds that could cause significant demand fluctuation,” explained Kasia Wenker, VP of Solutions Engineering at ITS Logistics. “In this type of environment, a fixed facility optimized for the lowest cost during ideal conditions quickly becomes a liability. The flexibility to scale with demand while maintaining operational excellence is the real key to protecting against risk.”

The EV battery market has seen exceptional volatility over the past year, with geopolitical tension influencing both supply and demand. Tariffs on rare earth minerals as well as lithium-ion cells represent a threat to domestic EV battery production. Additionally, the rollback of the federal EV tax credit, which offered consumers up to $7,500 in tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, is expected to decrease EV sales in the short term. Still, market optimism persists. Despite uncertainty, BloombergNEF forecasts U.S. EV passenger vehicle sales to more than double by 2030, representing 27% of total passenger car sales. While automakers anticipate a slight correction following record-high sales in August, most experts agree consumers will continue to purchase EVs for their environmental benefits and lower gasoline costs. For now, many brands are augmenting their strategy to include a mix of hybrid and ICE models in addition to all-electric vehicles.

“Current market dynamics, and the reactions we’ve seen from automakers so far, underscore a clear truth: to remain profitable in uncertainty, you must embrace flexibility — without compromising safety or compliance,” Wenker continued.

Lithium-ion batteries are high-value, hazardous, and subject to strict oversight across transport and storage. They require compliance with DOT and IMDG regulations in transit, and must meet NFPA 855, FM Global, and insurer requirements in storage. Variations in chemistry, packaging, and state-of-charge add operational complexity that traditional logistics networks can struggle to adapt to real-time demand and customer needs.

To address this, ITS Logistics has developed multi-tenant, campus-style Battery Hubs in Indianapolis and Dallas, designed to flex capacity up or down as demand shifts, support new model launches or recalls, and provide geographic diversity across the U.S. for regional agility. The network balances flexibility with critical needs for battery supply chains, including:

• Fire suppression and environmental monitoring systems designed specifically for lithium-ion risk and aligned with upcoming regulatory changes.

• Boots-on-the-ground, extensively trained operators and hazmat-certified staff executing battery-specific procedures and compliance documentation.

• FTZ-ready space for managing imports, completing assembly tasks, and protecting cash flow.

• Integrated hazmat-certified transportation across road, intermodal, and drayage, seamlessly coordinated with warehousing to reduce handoffs and delays.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Battery_Hub_PR.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:09:31.842539

Last month, an appeals court ruled against several nonprofit groups that had $16 billion in such grants frozen by the E.P.A.","A coalition of solar energy companies, labor unions, nonprofit groups and homeowners sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday over its termination of $7 billion in grants intended to help low- and moderate-income families install solar panels on their homes.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island, accused the agency of illegally revoking the money under the Solar for All program without congressional approval. It expanded an ever-widening legal battle over President Trump’s efforts to claw back billions of dollars in climate funding that had been approved by the Biden administration.

The lead plaintiff is the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a group of labor unions that had trained electricians and other workers to install solar panels in the state. While the unions did not directly receive funds under the Solar for All program, they had been counting on work that would have followed a $49.3 million grant to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.

“Now that the program is on hold, potentially hundreds of job opportunities are lost,” said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. He said the Trump administration had jeopardized hundreds of additional jobs for his members by ordering work to halt on several wind farms off the coast of New England.

“It’s not just a one-two punch to the work force that I represent,” Mr. Crowley said. “It really is a one-two punch to the entire state of Rhode Island because our energy costs need to be controlled, and renewable energy sources like solar and wind are a key component of that.”

Other plaintiffs include a homeowner in Atlanta who had applied for free rooftop solar panels from an initiative supported by a $156 million grant to the Georgia Bright Communities Coalition and companies that install solar panels in Georgia and Pennsylvania.

The plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit legal advocacy groups including the Southern Environmental Law Center and Lawyers for Good Government. Brigit Hirsch, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the suit, citing an agency policy of not commenting on pending litigation.

The Solar for All program was not only intended to help low- and moderate-income homeowners. It was also meant to expand community solar initiatives, which bring solar energy to people who don’t own their own homes or otherwise can’t install their own panels.

The program was projected to help 900,000 households get access to solar power, according to estimates by the Biden administration. The idea was to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the leading driver of climate change, while also helping to lower electricity bills. The participating households were expected to collectively save $350 million each year on utility costs.

Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in August that he was ending the Solar for All program at the behest of Congress. He said that Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill, which Congress passed in July, had eliminated what he called “billions of green slush fund dollars” under Solar for All.

“The bottom line again is this: E.P.A. no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Mr. Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.

But in the lawsuit, the coalition argued that the bill revoked only climate grants that the E.P.A. had not yet awarded. Under the Biden administration, the agency had awarded the Solar for All grants to 60 state agencies, nonprofit groups and Native American tribes.

The claim that the bill rescinded the Solar for All grants is “patently false and legally unsupportable,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government.

The Solar for All program was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature climate law. The measure authorized a total of $27 billion in grants for green activities like installing electric vehicle charging stations and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.

Last month, an appeals court ruled against several nonprofit groups that had $16 billion in such grants frozen by the E.P.A. In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the Trump administration had acted legally in its attempts to claw back the funds.

Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, said that because the case was essentially a dispute between the government and grant recipients, it belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit filed Monday is unlikely to face a similar setback, legal experts said, since it was not brought by the grant recipients.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/18/multimedia/01cli-solar-lawsuit/01cli-solar-lawsuit-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:04:51.647725

Trump Brings Fossil Fuel, Far-Right Think Tank Agenda To Government

An analysis of over 100 staffers' backgrounds reveals Texas oil money takeover of Trump administration, deep ties to fossil fuel industry and far right think tanks; Polluters get ‘concierge, white glove service’

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has installed more than 100 fossil fuel insiders, renewable energy opponents, corporate lobbyists, and far-right think tank alumni across nine agencies during his second term, according to a new analysis of the backgrounds of staffers appointed to roles in the administration.

The analysis by Public Citizen and the Revolving Door Project of 111 officials identified:

43 former fossil fuel industry employees

29 former corporate executives

14 former corporate lawyers

12 people tied to fossil fuel-funded right-wing think tanks

7 people tied primarily to Republican politics such as elected officials and staffers pushing a fossil fuel or corporate agenda

The analysis also found that more than two-thirds (25 out of 37) of staff nominated to Senate-confirmable jobs at the Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of the Interior had ties to polluting interests.

The agencies have made dozens of hires from the fossil fuel sector and other polluting industries, as well as corporate lawyers and far-right think tank alumni who are enacting Trump’s policies designed to promote dirty energy and destroy America’s public lands.

The report details comments by a White House staffer speaking on an energy lobbyist’s podcast, stating the Trump administration is providing “concierge, white glove service” to dirty energy companies pushing pipelines, mining projects, and export terminals.

The report highlights the expansive influence of the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the America First Policy Institute in staffing the second Trump administration. Both of the far-right think tanks are funded by the Texas oil billionaire Tim Dunn, and have created a pipeline of Trump staffers to implement an extreme, pro-fossil fuel agenda.

The ascent of Dunn and other allied Texas donors represents a changing of the guard from the libertarian Koch network, which had extensive influence on the first Trump administration, yet has parted ways on some issues, such as Trump’s tariffs.

“This is nothing short of a Texas oil industry takeover of the U.S. government at the expense of consumers, the climate, public health, and public lands and waters,” said Alan Zibel, a research director with Public Citizen and a co-author of the report. “To execute his extreme, reckless, backward-looking fossil fuel agenda, Trump has stocked his administration with fossil fuel staffers and ideologues,”

“Texas-based billionaires have taken over the Trump administration, providing a steady stream of staffers and an extreme set of policy ideas that consciously favors the most polluting forms of energy,” said Toni Aguilar Rosenthal, senior researcher with the Revolving Door Project. “Trump’s policies aid the fossil fuel industry’s exploitation of the public sphere for private profit while simultaneously sabotaging renewables and ensuring that the U.S. remains trapped in a dirty energy economy.”

At the same time, Trump has launched a far-reaching attack on renewable energy, with wind power hit the hardest. Offshore wind developers have been forced into court to defend projects, including an almost complete offshore wind farm. Since offshore wind turbines are sited in federal waters, the industry is especially vulnerable to Trump’s sabotage. The industry has long been the subject of a far-right think tank-backed anti-wind disinformation campaign.

Beyond the revolving door of corporate nominees and appointees, the report details numerous examples of Trump administration hires serving in, or nominated for, high positions with little, if any, subject matter expertise. Many have political connections, experience in other fields, or backgrounds in marketing, public relations and public speaking.

30%: Trump Fails To Kill NEVI Funding, Speeds It Up Instead

Alpitronic EV Chargers

Longtime readers of this publication and industry pros probably know the acronym NEVI: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the program allocated $5 billion in funding for DC fast chargers for states to dole out in the form of grant money. As part of its anti-green energy and cost-cutting push, the Trump administration sought to cancel that funding, but a federal court overruled that move in July.

Since then, Politico reports, more than 40 states are in the process of unlocking their NEVI funding—and red states like Texas and Montana lead the way. At least 32 say they have gotten a green light. And Trump's Department of Transportation actually seems to be offering more flexibility on where these chargers can be placed.

The publication calls this ""a major acceleration."" More on why, with emphasis mine below:

The new guidance that DOT issued in August largely kept the Biden administration’s rules but ditched a contentious requirement that chargers be placed every 50 miles along major highways. It also directed states to quickly submit updated implementation plans to access the funds. In the weeks since, at least 44 states and Washington, D.C., have submitted their plans, spokespeople for those states told POLITICO.

In a statement Friday, DOT spokesperson Nathaniel Sizemore said the Biden administration had added requirements to NEVI that were “difficult to understand and implement,” and that the huge amount of money that remained unobligated when the former president left office was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”

“Earlier this year, Secretary Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration launched a review of the program’s guidance to make the NEVI program more efficient,” Sizemore said. “If a [state’s] submitted plan meets the requirements detailed in the updated program guidance, it will be approved and the State’s NEVI funding will be made available for obligation.”

State and industry officials said the rush to access the money was due to both pent-up enthusiasm for the charger cash and a positive reception to the flexibility offered under the new rules.

“We’re already seeing states reengage and move more quickly toward accessing funds,” said David Piperno, chief financial officer at SparkCharge, an EV fleet charging provider. “The overall tone has shifted and there’s a new urgency to put these dollars to work.”

One transportation official told Politico that the strategic placement of chargers in America is about to get better, and at more gas stations and existing stops, because there's no longer this arbitrary 50-mile requirement. That was often very difficult to implement in, say, places like Alaska, which might have 80-mile stretches of rural highway with no communities along the way.

So, to recap: Trump tried to cancel EV charger funding, failed, declined to appeal in court, and has somehow put new rules in place that may actually be cutting red tape around deployment. What a time to be alive.

More from that story:

But it also reflects a growing reality: Millions of EVs are expected to hit the road in the coming years, regardless of Trump’s policies. And their drivers are going to need places to charge.

“If you look at the states that are putting their [charging] plans and their money back into play the soonest, it’s really states that recognize their EV adoption rate is going to continue to climb,” said Joshua Rodriguez, program director for environment at the nonpartisan American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “Red or blue or purple, it doesn’t really matter.”

It's a good sign that, tax credits or no, you can't stop progress.

60%: Stellantis' U.S. Brands Could Get A Big Capital Boost

2025 Jeep Wagoneer S Limited

One major criticism of Stellantis’ former CEO is that he steered capital and R&D investments toward the wrong brands within the European-American conglomerate. American brands like Jeep and Ram make much of Stellantis' revenue, yet they've been dealing with overpriced and aging lineups for years. (I am not saying this magically would've prevented those brands from making lackluster EVs, but it certainly didn't help.)

According to a new report, that could change soon. Bloomberg indicates Stellantis' American brands are about to get a major boost:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants—for re-openings, hiring and new models—in states including Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

[...] The new CEO has started scrapping some European investments, withdrawing support from a joint hydrogen fuel cell venture with Michelin and Forvia SE. Stellantis also is mulling a sale of its Free2move car-sharing business, Bloomberg reported this week. Earlier this year, the automaker hired McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice on Maserati and Alfa Romeo. It has repeatedly denied any plans to sell Maserati.

This U.S. focus makes sense for several reasons. For one, it's Stellantis going where the money is; its sales are lagging in Europe, and it faces severe factory overcapacity there too. And Jeep, Ram and even Dodge are what pay a lot of the bills. Plus, the American investments are necessary at a time when the company is getting hammered by Trump tariffs.

With any luck, this will also mean better U.S. investments into, at the very least, hybrid powertrains. Stellantis can't bet on V8 engines to win the future.

90%: Elon Musk's Turnover Problem

You can't really disrupt an industry the way Tesla did without busting your ass. But one problem within the company is that it still runs at the pace of an early-stage startup, and this has led to rapid-fire turnover that's somehow accelerated in recent years.

The Financial Times (subscription required) has the scoop on the burnout factor at Tesla, which is now endemic to Musk's other companies too:

Important members of Tesla’s US sales team, battery and power-train operations, public affairs arm, and its chief information officer have all recently departed, as well as core members of the Optimus robot and artificial intelligence teams on which Musk has bet the future of the company.

While many left happily after long service to found start-ups or take career breaks, there has also been an uptick in those quitting from burnout, or disillusionment with Musk’s strategic pivots, mass lay-offs and his politics, the people said.

“The one constant in Elon’s world is how quickly he burns through deputies,” said one of the billionaire’s advisers. “Even the board jokes, there’s time and then there’s ‘Tesla time’. It’s a 24/7 campaign-style work ethos. Not everyone is cut out for that.”

Robert Keele, xAI’s general counsel, ended his 16-month tenure in early August by posting an AI-generated video of a suited lawyer screaming while shovelling molten coal. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough,” he commented.

It's certainly not news that working for Musk can be brutal. But this situation is also intertwined with Tesla's apparent pivot away from building newer and cheaper EVs, and more to the unproven spaces of robotics and AI, the story notes:

Tesla has traditionally been the most stable part of Musk’s conglomerate. But many of the top team left after it culled 14,000 jobs in April 2024. Some departures were triggered as Musk moved investment away from new electric vehicle and battery projects that many employees saw as key to its mission of reducing global emissions—and prioritised robotics, AI and self-driving robotaxis.

Employees also perceive Musk’s rivalry with [Sam] Altman—with whom he co-founded OpenAI, before they fell out — to be behind the pressure being put on staff.

“Elon’s got a chip on his shoulder from ChatGPT and is spending every waking moment trying to put Sam out of business,” said one recent top departee.

I suppose we'll see what this era of Tesla is really capable of with tomorrow's reveal of the allegedly cheaper Model Y variant.

A 2023 U.S. Department of Energy report found that Puerto Rico had more than enough renewable energy potential to meet its electricity needs.","Conservation and community groups have won a legal challenge to federal plans to spend billions of dollars to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electric grid back to the centralized, fossil fuel-dependent status quo instead of investing post-disaster funding in distributed renewable energy.

Thursday’s ruling by the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico holds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it failed to consider rooftop solar, storage and other forms of distributed renewable energy to provide electricity to communities at risk from Puerto Rico’s hurricane-battered grid. The ruling orders FEMA to prepare an environmental impact statement that analyzes distributed renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.

The new ruling found that “[m]ost Puerto Ricans depend on an electrical power infrastructure that relies primarily on fossil fuels,” which the court concluded “has proven inadequate, unreliable and extremely vulnerable to weather events, events whose effects will be more severe in the future due to climate change.”

The ruling goes on to find that “if FEMA funding continues to be channeled to fossil fuel-based infrastructure, it is unlikely that Puerto Rico will have the resources to pursue renewable energy alternatives in the near future,” explaining how “the record clearly shows that renewable energy alternatives were reasonable and feasible.”

”This decision shatters the misconception that there is only one way to transform the electrical system and, on the contrary, recognizes that the alternative we have promoted for years — a renewable, distributed system — is viable and should be seriously considered when allocating public funds,” said Federico Cintrón Moscoso, program director of El Puente de Williamsburg’s Latino Climate Action Network in Puerto Rico. “FEMA’s failure to consider the solar alternative violated the law and paved the way for the reconstruction of the same obsolete fossil-based system that brought us to this crisis in the first place. This decision, therefore, recognizes our right to an accessible and clean energy system, as stipulated by our local laws and collective aspirations. It also recognizes that we cannot aspire to transform our electrical system at the expense of our health and that of the environment. Energy issues must be addressed fairly because they are not separate from the well-being of people or the planet.”

The ruling comes after Hurricane Erin impacted the archipelago in August 2025 and left thousands of Puerto Ricans without power yet again. Earlier this year, chronic grid outages compelled Puerto Rico’s governor to pledge to improve the fossil fuel grid. This case involves funds that Congress already allocated to Puerto Rico in Hurricane Maria’s aftermath.

This case concerns FEMA’s use of disaster relief funds from 2017’s Hurricane Maria to invest at least $12 billion in projects that lock Puerto Ricans into decades of fossil-fuel dependence. FEMA’s projects conflict with Puerto Rico’s 2019 law setting a goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050 and Puerto Ricans’ own energy plan for local solar and storage. A 2023 U.S. Department of Energy report found that Puerto Rico had more than enough renewable energy potential to meet its electricity needs.

A Circular Future Critical minerals are essential to everyday life and the clean energy transition.
In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals.","Key Takeaways:

The United States remains heavily dependent on imports for the critical minerals essential to the clean energy transition and everyday technologies.

Circular economy strategies help bolster the domestic supply chain by reducing reliance on virgin materials and imports.

Recycling and secondary recovery methods tap into discarded products and waste products to recover critical minerals and put them back in circulation.

Critical minerals are embedded in the fabric of everyday life, from energy, communications, and consumer electronics to transportation and healthcare. These minerals are also the foundation of the clean energy transition. Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel are key inputs for the advanced batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage. Neodymium and dysprosium are essential for the permanent magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines. Tellurium and cadmium can be found in solar panels, while aluminum is a crucial component of modern transmission lines. Even next-generation fuels like renewable hydrogen rely on platinum, nickel, or iridium.

The U.S. Depends on China and Others for Its Critical Minerals

The United States produces 37 of the 50 critical minerals identified by the U.S. Geological Survey from mining, secondary recovery, or recycling. However, it lacks a strong domestic supply chain, making the country heavily dependent on imports for most of its mineral needs. In 2024, the United States relied on imports for 100% of 12 critical minerals, and for more than 50% of another 28 minerals. China dominates global supply chains, being the top producer of 60% of U.S.-designated critical minerals. China is also the leading source of U.S. imports for nine of the 13 minerals for which the United States is most import-reliant. The United States also relies on Canada, Japan, and South Africa for critical minerals.

As this reliance suggests, a small fraction of countries produce the bulk of global critical mineral supplies. This fact—combined with long timelines for U.S. mining projects, mineral price volatility, and geopolitical conflict—has left the country vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Finding alternative, domestic sources of critical minerals can reduce vulnerability to these disruptions while supporting the clean energy transition.

The Circular Economy Approach

One strategy to reduce dependence is to adopt a more circular economy. As opposed to the traditional “take-make-waste” linear model, circular economies emerge when companies reduce material use, redesign products to require fewer inputs, and capture waste as a resource for new production. This approach improves resource efficiency, reduces waste, eases pressure on ecosystems, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. It also presents opportunities for new markets and job creation by expanding recovery and remanufacturing industries, and by favoring new business models like product leasing and product-as-a-service.

Improving resource efficiency and exploiting domestic sources is particularly important for critical minerals. As demand for clean energy and other critical mineral-reliant technologies increases, the need for minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is expected to rise. Circular strategies like recycling and secondary recovery can help meet this increased demand through domestic supply, without resorting to mining and its accompanying environmental damage. Reconfiguring the country’s critical mineral supply chain to prioritize circularity could bolster sustainability efforts and build toward a more secure energy future.

Closing the Loop: Battery Recycling

Recycling is one of the most important strategies for securing access to critical minerals. Mineral recycling can help reduce import reliance, decrease waste, and limit the environmental impacts of mining and waste disposal. Indeed, as more products containing critical minerals reach the end of their lives, they end up in landfills, potentially harming the environment and disproportionately impacting low-income and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities.

Lithium-ion battery recycling, particularly of EV batteries, presents significant opportunities. Battery recycling could reduce demand for mined lithium, nickel, and cobalt by around 10%. Despite this potential, fewer than 15% of U.S. lithium-ion batteries are recycled due to inefficient and inconsistent collection systems and limited recycling infrastructure.

Currently, most critical mineral recycling takes place through pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, batteries are smelted at high temperatures to recover metals, whereas in hydrometallurgy, acids are used to leach minerals from the battery’s cathodes, where the critical minerals are found. While both methods are effective, they are also costly and resource-intensive.

However, new techniques are beginning to improve the affordability and sustainability of mineral recycling. Researchers are developing two processes, organic acid extraction and deep eutectic solvents, which increase the efficiency and decrease the environmental impacts of hydrometallurgy. Another more widely adopted innovation is direct recycling, also known as “cathode to cathode” recycling, which restores cathode materials for immediate reuse rather than breaking them down into their base metals.

Battery design is a critical factor in overall recyclability. Complex disassembly is a major obstacle to scaling up recycling. Currently, many EV batteries are built with screws and welds that make dismantling them difficult and time-intensive. To address this challenge, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are experimenting with a new Quick-ReleaseTM Binder that could replace conventional fasteners, enabling more cost-effective and efficient disassembly. Designing batteries for recyclability from the start ensures that mineral recovery is viable.

While recycling alone cannot fulfill U.S. demand for critical minerals, it is crucial to securing a domestic supply chain. By recapturing minerals that would otherwise end up in landfills and returning them to circulation, the United States can bolster its supply chain while protecting vulnerable communities.

Secondary Recovery

While recycling focuses on products already in circulation, secondary recovery targets byproducts, or “tailings”, of critical mineral production, processing, and manufacturing. Historically, this waste has been underutilized due to its environmental and health hazards, but when treated properly, it can be transformed into new, domestic sources of critical minerals.

Acid Mine Drainage

On federal land alone, there are 140,000 abandoned mine features, costing the federal government $287 million in annual remediation. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the most significant issues associated with abandoned mines, contaminating 12,400 miles of streams and rivers in the United States. When mines are abandoned, they leave behind pits that collect rainwater. This water reacts with sulfide minerals from exposed rocks and oxygen to form sulfuric acid, which in turn dissolves heavy metals from the rocks into the water. Once the pit reaches its maximum level, it overflows into the surrounding watershed, contaminating the environment. Contaminated AMD water also contains critical minerals.

New treatment methods can simultaneously clean the water while capturing these minerals. For example, a two-step process developed at Pennsylvania State University adds carbon dioxide to AMD to create solids containing critical minerals that can be separated from the water. In Appalachia, solids collected from AMD treatment have been found to contain over 2,000 milligrams of rare earth elements per kilogram of material, valued at up to $400 per metric ton. The study of a pilot recovery plant by the University of West Virginia confirmed that recovery can be both technically feasible and economically viable at scale, with positive returns and payback within a few years. These high yields have been confirmed for AMD from coal and hard-rock mines, indicating that AMD recovery is applicable to many abandoned mines across the United States.

Phosphate Fertilizer Waste

Another promising opportunity for critical mineral secondary recovery comes from the fertilizer industry. Producing phosphate fertilizer generates large volumes of phosphogypsum waste—about 5 tons for every ton of phosphate produced. This radioactive waste, typically stored in large piles at hazardous waste sites, has high concentrations of critical minerals.

While more experimental than AMD recovery, chemical extraction methods for fertilizer waste have successfully extracted 77–94% of rare earth elements (REEs), a subset of critical minerals, from phosphogypsum. More recent research on biological methods of extraction has found that bio-acids can leach REEs at a milder acidity than mineral acids, reducing potential environmental impacts. A concentration of only 4% of REEs in phosphogypsum is required for recovery. Adding special polymers to the fertilizer waste can further concentrate REEs, increasing the ease of extraction.

Researchers are now looking to bring these methods to scale and increase yields. Experts emphasize that recovery becomes most viable when extraction facilities are co-located with existing phosphate operations, where the waste is already being collected and handled. Co-location reduces transportation and infrastructure costs, allowing recovery systems to leverage the fertilizer industry's existing footprint.

A Circular Future

Critical minerals are essential to everyday life and the clean energy transition. Worryingly, the United States remains heavily reliant on imports for most of its supply. Circular economic strategies, particularly recycling and secondary recovery, offer practical ways to reduce dependence while simultaneously bolstering economic and environmental opportunities.

In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals. The Department of Energy responded with nearly $1 billion in new funding for battery recycling, expanded recovery from mining and metal byproducts, and rare earth recovery and refinement demonstration projects. Congress has shown bipartisan support as well, through the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025 (H.R.2444/S.257) and the Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act (H.R.3198/S.823).

Even with this growing activity, additional federal support is still needed, including long-term support for recycling infrastructure, expansion of nationwide secondary recovery facilities, and clearer standards for integrating circular economy principles into supply chain planning.",,N,,2025-10-06 11:04:54.553486

The move has triggered a wave of criticism from Democratic lawmakers and energy advocates, who say the decision amounts to political punishment with consequences for jobs, innovation, and consumer energy costs.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency said in a statement.

A full list of affected projects has not yet been made public. However, DOE confirmed award recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, and some have already begun that process.

The cancellations cut across a wide range of DOE programs, including the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and Fossil Energy. In total, 321 financial awards were terminated. DOE officials highlighted that 26% of the awards — worth more than $3.1 billion — were issued in the short window between Election Day and the presidential inauguration, calling them hastily approved and inadequately documented.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the decision, saying DOE has been working to review “billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, echoed support in a post on X, saying the awards in states such as California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, and Washington were part of “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

But Democratic leaders see the move differently. They argue it undermines the rule of law and weaponizes federal policy for partisan purposes.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

“Our democracy is badly broken when a president can illegally suspend projects for Blue states in order to punish his political enemies,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., called the cancellations “reckless” and a betrayal of the public trust. “Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs.”

Advocacy groups also warned of wide-ranging fallout. Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said ending the awards would “stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Canceled awards reportedly include hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, battery production facilities, grid modernization efforts, clean vehicle manufacturing, and industrial decarbonization projects. California officials confirmed DOE rescinded up to $1.2 billion earmarked for ARCHES — the state’s planned hydrogen hub.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also denounced the move, saying it would undercut U.S. leadership in renewable energy.

Environmental groups stressed that consumers ultimately will bear the brunt. “By canceling more renewable energy projects, Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans,” said Patrick Drupp, Climate Policy Director at the Sierra Club.

With $7.6 billion in funding now rescinded, energy experts say the decision could slow progress toward decarbonization, stall advanced technology deployment, and diminish private sector confidence in federal clean energy initiatives. Supporters of the canceled projects warn that the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge to Europe and Asia, where governments are aggressively investing in clean energy manufacturing and innovation.",,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:48.905743

To help close this funding gap, Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P) launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2023, created GIP to finance and de-risk climate projects in the region.

GIP is an innovative blended finance vehicle under FAST-P that has secured $510 million in committed capital from global and regional private, public and philanthropic institutions. It will fund projects in sectors critical to decarbonisation and sustainable growth including renewable energy, distributed generation, e-mobility, circular economy and emerging climate solutions. GIP begins investing this year, starting with a bio-energy programme through BECIS Bioenergy that converts agricultural waste and other sustainably sourced feedstock into renewable steam, reducing over 100,000 tonnes of emissions annually. Also, a renewables portfolio with ib vogt comprising utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, cutting an estimated 257,000 tonnes of emissions each year.

BII’s $60 million commitment, including $10 million from its £100 million mobilisation facility announced by the UK Prime Minister at the UN General Assembly in 2024, has played a critical role in achieving the fund’s first close. It has helped to de-risk the capital structure to attract further commercial capital.

Leslie Maasdorp, CEO, BII, said “We are proud to support GIP, which exemplifies the power of blended finance, bringing together development finance, public, and private capital to unlock opportunities that might otherwise remain out of reach. By supporting GIP, we are accelerating the low carbon transition in South-East Asia and also demonstrating the power of innovative technologies and new business models.

“BII’s participation is designed to catalyse further commercial investment, sending a strong signal to the market and helping to scale climate action across the region.”

Nik Mehta, British High Commissioner to Singapore, said: “The UK’s commitment to the Green Investment Partnership demonstrates our determination to mobilise private capital for climate action at scale into developing countries in South-East Asia. This pioneering approach, co-investing alongside Singapore and other partners through FAST-P, will help unlock significant private investment for clean energy and sustainable infrastructure projects across the region, driving growth and jobs in the process.”

Congressman Gabe Vasquez: So, this funding was yet to be distributed.
Congressman Gabe Vasquez: Sure.
KC Counts: Congressman Gabe Vasquez, thank you very much for your time.
Congressman Gabe Vasquez: Thank you so much.","The Department of Energy announced billions in cuts to green energy projects in blue states. U.S. Congressman Gabe Vasquez talks with KC Counts about how New Mexico is affected. Here is a transcript of their conversation:

KC Counts:

Tell us what the landscape looks like in terms of how these cuts will impact New Mexico.

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

So, because of this political retribution and this decision to cut Department of Energy projects across the nation, New Mexico stands to lose over $135 million in investment for energy production, energy research, and that includes $56 million right here in New Mexico's second district. All four of the projects that were defunded in my district would be housed at New Mexico Tech inSocorro. Now, by cutting these projects, the administration has really hamstrung the ability for us to modernize fossil fuel development and oil and gas development in places like the Four Corners and the Permian Basin. The purpose of these funds were to develop, you know, methane capture technology that would make oil and gas production cleaner, avoid the types of methane leaks that we've seen. We have one of the largest methane clouds in the world right here in the Permian Basin. So, this means that we're going to lose out on research projects, jobs, students are going to miss out on this opportunity. And not just that, but the most important thing is that having cleaner oil and gas development contributes to cleaner air for all New Mexicans. And that's one of the things that we absolutely need, especially in communities like Hobbs and Carlsbad right here in my district, but also areas like Farmington and Gallup up north. So, it really impedes our ability to move forward with that technology and that includes retrofitting existing oil and gas wells. So, we're not moving in the right direction. And those folks at New Mexico Tech deserve to continue with this important research that's going to benefit all New Mexicans and the companies as well.

KC Counts:

In what way is this particular funding being affected? Was it yet to be distributed?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

So, this funding was yet to be distributed. Here at New Mexico Tech, that $56 million was congressionally approved funding. That means Congress allocated that funding by a vote in Congress. It's now been rescinded by Secretary Wright of the Department of Energy. The projects across the country are different. There are some projects that were already underway that are being cut halfway through their grants or through their projects. There's other projects that were just about to start, and if you think about what it takes for a university like New Mexico Tech to put the resources in place just to conduct and deliver on this grant, they have to mobilize an immense amount of resources, not to mention the amount of time that it took to actually apply for these funds. So, there's already money being lost. There's potential jobs being lost with contractors who are going to work as part of this project. So, it varies project by project across the country U.S. Congressman Gabe, but in this case, we stand to lose all $56 million of that congressionally approved funding for New Mexico Tech, although New Mexico Tech has already prepared themselves to take on this research.

KC Counts:

At this point, Congressman Vasquez, what is the remedy?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

Well, just today I sent a letter to Secretary Wright outlining how important these projects are across the country. One, because they help to lower the utility bills for all Americans. When we can create safer, cleaner, renewable energy or safer and cleaner fossil fuel energy, it helps both the companies and it helps New Mexicans, because if you think about methane leaks and capturing those methane leaks, those oil and gas companies actually make money off of selling some of that natural gas and some of the byproducts back to New Mexico, in the form of royalties, and that's really important. So, we're actually standing to lose millions more from not implementing this type of technology. Our air is going to get dirtier. You know, those high rates of respiratory disease in places like the Permian Basin are going to continue to climb. So that's just, it's not a good thing for us. But in terms of how we fix it, Secretary Wright has the opportunity to turn the dial back on this. Unfortunately, because of this political retribution, the fact that these projects were pulled in 12 blue states and the fact that this is a vindictive action by the administration, I'm not sure how willing they're going to be to restore that funding. But in my view, it also is a violation of the impoundment clause, which this administration has completely ignored in the last eight months.

KC Counts:

Looking ahead, do you think that there is a longer-term fix? Obviously, There's been a lot of political maneuvering in states like Texas to redraw boundaries, get more Republican seats. So, what is your outlook, quickly, before I let you go, Congressman Vasquez, on the midterms?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

Sure. Well, look, when Democrats have the majority in the House, we're going to work on a package of legislation that protects the American people from any future actions, from any future administration, from violating the impoundment clause, making clear that it is a violation of the law to misuse or misappropriate or retract congressionally directed spending. There's three branches of government for a reason. The Democratic Party believes strongly in those foundations that our founding fathers laid before us. And even though some may want to abdicate that responsibility or give that responsibility to the administration, I refuse to render Congress powerless. Folks elect us for a reason. They expect us to pass a yearly budget, which we haven't done. They expect that those congressionally directed funds are going to be spent in the way that they're supposed to be spent. And we've got to make sure that no president, Democrat or Republican, can do this in the future.

KC Counts:

Congressman Gabe Vasquez, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it.

Created in 1948, the IUCN comprises the world’s largest and most diverse network of organizations working for the environment. From governments to non-profits and more, over 1,400 member organizations and 17,000 experts make up the union of the IUCN—the “global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it.”

The Aquarium was recognized as a member because of its commitment to conservation and the IUCN mission, demonstrated through our extensive animal care, innovative scientific research, and marine conservation and education work. While the IUCN strives to conserve all of nature, our ocean-specific focus lets us weigh in on issues ranging from marine life and habitats to the blue economy and youth engagement—and connects the Aquarium to a broad array of experts and resources to help advance our own work to protect the blue planet.

While it’s still the early days of the membership, there are opportunities to be more involved in the future. One area is in informing equitable and effective practices for the IUCN’s project-based conservation work around the globe, based on our experience working with and learning from our Marine Conservation Action Fund (MCAF) fellows and project leaders.

Another is for members of our Animal Care and Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life teams to serve on the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC)—groups of volunteer experts who gather knowledge on the status of over 150,000 different species and threats to them.

The SSC network, composed of more than 180 Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Conservation Committees, and Task Forces, “provides scientific advice to conservation organizations, government agencies, and other IUCN members,” and helps support international environmental agreements to protect biodiversity.

Already, Dr. Elizabeth Burgess, senior scientist in the Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, is a member of the SSC Sirenia Specialist Group. Veterinarian and Senior Scientist Dr. Charles Innis participates in the SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group.

The Aquarium is also exploring joining one of several other Commissions, such as the Commission on Education and Communications or the World Commission on Protected Areas.

In mid-October, a delegation from the Aquarium will be traveling to Abu Dhabi to attend the IUCN World Conservation Congress, a gathering held once every four years that brings together experts and decision-makers from around the globe. Chief of Conservation and Stewardship Dr. Letise LaFeir will represent the Aquarium as Authorized Vote Holder at the conference, joining debate at the Member’s Assembly and voting on IUCN conservation priorities on behalf of the Aquarium.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a Social Democrat who is also the vice chancellor, told the news agency.
The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.
“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” DPA quoted Klingbeil as saying.
“The goal of selling only pure electric cars by 2035 is not realistic,” Lies told German newspaper NWZ.","Germany’s ruling coalition confirmed it will extend a tax exemption for new electric vehicles as part of a broader effort to support the nation’s key car industry in the transition to more climate-friendly technologies.

Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil will present a draft law soon that will keep the existing tax exemption for EVs in place until 2035, Maximilian Kall, a finance ministry spokesman, said Monday at a regular government news conference in Berlin, confirming a report by DPA.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a Social Democrat who is also the vice chancellor, told the news agency.

The coalition accord agreed on by Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and Klingbeil’s SPD included the pledge to extend the incentive to 2035 and the confirmation comes ahead of a planned “car summit” Thursday between government officials, auto executives and labor representatives.

The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.

Announcements last month that Volkswagen AG was paring back production and Robert Bosch GmbH slashing 13,000 jobs were the latest evidence of how the auto industry’s decline is rippling through Europe’s biggest economy.

Auto parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG followed last week by saying it planned to eliminate 7,600 positions at its electrified drivetrain division as it steps up its restructuring efforts to deal with poor demand.

“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” DPA quoted Klingbeil as saying. “We want the best cars to continue to be made in Germany.”

Extending the EV exemption is expected to cost the federal government approximately €600 million ($702 million) in lost revenue through 2029, Kall told reporters.

As part of his government’s effort to aid the car sector, Merz last month urged the European Union to give up its 2035 deadline to effectively ban combustion engines and instead allow the industry to pursue a softer path to climate neutrality.

Some members of Klingbeil’s SPD are unhappy with the move, but the party is expected to signal its backing this week, with the issue set to be discussed at regular coalition talks on Wednesday in Berlin.

Olaf Lies, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony whose government is VW’s second-biggest shareholder, said last week the priority should be to protect jobs.

“The goal of selling only pure electric cars by 2035 is not realistic,” Lies told German newspaper NWZ. “Combustion engines, especially plug-in hybrids and vehicles with range extenders, must continue to be permitted beyond 2035, and alternative fuels must also be included.”

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

""Home energy storage is no longer a luxury—it's becoming the backbone of the modern renewable home,"" notes an energy analyst from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Renewables Integration and the Rise of Energy Independence

Homeowners across the world are rethinking how they consume and store energy. With increasing electricity demand and growing solar installations, energy storage is bridging the gap between generation and reliability.

Residential users can now store excess solar energy generated during the day and deploy it when sunlight fades or during grid outages. This not only enhances energy security but also significantly reduces electricity costs, creating a compelling economic case for adoption.

In markets like California, Germany, and Australia, government incentives and tax credits have accelerated residential storage installations. For instance, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offers a 30% federal tax credit, while Australia provides rebates up to A$1,300 under new state energy programs.

Battery Technology: From Lithium-Ion Dominance to Sodium-Ion Disruption

In 2024, lithium-ion batteries held roughly 70% of the global market share, thanks to their high energy density, efficiency, and long lifecycle. However, the market is undergoing a technological transition.

Emerging sodium-ion batteries are attracting attention as a lower-cost, safer, and more sustainable alternative. They rely less on critical minerals like lithium and cobalt and perform effectively across wider temperature ranges. This makes them especially suited for frequent charge-discharge cycles—a hallmark of residential energy systems connected to intermittent renewables like solar.

""Sodium-ion chemistry could become the defining innovation of the next decade,"" predicts a senior researcher at BloombergNEF, ""particularly as cost reduction aligns with scaling solar-plus-storage projects.""

At the same time, the race toward solid-state batteries promises even greater safety, energy density, and durability, further lowering the total cost of ownership for homeowners.

AI and Smart Energy Management

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining how home energy storage systems operate. Advanced AI algorithms are enabling dynamic energy forecasting, real-time optimization, and predictive maintenance.

Smart energy management systems now predict renewable generation patterns and optimize when to buy, store, or release energy based on grid prices. This capability transforms a household battery from a passive storage unit into an intelligent energy trading asset.

AI also plays a crucial role in battery health diagnostics, extending lifespan through adaptive charging strategies and preemptive fault detection.

This integration of digital intelligence is paving the way for Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) decentralized energy networks that aggregate home batteries into grid-level assets. VPPs enhance grid stability, unlock new revenue streams for homeowners, and support the broader decarbonization of energy systems.

Market Segmentation: Powering Homes of All Sizes

By Capacity: The 10-20 kWh segment leads the market with a 40% share, as it aligns with typical residential backup needs and peak load management. However, >20 kWh systems are expected to grow fastest as costs decline and demand for long-duration backup rises.

By Connectivity: On-grid systems dominate with 60% share, while hybrid systems—which combine grid, solar, and battery backup—are expected to see the most significant growth through 2034.

By End User: Single-family homes remain the largest segment (55% share), driven by rooftop solar adoption. Meanwhile, multi-family housing is emerging as a fast-growing segment, especially in dense urban areas where shared energy systems are being tested.

Regional Outlook: Global Hotspots of Growth

North America

The U.S. market alone was valued at USD 0.96 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to USD 2.40 billion by 2034. Federal incentives like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and state-level programs such as California's SGIP continue to propel adoption.

Grid modernization projects and frequent climate-induced outages further strengthen demand for resilient residential systems.

Europe

Germany remains the European leader, supported by KfW loans, net-metering incentives, and strict technical standards for battery integration. The U.K. has reinforced growth with VAT exemptions for home battery systems and the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), rewarding users for exporting stored energy.

Asia-Pacific

Expected to grow at the fastest CAGR through 2034, the region's expansion is anchored by China's 30 GW energy storage target by 2025 and India's ₹5,400 crore viability gap funding (VGF) for new BESS projects. Japan's GX Transition Bonds and aggressive decarbonization initiatives further underline Asia's pivotal role in shaping global energy storage trends.

Investment and Industry Momentum

Private equity and utility companies are investing heavily in home storage technologies. Giants like Tesla (Powerwall 3), LG Energy Solution (enblock S+), and BYD (Battery-Box HVB) are joined by emerging European innovators such as Sonnen and software-driven platforms like Enphase Energy.

Investors are particularly attracted by the dual value proposition: growing consumer demand for energy independence and the opportunity to participate in decentralized grid stabilization via VPPs.

Toward a Smarter, Decentralized Future

As the world edges toward a decentralized, AI-enabled energy economy, home energy storage systems are set to become a mainstream household technology. The convergence of battery innovation, digital intelligence, and renewable generation is transforming how homeowners interact with energy—turning them from passive consumers into active participants in the energy ecosystem.

By 2034, the global market will not only double in value but also redefine what it means to be energy independent—where every home can generate, store, and manage its own clean power.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:05:25.391392

James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, attacked Sadiq Khan’s housing record as London mayor in his speech to the conference this afternoon.

Since 2010, Conservatives have delivered 2.5m homes – a million of those in the last parliament alone.

Last year in the south-east of England, and the east of England, Conservative-run regions, about 2.5 new homes were built per thousand people.

In London, run by Labour for the best part of a decade, 0.5 homes per thousand.

And so, what do those figures mean, for real people, for ordinary hard-working Londoners?

In 1980, the average London home cost £25,000, and that was about four times the average national salary.

Today, the average London house costs over £500,000.

And that is fifteen times the average salary.

That is Sadiq Khan’s record of failure.

We should not, and we cannot, and we must not accept it.

There is speculation that Cleverly may put himself forward as the Tory candidate for London mayor at the next election, in 2028.

Matt Chorley from the BBC has written an excellent long read on what Tory MPs are saying in private about Kemi Badenoch and her prospects. It includes this wonderful anecdote.

In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches.

When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied “oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in”.

John Glen, Badenoch's PPS, floats case for cutting pensions tax relief for high earners

Phillip Inman

Phillip Inman is a senior Guardian economics writer.

John Glen, Kemi Badenoch’s bag carrier (parliamentary private secretary), has raised the prospect of the Conservative party taking away pension subsidies from better off taxpayers.

Glen, who joked that his appointment in July as PPS had turned him into a slave, said there was a case to answer when the public finances were constrained and the level of pension subsidy had reached £50bn.

At a fringe meeting, Glen, who sits on the Commons Treasury committee, said:

We spend £40bn to £50bn on tax relief and £15bn to £20bn goes to people who pay the higher rates of tax. We need to have an honest discussion about what the overall burden of tax should be.

We have a system that is based on pension savings being exempt on entry and exempt on accumulation but taxed on exit. What we need to do is ask wha we can afford and what is fair.

It is not the party’s policy to have a single rate. There would obviously be an opportunity to change the rate.

But philosophically, the question is about the role of the state. There are lots of people receiving 40% relief and building penion pots that are much more than securing just a reasonable pot alongside their triple lock pension. The question is, are there better ways to spend that money?

Government pension subsidies are based on tax relief, which means those that pay the highest rates of tax gain the most from tax relief.

A flat rate subsidy of 25% or 30% would increase the subsidy for standard rate taxpayers while cutting it for those who pay higher rates of tax.

Ulster Unionist leader criticises Badenoch's proposal to leave ECHR

Lisa O’Carroll

Lisa O’Carroll is a senior Guardian correspondent.

The Ulster Unionist party has condemned Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch’s intention to leave the ECHR if she is voted into power.

The UUP helped negotiate Good Friday agreement peace deal which is undermined by the convention.

Mike Nesbitt, the UUP leader, said:

The Ulster Unionist party negotiated the 1998 agreement. Any suggestion of the UK leaving the ECHR, as suggested by Ms Badenoch, would cut across the principles of that agreement, which guarantees access to the ECHR in law, a point the Conservative leader has said herself would be a point of ‘particular challenge’.

Reform UK defends record of its Doge unit after report says cost-cutting won't stop Kent raising council tax

Reform UK has reject claims that its efforts to find savings in Kent council have been disappointing.

Referring to a story in the Financial Times today (see 7.59am), Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said:

Reform’s pledge to slash millions from Kent Council’s budget has turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Just like his idol Elon Musk, Zia Yusuf has spectacularly failed to deliver what Doge promised. It turns out cribbing the notes of dodgy American tech billionaires is no way to run a council.

But a Reform UK spokesperson insisted the party’s Dolge (Department of Local Government Efficiency) was having an impact. The spokesperson said:

Our team in Kent county council have already done some fantastic work to clean up the mess left by the Kent Conservatives and reduce the county council’s debt by £66m in their first five months in office. The majority of that has come from savings as a result of their Dolge unit.

This includes implementing a ‘no more borrowing’ policy which will reduce their debt by a further £33m by March 2026, scrapping KCC’s net zero renewable energy Programme to save £32m over 4 years and stopping the move to a new council building which has avoided an additional £14bn of borrowing.

Referring to reports that Kent is likely to raise council tax by 5%, the maximum amount, a Reform source argued that most councils were expected to do that and claimed that not raising council tax could lead to an authority losing government grant money.

Andrew Rosindell calls for pact with Reform UK, saying many Tories like him will lose their seats without one

The Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell has called for his party to form a pact with Reform UK to defeat Labour at the election.

In an interview with GB News, Rosindell said:

Our electoral system can’t accommodate two parties that are broadly conservative. That means a divide in the vote and the calamity of another Labour government for five years, or even worse, a Labour government propped up by Liberal Democrats, Greens, Plaid Cymru, SNP, fruit and nut, and whoever else is around to prop Keir Starmer up in office. No, thank you.

I would much rather see people of like mind on the right of centre to work together … We need to get everyone working together to rescue our country from the disaster of this left-wing socialist government.

Rosindell, who represents Romford, said, without a pact, many Tory MPs, including him, faced defeat at the election.

I’m worried about many of my colleagues who will not come back as MPs, including me. At the moment my seat would almost certainly go to Reform. I think the whole of Essex would go Reform.

Asked if he would stay with the Tories or defect to Reform before the electon, Rosindell said he wanted both parties “to think about what’s best for our country”.

At the Politico fringe, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, was asked by Dan Bloom the Theresa May question – what was the naughtiest thing he hads ever done? His answer was more interesting than hers.

Philp replied:

When I was a student at University at Oxford in the 1990s, OJ Simpson, remember him, came to speak at the Oxford Union, and he there was no press.

So I was very enterprising. I smuggled a load of recording equipment into the place, before the security cordon went up, recorded the entire thing, retrieved the recording devices afterwards, and then sold the recordings to various American news stations for a decent amount of money, in cash.

And I sold it simultaneously to ABC, NBC and CBS, all of whom thought they were getting it exclusively.

Former Tory Brexit secretary David Davis says he does not support ECHR withdrawal

Randeep Ramesh

Randeep Ramesh is the Guardian’s chief leader writer.

David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, has told a fringe meeting at the party conference that he is opposed to the party’s decision to leave the European convention on human rights.

Speaking to the Guardian, Davis, who is one of most prominent libertarians in the party, Davis said:

I don’t trust any British government – Conservative Labour, coalition – to have entirely clean hands on civil liberties, torture and rendition, surveillance, 90 days detention without charge, all these things. And parliament is getting weaker and weaker. So that’s why I want to have some external agency.

Davis said he was also concerned about the problems withdrawal from the ECHR would create in Northern Ireland.

It won’t destroy [the Belfast/Good Friday agreement] but it will cause issues and it will force a renegotiation with the Irish demanding things. On European trade policy, it would give the option to the Europeans of withdrawing certain aspects.

Davis also believes that that efforts being made by several European countries to reform the ECHR, including the Labour government in Britain, may lead to changes.

Philp plays down concerns proposed Tory removals force will adopt 'heavy-handed' tactics used by Trump's Ice

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, has played down concerns that the Trump-style removals force proposed by the party will adopt some of the thuggish and lawless tactics used by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), its US counterpart.

Speaking at a fringe meeting at the conference, where he was being interviewed by Politico’s Dan Bloom, Philp said:

There are some examples in the US where they have clearly used tactics that are too heavy handed, and people families have been separated. We don’t advocate that sort of approach.

We do advocate zero tolerance for illegal immigration and anyone entering this country illegally, no matter what their purported excuse, will get removed within a week.

Philp told the same meeting there was another area where he would like to see the UK move closer to the US model. In the US there are thousands of government jobs which an incoming president can give to political appointees. In the UK the civil service in independent, and cabinet ministers are only allowed to bring in a handful of political appointee (special advisers, or “spads”) to help them. Philp said he would like to see this number increased.

I could imagine a few dozen people [as party political advisers] coming into a big department would make quite a big difference to ministers’ ability to get things done.

Helen Whately, shadow work and pensions secretary, suggests term 'disabled' being applied too widely if 25% of people qualify

Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, has suggested the term “disabled” is being over-used if it applies to around a quarter of people.

She made the claim in her speech in which she defended the Tory plan to cut benefits – which the party now says could save £23bn a year. (See 8.09am.)

She said:

We are here because we know we have a really important job to do – if not us, who?

But millions of people right now, are sitting on the sofa at home.

Millions have got themselves a sick note from the GP and signed onto sickness benefits with just a form and a phone call.

Millions are getting benefits for anxiety and ADHD, along with a free Motability car.

TikTok videos tell you how - and some people even pay for VIP services to boost their chances of a successful benefits claim.

Yes, there are people with serious illnesses and disabilities,

But one in four people now describe themselves as disabled, so what does the term even mean?

In claiming that the term disabled is used too widely, Whately is just echoing an argument made by Kemi Badenoch, who made a very similar comment earlier this year.

There is an explanation for the ‘one in four’ figure (24%, to be precise) in this DWP report. It is based on the definition of disabled in the Equality Act, which says a person is considered to have a disability if they have a physical or mental impairment that has ‘substantial’ and ‘long term’ negative effects on their ability to do normal daily activities.

In her speech, Whately also claimed she had a “common sense” plan to cut welfare spending.

I’ve got my common sense plan for savings.

Fix the ‘sick note’ system, bring back face-to-face assessments, end sickness benefits for low level mental health problems, stop the abuse of Motability, and put British citizens first in our benefits system – just living here is not a reason to get money from taxpayers.

And that’s not all.

We will change our sickness benefit system, so it helps those who really need help and stops turning people into victims.

We will make the benefits cap do what it should, so that families on benefits aren’t better off than those in work.

And we’ll tackle the massive hike in housing benefit.

All that gives you billions of savings off the benefits bill.

Helena Horton

Helena Horton is a Guardan environment reporter.

Claire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, has been accused of a Reform UK-style anti-business measure by experts.

She has pledged to scrap the the renewables obligation (RO) scheme, under which many wind farms receive fixed subsidies for 15–20 years. (See 11.27am.)

Coutinho referred to these subsidies as “the biggest racket going”, adding:

Our energy system is not here to prop up the profits of multi-million-pound wind developers at billpayers’ expense. It’s here to deliver cheap, reliable energy for the country.

However, one of the reasons the UK has historically been a favourable place to invest is its strong contract law, meaning that when a business signs a contract it knows the terms will be honoured.

Ripping up existing agreements would run contrary to this.

Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said:

If what is being proposed is to terminate contracts with renewable energy suppliers under the renewables obligation, unless there is an alternative in place, this kind of policy instability, akin to what Reform has proposed, would deter investors not just in renewables, but across the board from investing in the UK. This uncertainty would make financing more risky pushing up costs of investment, making everything in turn more expensive.

Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform, faced criticism from business leaders when he proposed a similar policy, to scrap the contracts for difference scheme under which renewables companies agree a price per megawatt hour for their power.

Even the wind power sceptic energy analyst Kathryn Porter, who writes for the Telegraph, has said that cancelling existing schemes would dent investor confidence.

New analysis has also found that renewables including wind power cut electricity prices by up to a quarter in the last year.

No 10 says claims government interference led to collapse of Chinese spying case 'all untrue'

Claims that government interference led to the collapse of a major Chinese spying case are “all untrue”, Downing Street has insisted. PA Media reports:

Ministers also retain confidence in England and Wales’ chief prosecutor following the case, according to No 10, as he based his work around the previous Conservative government’s policy on China.

The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry was dropped on 15 September, sparking criticism from Downing Street and MPs from across both sides of the political aisle.

The decision reportedly came after senior Whitehall mandarins met to discuss the trial, including national security adviser Jonathan Powell and the Foreign Office’s top civil servant Sir Oliver Robbins, according to the Sunday Times.

In order to prove the case under the Official Secrets Act, prosecutors would have had to show the defendants were acting for an “enemy”.

But Powell reportedly revealed the government’s evidence would be based on the national security strategy, which does not use that term to describe China, so it could not be used in court.

“The suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,” the PM’s press secretary told reporters at a lobby briefing this morning.

Among those who have heavily criticised the collapse of the case are the Tories, who have said ministers now have serious questions to answer.

But sources within government said evidence in the case had to relate to the period when the alleged incidents took place – between 2021 and 2023 – when the Conservatives were in power.

Senior Tory figures at the time – including the party’s current leader, Kemi Badenoch – did not refer to China as an enemy, only as a “challenge”, informing the evidence.

Stephen Parkinson, chief prosecutor in England and Wales, had said the CPS had determined the proceedings had to be stopped because of an “evidential failure”.

Downing Street was asked if the prime minister remained confident in Parkinson’s ability to do the job.

“Yes. It is obviously for the CPS to take decisions on the evidential threshold which they take cases forward, and they obviously judged that that threshold was met at the time,” a spokesperson said.

“It’s obviously up to them to keep that under review and to take their own decisions. But very clearly, the government’s evidence did not materially change, not least because it was based on the previous government’s policy, and previous governments’ policy can’t change.”

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

The Metroparks study found that the parks system generates $92 million annually in visitor spending.
“Those have all really, I think, served to reinforce one another.” Business benefits Parks also have significant positive implications for local business.
Bush says the city of Detroit has been “highly intentional” about engaging Detroit business owners and community members in shaping the way new park investments affect their communities.
Unexpected benefits While increased housing values, visitor spending, and business activity may be fairly obvious economic benefits of parks, the Metroparks study also quantified some more unexpected and less tangible impacts.","This story is part of a series exploring how parks serve as engines of exploration, education, play, and equity. It is made possible with support from Huron-Clinton Metroparks and the City of Detroit.

Alicia Powell says she gets “choked up” every time she brings her food truck, Wetzel’s Pretzels, to vend at an event in one of Detroit’s newer parks. Powell, who often vends along the Joe Louis Greenway and at Spirit Plaza, says she doesn’t recall having “these beautiful greenspaces” when she was growing up in the city. Now, she says, she not only appreciates the new parks’ impact on her own business, but she feels like she’s “participating in this beautiful transformation” for the city overall.

“You have to have these greenspaces and recreational space for people,” she says. “… It makes these neighborhoods more attractive. And hopefully it brings value to the area, and then other people start investing more. But it starts with the city providing these spaces.”

Beyond simply providing a place for people to unwind in nature, parks also have demonstrable positive impacts on local businesses, property values, tourism, environmental management costs, and even medical bills.

“Parks offer an opportunity for maximizing investment in neighborhoods, so building or investing in a park really draws additional resources to that area, and we see that with the Joe Louis Greenway,” says Leona Medley, executive director of the Joe Louis Greenway Partnership. “It allows us to think about programming, … building on transportation networks, thinking about commercial corridor redevelopment, really focusing on neighborhood stabilization strategies, and preserving existing residents while also attracting new ones. And so we continue to see parks, as an economic development catalyst, produce good results around the city.”

Alexa Bush, the city of Detroit’s planning director, says parks “only add value to any of the other types of more traditional economic development activity.”

“I think having this opportunity to be in a really high-quality public space, a park, a natural area, adds to that value, and I think people recognize it even if they don’t name it as such,” she says. “… It only adds to the excitement, the density, the value of the vertical development that goes along with it.”

Attracting residents and visitors

One of the primary economic impacts of parks is their ability to attract both residents and visitors to the areas surrounding them. Amy McMillan, CEO of the Huron-Clinton Metroparks, says parks are “inseparable” from economic development – particularly in Michigan, where she says “quality of life” should be the “primary driver” of efforts to market the state as “an incredible place to live.”

“There have been studies for decades that demonstrate the influence that being next to well-maintained parkland and open space has on property values,” she says. “And so I think they’re inextricably linked, and that is not often enough realized when talking about economic development.”

Data back up McMillan’s assertions. A 2020 Journal of Leisure Research review of 33 studies found an average property value increase of 8-10% for properties adjacent to parks. And a 2020 study produced for the Metroparks by the Trust for Public Land found an additional $68 million in residential property value for properties within 500 feet of Metropark locations.

Similarly, parks are a boon to visitor attraction and visitor spending. The Metroparks study found that the parks system generates $92 million annually in visitor spending. Studies commissioned by the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy have found $82 million in annual visitor spending along the Detroit Riverfront, which has seen considerable revitalization over the past decade-plus.

Bush credits parks and greenspaces such as the Detroit Riverwalk and Campus Martius as major drivers of the revitalization of downtown Detroit.

“I think we’ve had that synergy between creating these really wonderful public places that work for big events [and] work for tourists, but they also support residential life downtown,” she says. “Those have all really, I think, served to reinforce one another.”

Business benefits

Parks also have significant positive implications for local business. For example, the Metroparks study found that the recreation economy in the Metroparks’ five-county service area supports 272 sporting goods stores generating $678 million in annual sales.

“People are buying bikes. They’re getting their bikes fixed. They’re buying golf clubs,” McMillan says.

Beyond the direct impact of park visitors buying supplies to support their recreational activities, parks can also be a catalyst for small, locally-owned businesses like Powell’s.

“It’s great for us – money in our pocket – and then it’s great for the residents,” Powell says.

Sandra Epps, owner of the Detroit-based face-and body-painting business Sandy’s Land, agrees. She says Joe Louis Greenway events have helped increase her business, with Tuesday yoga sessions on the greenway providing a particularly “huge boost.”

Epps says she was “excited” to learn that a section of the Joe Louis Greenway will be built near seven lots she’s acquired at the intersection of Fenkell Avenue and Log Cabin Street to build a butterfly garden and doll museum.

“New parks and greenspaces are creating a new resurgence in communities throughout Michigan, but especially in the city of Detroit,” she says. “And this is exciting to see and be a part of this new expansion and positive transition in the city of Detroit.”

Parks can draw new commercial activity to a neighborhood, which can require careful strategy to ensure that existing residents benefit from their new greenspace instead of being pushed out by it. Bush says the city of Detroit has been “highly intentional” about engaging Detroit business owners and community members in shaping the way new park investments affect their communities. One example of this is the 2025 Joe Louis Greenway Neighborhood Planning Study, which takes a highly granular neighborhood-level approach to planning investments in the communities surrounding the greenway.

The study was heavily shaped by community feedback. Medley says some neighborhood residents wanted to prioritize commercial corridor development around the greenway, while others did not. She and city staff have worked to be responsive to those needs.

“I think one of the most powerful strategies that we’re employing is … to ensure that we are understanding the current makeup of the neighborhoods, while also engaging with the residents to ask questions about what are some of the impacts that they want to see from a project like this, and then working … to really develop that strategy,” she says.

Unexpected benefits

While increased housing values, visitor spending, and business activity may be fairly obvious economic benefits of parks, the Metroparks study also quantified some more unexpected and less tangible impacts.

One of these is reduced health care bills. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for physical activity, The Trust for Public Land conducted a telephone survey to determine how many adults were using Metroparks “at a frequency and intensity that would result in health care cost savings.” The study found 9,030 adults ages 18-64, and 7,600 adults 65 and older, using the parks in this manner. Based on previous research into the health care savings associated with regular intense exercise, the Trust for Public Land assigned an average annual health care savings of $1,250 to the younger group and $2,500 to the elder, estimating the parks system’s total annual health benefit to users at $30.3 million.

“The opportunity to improve the health of our workforce, the impact that that has on the bottom line for companies, is not too often discussed,” McMillan says. “I think that is one of those opportunities that is hugely missed because we so often take it for granted.”

The Metroparks study also quantified the economic impact of the parks system’s environmental benefits. The many acres of pervious (i.e. non-paved) surfaces in each park hold significant benefit for absorbing stormwater, slowing its runoff, and filtering out pollutants. Calculating the total amount of stormwater runoff mitigated by the parks and multiplying it by the cost ($0.11 per cubic foot) of managing that water otherwise, the study found the Metroparks generate a $30.3 million annual savings in stormwater management alone. Similarly, the study found that the Metroparks remove 793,000 pounds of pollutants from the air annually, saving $2.25 million primarily in health care costs.

McMillan notes that, while the study was focused on the Metroparks, similar benefits will result from any park.

“They’re great for outdoor recreation when the weather’s good, and then they manage storm water when the weather is bad,” she says. “That presents a huge savings to local communities as a whole, and individual property owners that struggle with flooding.”

Given the many ways parks can positively impact the economies surrounding them, McMillan says it’s important not to become “complacent” about the natural resources around us. She notes that developing new parks and managing existing ones are “super intentional things” that “don’t happen by themselves.”

“It’s a virtuous cycle when you invest in public parks because it pays so many benefits to people individually, to the businesses, and we’re all the better for that,” she says.",https://djq2xymdufr22.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/05203607/IMG_FootTruck_20251002_Selections-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:08:01.577659

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. and PETERSBURG, Ind., Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Arevon Energy, Inc., a leading American energy developer, owner, and operator, is pleased to announce that operations are underway at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Pike County, Indiana. Together, the projects add 264 megawatts (MWdc) of new domestic solar power to the grid and are the company's first owned and operational utility-scale projects in the Hoosier State.

Ratts 1 and Heirloom represent an investment of nearly $400 million and will disburse more than $86 million to local governments over their lifespans, supporting schools, infrastructure, and other essential public services. The two facilities employed more than 200 full-time equivalent personnel to build the projects and also brought about an increase in spending at local stores, hotels, and restaurants. Ratts 1 Solar is under a long-term power purchase agreement with Indiana Municipal Power Agency (IMPA), and Meta is the offtaker for Heirloom Solar.

Arevon hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the start of operations at Ratts 1 and Heirloom, which are now producing homegrown, reliable energy and long-term community benefits. Attending the event alongside the Arevon team were public officials, community leaders, landowners, the construction contractor Primoris Renewable Energy, and other project stakeholders. Speaking at the ribbon-cutting were Kevin Smith, Chief Executive Officer at Arevon; Kyle Brouillette, Senior Vice President, Market Operations and Planning at IMPA; Jill Hyneman, Executive Director at Pike County Chamber of Commerce; and Aaron Meyer Principal at Winslow Elementary School. Nikki Jeffers, Director of Development at Arevon, served as the event's master of ceremonies.

""Ratts 1 and Heirloom are about more than megawatts — they are tangible illustrations of the positive and real impact renewable energy can bring to local communities,"" said Smith. ""These facilities will produce American-made power for decades, while also supporting Pike County's economy and quality of life. Arevon is proud to be a long-term partner here, as we continue to invest in Indiana's future.""

The weeds are where it happens Klein and Thompson are clear that their book does not offer specific policy solutions.","In the introduction to their bestseller Abundance, authors Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson write that the book is “dedicated to a simple idea: to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. That’s it. That’s the thesis. It reads, even to us, as too simple.”

Klein and Thompson are right on both counts.

They are right that addressing the challenges of the climate crisis, affordable housing shortages, prohibitive healthcare costs, and stymied scientific innovation–all topics discussed in the book–will require ramped-up creativity, cooperation, funding, and planning. They are also right that their prescription for this need is too simple, at best.

The book focuses on the proper role and scope of government regulation, arguing that in many situations, government should simply get out of the way. Meanwhile, the warping, smothering influence of corporate money and power lurks on every page unacknowledged, like a monster Klein and Thompson refuse to see.

Scarcity is indeed a choice, as the authors say, but not one being made by overzealous regulators or litigators. Scarcity is a choice made by those who profit from imposing it on the rest of us. The problem is not chiefly a regulatory bottleneck–it is a boot on the neck of progress, competition, innovation, and millions of Americans who struggle to survive, by those enriched by the status quo. Abundance is a detailed indictment of the wrong suspect, which only serves the interests of the real culprits.

A book that hit a nerve

Abundance has garnered significant attention in political and policy circles and has spent more than six months on the New York Times bestseller list, and with good reason. Klein and Thompson are talented writers and the book includes earnest, trenchant observations.

At a time when progressives face constant assault for ineffectual messaging, Abundance feels like a lifeline, offering an alluring vision of a progressive future and identifying past liberal overreach as the barrier to achieving it. In that scenario, it is within liberals’ power to achieve the future “we all want.” Unfortunately, this apparent oasis is a dangerous mirage.

Rose-colored glasses

The original sin of Abundance is careless nostalgia. The book is premised on a rose-colored remembrance of a time when the United States “built things.”

To be sure, the United States has seen periods of explosive growth in manufacturing, housing, highways, and more–in part thanks to lower density, world wars, untapped resources, and undeveloped land. It is true that it only took about five years to erect Hoover Dam. It is also true that scores of workers died during construction.

The “golden ages” of US development came at the cost of lives, neighborhoods, air and water quality, biological diversity, and public health; these costs were largely paid by the poor and those living in Indigenous and front-line communities.

Klein and Thompson are self-described liberals and acknowledge the need for laws protecting the health and wellbeing of people and the environment, but it is difficult to reconcile that with their yearning for the good old days.

Any fair critique of our current regulatory system must begin with a clear-eyed assessment of the devastating, unsustainable, and unjust impacts on people and the planet wrought by oil companies, developers, mining companies, and highway builders before regulations were promulgated to govern them. Abundance fails to do so.

The elephant in the room

In addition to the authors’ averting their eyes from the realities of corporate money and power, they also write in a vacuum divorced from the current political reality.

There is no bill or Executive Order that could pass this Congress, or be signed by this President, to “cut red tape” that would be even remotely responsible. While Klein and Thompson offer their views on the need to speed permitting in good faith, the Trump Administration and the current Congress have already begun to adopt their talking points in the worst faith possible. Big Oil, Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Developers have enormous sway over the agenda in Washington, and they are more than happy to glom on to abundance talking points to maintain wildly profitable scarcities.

Nothing demonstrates this more powerfully than repeal of significant portions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). While neither law was perfect, the IIJA included billions for new infrastructure development and the IRA included funding and tax incentives in support of sustainable electricity generation, clean transportation, green buildings and energy efficiency, sustainable manufacturing, environmental and climate justice, agriculture, forestry, land conservation, and more. In other words, Congress had enacted much of the abundance agenda.

And then, backed by millions from industry, the Trump Administration and the new Congress repealed virtually all of it (including provisions that were clearly benefiting red states) and replaced it with a budget bill designed to help old industries kill new ones. “Red tape” did not reach up and stymie a new age of abundance, wealthy special interests did, and any permitting “reform” passed now will only benefit those same old power players.

To focus on a utopian future where the biggest barrier to “the world we all want” is an inefficient regulatory process, while ignoring the stranglehold that monied interests have on American progress, fails to meet the moment.

The weeds are where it happens

Klein and Thompson are clear that their book does not offer specific policy solutions. Rather, they are offering a “lens” through which these issues might be examined. This feels inadequate. Permitting reform is not a new issue. Dozens of legislative proposals on the topic exist and the authors should reckon with them.

It turns out, every time lawmakers pushing permitting reform put pen to paper, the resulting legislation is the same: some combination of provisions that truncate public participation, limit judicial review, and privilege fossil fuel development even more. In many cases, the proponents of development are already benefiting from an approval process that skirts public awareness and effective judicial review, and they just want to write those shortcuts into law.

To give a recent example, last month the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted to “cut red tape” and approve three new Entergy gas plants to power a data center for Meta. From the beginning, the proceeding lacked transparency and skipped crucial state-mandated measures aimed at saving money for ratepayers. Review by an Administrative Law Judge of the final deal is typically part of the process, but Commissioners rushed a final vote before the judge could even issue a recommendation to the Commission.

A process that was even slightly less rushed would have allowed the judge to express an opinion about whether this proposal was truly in the “public interest” and allowed the Commissioners to attach bare-minimum safeguards for ratepayers as conditions of approval. Instead, regulators hurriedly granted the wishes of Entergy and Meta.

This is not the “future we all want.” This is abundance for Entergy and Meta’s shareholders at the expense of millions of Louisianans and the environment. If the “lens” described in Abundance can be used to justify this kind of irresponsible permitting, it is not a new vision: it is just a new weapon available to the old guard.

The corporate interests which benefit when these proposals become law once claimed such legislation was necessary to “create jobs.” Over time, the messaging evolved through “energy independence” to “energy dominance.” More recently, “national security” and the need to “beat China” have been the alleged justifications. Now these same special interests can claim we need to bar access to the courts and shut the public out of permitting decisions to achieve abundance.

The future we all want

UCS is a nonpartisan science advocacy organization. We advocate for robust science; accountability for fossil fuel corporations; Environmental Justice; democracy; clean energy; healthy and sustainably produced food; clean transportation; and a safer world. And at every turn, the forces lined up to oppose our advocacy are well-funded, powerful, entrenched special interests who profit from a lack of progress on any of those fronts.

Our experience tells us that curtailing the ability of regulators to place even minimal limitations on the appetites of those special interests will not unleash a new era of progressivism: it will only help the rich get richer.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blog-Thumbnail-Target-Missed-its-Mark.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:00:53.935647

The automaker delivered 710,347 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, according to company data released Tuesday. That figure reflects balanced gains across gasoline-powered and electric lineups. SUVs such as the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and Buick Envista all set records, while full-size pickups and large SUVs continued to drive profits. Through nine months, GM has sold 2.2 million vehicles, its strongest start to a year in more than a decade.

10 Coolest Cars That Rocked Pop-Up Headlights

The standout metric, however, was in EVs. GM delivered 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter, its highest volume yet and more than double last year’s pace. Year-to-date EV deliveries now total 144,668 units, cementing GM’s role as the No. 2 EV seller in the U.S., behind Tesla. Analysts credited expanded Ultium-based products, better availability, and competitive pricing.

Still, the strong results come with caveats. The federal $7,500 EV tax credit ended earlier this year under the Trump administration, prompting GM and Ford to quickly launch their own incentive programs of the same value. Analysts say those automaker-backed discounts helped sustain momentum into September, but it remains unclear whether demand will hold steady without federal support.

At the same time, GM’s profitability has lagged. The company reported a 35% income drop for the first half of 2025, citing rising costs, tariffs, and heavy EV investments.

Early state leadership A few governors have already taken a stand to communicate that their states are still open for solar business.
Solar advocates will need to play defense to mitigate the damage.","The Trump Administration’s attack on renewables has rocked the solar industry this year. The full impact of anti-solar legislation and executive orders may not be fully understood until 2026, when the residential tax credit ends, material restrictions begin and start-construction deadlines arrive for the large-scale ITC.

Instead of abandoning all hope, solar advocates are shifting focus to state action.

“Federal government, Congress, they’re walking away from these opportunities. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an opportunity here,” said Sachu Constantine, executive director of Vote Solar. “We’ve long made the case that the actual decisions about deployment, about what resources go into our grid, are made at the state-level.”

It’s not the first time strategies have shifted. During Donald Trump’s first presidency, a “blue wave” in 2018 awarded many governor seats to Democrats. Solar advocates zeroed in on state policies then, mostly pushing for renewable portfolio standards (RPS) requiring utilities to add solar to their portfolios. Now, enormous data center energy demand combined with overall home electrification are creating new, urgent priorities.

“It’s a more mature industry than it was back then. RPS is not really the driving factor these days,” said Sean Gallagher, senior VP of policy for SEIA. “It’s economics and the need for speed, and the attractiveness of solar and storage in terms of both affordability and reliability.”

State budget sensitivity

HR1 didn’t just decimate solar incentives. It stripped money from the states for crucial programs like Medicaid, student loan funding, SNAP benefits and school meals. States will be pressed to find money for many social programs impacted by HR1, so funding for renewable energy may be hard to come by.

Luckily, many efforts that could help reduce the overall cost of solar may not cost states much at all.

“A lot of this is not brand new, but it’s sort of a renewed emphasis on these nuts and bolts, things that states really can do to both facilitate and expedite bringing more resources online,” Gallagher said.

SEIA outlines some main objectives for all solar markets in its “Post-HR1 State Policy Roadmap.” For the larger market, these include enforcing interconnection timelines by penalizing utilities not in compliance, developing “flexible interconnection” policies to bring more solar online without requiring major grid updates and streamlining requirements for solar + storage projects on state lands.

On the small-scale front, SEIA is especially focused on helping residential installers navigate a post-25D market. The group will encourage AHJs to adopt automatic instant permitting via SolarAPP+, ensure policy is in place for companies to adopt third-party-ownership structures to capture the 48E ITC and work to expand statewide virtual power plant options.

“How can we really reduce cost, particularly in the residential sector, so that we can transition solar from a product that’s sold to a product that’s bought?” Gallagher said of SEIA’s focus.

Early state leadership

A few governors have already taken a stand to communicate that their states are still open for solar business.

“It’s what we’ve seen historically — when there’s been disruptions at the federal level, the leading states will step in and ensure that their trajectory toward their goals is at least maintained, if not further supported,” said Kevin Cray, VP of existing markets and regulatory affairs at the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued executive actions over the summer to help residents determine which renewable energy tax credits they qualify for, as well as ensure state agencies cut red tape and prioritize renewable energy projects.

“We must provide confidence to the clean energy industry that Colorado is open for business as tariffs, shifting federal rules, supply chain crunches and market uncertainty risk delaying investment in these affordable domestic energy resources,” wrote Polis in his executive letter.

CCSA worked directly with Polis’ office to offer recommendations for supporting solar in the face of federal uncertainty and was pleased to see its main points reflected in the letter.

“Some of the recommendations around flexible interconnection and stuff like that were very specific, and I think create some of that near-term certainty needed for investments to still move forward,” Cray said.

In Arizona, Gov. Katie Hobbs put forth an executive order in September called “Removing Barriers to Delivering Affordable Energy for Arizona,” with goals of streamlining permitting and speeding energy deployment, including renewables. It establishes the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce, which will develop plans to facilitate large-scale growth and expand Arizona’s clean energy economy.

SEIA and CCSA see these actions as great examples for other states to follow, especially Colorado’s specificity.

“That’s something that we’re certainly running state to state with at this point — trying to get other governors, administrative agencies, etc., to take similar steps as far as some of the exact provisions of the executive action,” Cray said.

Playing defense

While states that already lead on solar will continue to do so, influential oil and gas companies in others will be looking to take full advantage of the support of this “drill, baby drill” administration. Solar advocates will need to play defense to mitigate the damage.

“What’s unfortunate in some of those red states is that the big actors — let’s say the Duke [Energys] of the world, the Georgia Powers, the Southerns, FPLs — they know that solar is the best option. But they also know that in this environment, with the rhetoric coming out of the federal government, they can continue to try to cram some gas into the rate base,” Vote Solar’s Constantine said.

“Wherever we can, we want to get into the planning process early — the Integrated Resource Plans, where the regulators approve or shape the procurement plans for the utilities,” he continued.

Some of those negative actions are already popping up. Although Arizona’s governor supports solar power, the Arizona Corporation Commission unanimously voted to repeal the state’s RPS the month before she put forth her executive order. And the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada recently voted to approve a new rate design that changes the solar net-metering structure to 15-minute netting and adds mandatory demand charges to all customers. Instead of balancing solar production against usage over a full month, customers will now only get credit for excess energy within each 15-minute window. SEIA said the decision “discourages private investment in reliable, affordable, clean energy at a time when the grid needs every electron it can get to power Nevada’s economy.”

Still, the country needs massive amounts of new energy on the grid, and it needs it quickly. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is forecasting continued average electrical consumption growth of 1.7% through 2026, after growth was nearly flat from 2005 to 2020. Solar has consistently been the fastest-growing source of electricity to meet that demand. Advocates plan to cut through the administration’s rhetoric and stick to those facts to win as many policy battles as possible in this trying time.

“We have to bring a real clear focus now on the economic proposition that solar provides and the speed to power that we can do. We have our work cut out for us. But, as you saw at RE+, I think the industry feels like we’re going to figure out a way to manage through this,” Gallagher said.",https://news.energyjobline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/energy_jobline_icons-300x300.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:05:31.967298
,North Carolina Environment,2025-10-06 12:09:44+00:00,News From The States,"Paying farmers proves most cost effective way to conserve Colorado River, study says",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/paying-farmers-proves-most-cost-effective-way-conserve-colorado-river-study-says,"The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent about 30% of water conservation funding between 2004 and 2024 on agricultural projects.
Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline.
Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects.
The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.
It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.","The most cost-effective and quickest way to conserve the Colorado River’s shrinking water supply amid persistent drought and rapid population growth is changing how states handle the largest use of water on the river: agriculture.

Agriculture uses about 80% of the river’s water, but the good news is that paying farmers not to use water allotted to them has proved to be remarkably cost-effective.

That’s according to a comprehensive study examining 462 federally funded Colorado River conservation and supply projects using available spending data from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Water Resources Association last week, was conducted by UC Riverside’s School of Public Policy in partnership with the Utah Rivers Council.

The water projects examined – ranging from large-scale infrastructure such as reservoirs and wastewater treatment plants to agricultural water use – totaled about $1 billion in federal funding between 2004 and 2024.

“How much water is actually being saved for every dollar we are spending?” asks Mehdi Nemati, an assistant professor of public policy, co-author of the study. “If we want to be more efficient or gain more water saved per dollar spent, then answering this question matters.”

“The big message is not all water savings are equal. Some projects saved water at a fraction of the cost of others,” he continued.

Agricultural conservation programs conserved water for as low as $69.89 per acre-foot. On average, agricultural conservation programs cost about $417 per acre-foot, while local supply projects —such as reservoirs, wells, and wastewater treatment facilities—cost more than $2,400 per acre-foot on average. (An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre of land to a depth of one foot, or about 325,851 gallons.)

“Spending money to conserve water within the agriculture sector seems to be one of the most cost-effective ways. There’s also a lot of room to improve and save more water in this sector,” Nemati said. “About 80% of the water goes to agriculture. If you’re using a big share and it’s more cost-effective, then that’s going to need to be the target.”

Historically, farmers have been reluctant to lower their water use out of fear the government might take their water permanently. But the study found that agricultural conservation programs, particularly those that provided financial incentives to promote behavioral changes among farmers, were successful at delivering water savings at a relatively low cost.

The most common type of agricultural conservation program was paying farmers who rely on the Colorado River to reduce their water use on crops during certain non-critical periods, saving an average of 747 acre-feet per year at a cost of about $140 per acre-foot.

Paying farmers to temporarily leave their fields empty – particularly for water-intensive crops like alfalfa – produced an average annual water saving of 17,500 acre-feet per year at an average cost of about $193 per acre-foot, according to the study.

“Grass, alfalfa, corn pasture, these are all water intensive crops. That’s where we get our most savings per dollar, and there is huge room for savings. I would say these are low hanging fruit,” Nemati said.

Other programs studied paid farmers to replace flood irrigation with precision methods such as drip or sprinkler systems, which demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements while maintaining agricultural productivity.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent about 30% of water conservation funding between 2004 and 2024 on agricultural projects.

Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline.

Water-intensive crops are where the savings are

Much of the funding used to pay farmers to conserve Colorado River water was provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which helped double agricultural water conservation from 1.5 million acre-feet of water to over 3 million acre-feet of water, according to the study.

Water recycling and treatment facilities also proved to be a cost-effective way to conserve substantial amounts of water in the long-term, despite higher initial construction costs. Water recycling and treatment facilities had an average lifetime cost of $385 per acre-feet with an average annual water savings of about 18,600 acre-feet.

Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects. California got the lion’s share of that funding, about 80%. Upper Basin states received only 4% of reuse funding, while Tribal areas received no funding.

There’s a lot of room for improvement in water recycling across states that rely on the Colorado River. One recent study found that Upper Basin states – Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico – recycled less than 5% of their water, as compared to Lower Basin states – California, Arizona and Nevada– which recycled more than 30% of their water.

The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.

Between 2004 and 2024, Upper Basin states only received about 6% of overall water conservation spending by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, while about 75% was directed to the Lower Basin, and about 19% was designated for Tribal areas, some of which extend across both regions.

Nevada received nearly $6 million for 28 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of roughly 1,500 acre-feet at a cost of about $3,800 per acre-foot.

It’s a stark contrast to Upper Basin states like Colorado, which received about $610,000 in federal funding for 47 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of about 2,100 acre-feet at a cost of about $285 per acre-foot.

It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.

“In some areas in Nevada there has been tremendous investment in the urban side and efficiency gains in the urban side. But if you’re looking at the lowest dollar per acre feet, water-intensive crops are the areas we want to target,” Nemati said.

“There are areas in the Upper Basin that could save water for a fraction of money being used in Nevada or southern California,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/52627025695_ab463b4dc5_o-1024x7681759764523.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=VisWZGsn,N,,2025-10-06 13:05:17.815192

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets.

The total electrical generation from coal-fired power plants has decreased, while wind power generation has increased.
Efforts are ongoing to reduce CO2 emissions from existing baseload power plants and other energy generation sites through capture and sequestration methods.
Natural gas production is also growing in the Bakken region in western North Dakota.
Located near the existing Pioneer Generation Station northwest of Williston, PGSIV is Basin Electric’s largest generation project built in North Dakota since the 1980s.","Electricity generation in the U.S. has been growing rapidly this year as a result of increasing demands for power from data centers and industrial customers, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The agency expects that total U.S. generation by the electric power sector will grow by 2.3% this year and another 3% in 2026. Solar power is expected to supply the largest share of the increase in both years.

North Dakota produces significantly more energy than is consumed, and the state is a net exporter of energy. Overall, energy consumption has increased over the past decade, primarily through the growth of the industrial sectors, according to a September 2024 draft research report of the state’s energy security and resilience plans by the Energy & Environmental Research Center for the North Dakota Department of Commerce. The total electrical generation from coal-fired power plants has decreased, while wind power generation has increased. Efforts are ongoing to reduce CO2 emissions from existing baseload power plants and other energy generation sites through capture and sequestration methods.

Most of the electricity produced in the state is generated by coal-fired power plants, although electricity generation from renewable wind power has grown quickly over the past 10 years. Natural gas production is also growing in the Bakken region in western North Dakota.

Taking advantage of the increased natural gas production, Basin Electric Power Cooperative will build a natural gas-fueled combined-cycle power plant in Williams County, called Bison Generation Station. The need for the station was determined through the co-op’s load forecasting and power supply planning process, a release states. This includes an annual load forecast, which is a cooperative effort among distribution members, generation and transmission members, and Basin Electric for its entire service area.

“Basin Electric’s 2024 Load Forecast highlighted strong oil and gas-related growth in the Bakken region, in addition to growth across Basin Electric’s service territory ,” said Benjamin Hertz, Basin Electric’s manager of power supply planning. “Bison Generation Station addresses the growing energy demands of member electric cooperatives, which serve a wide variety of traditional load sectors including agriculture, oil and gas, ethanol, manufacturing and residential.”

Crews began initial site grading in August under the observation of North Dakota Public Service Commission’s third-party inspector. The grading work was done this summer and fall to prepare the site for the planned construction start in 2026.

The flagship resource for Basin Electric’s membership will be capable of providing a long-term dispatchable supply of generation to the area, the release states, which can be delivered across the co-op’s service territory in the Southwest Power Pool.

Another project for the utility is the newly completed Pioneer Generation Station Phase IV. The natural gas-fueled generation facility is a combination of combustion turbine and reciprocating engine units that provide dispatch flexibility while addressing near-term load growth and long-term grid stability in the Bakken region, a release about the project states. Located near the existing Pioneer Generation Station northwest of Williston, PGSIV is Basin Electric’s largest generation project built in North Dakota since the 1980s. It will generate approximately 580 megawatts (MW) of electricity.

Gavin McCollam, Basin Electric senior vice president and chief operating officer, said the successful completion of the PGSIV project – on time, under budget and with a great safety record – is exactly what the team strives for every single time.

Just off I-49, MMR will transform an existing building into a state-of-the-art assembly facility and continue to fuel an industry that powers our everyday lives. It’s proof that when businesses choose Lafayette, they choose growth, innovation and opportunity for everyone.”

To encourage MMR to expand its manufacturing and assembly business in Lafayette, the state of Louisiana offered a competitive incentives package including a $500,000 performance-based grant for building renovations and the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and High Impact Jobs programs.

“We are thrilled to welcome MMR Group’s state-of-the-art assembly facility to Lafayette which represents a significant milestone in LEDA’s ongoing economic diversification efforts,” Lafayette Economic Development Authority President and CEO Mandi Mitchell said. “This announcement builds on the momentum we’ve seen throughout 2025 since the announcement of Meta’s major investment in Louisiana. Together, these projects reinforce Lafayette’s position as a premier destination for advanced manufacturing and technology-driven industries.

The investment bank also raised its price target on Ford by 33.3% to $12.

Ford‘s shares have closed at $12.67 on Friday and have surged nearly 30% year to date.

Analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a new research note — obtained by PriceTarget — that Ford‘s management had already mentioned a “multi-billion opportunity” for the company given “looser” GHG (greenhouse gas) and CO2 regulations.

This allows the company to concentrate on selling more profitable petrol and diesel models — especially pick-up trucks and SUVs, which make up a large portion of its US sales.

Jefferies expects Ford “will refrain from providing 2026 guidance until next year,” after the company suspended its 2025 guidance in May, citing the uncertainty of the US tariffs’ impact.

By then, Ford said it expected to take a $1.5 billion hit caused by Trump’s tariffs.

However, the analyst said that the automaker “could comment on potential mix benefits starting in Q4 and a shift in EV strategy.”

Last week, the company announced that it delivered a record 85,789 electric vehicles in the third quarter, as demand jumped ahead of the EV consumer credit deadline on September 30.

“We already assumed lower losses from model e,” Houchois noted, as Ford both shifts EV exposure to Europe, “where unit losses are lower,” and as the company normalizes “spending on the Universal Platform scheduled for 2027.”

In August, the analyst had already said that the automaker should be able to materially reduce losses at its Model e electric vehicle unit from 2026, pointing to Q2 results that showed all incremental revenue over Q1 coming from Europe, while divisional losses held steady.

Ford announced in August that it will invest “approximately $5 billion” to develop a new EV platform and launch a midsize four-door electric pickup in 2027 with a target starting price of $30,000.

According to Jefferies, Ford‘s strong compliance with US fuel economy and emissions rules, combined with earned regulatory credits, has kept its compliance costs low.

In a earlier note, Houchois raised the firm’s 2025 adjusted EBIT estimate for Ford by 2% to $6.9 billion, with its Credit division offsetting weaker Pro segment results.

They also lifted its free cash flow forecast by 12% to $2.7 billion on a higher internal Credit dividend — though still below company guidance.

On Monday, Houchois wrote that 43% of Ford‘s US volume is in full size pick-ups and SUVs, while estimating that 60 to 80% of North American sales and profits are coming from Ford‘s Pro and Blue divisions.

“Loosening current constraints” on a mix of higher CO2 mix models, like the Raptor and ST-Line, “should enable Ford to offset tariffs and improve earnings next year.”

Jefferies expects Ford “to remain committed to an electrification strategy,” saying that it should benefit from a longer adjustment period.”

Given Friday’s closing price of Ford shares, the new price target implies a downside of 5.3%.

Houchois also raised the firm’s price target on Detroit automaker General Motors, from $50 to $55, while maintaining a Hold rating on the stock.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cqdam.web_.2400.webp?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-06 10:01:14.409826

And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.
“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.
The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.","U.S. government support of sustainable aviation fuel has waned, shifting the impetus for increasing its production to the states. But progress continues.

“It’s a pivot,” says Keith Sawyer, Avfuel manager of alternative fuels. “The focus had been typically on the federal government; now investors are including what may or may not be offered by states in their calculations, in their rates of return on investment in facilities.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) that became law with President Donald Trump’s signature on July 4 amended the existing 45Z clean fuel production credit (CFPC) to benefit biofuel producers instead of blenders and extended it for two years through 2029. Added to the tax code during the Biden administration through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CFPC was set to expire in 2027.

The continuation of the tax credit is cause for some optimism that ongoing development of SAF capacity is supported—given that one of Trump’s early actions after becoming president in January was to pause funding disbursements under the IRA, which was considered a major achievement of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.

Trump’s executive order was slowed by legal challenges, but the OBBB approved by the Republican majority in Congress contains a section that rescinds unobligated balances of the FAA’s Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant program, also established under the IRA.

The Biden administration had announced $291 million in FAST grants in August 2024, primarily for 22 projects “that produce, transport, blend or store sustainable aviation fuel.” The largest single grant—$50 million—went to Martinez Renewables LLC, a 50/50 joint venture of Marathon Petroleum and SAF producer Neste, to fund the conversion of a Marathon facility in Martinez, California, for renewable fuels production.

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.

Under the OBBB, the CFPC has been modified; the value of the credit for production of “neat” or pure, unblended SAF declines from $1.75-per-gallon to $1-per-gallon after 2025, aligning it with the credit for renewable diesel. And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada. Sugar cane, soybeans, tallow, used oils and greases sourced outside of North America won’t qualify.

“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.

The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Also welcoming the new 45Z credit as one of the OBBB’s “America First” energy provisions was Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, a coalition that joins Airbus, Airlines for America, Delta Air Lines, and NBAA representing the aviation industry with agriculture groups and energy companies ExxonMobil and BP.

Ready to explore how your facility qualifies for New Jersey manufacturing tax credits?","Governor Phil Murphy signed the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program into law on August 13, 2025. This marks New Jersey’s most significant manufacturing investment in recent history.

The program allocates $500 million in New Jersey manufacturing tax credits. But these aren’t standard tax incentives. They’re transferable, stackable, and designed to reward manufacturers who think long-term.

Why New Jersey is betting big on manufacturing now

The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) has already approved 431 applications through its Manufacturing Voucher Program, distributing over $66.2 million. These companies committed to investing $252.7 million in return, nearly four times the state’s contribution.

That’s the multiplier effect New Jersey wants to replicate at scale.

The state faces increasing pressure from federal tariffs and supply chain disruptions. This program utilizes $500 million from existing Aspire and Emerge credits, redirecting them specifically toward manufacturing job creation and in-state production capacity.

Understanding New Jersey manufacturing tax credits

The credit calculation follows a specific formula. You receive the lesser of three amounts:

Formula 1: 0.1% of your total capital investment × number of new full-time jobs created

Formula 2: 25% of your total qualified capital investment

Formula 3: $150 million (program maximum per project)

Let’s make this concrete. Say your facility plans a $50 million equipment upgrade and will create 100 new positions.

Formula 1: ($50M × 0.001) × 100 = $5 million

Formula 2: $50M × 0.25 = $12.5 million

Formula 3: $150M (not applicable)

You’d receive $5 million in New Jersey manufacturing tax credits under this scenario.

The clean energy carve-out creates first mover advantage

$100 million in tax credits during the first two years are reserved exclusively for clean energy product manufacturers. This includes solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen production.

After two years, unused clean energy credits roll into general manufacturing allocation. This creates a window where clean energy manufacturers face less competition for funds.

If your facility produces components for renewable energy systems, you’re competing for a smaller pool initially. That improves your odds significantly.

Bonus credits stack and they add up fast

The base credit is just your starting point. New Jersey offers stackable bonuses for companies holding state business certifications, operating in Opportunity Zones, or maintaining collective bargaining agreements.

These bonuses can add up to 5% to your total credit. On a $10 million award, that’s an additional $500,000.

Bonus eligibility categories:

Minority and Women Business Enterprises (MWBE) certification

Veteran-Owned Business (VOB) certification

Opportunity Zone location

Collective bargaining or labor harmony agreements

Multiple bonuses can apply simultaneously. A MWBE-certified manufacturer in an Opportunity Zone with union representation qualifies for multiple stacked benefits.

What “Qualified Business Facility” actually means

Your project must center on a physical manufacturing facility in New Jersey. The minimum capital investment threshold sits at $10 million.

Capital investment includes:

Manufacturing equipment and machinery

Facility construction or expansion

Technology systems supporting production

Technology systems supporting production

It excludes

Working capital

Inventory

Non-manufacturing administrative spaces

The facility must remain operational in New Jersey for 10 years. This isn’t a short-term play.

Job creation requirements go beyong headcount

You must create at least 20 new full-time positions. But quantity isn’t enough, these positions must meet specific wage requirements.

The program emphasizes “good-paying jobs“. While exact wage thresholds aren’t published yet, expect them to align with prevailing wage standards for manufacturing in New Jersey.

The program also requires partnerships with New Jersey educational institutions or workforce entities. This ensures your hiring connects with local talent development infrastructure.

Environmental standards are non-negotiable

Every participating facility must comply with minimum environmental and sustainability standards. These requirements recognize that modern manufacturing success depends on sustainable practices.

Expect documentation requirements around:

Energy efficiency measures

Waste reduction protocols

Emissions management

Water conservation practices

Green manufacturing isn’t just good for New Jersey manufacturing tax credits eligibility, it’s increasingly what customers demand.

Credits are issued over five years not upfront

Your total credit award gets distributed over a five-year period. Annual disbursements depend on continued compliance.

You must maintain:

Required job levels

Facility operations in New Jersey

Educational/workforce partnerships

Prevailing wage standards

Environmental compliance

Fail any requirement, and that year’s credit is forfeited. This structure protects taxpayer investment while ensuring manufacturers deliver promised benefits.

The transferability feature changes everything

These credits are transferable, meaning you can sell or assign them.

For manufacturers without sufficient tax liability to use credits immediately, transferability creates liquidity. You can monetize credits through sale to companies with tax liability.

This transforms credits from future tax savings into current capital, exactly what growing manufacturers need.

Unused credits can be carried forward for 10 years, providing additional flexibility for facilities with variable tax liability.

Applications open soon on first-come, first-served basis

The NJEDA will accept rolling applications through March 1, 2029. But the $500 million pool operates first-come, first-served.

Early applications have strategic advantages:

Less competition for available funds

More time to gather documentation

Ability to adjust project plans based on feedback

Projects already in planning stages should accelerate preparation. Every month of delay means more competitors enter the queue.

What should manufacturers do right now?

Assess project timing: Can you reach the $10 million capital investment threshold? Do you have expansion plans that could be accelerated?

Review workforce plans: Will you create at least 20 new positions? How do wages compare to prevailing standards?

Identify partnership opportunities: Which New Jersey educational institutions or workforce programs align with your hiring needs?

Document sustainability measures: What environmental standards does your facility already meet? Where can you strenghten compliance?

Calculate potential credits: Run the formulas with your actual investment and job creation numbers. Understand your realistic award range.

The strategic context: Why this matters beyond tax savings

New Jersey positions itself as having “the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem in the nation“. This program advances that vision through targeted manufacturing support.

For manufacturers, New Jersey manufacturing tax credits represent more than tax relief. They signal where the state is investing infrastructure, workforce development and regulatory support.

Facilities that establish themselves now gain access to an ecosystem being actively built around manufacturing success.

Next steps for your facility

The NJEDA hasn’t opened applications yet. But preparation determines success.

Companies that win competitive funding programs share common traits: they start early, document thoroughly and align projects with program priorities.

Tesla has teased an October 7 event, likely to unveil a more affordable Model Y and sustain sales.

Tesla expects the more affordable Model Y to be 20% cheaper to manufacture and aims to reach an annual production of 250,000 units in the U.S. by 2026.

The teaser follows record quarterly deliveries ahead of the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, but analysts warn that sales may slow without incentives.

On Sunday, Tesla teased an event on October 7, sending shares up 2% in premarket trading as investors and analysts speculated that the company may unveil a long-awaited, more affordable electric vehicle.

The teaser, a nine-second video posted on the social media platform X, showed a vehicle with its headlights illuminated in a dark setting. A second video hinted at the scheduled date with “10/7” at the end, stoking anticipation for the announcement.

Analysts expect Tesla to unveil a lower-cost version of its Model Y, which the company had previously delayed in the U.S. market. In June, Tesla announced that it had completed the “first builds” of the vehicle, with plans to begin selling it in the fourth quarter and gradually ramp up production. The stripped-down Model Y is projected to cost roughly 20% less to produce than the refreshed version.

The teaser follows Tesla’s record quarterly deliveries for the three months ending September, fueled by a surge in purchases before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. However, analysts warn that sales may slow in the coming months without the incentive. Wall Street estimates Tesla’s deliveries will climb to 1.85 million vehicles in 2025, with the new model contributing about 155,610 units by 2026, according to Visible Alpha data.

Tesla faces mounting pressure from an aging vehicle lineup. The automaker has not introduced a new mass-market model in years, relying instead on incremental updates to the Model 3 and Model Y. The company’s most recent major launch, the Cybertruck, has underperformed, prompting the company to offer discounts on its inventory. A U.S. recall filing in March showed that 46,096 Cybertrucks were built between its November 2023 debut and early 2024.

The October 7 event is viewed as a pivotal moment for Tesla to sustain sales momentum and capture buyer interest amid rising competition and the impending end of federal EV tax incentives.

The move adds a third production site to existing facilities in Edina, Minnesota and Jubail, Saudi Arabia, positioning the company to meet rising demand across the Asia-Pacific region more efficiently and sustainably.

The agreement, scheduled to close in Q4 2025, forms part of DuPont’s long-term strategy to strengthen regional manufacturing and reduce the distance between production and end use.

It directly supports DuPont’s flagship water technology brand, FilmTec, which produces high-efficiency membranes used in reverse osmosis water purification.

""This acquisition aligns with our strategy to enhance our global manufacturing capabilities for FilmTec RO elements and better serve our customers in China and the Asia Pacific region,"" explains Jeroen Bloemhard, President of DuPont's Healthcare & Water Technologies segment.

""With an expanded global manufacturing footprint, DuPont remains dedicated to providing solutions that purify and reclaim water sources, particularly in regions facing water scarcity and resource challenges.""

Local manufacturing to support resilient water supply chains

Reverse osmosis is a pressure-driven process that removes salts, minerals and dissolved solids from water. It is widely used across sectors such as power generation, food production and municipal water supply.

With growing industrial demand and increased urbanisation across the Asia-Pacific region, DuPont sees regional production as essential for fast and reliable delivery of water treatment technologies.

By manufacturing FilmTec RO elements locally in China, DuPont says it can reduce delivery lead times, simplify logistics and better navigate market-specific regulations.

The newly-acquired Sinochem site is already qualified to produce FilmTec membranes for use in China and the wider Asia-Pacific market. The goal is to localise supply for regional customers while increasing flexibility and lowering operational risk.

DuPont’s approach is based on matching production capabilities with geographic demand. It allows the company to serve its core customers, industrial users, municipal water authorities and food and beverage manufacturers, through shorter supply routes and improved regional agility.

The localisation strategy also plays a key role in supporting supply chain continuity. In an environment where global logistics are often strained and regulatory conditions evolve rapidly, the company says having regional manufacturing nodes is now essential.

Water treatment and the energy transition

DuPont’s broader water technology portfolio already purifies more than 50 million gallons of water per minute across 112 countries, through a combination of membrane and resin products.

The technologies are used in desalination, demineralisation and water reuse applications.

FilmTec, as the core brand for RO membranes, is widely recognised for delivering high performance in demanding conditions. The company continues to focus on the intersection of water and energy challenges.

DuPont’s water technologies are used not only in traditional industrial applications but also in energy-related sectors, including lithium extraction and green hydrogen production. Both areas require large volumes of purified water and are central to future clean energy strategies.

By adding a localised manufacturing base in China, DuPont can respond more effectively to these emerging demands. The move also supports sustainability by reducing reliance on long-distance shipping, which lowers the carbon footprint of supply and improves the speed of delivery for critical components.

The acquisition strengthens DuPont’s ability to supply essential infrastructure components at a time when water scarcity is intensifying and pressure to reuse industrial water is rising.

The combination of regional production, reliable technology and application-specific expertise positions DuPont to address both environmental and operational challenges in a growing market.

Preparing for rising water demand in Asia-Pacific

The Asia-Pacific region is facing one of the fastest increases in demand for advanced water treatment solutions. Industries and governments alike are investing in solutions that can support growing populations, climate resilience and circular water use.

Reverse osmosis is central to these efforts, offering a proven method for turning previously unusable water sources into clean, usable water.

With this acquisition, DuPont is aligning its operations with these long-term trends.

The decision to build regional resilience through local manufacturing is not just a cost-saving measure, it is also a forward-looking approach to securing water supply chains for sectors that increasingly depend on reliable purification technologies.

By reinforcing its FilmTec manufacturing network in China, DuPont is aiming to meet regional needs quickly, adapt to local conditions and deliver RO elements more sustainably.

As demand for clean water and reuse solutions grows, DuPont’s expanded footprint could play a key role in enabling more efficient and secure water systems across Asia-Pacific.

The Sinochem facility looks set to serve as a strategic hub in DuPont’s effort to balance global supply capacity with localised market response.

Through this model, the company is working to ensure its technologies can be delivered where and when they are needed most, while building supply chains that are both robust and responsible.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8a15e740bc3ecfb1d7e9c3456e7d691a:f235d9d7d5a5552548c185af57ffb45a/reverse-osmosis.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 08:00:15.884580

Although EPA risk evaluations are based on theoretical and conservatively modeled conditions that are often criticized, the draft evaluation demonstrates a shift in the EPA's position as it relates to D4. For the first time, the agency has concluded that D4 may pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment under certain circumstances. The EPA found that D4—a chemical precursor widely used to produce various silicone chemicals and an ingredient in certain personal care products—presents unreasonable risk to human health via several potential exposure pathways that are covered under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Key findings include:

Human Health Risks

Unreasonable risks were identified for workers across 23 conditions of use, and for consumers under one condition of use, when recommended personal protective equipment is not used.

Environmental Risks

D4 was found to pose unreasonable environmental risks under seven conditions of use.

No Risk Identified

Over 30 additional conditions of use were evaluated and found not to present unreasonable risks to human health or the environment.

The conditions allegedly associated with elevated risk primarily involved manufacturing, processing, and industrial uses of D4 and its derivatives in adhesive, sealant, paint, coating, corrosion inhibitor, and solvent applications. Notably, the conditions of use considered by EPA are theoretical and conservatively modeled exposure scenarios that do not account for the use of personal protective equipment and other safeguards utilized to reduce chemical exposure in industrial and environmental settings. Therefore, they may not represent actual exposure scenarios for this chemical.

In light of EPA's draft evaluation, companies operating in industrial sectors should continue to monitor future developments concerning D4 and consult counsel as appropriate.

(Nasdaq: NUAI) (“New Era,” or the “Company”), a developer and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure and integrated power assets, today announced the commencement of Phase Two engineering for Texas Critical Data Centers LLC (“TCDC”), its flagship data center and power development project located in West Texas. In addition, on October 3, 2025, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission providing an update on its financial status.

Phase Two Engineering Underway

New Era recently announced the completion of Phase One engineering for the TCDC project [read here], its joint venture with Sharon AI Inc. TCDC has now advanced into Phase Two engineering, focusing on detailed site planning, site clearing, and infrastructure integration for the data center campus. TCDC is collecting bids for site clearing, with work expected to begin within the next 60 days.

TCDC also highlighted significant progress on obtaining air permits. The data center site is located in an air-quality attainment zone, a positive factor differentiating it from other data center projects. TCDC is pursuing a minor source air permit, a streamlined process that allows up to 250 tons of emissions per year and can typically be approved within 90 days. By comparison, a major source air permit under current air emission standards can take 18 months or longer. TCDC believes its flexibility to develop multiple power islands under minor source air permitting standards provides another key competitive advantage, setting its data center campus apart from other developments.

Land Expansion

TCDC plans to close on the acquisition of the additional 203 acres previously announced within 60–90 days, expanding the site to 438 contiguous acres and further strengthening its land position for long-term scalability. With this land expansion, TCDC’s West Texas data center campus is now being designed to ultimately scale to 1 GW or above, supporting the surging demand for AI and GPU-driven digital infrastructure.

Project Timeline

Additional near-term milestones include expanding behind-the-meter power capacity and submitting a large-load interconnection application. In 2026, the focus will shift to starting construction of behind-the-meter power, and commencing initial data center construction, with capacity expansion planned to begin in 2027 to meet demand.

Regulatory Filing: 8-K

On October 3, 2025, New Era filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing is available on the SEC's website at sec.gov and further describes the retirement of its outstanding convertible notes while also accessing its existing equity line of credit.

E. Will Gray II, CEO of New Era Energy & Digital, commented: “We are making tangible progress across all fronts including engineering, permitting, regulatory filings, and land expansion. Additionally, our financial status update located within the October 3rd 8-K reflects the Company’s continued commitment to transparency and disciplined execution as we advance Phase Two of the TCDC project. I would also like to thank our significant investor who supported the Company during the de-SPAC process through convertible notes, the remaining balance of which management strategically converted during periods of higher trading volume in conjunction with an equity line of credit. These notes are now fully satisfied, strengthening our balance sheet and providing the cash reserves needed to advance through Phase Two and beyond. With the additional 203 acres, we now have the capacity to scale TCDC to 1 gigawatt, positioning New Era at the forefront of AI-powered infrastructure.”

Questioning the Science President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.
In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.
Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.
Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.","The Trump administration’s plan to revoke a key finding that certain greenhouse gases pose a risk to human health removes one of the most potent tools for emissions regulation from the last two decades, according to former EPA air office leadership.

The proposal to nix the 2009 endangerment finding is on a fast-track for finalization, and former leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency say it will claw back US climate progress and create a vacuum of strong GHG regulations.

“The political leadership is essentially performing a lobotomy on itself,” according to Joe Goffman, who led the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden. “The surgery began when they essentially shed all of the climate staff in the last couple of months.”

Three former EPA Administrators—William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman, and Gina McCarthy—wrote to current Administrator Lee Zeldin Sept. 22, expressing opposition to the endangerment proposal and urging him to “follow the law, the science, and EPA’s mission” by withdrawing the revocation plan.

Following through with the plan, in combination with the agency’s decision to end greenhouse gas reporting requirements, jeopardizes emissions enforcement under the Clean Air Act, Whitman said in an interview with Bloomberg Law.

“The whole point behind all of this is to stop regulating, the irony that’s lost on most people, that we are banning Tylenol, but we don’t seem to care about air pollution,” Whitman said, referencing unproven claims from the Trump administration about the alleged dangers of the pain and fever reducer.

Questioning the Science

President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.

The EPA is also looking to cut its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which would end agency insight into how much GHG pollution is coming from large emitters across the country.

In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.

Supporters of Trump’s plan to kill the finding this time around echo some of the justifications used in unsuccessful petitions of the past, namely that the finding puts undue regulatory pressure on industry and is based on faulty or incomplete scientific record.

The proposal itself relies heavily on a Department of Energy report that casts doubt on the extensive scientific record on climate change, claiming that carbon-induced warming “might be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial.”

Creating Uncertainty

Staff who served during the agency’s early climate work in the late 90s and early 2000s fought for the type of change the endangerment finding eventually brought to the EPA’s air rulemaking regime, and see major backsliding on climate mitigation without such a crucial tool.

Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.

But those efforts “were not getting the kind of emissions reductions that science was clearly showing would be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes and smoke stacks,” Symons said.

The revocation proposal is currently just past its public comment period, and working its way to finalization. Once final, legal challenges are all but inevitable, which many clean air experts say hurts industry as much as public health with prolonged regulatory uncertainty.

Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.

“It’s the worst case scenario for our safety,” he said. “It’s the worst case scenario for business, because the one thing that hurts everybody is having this chaotic wrecking ball approach that nobody thinks will stand up over the long term.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/9eece9d/2147483647/crop/5996x2311+0+177/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fc4%2F72754f4d49ad98904a2e0d6fb29e%2Fdec3-smog.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:28.819086

Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good.
I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact.
I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too.
They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them.","But I don’t think this is a reason to be pessimistic. I see it as cause for optimism, because humans are very good at inventing things. In fact, we’ve already created many tools that are reducing emissions. In just the past 10 years, energy breakthroughs have lowered the global forecast for emissions in 2040 by 40%. In other words, because of the human capacity to innovate, we are on course to reduce emissions substantially by 2040 even if nothing else changes.

And I am confident that more positive changes are coming. I’ve been learning about global warming and investing in ideas to stop it for the past 20 years. I’ve connected with unbiased scientists and innovators who are committed to preventing a climate disaster. Ten years ago, some of them joined me in creating Breakthrough Energy, an investment group whose sole purpose is to accelerate clean energy innovation. We’ve supported more than 150 companies so far, many of which have blossomed into major businesses such as Fervo Energy and Redwood Materials, two of this year’s Companies to Watch. [Editor’s note: Mr. Gates did not participate in the selection process of this year’s companies and was not aware that two Breakthrough investments had been selected when he agreed to write this essay.]

Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good. They will remake virtually every aspect of the world’s economy in the coming years, transforming energy markets, manufacturing, transportation, and many types of industry and food production. Some of these efforts will require long-term commitments, but it’s important that we act now. And what’s more, it’s already clear where the opportunities lie.

In the past decade, an ecosystem of thousands of innovators, investors, and industry leaders has emerged to work on every aspect of the problem. This year’s list of 10 Climate Tech Companies to Watch shows just a few of the many examples.

Although much of this innovation ecosystem has matured on American shores, it has become a global movement that won’t be stopped by new obstacles in the US. It’s unfortunate that governments in the US and other countries have decided to cut funding for climate innovations and reverse some of the policies that help breakthrough ideas get to scale. In this environment, we need to be more rigorous than ever about spending our time, money, and ingenuity on efforts that will have the biggest impact.

How do we figure out which ones those are? First, by understanding which activities are responsible for the most emissions. I group them into five categories: electricity generation, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and heating and cooling for buildings.

Of course, the zero-carbon tools we have today aren’t distributed evenly across these sectors. In some sectors, like electricity, we’ve made a great deal of progress. In others, like agriculture and manufacturing, we’ve made much less. To compare progress across the board, I use what I call the Green Premium, which is the difference in cost between the clean way of doing something and the conventional way that produces emissions.

For example, sustainable aviation fuel now costs more than twice as much as conventional jet fuel, so it has a Green Premium of over 100%. Solar and wind power have grown quickly because in many cases they’re cheaper than conventional sources of electricity—that is, they have a negative Green Premium.

The Green Premium isn’t purely financial. To be competitive, clean alternatives also need to be as practical as what they’re replacing. Far more people will buy EVs once you can charge one up as quickly as you can fill your tank with gasoline.

I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact. Where it’s high, as in the case of jet fuel, we need innovators and investors to jump on the problem. Where it’s low or even negative, we need to overcome the barriers that are keeping the technologies from reaching a global scale.

A new technology has to overcome a lot of challenges to beat the incumbents, but being able to compete on cost is absolutely essential. So if I could offer one piece of advice to every company working on zero-carbon technologies, it would be to focus on lowering and eliminating the Green Premium in whatever sector you’ve chosen. Think big. If your technology can be competitive enough to eventually eliminate at least 1% of global emissions per year—that’s 0.5 gigatons—you’re on the right track.

I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too. They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them. This is not just a public good: The countries that win the race to develop these breakthroughs will create jobs, hold enormous economic power for decades to come, and become more energy independent.

In addition, young scientists and entrepreneurs should think about how they can put their skills toward these challenges. It’s an exciting time—the people who begin a career in clean technology today will have an enormous impact on human welfare. If you need pointers, the Climate Tech Atlas published last month by Breakthrough Energy and other partners is an excellent guide to the technologies that are essential for decarbonizing the economy and helping people adapt to a warmer climate.

Finally, I’d encourage investors to put serious money into companies with technologies that can meaningfully reduce the Green Premium. Consider it an investment in what will be the biggest growth industry of the 21st century. Companies have made dramatic progress on better and cleaner solutions in every sector; what many of them need now is private-sector capital and partnerships to help them reach the scale at which they’ll have a real impact on emissions.

Transforming the entire physical economy is an unprecedented task, and it can only be accomplished through markets—by supporting companies with breakthrough ideas that beat fossil fuels on cost and practicality. It’s going to take investors who are both patient and willing to accept the risk that some companies will fail. Of course, governments and nonprofits have a role in the energy transition too, but ultimately, our success will hinge on climate innovators’ ability to build profitable companies.

If we get this right—and I believe we will—then in the next decade, we’ll see fewer news stories about missed emissions targets and more stories about how emissions are dropping fast because the world invented and deployed breakthrough ideas: clean liquid fuels that power passenger jets and cargo ships; neighborhoods built with zero-emissions steel and cement; fusion plants that generate an inexhaustible supply of clean electricity.","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bill-Gates_Headshot_social.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 08:00:20.095043

That's why we've spent years building wind farms across the UK and beyond and created innovative ways for our customers to join the green energy revolution.

Now we're taking our biggest international leap yet. We've just launched our first African energy fund with the goal of mobilising £250 million over the next three years to bring clean energy to communities across the continent.

Unlocking Africa’s Renewable Potential

Africa is home to nearly 40% of the world's renewable energy potential. Yet this energy-rich continent receives just 2% of global clean energy investment. Millions of people still lack reliable electricity despite sitting on some of the planet's best solar and wind resources.

That’s exactly what we want to change. To supercharge the energy transition across Africa’s sun-soaked landscapes, we’ve launched the Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund with an initial £60 million and an ambitious plan to grow it to £250 million over the next three years. From rooftop solar and battery storage to electric vehicle charging and smart grid upgrades, the fund will back projects that light up Sub-Saharan Africa.

A Different Approach to Investment

We want to do this right. That's why we're working with investors who share our mission and who understand that positive impact and investment go together. These include family offices, foundations, and individuals who care about building something meaningful alongside financial success.

We're also working with fund design experts to create more flexible investment structures than typical infrastructure funds, ensuring our approach works for both investors and the communities we're supporting.

Creating Opportunity, One Community at a Time

While our new Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund is our most ambitious leap in Africa yet, it’s far from the beginning of our journey there. In partnership with Idris Elba’s Akuna Group, we’re building Sierra Leone's first wind farm to bring clean, affordable energy to the area and kick-start a new wave of green economy,

Across Africa, brilliant minds are developing the next breakthrough energy technologies. To celebrate and support their innovation, we’ve launched the Africa Energy Entrepreneurship Awards in partnership with the King’s Sustainable Markets Initiative.

And we are also working with MOPO, a solar-powered battery company renting power-bank-style units on a pay-as-you-go basis, helping households and businesses unlock economic opportunities that were previously out of reach.

Global problems require global solutions

You might wonder what an African solar farm has to do with British energy customers. The answer is everything. Climate change doesn't respect borders. Every solar panel installed in Kenya reduces global carbon emissions. Every wind turbine in South Africa means one less coal plant needed anywhere else.

The global energy transition benefits everyone. By generating power where the sun shines brightest and the wind blows strongest, we can make the most of abundant renewable potential. This means driving down energy costs quickly while building a clean energy system that benefits all.

When we help power a hospital in Ghana or connect a school in Kenya to the grid, we're part of building a fairer, cleaner world. Africa's energy demand is expected to grow faster than anywhere on Earth. The choice we make now about how to power that growth will shape the climate for generations.

The Energy Revolution Goes Global

We've proven that renewable energy can be cheap, reliable, and popular. Our customers love our clean tariffs and innovative products. like The Collective, where people can invest in local wind and solar projects from £25.

Now we're scaling that success globally. Africa could become a clean energy superpower with its abundant sunshine, strong winds, and growing energy demand. Expanding access to renewable energy doesn’t just power homes; it powers opportunity. It enables entrepreneurs to thrive, businesses to grow, and communities to build sustainable prosperity for the future.

Our job as a global energy disruptor is to help local communities and investors make that happen.

As of 2022, the US had almost 4,000 megawatts of installed geothermal energy, meaning Cape Station would be equivalent to around 12% of the country’s geothermal capacity.
Caveats Any fracking project comes with the risk of earthquakes—a hazard that has plagued previous geothermal efforts in South Korea and Switzerland.","By harnessing heat from deep below ground, Fervo promises 24/7 clean geothermal energy—potentially anywhere. The company uses fracking techniques to create geothermal reservoirs capable of delivering enough electricity to power massive data centers and hundreds of thousands of homes.

Some places on Earth hit the geological jackpot for generating electricity. In those spots, three conditions naturally align: high temperatures, plentiful water, and rock that’s permeable enough for fluids to circulate through.

Enhanced geothermal systems aim to replicate those conditions in far more places—producing a steady supply of renewable energy wherever they’re deployed. Fervo’s approach centers on two key techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry.

First, the company uses fracking, pumping high-pressure water to crack open the deep, hot rock. Second, in addition to drilling down, Fervo also drills sideways. This means Fervo can access more hot rock in each well.

Combining these strategies with special diamond drilling bits that rapidly chew through rock means Fervo can drill faster and cheaper than previously thought possible for geothermal. As a result, the cost of its electricity could be competitive with—or even more affordable than—other sources like coal or nuclear power.

Fervo has already shown that its technology can deliver power at commercial scale. In 2023, its Project Red in Nevada demonstrated its 3.5-megawatt capacity and began feeding electricity into the local grid that powers Google’s data centers.

Key indicators

Industry: Geothermal energy

Founded: 2017

Headquarters: Houston, Texas, US

Notable fact: In June, Fervo announced it had drilled its hottest and deepest well to date: a well plunging 15,765 feet deep and reaching 520 °F (271 °C).

Potential for impact

Geothermal plants provide low-emissions power and need less land to produce the same amount of electricity as other renewable energy sources and coal-fired power stations. And unlike weather-dependent wind and solar, geothermal can be a round-the-clock energy source for the grid. That could be a major benefit as AI and data centers push electricity demand higher across the US and around the world.

Fervo was featured on the 2023 edition of this list and has made steady progress since. In fact, it’s now building the world’s largest enhanced geothermal power plant, Cape Station, in southwestern Utah.

Southern California Edison, Shell Energy North America, and others have agreed to buy electricity from the 500-megawatt–capacity project starting next year. That’s enough energy to power more than 400,000 average-sized US homes. As of 2022, the US had almost 4,000 megawatts of installed geothermal energy, meaning Cape Station would be equivalent to around 12% of the country’s geothermal capacity.

Fervo also benefits from a rare political sweet spot: US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was one of Fervo’s early investors while at the energy services firm Liberty Energy, has listed geothermal as one of his top priorities.

Caveats

Any fracking project comes with the risk of earthquakes—a hazard that has plagued previous geothermal efforts in South Korea and Switzerland.

Fervo reduces that risk by fracking wells in smaller stages. This strategy, which involves pumping fluid into the rock in sections, reduces the risk of large fractures that can trigger significant seismic activity. Fervo also operates dozens of seismic monitors around its sites.

Lengthy review timelines could still slow the company’s progress. Planned expansions to the Cape Station project took about three years to go through the federal permitting process, and developments on federal land can take more than 10 years to get approval. Without streamlining, future projects may be subject to the same waiting game.

Next steps

The first phase of Fervo’s Cape Station in southern Utah is slated to go online in late 2026 and will be capable of generating 100 megawatts of electricity. A second phase will add another 400 megawatts of capacity in 2028.

Fervo says that it has already secured enough land in Utah to support up to 10 gigawatts of geothermal development.","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fervo-Energy_Cape-Station_3.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 08:00:36.197056

The country’s clear and coherent approach, exemplified by the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, outlines a long-term commitment to significantly increasing the share of renewable and clean energy in its power mix to not only meet growing domestic demand but also to lead international climate action efforts.

The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 aims to triple the contribution of renewable energy and invest between AED150 to AED200 billion by 2030. This initiative targets increasing the installed clean energy capacity from 14.2 GW to nearly 19.8 GW by 2030, while also rising the clean energy share in the total energy mix to 30 percent by that date. The strategy is set against a backdrop of a rapidly growing economy and rising energy demand, balanced by a clear focus on environmental responsibility and economic sustainability. Key goals include reducing emissions from water and energy sectors to achieve net zero by 2050, eliminating clean coal from the energy mix, increasing energy consumption efficiency by 42 to 45 percent compared to 2019, and creating 50,000 new green jobs by 2030. Through this, the UAE plans substantial financial savings while fostering significant investments to sustain economic growth.

Expanding capacity and reducing carbon emissions

The leadership of the UAE under the wise guidance of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, is foundational in these accomplishments. With the declaration of 2023 as the Year of Sustainability under the theme ‘Today for Tomorrow,’ the UAE has reinforced its commitment to integrating sustainability principles across all sectors.

Flagship projects demonstrate the country’s commitment to clean energy and technological advancement. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, the world’s largest single-site solar park, is pivotal to the UAE’s renewable energy landscape. Scheduled to reach a capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030 with investments around AED50 billion, this massive solar park supplies clean energy to over half a million homes and significantly reduces carbon emissions. The park’s ongoing expansion in 2025, along with other solar projects nationwide, highlights the UAE’s relentless push to boost solar capacity by an additional 800 MW this year alone.

Addressing renewable power stabilization challenges

Furthering its advanced technology credentials, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is partnering with international firms to deploy cutting-edge energy storage solutions, including large-scale battery systems. These measures address the key challenge of stabilizing renewable power supply and underpin the UAE’s efforts toward secure, reliable clean energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, green hydrogen pilot projects show Dubai’s ambition to diversify its renewable energy portfolio beyond solar and wind, targeting decarbonization across sectors like transportation and manufacturing.

Another cornerstone of the UAE’s clean energy leadership is the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, the first nuclear power station in the Arab world, which exemplifies the country’s diversified approach to clean and sustainable energy. Alongside nuclear and solar, the UAE is advancing technologies in energy efficiency, carbon capture, and sustainable urban development, including the globally recognized Masdar City—a smart city built around principles of sustainability and environmental stewardship.

Integrated blueprint for sustainable growth

The UAE’s strategic clean energy efforts are recognized internationally. Industry leaders such as Helmut von Struve, CEO of Siemens UAE and the Middle East, emphasize the critical role of data-driven technology in managing the renewable energy transition efficiently. Frédéric Godemel, Executive Vice President at Schneider Electric, lauds the UAE’s integrated blueprint that combines smart technology and sustainable growth, while Arshad Mansoor, CEO of the Electric Power Research Institute, points to landmark projects as evidence of the UAE’s potential as a global energy leader.

Investment in clean and renewable energy is a significant pillar of the UAE’s economic diversification. The UAE government aims to mobilize between AED150 billion and AED200 billion in investments by 2030, creating 50,000 green jobs which contribute to the country’s transition to a knowledge-based, sustainable economy. This economic shift also generates considerable financial savings, expected to reach AED100 billion by 2030, underscoring the cost-effectiveness of clean energy adoption alongside environmental benefits.

Comprehensive energy mix strategy

A look at the broader UAE national clean energy framework shows the country’s commitment to ambitious targets, including achieving a 50 percent clean energy contribution to the overall energy mix by 2050, as outlined in the national energy policy updates. This includes a combination of renewable, nuclear, and clean energy sources, reducing the carbon footprint of power generation by 70 percent, and increasing energy consumption efficiency by 40 percent. The UAE’s energy grid emission factor target stands at an impressively low 0.27 kg CO2 per kWh by 2030, highlighting the country’s advanced environmental standards and achievements.

UAE’s leadership extends beyond national borders, investing heavily in international renewable energy projects, particularly in Africa, reinforcing its role in the global clean energy landscape. These outward investments showcase the UAE’s ambition to scale knowledge, technology, and finance in renewable energy globally, further cementing its reputation as a pioneer in climate action.

The World Green Economy Summit 2025, held recently in the UAE, underscored the country’s role as a central platform for dialogue and partnership on clean energy investment and emissions reduction.

More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.
These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development.
The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.
“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers.","LUBBOCK — Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers”

Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there’s better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water”

Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

Town halls are expected to begin in November.

President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill, along with a series of executive actions targeting climate and clean energy programs, are disrupting clean energy manufacturing, supply chains and deployment that had been surging this decade.

Notably, these actions include curtailing tax credits that had driven hundreds of billions of private dollars into clean technologies, making it more difficult to build new energy projects and stopping nearly completed projects in their tracks. These steps actually run directly counter to many of the Trump administration’s own economic and energy goals.

Instead of reducing electricity prices, the bill is projected to increase them by making the quickest-to-build and most affordable new power sources more expensive at a time of rising electricity demand. Instead of restoring America’s manufacturing base and supply chains, the slow deployment will undermine private investment into new clean tech factories planned across the country and their supply chains. And instead of positioning the U.S. to better compete in global industries, the bill effectively cedes key 21st century technologies such as batteries, electric vehicles and energy infrastructure to China.

While these issues have become unfortunate fodder in the culture wars, they were always economic. You can see that in the effort major businesses from across the U.S. economy made throughout 2025, as they pressed Congress to maintain clean energy incentives. And it’s why, amid rising energy prices and economic change, businesses should continue to advocate for clean energy policy that helps to meet energy demand and sustainably grow the economy. In this difficult political environment, climate and clean energy policy must focus on building up U.S. industry and innovation by advancing affordable, reliable, homegrown clean power.

For sustainability professionals, this is an opportunity to better align key corporate functions with policy priorities and help guide your company’s support through the rest of this Congress. Here are some key policy areas where companies should advocate.

Extend and simplify tax credits

Trump’s big bill takes sharp aim at wind and solar power, rapidly phasing out tax credits for these energy sources if they don’t start construction by next summer or aren’t up and running by the end of 2027. At the same time, the administration has imposed unreasonable restrictions on many wind and solar projects and changed qualification rules, making it harder for projects to get started in time to claim what remains of the tax credits.

These actions threaten to dramatically slow down deployment of wind and solar power — the most affordable and quickest-to-build energy sources — at a time when the nation needs all the energy it can get as quickly as possible to affordably meet surging demand.

Businesses should call on Congress to provide greater stability and a longer runway for wind and solar power. We need that affordable power to meet the increasing energy demand for data centers, artificial intelligence and new manufacturing facilities. Restoring the incentives will also support new manufacturing jobs as companies work to reshore supply chains to make these technologies in the U.S.

As the general public and lawmakers from both parties recognize the need for new power sources to prevent skyrocketing utility bills and investments shifting abroad, businesses can play a powerful role in advocating for extended incentives and cutting bureaucratic red tape to accelerate the build-out of solar and wind power.

Make American transportation cutting edge

Congress is due to renew its every-five-year transportation infrastructure funding in 2026 to strengthen the nation’s roads, bridges, railways and more. Not only is this an opportunity to fund critical projects and repairs, but it also presents an opportunity to fully modernize U.S. infrastructure and the transportation systems that companies across the economy depend upon.

Businesses should call for this legislation to support jobs and innovation in industrial materials that are central to our infrastructure such as asphalt, concrete and steel. Incentives for cleaner industrial processes will further support investment and jobs that are already taking root across the country, positioning the U.S. to lead the world in building materials that are in growing global demand.

It is also a timely opportunity for companies that want greater access to electric vehicles to advocate for policies that expand access to them, and for the U.S. auto industry to secure policies that help it compete in a changing global economy. New investment in mining, processing and refining critical minerals would shape domestic supply chains for batteries, while further deployment of charging infrastructure would support wider-spread adoption of the innovative and cost-saving vehicles they are building.

Meet the economic moment with smart permitting

Red tape holds up investment, so meeting the nation’s surging energy demand and supporting domestic manufacturing will require smart policy changes that make it faster and easier to build. Businesses especially need new transmission infrastructure to reliably deliver affordable power, and the U.S. must also find ways to responsibly source our growing need for critical minerals. In each case, it will take reforms that make it more efficient to secure permits and increase certainty for businesses and investors as they take these projects on.

Bipartisan momentum for federal permitting reform has grown in recent years. While negotiations fell short in the last Congress, the need has only increased. Republicans and Democrats have a real opportunity to negotiate responsible reforms that support homegrown clean power and advanced manufacturing to meet the nation’s energy, economic, and national security needs. Businesses are well-suited and well-positioned to help bridge the political divide and make the economic case for action.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trellis_editorial_clean_energy_1470x894.png,N,,2025-10-06 06:59:38.628712

A new report by Penn State researchers offers a brilliant, equitable solution: turning streetlights into charging stations. The idea has the potential to change the way cities extend electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure—faster, cheaper, and more equitably.

Power Where It’s Needed Most

For most people, public charging will be the sole true public choice. For apartment dwellers and condo residents, home charging is not an option. Without a garage or driveway space, overnight charging is nearly a luxury. That’s a tremendous barrier to EV adoption, even as sales continue to grow. By 2040, electric vehicles are projected to represent 11% to 28% of all vehicles on the road. But if charging is not as convenient as parking, that growth could make entire neighborhoods obsolete.

“Most apartment and multi-unit building residents, especially in urban and downtown settings, do not have access to special home EV chargers,” said Xianbiao “XB” Hu, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State. “Luckily, the streetlight pole is already energized and usually municipally owned, so working with them is pretty straightforward.”

Streetlights already line streets where cars park. They’re connected to the electrical grid and publicly owned, meaning that cities can upgrade them without expensive trenching or construction. By placing charging equipment on existing poles, you can construct curbside charging that’s both practical and fair—providing clean transportation to those who’ve been left behind in the EV revolution.

Building a Real-World Test

To make the shift from theory to practice, Penn State partnered with Recharge Kansas City, an alliance of the City of Kansas City, the Metropolitan Energy Center, a nonprofit institution, local utility Evergy, and the U.S. Department of Energy. They built and pilot-tested 23 street lighting charging stations along Kansas City, Missouri. They selected each site using a three-part framework that emphasized demand, technical feasibility, and social equity.

The research, which appeared in the Journal of Urban Planning and Development under the American Society of Civil Engineers, monitored performance for a year, between January and December 2023. Scientists were curious to know how the streetlight chargers compared with the old ones in terms of speed, expense, and environmental advantage.

According to the findings, the new plan bettered expectations even more. The updated streetlights charged faster, cost less to install, and helped lower emissions by minimizing gasoline usage. Because they drew power directly from city power lines, these chargers also saw less competition from multiple users, compared to busy commercial locations.

Smart Data Meets Street Smarts

To find where chargers should be sited, the research team developed a two-tiered siting model that combined artificial intelligence and local knowledge. They first worked with six years of data from 455 installed charging points in Kansas City to train a predictive model that forecasted weekly charging demand. The model considered factors like traffic flow, land use, trip generation, and the number of nearby points of interest—everything from grocery stores to apartment complexes.

Next was the equity layer. The community sought to see chargers not just go where they’d be busiest, but also where they’d be most needed. “We thought about equity, in this case, as proactive engagement with the community to offer just and equitable access to the streetlight charging advantages,” said co-author Yang “Chris” Song, a former Penn State doctoral student who now works as a data scientist for ElectroTempo.

After merging the data with on-the-ground surveys, they chose the 23 most optimal sites—those that were in balance between expected demand and access to underserved neighborhoods. The installations that arrived at the final stage underwent safety inspections, engineering approvals, and regulatory testing to guarantee dependable operation.

Why Streetlights Make Sense

Retrofitting streetlights is very cost-effective. Because the poles are already installed and energized, installation is inexpensive relative to building new stand-alone stations. Municipalities also save time and public money from digging sidewalks or adding new electrical conduits.

Local control is also a plus. Cities can map charger networks based on public goals—lowering emissions, supporting local business, or increasing neighborhood convenience—without lengthy negotiations with individual property owners. That control simplifies scaling and makes it easier to balance equity with efficiency.

And since streetlights are near daily destinations, charging can easily be integrated into the daily routine. As your car charges, you can stop to shop, dine, or catch up with friends nearby. The effect is a system that doesn’t feel like “refueling” at all, but rather like an ordinary aspect of city life.

Proving It Works

Once chargers were in place, the research team measured performance against that of normal charging stations. The researchers used a statistical test called the Mann–Whitney U test to confirm whether any differences in reliability and speed were real. The analysis found no significant performance differences—proving streetlight chargers can match standard stations for efficiency while being less expensive and available to more people.

The pilot, lasting one year, also revealed valuable insights on user behavior. Because the chargers were accessible and visible, on the curb and handily within reach, drivers made consistent and frequent use of them.

The researchers tied that convenience to measurable gasoline savings and lowered greenhouse gas emissions. With the passage of time, those benefits could be an important factor in helping cities achieve climate goals.

A New Model for Urban EV Access

Most prior research on charger placement attempted to maximize utilization or minimize travel distances—good goals, but ones that tend not to prioritize social equity. The Kansas City pilot broke new ground by marrying advanced data modeling with a strong focus on equity.

“We wanted a model that cities could quickly adopt,” Song said. “Scalability was the largest factor in why this matters. It’s not only for Kansas City—it’s for cities in general.”

Other researchers participating in the project included postdoctoral fellows Yuyan “Annie” Pan and Tianjia Yang, and doctoral student Yuxin Ding. Through their collaboration, they created a scalable, reproducible model for cities to expand EV availability without burdensome infrastructure costs.

The success of the initiative proves that cities do not need to start from square one to build a fair and effective EV network. They merely need to look up—to the streetlights that already illuminate the streets.

Practical Implications of the Research

Converting streetlights to electric vehicle charging stations can rewire the approach to public infrastructure in cities. Recycling infrastructure is cost-effective, speeds up deployment, and brings charging to everyone — renters to multifamily dwellers.

This approach also encourages cleaner air and lower emissions, particularly for city communities most affected by car pollution.

Implemented broadly, streetlight charging can make going electric more just and sustainable, turning a humble utility into a climate action and economic justice force.

“In areas that are affected most egregiously by overdevelopment of data centers, you have bipartisan support for regulation,” said Lovejoy.
“It’s when you move away from the blast zone of the impact of the data centers, people become less concerned,” Lovejoy said.
Initially, the measure would have required details on the electricity generation within a locality that would serve any proposed data centers.","RICHMOND, Va.—You might think the state that is the undisputed epicenter of global internet traffic has a leg up on managing the challenges of the artificial intelligence arms race.

So far, it’s not working out that way.

Nationwide, that push by Silicon Valley is gobbling up energy, increasing average customers’ electricity bills and threatening progress on decarbonization. In Virginia, data-center developers warned the utility Dominion Energy at the end of last year that their upcoming projects would need 40 gigawatts of electricity—the energy equivalent of increasing Virginia’s households nearly fourfold.

Dominion plans to respond by building more natural gas power plants, which could raise utility bills for households and businesses both here and beyond the Mid-Atlantic state.

Virginia’s legislators certainly took notice. At least 33 unique bills were introduced in the last session to address various data-center dilemmas, an Inside Climate News analysis found.

“We are practically providing data centers for the entire world and I don’t want that cost to be borne by ratepayers in my district,” said state Del. Shelly Simonds, a Democrat representing the port city of Newport News.

But almost all of the bills ran aground, meeting cumulative resistance from tech businesses, local governments, labor unions and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Of the four that made it into law, only two were more than a symbolic measure.

The data-center growth spurt was already putting pressure on the state’s power supplies before this year. Virginia overtook California, the most populous state, in 2023 to emerge as the top importer of electricity, driven by rapid growth in commercial power consumption.

That means the impact of Virginia’s data-center decisions extends to the wider region. It shares an interconnected grid with much of the Mid-Atlantic, and that grid’s operator is increasingly under pressure from state governors as costs spike.

“Virginia cannot produce the amount of power needed for the data centers, so we’re going to have to pipe in power from neighboring states. And if Maryland is enhancing its grid and building infrastructure, then odds are Marylanders are going to be paying for that when the power is coming here,” said Del. Ian Lovejoy, who sponsored four data-center bills last session, none of which passed.

The skyrocketing power demand is also creating hurdles for the state’s ambitions to completely wean its two largest electric utilities off planet-warming fossil fuels in the next few decades. Many data centers also have on-site diesel generators that are meant for backup power but are being run more frequently, worsening air quality and prompting noise complaints from residents.

As a result, “the rapid growth of data centers [has] surpassed all environmental issues in Virginia practically, so it’s something that demands our attention,” Simonds said.

But the failure last session of nearly all 33 bills on the subject, most without even getting a hearing, underscores the challenge of legislating on data centers in a state home to the greatest number of them.

Legislative roadblocks

The most ambitious of the five data-center bills that the Virginia General Assembly passed was vetoed by Youngkin.

That bill would have required jurisdictions considering a data-center proposal to mandate a noise study if the site is close to homes and schools, and to review with the local utility any electric substation upgrades that would be needed.

The majority of bills, 22, never even made it out of committee. That’s the stage where a bill must get approval from a smaller group of legislators before it advances to the full chamber.

Some of the bills had bipartisan backing. But interviews with a dozen state lawmakers pointed to a range of hurdles—chief among them a muscular lobbying effort by tech companies as well as the fraught politics of treading on the decision-making domain of local officials.

Nineteen of the 33 bills were primarily sponsored by Democrats, while Republicans were the primary sponsors of the other 14. Geography, rather than politics, helps explain who pushed for change.

“In areas that are affected most egregiously by overdevelopment of data centers, you have bipartisan support for regulation,” said Lovejoy. The Republican’s district covers part of Prince William County where a local rezoning fight is unfolding over an upcoming 1,700-acre data center corridor.

“It’s when you move away from the blast zone of the impact of the data centers, people become less concerned,” Lovejoy said.

The legislative proposals covered a variety of issues: improving transparency, reforming tax incentives, protecting ratepayers, increasing state oversight and overhauling data-center siting and zoning.

Two bills that would have required data centers to disclose their often-massive water and power usage died in committee. Another seven bills that sought to change the tax incentives for data centers—some by requiring clean energy use, higher energy-efficiency or wage minimums—also all died in committee.

A handful of bills sought to explicitly protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of infrastructure that will be built to accommodate data-center growth. Under the current system, everyone pays. Two of those measures got merged, and variants passed in the House and the Senate. But the chambers could not resolve the differences.

One ratepayer-protection measure did make it into law, and it’s a meaningful change—but only for the roughly 700,000 customers served by the state’s nonprofit electric co-operatives, a fraction of the total customer base in Virginia. The new law creates a path for the co-ops to create an affiliate to serve large electricity users in order to reduce their impact on average ratepayers.

Of three bills attempting to increase state oversight, one became law—after an amendment wiped out nearly all the extra oversight it would have brought.

The original version would have required electric utilities to create a separate classification for data-center customers. The enacted version requires the state utility regulator to exercise authority it already has: to determine whether existing customer classifications are reasonable when considering rate increase requests from Dominion or Appalachian Power Co., the state’s biggest electric utilities.

Dominion now has a rate case before that regulator, the State Corporation Commission, with the powerful utility and big tech companies squabbling over what fair rates for data centers should be.

“The issue is none of this stuff has enough teeth,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, a Prince William County Democrat who voted for the weakened bill and had sponsored one of her own that stalled. “What ultimately got passed was a significantly watered-down version.”

Del. Irene Shin, a Fairfax County Democrat, proposed the bill about the State Corporation Commission. She thinks the law it became sends “a clear signal to the SCC with what the General Assembly wants them to do.”

Those wants include “safeguards that protect ratepayers like your normal, average Virginia family, and prioritize their protections over what the big corporations need,” Shin said, “because we’re talking about billion-dollar corporations, multi-billion-dollar corporations that can absolutely afford to pay the cost of getting the energy that they need.”

Her region is taking a hit from the Trump administration’s big cutbacks to federal employment, and she’s worried about further economic consequences to residents from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Adding the proposed increase to Dominion customers of about $20 every month for typical households starting next year, she said, is “insane.”

Del. David Reid, a Democrat who represents part of Loudoun County, sponsored two of the four data-center bills that made it to the finish line.

The first offers an incentive for large electricity users to install battery storage.

He also sponsored legislation to build transmission lines with advanced conductor technology to deliver power more efficiently. What ultimately made it into law was diluted from a requirement to a suggestion: to “consider the prudency of using advanced conductors.”

“I was probably trying to accomplish much more in the earlier version, and then you get to the point where it’s like, OK, we can all agree to this this year,” Reid said, pointing to varying perspectives that crop up during the session. “The process works. It’s just that sometimes, in Virginia, it doesn’t work very fast.”

Over a dozen bills, more than for any other data-center issue, would have changed how localities handle siting and zoning for the facilities. None of them made it through.

One was vetoed. Another was voted down by the Senate. Two were turned down in committee, and the rest languished and expired without making it even that far.

The bill vetoed by Youngkin, which would have required a noise study and information about substation needs from data centers, had been more ambitious in an earlier iteration. Initially, the measure would have required details on the electricity generation within a locality that would serve any proposed data centers.

“The bill that we started with, that I wanted, does not look very much like the one that passed,” said Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat representing parts of Prince William County, who sponsored the measure in the House.

In his explanation for vetoing it, Youngkin said the bill “limits local discretion and creates unnecessary red tape” and warned it “could chill investment and hinder economic development.”

“Do we need to make sure that citizen voices are heard? Yes,” the governor said afterward at an event announcing a $9 billion investment from Google. “Do we need to make sure that local leaders are empowered to make decisions about where they go? Yes. Should that be decided in Richmond? Absolutely not.”

Thomas said his constituents are frustrated about seemingly inexplicable siting decisions being made locally, and they wanted state intervention.

“The current Republican administration in Virginia has made it very clear that they are unabashedly and, at times, irrationally pro-data center,” Thomas said. “Why we would continuously build industrial sites that have diesel generators on top by schools is beyond me but yet the industry keeps pushing to have that happen.”

Following the money

The downfall of data-center legislation in Virginia speaks, in more ways than one, to the role of money in politics, advocates and state lawmakers told Inside Climate News. The state is among the minority of states that set no contribution limits on campaign finance.

“Nobody’s immune to taking a lot of money,” said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council, an advocacy group.

Dominion, which opposed two of the data-center bills, is the top political donor in the state. The company contributed more than $13 million to both parties from 2024 through Aug. 31, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Powerful Silicon Valley giants have also poured money into the state in recent years, through the Data Center Coalition—which testified against many of the 33 bills—and associated political action committees.

The Data Center Coalition and Dominion Energy did not respond to requests for comment.

“Anything that makes it more difficult to lubricate the wheels of commerce from data-center development that people are making a lot of money off of is going to be met with the typical sorts of issues in subcommittees where some of these bills go to die,” Kapoor said.

Another source of pressure: localities that reap the financial benefits of this data-center growth.

“We essentially have inadvertently created a monstrous money-making machine for local governments,” said Simonds, the Newport News delegate. “A huge number of cities and localities across Virginia are lining up to have a data center because of the tax revenue.”

Loudoun County, for instance, collected $733 million, almost a third of its total tax revenue, from data centers in the 2023 fiscal year. That kind of revenue allows local governments to avoid taking the unpopular step of raising real estate taxes.

“There’s a lot of folks in rural parts of the state, we’re all for data centers,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, the Republican House minority leader representing parts of several counties in Southwest Virginia, an area that has struggled to recover from the downturn of coal.

The political cost for state lawmakers to be seen as stepping on the authority of localities is especially high during a big election year. Virginia, with a Democratically controlled Senate not up for election until 2027, will vote on a new governor and all 100 House of Delegate members in November.

“The General Assembly doesn’t like to get involved in local siting issues because they don’t want to open that can of worms, so to speak,” said Lovejoy, the Prince William County delegate.

The result is an uncoordinated system in which local decisions about data centers create fallout for the power grid that will affect everyone’s pocketbook if the state doesn’t intervene.

“It’s like an orchestra where you’ve got certain instruments playing loud and unwieldy and then you’ve got other areas where they’re not playing at all,” Simonds said. “We need somebody to be the conductor of this orchestra.”

There’s also an unlikely political alliance at play.

“You have businesses and unions agreeing on something. And that doesn’t happen that often. But it’s happening over data centers,” Lovejoy said.

The support of organized labor is largely coming from the construction trades and electrical workers’ unions. In Virginia, data centers support an estimated 74,000 jobs and generate $5.5 billion in labor income, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.

Most of these jobs, however, don’t last beyond the construction stage. And “there are other unions that might be really concerned with what’s going on,” said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that seeks to hold companies and governments accountable on economic growth.

“For example, public sector unions might be concerned that the states are losing revenue and there’s less money” to hire teachers and firefighters, she said. Virginia forgoes close to $1 billion in yearly revenue over its tax exemptions to attract data centers.

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership contended there’s a 14 percent average annual local and state tax return on the exemption incentive for the years 2022 through 2027. But there’s spirited debate across the country about whether states dangling incentives would get this development either way. And that return on investment figure doesn’t account for the extra power costs.

Economic overdependence on data centers might also prompt companies with job-intensive investments to look elsewhere with more available power supplies, Tarczynska added.

Climate and costs

The huge increase in expected demand for power is throwing a wrench in the state’s progress toward fulfilling its legal mandate of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050. The General Assembly set that target in the Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020.

“You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” said Sen. Russet Perry, a Democrat whose district encompasses parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties. “You can’t continue to not regulate and to sign off on these massive data centers, each one of which often requires more power than your average city, and simultaneously say, ‘OK, we’re going to get to 100 percent clean energy on this deadline.’”

Del. Rip Sullivan, a Fairfax County Democrat, was the primary sponsor of that clean-energy law in the House. He thinks all is not lost.

“I’m not blind to the fact that it makes the road steeper, makes the challenge harder,” he said. But “if we were to put as much energy—pardon the pun—political energy into accelerating the Clean Economy Act as some opponents that you see are putting into trying to kill it, if we put all that energy into trying to improve it and meet those goals, I have every confidence we could meet them.”

One of his bills this year, which made it through the legislature but was vetoed by the governor, would have set targets for how much energy storage capacity utilities must build or buy in the next couple of decades. If enacted, it would have been a market signal for energy storage companies to come to Virginia, he said.

Ratings from the regional grid operator show solar’s effective load carrying capacity, its ability to produce energy when it’s most needed, is as low as 33 percent without storage but as high as 75 percent when paired with it.

Asked for his views on battery storage, Youngkin cited the costs of the technology, supply chains dominated by China and “great alternatives” that are available.

“If people want to invest in battery storage, God bless them. All of the above—we need everything. But to mandate what the answer is based on misinformed facts, I firmly believe is a mistake,” Youngkin said.

Meanwhile, the way that electricity rates are set by utilities and approved by state regulators is putting a disproportionate burden on households and businesses.

“We are effectively seeing customers across the Mid-Atlantic subsidizing the electrical infrastructure that’s needed for Northern Virginia’s data centers,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a global think tank with a mission to accelerate the energy transition.

Multiple state lawmakers spoke of their constituents’ electric bills while explaining their motivations for sponsoring data-center legislation.

“You have certain counties getting rich and then in other places, like my city of Newport News, I have constituents hopping mad about their energy bills going up,” Simonds said.

Thomas, the Prince William County delegate, was also concerned about declining property values. “Residents who were living in an area first, and then a data center was built later, had pretty much lost their largest wealth-building tool, which is their home value that’s plummeted because now there’s an industrial building a hundred feet from their back deck,” he said.

Legislators hoping to raise oversight to shield their constituents aren’t giving up. Sen. Danica Roem, a Prince William County Democrat, said her work for the next session can begin with the 13 Senate members who voted for a water-protection bill introduced by Sen. Richard Stuart, a Republican who represents parts of the Middle Peninsula northeast of Richmond. They just need eight more votes to get the bill out of the Senate.

“I need to bring in four more Democrats. Richard needs to bring four more Republicans,” Roem said.

House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and Senate Democrat majority leadership did not respond to requests for comment.

Ultimately, voters can influence what happens next.

“The pushback has to come from the ground and it has to come from the people,” Piedmont Environmental Council’s Kapoor said. “The more these legislators, whether they’re rural or urban, feel the pushback from their constituents, those [proposed bills] will have increasing resonance.”

From Sullivan’s perspective, it’s not too late for Virginia to chart a nation-leading course that avoids sticking residents with the tab for data centers, from their electric bills to the climate consequences.

“This is an immense challenge, and it is going to take a concerted effort to meet that challenge,” he said, “but the difficulty of the challenge should only embolden us rather than cause us to give up.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_6367-1024x6831759742649.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=FfJat6wE,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:38.981613

On Thursday, October 2, PT SMI visited Ijen Geothermal Power Plant in Bondowoso Regency, East Java. President Director of PT SMI, Reynaldi Hermansjah, observed the operation of Ijen Geothermal Power Plant which delivers benefits to the community in the electricity sector. During this site visit, Reynaldi was also accompanied by the Head of the Corporate Secretary Division of PT SMI, Ramona Harimurti, Team Leader of the Sustainable Financing Division, Teddy Wardiana, as well as the Director & Chief Financial Officer of PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, Anthony R. Mathias, and the Director and Chief Financial Officer of PT Medco Power Indonesia, Myrta Sri Utami.

PT SMI finances the development of Ijen Geothermal Power Plant amounting to USD 144.9 million, or approximately IDR 2.35 trillion, equivalent to 65% of the total project value. In addition, PT SMI also supports strengthening cross-sector collaboration, including partnerships with international institutions such as the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) through a blended finance scheme via SDG Indonesia One (SIO) platform. Besides AFD, other international donor institutions supporting this project are the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and USAID SINAR, which both provide technical assistance.

PT SMI appreciates the mutual collaboration among all parties. ""The Ijen Geothermal Power Plant project is a real example of synergy between development financing and a commitment to environmental preservation. We at PT SMI are always open to collaborate with various parties, including - in this project - with Medco, and also international partners like AFD (Agence Française de Développement). We hope this strategic step will support the achievement of the government's Asta Cita, especially in the New and Renewable Energy sector,"" said Reynaldi.

Ijen Geothermal Power Plant was recently inaugurated by President Prabowo Subianto on June 26, 2025. This geothermal power plant is one of the strategic projects in the development of New and Renewable Energy in Indonesia. With an initial capacity of 35 Megawatts (MW), Ijen Geothermal Power Plant can support the Java-Bali Electricity System, benefiting over 80,000 households. The operation of Ijen Geothermal Power Plant supports the government's target to increase renewable energy mix from 9% to 23% by 2025, in accordance with the National Medium-Term Development Plan. Additionally, it aligns with Indonesia's goal of achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2060 or sooner, and with global commitments to address climate change. The operation of the jen Geothermal Power Plant has potentially contributing to avoid greenhouse gas emissions of 228,636 to 838,332 tCO₂e/year.

PT SMI's commitment for environmental sustainability is also demonstrated through its Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (TJSL) program. On Friday, October 3, PT SMI also visited ""Omah Tukik"" turtle conservation facility at Cemara Beach, Banyuwangi Regency. On that occasion, PT SMI and the local community also released 40 turtle hatchlings into the open sea. Through this program, PT SMI assists in the construction of sea turtle hatcheries, the revitalization of patrol boats, and the provision of maritime safety equipment. The results are evident in the hatching rate, which exceeds 90 percent, with 1,200 hatchlings released annually. This program also creates livelihood including tour guides, operators, and conservation site managers. A total of 500 local residents are also involved in various activities, from facility construction and marine safety training to education and sea turtle release, and community empowerment for vendors at the conservation site.

""Turtles are one of the important elements in maintaining the ecosystem and biodiversity. This is where PT SMI comes in to help with environmental conservation on the coast of Banyuwangi, through our TJSL program. Besides that, we also hope to increase local community welfare through this program,"" said Reynaldi.

Ijen Geothermal Power Plant project and Omah Tukik TJSL program reflect the Company's grand vision for building a sustainable Indonesia, where infrastructure progress, environmental preservation, and community welfare go hand in hand. PT SMI emphasizes that future development must be inclusive, environmentally friendly, and long-term oriented.

Some moves, like a rare state tax hike, are getting lots of attention and likely to face a legal challenge from the marijuana industry. Others are still coming to the surface as the package is analyzed ahead of its expected approval by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. She could sign some or all of it before a one-week interim spending law expires late Wednesday.

Following are some more under-the-radar facets of the budget and transportation deal:

The Republican-led House demanded and secured reforms to the legislative process of awarding earmarks to specific entities. It also scaled back funding for such “pork” grants, which surged amid COVID-19 pandemic-related surpluses.

Many earmarks are not necessarily controversial. They go to things like bridge repairs and police equipment.

But the typically secretive, 11th-hour process has drawn scrutiny because there has been little or no evaluation or vetting of the projects in public before they are announced. Some grants to nonprofits tied to politically connected developers and businesspeople have led to criminal investigations.

New transparency rules for earmarks were adopted by the House, which held hearings on earmark requests. The Democratic-controlled Senate eventually backed similar rules last week. They are expected to be codified into law.

A bill pending on Whitmer’s desk has $148 million for new “legislatively directed spending items” across this fiscal year and last. That is down from $335 million in grants awarded in 2024, $769 million in 2023 and $1 billion in 2022.

It can be difficult to define and tally earmarks. For instance, the budget designates $250 million for Michigan State University to expand a prenatal and infant cash program, but the money will ultimately go to pregnant and new moms.

“We significantly cut the pork, and none of you can dispute that,” Republican House Speaker Matt Hall told reporters. “That was a big priority of mine.”

New permanent funding for roads and bridges is the linchpin — and main headline — of the agreement. It will total $1.5 billion in the first calendar year and gradually rise to nearly $1.9 billion by the end of the decade, more than making up for the impending loss of money generated by a short-term bonding program for state highways.

What is less publicized is that legislators upended how a portion of the new funds (and $600 million in existing funding) will be distributed, designating more to local road agencies and less to the state than under the traditional formula.

The New Neighborhood Roads Fund will get $1.1 billion initially and $1.4 billion annually down the line. Of that:

$100 million will be used to repair closed, restricted and critical local bridges.

$40 million will fund grade-separation grants to help local governments move roads above or below congested railroad crossings.

$35 million will be sent to local transit agencies and other public transportation purposes.

$65 million will go to a new Infrastructure Projects Authority Fund. The Michigan Department of Transportation will issue grants to “infrastructure mobility projects” — things like mass transit, including passenger rail — with priority given to projects that need money for federal matching dollars. The funding could spur movement in Metro Detroit, where business leaders say inadequate public transportation is holding the region back.

Rep. Jason Morgan, D-Ann Arbor, estimated the total for public transit is $160 million because it will also receive some $60 million from removing the sales tax on fuel and replacing it with higher gasoline and diesel taxes.

This is going to be the largest investment in public transit, probably in my lifetime, if not ever,” Morgan said, saying it will go to buses, rail and rural transportation. “This is going to be transformational for Michigan.”

Democrats successfully advocated to greatly grow Rx Kids, which provides pregnant moms $1,500 along with $500 a month during the baby’s first months of life. MSU, which will contract with service providers, will get $250 million over four years.

It was not immediately clear if that is enough to expand the program statewide, though that is what some Senate Democrats had called for in March.

The public-private partnership is funded by governments and foundations. It was launched in Flint and is now also in Kalamazoo, the eastern Upper Peninsula, Clare County and three communities in Oakland County — Pontiac, Royal Oak Township and Hazel Park.

""Rx Kids is a prescription for health, hope and opportunity,"" Dr. Mona Hanna, founding director of the MSU-Hurley Children’s Hospital Pediatric Public Health Initiative, said earlier this year.

Lawmakers freed up the $250 million by stopping a planned $500 million deposit into the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, which Whitmer’s administration has utilized in incentive packages to land electric vehicle battery factories and other business projects.

Hospitals and insurance companies secured wins when legislators moved to, as some called it, ""save Medicaid,"" the government health care program that faces funding uncertainty in part due to new federal limits on provider taxes.

The budget authorizes the state to spend up to $9.3 billion from two Medicaid taxes and federal matching funds if revenues are available.

One of the levies, on health insurers and managed care organizations, is highly unlikely to pass muster under President Donald Trump's tax law and pending federal rules. The question is how much time Michigan has to replace the multi-tiered tax that, if not replaced, could lead to cuts in Medicaid, which covers one in four residents.

A bill sent to Whitmer empowers the state Department of Health and Human Services to work with the federal government to replace the Insurance Provider Assessment without needing legislative approval for the new tax.

Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, R-Coldwater, said it ""is an admirable attempt to solve a very real problem,"" but letting the department ""entirely rewrite a tax structure"" is ""a terrible amount of power to give to the department. What’s even worse is that currently it gives them that power in perpetuity.""

But Dominick Pallone, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans, whose members contract with the state to provide Medicaid coverage, credited lawmakers for affording the executive branch broad taxing authorities to support Medicaid.

""However, with great power comes great responsibility,"" he said. ""We urge executive leaders to exercise patience and due diligence by not administering any immediate changes to the IPA that would come at the expense of commercial health insurance. We also call upon Republicans and Democrats to work in the same bipartisan fashion they have demonstrated in this budget agreement to support our call to federal leaders to allow Michigan a three-year transition period to change our current IPA to avoid increasing premiums on employers and employees.""

Hall said the issue was one of the most important parts of the budget talks for Democrats. Negotiators, he said, balanced that the tax has not yet been deemed to be noncompliant but could be at any time, putting the state in a bind if it is not given time to adjust.

""We basically depoliticized that issue. I'm really glad that we did that. People count on Medicaid. They count on their health care to be there,"" said Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn.

Questioning the Science President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.
In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.
Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.
Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.","The Trump administration’s plan to revoke a key finding that certain greenhouse gases pose a risk to human health removes one of the most potent tools for emissions regulation from the last two decades, according to former EPA air office leadership.

The proposal to nix the 2009 endangerment finding is on a fast-track for finalization, and former leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency say it will claw back US climate progress and create a vacuum of strong GHG regulations.

“The political leadership is essentially performing a lobotomy on itself,” according to Joe Goffman, who led the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden. “The surgery began when they essentially shed all of the climate staff in the last couple of months.”

Three former EPA Administrators—William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman, and Gina McCarthy—wrote to current Administrator Lee Zeldin Sept. 22, expressing opposition to the endangerment proposal and urging him to “follow the law, the science, and EPA’s mission” by withdrawing the revocation plan.

Following through with the plan, in combination with the agency’s decision to end greenhouse gas reporting requirements, jeopardizes emissions enforcement under the Clean Air Act, Whitman said in an interview with Bloomberg Law.

“The whole point behind all of this is to stop regulating, the irony that’s lost on most people, that we are banning Tylenol, but we don’t seem to care about air pollution,” Whitman said, referencing unproven claims from the Trump administration about the alleged dangers of the pain and fever reducer.

Questioning the Science

President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.

The EPA is also looking to cut its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which would end agency insight into how much GHG pollution is coming from large emitters across the country.

In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.

Supporters of Trump’s plan to kill the finding this time around echo some of the justifications used in unsuccessful petitions of the past, namely that the finding puts undue regulatory pressure on industry and is based on faulty or incomplete scientific record.

The proposal itself relies heavily on a Department of Energy report that casts doubt on the extensive scientific record on climate change, claiming that carbon-induced warming “might be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial.”

Creating Uncertainty

Staff who served during the agency’s early climate work in the late 90s and early 2000s fought for the type of change the endangerment finding eventually brought to the EPA’s air rulemaking regime, and see major backsliding on climate mitigation without such a crucial tool.

Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.

But those efforts “were not getting the kind of emissions reductions that science was clearly showing would be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes and smoke stacks,” Symons said.

The revocation proposal is currently just past its public comment period, and working its way to finalization. Once final, legal challenges are all but inevitable, which many clean air experts say hurts industry as much as public health with prolonged regulatory uncertainty.

Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.

On a recent afternoon, about 150 animals were making short work of grazing Jay Peak’s Interstate trail.
Jay Peak has about 350 acres of ski trails that all have to be mowed annually, says Andy Stenger, director of mountain operations.
“And it didn't take a lot of convincing for us to hop on board with it.” Grazing ski trails isn’t a new idea.
Stenger, with Jay Peak, says grazing is slower than mowing, but he’s keeping an open mind.","Every fall, ski areas across Vermont have to brush hog and weed whack their slopes to clear them of shrubs and grass for ski season. Now, some mountains are experimenting with a different kind of mower: goats and sheep.

On a recent afternoon, about 150 animals were making short work of grazing Jay Peak’s Interstate trail.

“The goats are great at the trees and the goldenrod and the other types of brush, but the sheep really do well with the grasses,” says farmer Adam Ricci of Barnet. “So by mixing the two together, we get everything covered pretty well.”

Ricci’s goats and sheep are outfitted with special solar-powered collars that use GPS trackers.

Instead of using traditional electric fencing, he draws a boundary map on his phone that he calls a “virtual paddock.”

This lets him move the animals multiple times a day, so they can cover more ground and don’t over-graze. It’s also less labor intensive than keeping them contained with traditional electric fencing.

Ricci’s herding dog also plays a critical role in helping to move the goats and protecting them from predation on the mountain.

“We also have Helios, the guardian dog,” he says. “He spends his time with the flock.”

If the animals stray too far, they get an audible warning that starts as an unpleasant ringing sound.

After a few warnings, wayward sheep and goats get what Adam says is a light shock, similar to that delivered by an electric fence collar for a dog.

He says this doesn’t happen very often, partly because he spends time training the flock to the collars with the visual aid of traditional fencing before putting them in the virtual paddock.

He says it’s a pretty good deal — the goats and sheep get to munch on grasses, but also knotweed and small trees like willow and maple. And Adam gets a place to graze them and a bit of extra income for his small farm.

Jay Peak has about 350 acres of ski trails that all have to be mowed annually, says Andy Stenger, director of mountain operations.

Doing it is expensive and uses a lot of diesel. The mountain is hoping the goats will be an environmentally friendly way to burn less fossil fuels.

So far, he’s been happy with the results, and there are obvious branding benefits.

“It’s good for the environment,” Stenger says. “And it didn't take a lot of convincing for us to hop on board with it.”

Grazing ski trails isn’t a new idea. It’s been tried before, but rotating animals frequently in steep terrain is labor intensive and traditional netting doesn’t always work well on steep and rocky trails.

These collars aren’t cheap — they cost about $200 apiece. A state grant for roughly $150,000 is helping farmers test them out on loan. They've been used to help goats remove knotweed, graze power lines and more.

Private donations have helped them test the technology at ski areas, and so far they’ve also been tried at Magic Mountain in Londonderry.

Dan Smith is with the Agritech Institute for Small Farms, which is lending Ricci the collars for the season.

“We're trying them out for vegetation management on utility lines in place of mechanized brush hogging and weed whacking,” he says of the state grant.

As for the environmental benefits, grazing does use less fossil fuels than mowing. But when it comes to the climate, that’s where the math starts to get a little more complicated.

Meredith Niles is a researcher at the University of Vermont who studies this.

“It’s not an easy apples to apples comparison,” she says of swapping goats for mowers. “We have to think about all kinds of greenhouse gas emissions if we're talking about climate change.”

Niles says goats and sheep produce methane, a super potent climate warming greenhouse gas. It mostly gets released when they burp or fart.

However, she says, so long as projects like this one don’t add a lot more animals to the landscape, it’s likely they’re reducing emissions.

When it comes to managing vegetation outside of ski areas, Niles says goats and sheep are particularly good options from a climate perspective because they produce about 1/15th the amount of methane that dairy cows do, and they compact the soil less, provided they are rotated frequently.

Niles says in Vermont, grazable land can be hard to come by for farms. “So I think this is a really interesting, innovative solution.”

Back on the slopes, Ricci says there’s no terrain at Jay Peak that’s too steep for his goats to graze, and he’s thinking about buying the collars at the end of the season.

Stenger, with Jay Peak, says grazing is slower than mowing, but he’s keeping an open mind.

“The total acreage that we were hoping to hit through this, we're probably not going to hit it,” he says. “But if we pursue it again in the future, we’ll have learned from this.”

If the pilot proves successful, the virtual paddock technology could allow grazing in all sorts of places that are mowed now, like under power lines and solar arrays — a sweet deal for local farmers in need of pasture and for the climate.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a58c19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+345/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F23%2F15d1c815414583e92afb421f04e4%2Fgoats-graze-ski-trail-jay-peak-vermontpublic-giles-20250926.JPG,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:19.749854

Its Vietnamese apparel manufacturing operations are aiming for 100% renewable energy by 2027, with 35% on-site solar expected by 2026.
The 2024 Impact Report is less a PR exercise than a blueprint for what clean manufacturing at scale can look like.","For years, fashion manufacturing has faced an uncomfortable paradox. The industry thrives on growth, yet its environmental impact grows with it. Many brands talk about decarbonisation but few have shown that expansion and sustainability can truly move in the same direction. Saitex, the Vietnam and US-based apparel and denim manufacturer, appears to be one of the rare exceptions.

The company’s newly released 2024 Impact Report paints a picture that is both ambitious and surprisingly pragmatic. Production volumes surged – apparel output rose by 25% and denim mill production more than doubled – yet carbon emissions per garment fell by 18% and per metre of fabric by 16%. Electricity use declined, renewable energy use climbed, waste was reduced and community programmes expanded their reach.

In short, Saitex grew, but its footprint didn’t.

“Our mission has never been about incremental change, but about systemic transformation,” says founder and CEO Sanjeev Bahl.

It’s not an empty statement. Since its founding in 2001, Saitex has steadily built a reputation as ‘the cleanest denim factory in the world’, transforming from a straightforward manufacturer into a fully fledged ecosystem. It now includes vertically integrated production sites in Vietnam and the US, its own fabric mill, circular innovation through the Stelapop upcycling lab, workforce inclusion initiatives such as Rekut and creative repair collaborations through Atelier & Repairs.

The numbers behind this transformation are telling. Electricity consumption per garment dropped by nearly 7% and steam use fell by more than a quarter. The company planted thousands of trees through its partnership with Gaia Nature Conservation, supporting a broader carbon offset strategy that reached 35% last year.

At its denim mill, 70% of energy now comes from renewable sources, with waste reduced by 8% and 92% of remaining material recycled.

Community outreach programmes also grew last year, reaching more than 13,000 people through clean water projects, education schemes and environmental awareness campaigns. The Rekut initiative continues to bring disabled workers into the core workforce, while a new Gaia x Saitex employee project links workplace action to ecosystem restoration.

The report isn’t all polished success though. Water use and wastewater discharge rose temporarily because of planned filter maintenance, while gas consumption increased due to growing demand for 3D fashion processes. An internal labour audit found cases of undeclared Sunday work, which have since been rectified through back pay, retraining and new compliance systems. Saitex doesn’t gloss over these setbacks, framing them as part of a process of continuous improvement, with fixes already underway.

The company’s roadmap is equally bold. Its Vietnamese apparel manufacturing operations are aiming for 100% renewable energy by 2027, with 35% on-site solar expected by 2026. The denim mill plans to complete a closed-loop wastewater system by the end of 2025 and is working towards net-zero operations by 2030. System-wide, Saitex is pushing further into circular design, expanding the use of NFC-powered trims and setting its sights not just on neutrality but on becoming carbon positive.

In a sector often criticised for lofty sustainability promises that never quite translate into action, Saitex stands out for showing its workings. Its approach isn’t perfect, but it is transparent, data-driven and unapologetically ambitious. The 2024 Impact Report is less a PR exercise than a blueprint for what clean manufacturing at scale can look like.

As fashion brands face increasing regulatory pressure and consumer scrutiny, the industry will need more than aspirational rhetoric. Saitex, as an example, example suggests that with the right infrastructure, clear goals and a willingness to tackle problems head-on, growth and decarbonisation don’t have to be at odds.",https://www.innovationintextiles.com/uploads/16651/Saitex1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 06:59:56.049723

Brendan Hanley, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Northern and Arctic Affairs, made the announcement on behalf of the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources. The funding will support the 7.5MW Innavik Remote Hydro Project in Inukjuak and a feasibility initiative to develop a 17MW hydroelectric plant at the Matawin dam near Saint-Michel-des-Saints.

The Innavik Remote Hydro Project, a run-of-river facility, replaces nearly all diesel generation in the Nunavik community of Inukjuak. Jointly owned by the Pituvik Landholding Corporation and Innergex Renewable Energy, the project is the largest off-grid hydropower installation in Canada and supplies clean electricity to approximately 1800 residents.

The Matawak Hydroelectric Power Plant project, led by Énergie Matawak S.E.C., represents a partnership between the Atikamekw Nation of Manawan and the Innu Nation of Lac-Saint-Jean. Planned at the existing Hydro-Québec Matawin dam on the Lac Taureau reservoir, the 17MW plant would help meet local energy needs and generate long-term revenue for the participating Nations. Construction is expected to begin in 2026.

Federal support comes through two programs: $14.9 million from the Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities (CERRC) program for Innavik, and over $1.7 million from the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program (SREPs) for Matawak.

Minister Hodgson said: “The Government of Canada is committed to reconciliation and supporting clean energy projects in Indigenous, rural and remote communities. In collaboration with governments, Indigenous partners and the energy sector, we are investing in initiatives to create economic growth in communities while tackling climate change.”

Hanley added: “I am proud to see the largest off-grid hydropower project in Canada come to life and the exploration of more community-led initiatives in Canada’s Northern regions. These projects are a powerful example of what’s possible when Indigenous leadership and community vision come together, not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on diesel but also to strengthen energy independence and create lasting social and economic benefits for communities. We are proud to support initiatives like this that build a cleaner, more inclusive energy future for all Canadians.”

Tommy Palliser, President of the Pituvik Landholding Corporation, said: “The Innavik Hydro Project is an affirmation of a sustainable future for the Inuit community of Inukjuak. The project realizes a 20-year vision for Inuit-led and co-owned clean energy infrastructure that generates impacts for the Inuit beneficiaries of our community, through proactive and positive partnership with Innergex Renewable Energy, supported by the Governments of Canada and Quebec.”

Michel Letellier, President and CEO of Innergex Renewable Energy, commented: “When Pituvik Landholding Corporation invited us to join them on this journey, we partnered closely with the people of Inukjuak to shape a project that reflects their vision and meets their needs. This project is a source of pride for all of us at Innergex because it directly improves daily life in Inukjuak while supporting the community’s long-term energy independence. We are grateful for the collaboration and confidence of our Inuit partners, and we thank everyone who worked to make the community’s vision a reality.”

“First Nations must be involved in the development of the resources on their territory,” emphasised Keith-Michel Flamand, President of Énergie Matawak S.E.C. “We all live together on this land and work in partnership, guided by harmony and mutual respect. The goal of Énergie Matawak is not only to produce energy but also to do so responsibly while protecting our environment. Our project is one that carries hope for the future.”

Lorena Patterson, President and CEO of WaterPower Canada, said, “This investment in Indigenous-led hydropower projects exemplifies the economic reconciliation our sector is committed to advancing. Through meaningful equity partnerships, our sector is fostering job creation, local economic growth and shared prosperity in Indigenous communities. Collaboration with Indigenous Peoples is integral to building the sustainable, reliable and clean energy infrastructure Canada needs to achieve its climate goals while ensuring Indigenous communities have a true stake in our energy future.”

Since its launch in 2018, the CERRC program has supported 229 projects across Canada to replace diesel generation in remote and Indigenous communities. It has a total budget of $453 million. The $4.5-billion SREPs program supports grid modernization, storage, and non-emitting generation initiatives nationwide.

Dry Bulk | Trade & Commodities

We have reached a FID (Final Investment Decision) with the UK Government to build the world’s first carbon capture facility to enable fully decarbonised cement production.

The announcement, made recently by Michael Shanks, Energy Minister in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, allows Heidelberg Materials to begin construction of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at their Padeswood cement works in north Wales.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: “Our clean-energy mission means good jobs, regional growth, and investment for local communities.

“This trailblazing cement works showcases the north Wales workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation through this UK-first project.”

The funding decision aligns with the UK Government’s ambitions to reduce CO₂ emissions and deliver economic growth through construction.

The Padeswood project is the first of its kind in the UK and is Group’s first full-scale carbon capture facility to reach FID. Construction will start later this year and the facility will enable the production of evoZero carbon captured net zero cement for the construction industry in 2029.

The CCS project will bring significant economic benefits to north Wales through investment and job creation: it will protect over 200 jobs and create around 50 new ones, as well as up to 500 more during construction.

Cement is an essential construction material. It is the ‘glue’ in concrete, the most widely used building material in the world, but its production gives rise to CO₂. As these emissions result from the chemical process involved in cement’s manufacture, they cannot be avoided by using low carbon or renewable energy sources. The only way to remove them and produce the net zero cement the UK needs is to capture them using CCS before they enter the atmosphere.

The carbon capture facility at Padeswood is designed to capture almost all (around 95 per cent) of the CO₂ emissions from the process. The emissions captured from the kiln include biogenic CO₂ from biomass fuels, mainly from domestic food, wood and paper wastes that cannot be recycled, which could allow the cement produced at Padeswood to be net negative.*

The carbon captured at Padeswood will be compressed and transported via an underground pipeline for secure storage under the seabed in Liverpool Bay as part of the HyNet North West project.

CEO Simon Willis said: “Our constructive partnership with the UK Government has allowed us to reach this major milestone, which is fantastic news, not just for us, but for the industry as a whole.

“Our new facility at Padeswood will be a world-leader. It will capture around 800,000 tonnes of CO₂ a year from our existing cement works, allowing us to produce evoZero carbon captured net zero cement, which will help the UK construction industry reach its decarbonisation aims.

“CCS is a growing sector worldwide and our Padeswood project is an exemplar, helping position the UK as a global force at the forefront of this technology. It will also pave the way to decarbonising our domestic cement industry, helping it remain competitive while mitigating against climate change.”

*Biomass is carbon neutral as trees and crops remove CO₂ from the atmosphere as they grow by storing it within their cells. Any CO₂ released from these materials in the kiln would also be captured by the carbon capture facility. As a result, the capture of biogenic CO₂ could allow the cement produced at Padeswood to be net negative.",https://www.drycargomag.com/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-10-06 07:00:00.206752

It added that 79,989 b/d of GOM oil production, or about 5.7%, had been suspended.","Prices shot higher by double-digit amounts nearly across the board Thursday as a palpable threat to Gulf of Mexico (GOM) production grew more intense, cash numbers had substantial support from the previous day's 14.5-cent futures rise, and some regions such as the Midwest were heating up, although their contribution to cooling load was likely to be brief.

Only a Dracut drop of nearly a dime was left out of overall gains ranging from a little more than C5 cents to nearly a quarter. A low-end quote of $2.40 for volatile Tennessee Zone 4 was by far the cheapest market price. Gains were fairly evenly distributed among geographic regions.

Despite a nominally bullish report of a 55 Bcf addition to storage in the week ending Aug. 26, when consensus expectations had been mostly in the low 60s Bcf, Nymex traders saw fit to discount both the Energy Information Administration data and the likely tropical storm entering the offshore production area in sending the October futures contract 0.4 cent cent lower (see related story).

A broad area of low pressure a couple of hundred miles south of the Louisiana coast at midday Thursday had an 80% chance of becoming Tropical Storm Lee within the succeeding 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.

Tropical Storm Katia briefly achieved hurricane status before being downgraded to a tropical storm again, but it was expected to restrengthen while continuing to churn toward the west-northwest in open Atlantic waters about 930 miles west of the northern Leeward Islands. An expected turn to the north was likely to keep it well out to sea. Similarly, a low-pressure system about 350 miles north of Bermuda had a 50% chance of tropical storm development, NHC said, but its northeastward movement would take it away from the East Coast.

In a report on GOM evacuations due to the Invest 93L area of tropical disturbance, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEM) said 127 MMcf/d of shut-ins, or 2.4% of normal Gulf output, had been reported to it by 11:30 a.m. CDT Thursday. Personnel had been evacuated from nine production platforms, but none of the mobile drilling rigs, BOEM said (see related story). It added that 79,989 b/d of GOM oil production, or about 5.7%, had been suspended.

The shut-in volume obviously was growing as following the BOEM report Transco said about 200 MMcf/d scheduled to flow into its system was offline. However, based on the projected storm track and intensity, Transco did not anticipate any supply allocations as a result of storm-related supply interruptions.

WeatherBell Analytics chief meteorologist Joe Bastardi said what he expects to become Tropical Storm Lee may be the slowest-moving storm in the northern GOM since Hurricane Juan in 1985, a storm that took five days to move across the Gulf's open waters. ""Parts of the Gulf of Mexico's offshore oil and gas producing areas could experience gales for four or five days as Lee will be very slow to move before finally making up its mind to move out of the area,"" Bastardi said. ""The endgame is still unclear, but what is obvious is the northwest Gulf is in for a siege from a tropical cyclone that will impact the energy industry for at least several days, even though Lee may not be as intense as some of the other storms this year.""

Although highs ahead of a front would reach the 90s to the mid 100s Friday from Minnesota through the Great Lakes and southwest to Kansas, The Weather Channel said, a fall chill will replace them quickly during the weekend. The Northeast's price gains ignored generally mild temperature forecasts, while much of the Gulf Coast area will soon be cooling down as well from the rains anticipated from the low-pressure area heading toward Louisiana. The area from Louisiana, Arkansas and western Tennessee through the desert Southwest can expect hot peaks from the upper 90s through the low 110s to continue a bit longer, but the Rockies is due for a dramatic cooldown, with Denver forecast to go from a high around 97 Thursday to the mid 80s Friday, according to Weather Underground.

Is it fall already? Northern Natural Gas illustrated how short-lived the current warm-up in the Midwest will be, saying a system-weighted average temperature of 82 Thursday was projected to plummet to 69, 66 and 61 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively.

Pipeline constraints were minimal heading into the weekend.

Northwest was probably typical among pipelines in asking shippers to avoid ""excessive banking"" on its system during the Labor Day weekend, citing a declining amount of available capacity in its balancing accounts at the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin storage facilities.

For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology. There's also typically no maintenance or end-of-lease panel removal concerns with the contracts, according to Palmetto, another North Carolina company that offers leases.

""We believe solar energy should be accessible and affordable to all and are committed to bringing clean energy opportunities to homeowners through our offering of the first solar plus storage lease in North Carolina. We appreciate that Spruce Power customized a servicing solution to meet our needs,"" EnerWealth CEO Ajulo Othow said in the statement.

Batteries provide stored electricity for later use, and even to charge electric vehicles. Customers can even sell it back to the grid, depending on plans and programs available in the area, and the lease agreement.

Leasing is also a great way to limit the electricity needed from dirty fuels that cause planet-warming air pollution. NASA has linked the gases to greater risks for extreme heat that could soon leave some places uninhabitable.

It's all good news for energy-savvy Tar Heel homeowners, as well as for the industry as a whole. Federal solar tax incentives expire at the end of the year, but Investing.com reported that Spruce was enjoying solid stock market performance earlier this month when the partnership with EnerWealth was announced.

It's also important for customers to understand the benefits of both leasing and buying. EnergySage said that an array can cost around $30,000 on average, before credits. EnergySage is a free online resource that can help customers compare quotes, find the right installer, and secure all the rebates before they are gone. Fast action can save up to $10,000 when buying a system.

Palmetto — in the business for more than 16 years — has a great guide that lists pros and cons for leasing and buying. It offers leases through LightReach and has more than 500,000 accounts. It's important to know your options to make the best decision. If you plan on selling your home soon, leasing likely isn't the best option, for example.

In North Carolina, Spruce ""will deliver the operational infrastructure that enables EnerWealth to scale rapidly while maintaining exceptional homeowner experiences,"" according to the release.

Billing, collections, support, and remote monitoring are all part of Spruce's expertise, proved by having managed 145,000 ""residential solar assets"" around the country, the statement continued.

The center recently conducted a pilot Bexar County Omnibus Survey, giving researchers and organizations insights from thousands of local residents who are on the center’s county panel.

One of the standout findings was the strong support for nuclear energy, with 65% of residents in favor, notably higher than the national average of 59-61%. The survey showed 17% expressed opposition, with safety being the most common concern.

These results mirror national policy trends and reflect a growing momentum behind nuclear energy expansion.

“We found remarkable alignment between the Trump administration’s nuclear renaissance strategy and public sentiment both nationally and locally,” said Chris Reddick, professor of public administration in the College for Health, Community and Policy at UT San Antonio. “This convergence of favorable public opinion, technological readiness and political will creates what may be unprecedented conditions for American nuclear expansion since the 1970s.”

Fostering research and collaboration

Among the groups submitting questions for the survey was the university’s CONsortium on Nuclear sECurity Technologies (CONNECT), a program that seeks to establish career pathways between the U.S. Department of Energy and students at minority-serving institutions majoring in STEM fields such as physics, engineering and computer science.

The mission of CONNECT is to foster interdisciplinary research, collaboration and professional networks within the field of nuclear security.

In 2022, renewed funding from the National Nuclear Security Administration expanded CONNECT to foster new collaborations between UT San Antonio faculty in science and engineering and those in global affairs and public administration.

“In addition to the cross-disciplinary mentoring and training, we’ve become really excited about the advancement of nuclear energy from not just the technical aspects but also the policy advancements and public engagement side,” said Elizabeth Sooby, project director of CONNECT and associate dean for research in the College of Sciences.

Sooby saw the Bexar County Omnibus Survey as an opportunity to gain new insight into the local community’s perspective on nuclear energy expansion and worked with CPOR to include four questions related to nuclear energy on the survey.

Regional attitudes and needs

One of the goals with the Bexar County Panel and our Omnibus Survey is to facilitate research at UT San Antonio and generate insights into the attitudes and needs of the San Antonio metropolitan region, said Bryan Gervais, director of CPOR and associate professor of political science and geography.

“We were very happy to work with Dr. Sooby and her team on this project — and I think their work highlights the range of projects that can benefit from our panel,” Gervais said. “By providing high-quality samples, we hope to keep more resources here at [the university] rather than going to external, commercial companies who charge a lot more.”

The nuclear energy questions included in the survey asked respondents what level they believe nuclear energy should contribute to the U.S. electricity supply, about their personal view of nuclear energy, concerns about nuclear energy, and what their level of understanding is toward nuclear energy.

“These questions were designed to capture both the level of public support for nuclear energy and the concerns influencing people’s views,” said Jesus Facundo, a doctoral student in physics who wrote the survey questions. “Nuclear energy is playing a growing role in national conversations about climate change and energy security, and it’s important to understand how our community sees the issue so we can connect those broader discussions to local priorities.”

Sooby said that the community’s response aligns with, and will continue to shape, the research happening at UT San Antonio, reinforcing how the university’s discovery enterprise is serving the interests and concerns of the region.

“These questions are just the tip of the iceberg and it’s exciting to see that our local community is interested in nuclear energy while cautiously concerned about all the things we are tackling in our research efforts here [with regard to] the safety and security of these empowering technologies,” Sooby said.",https://news.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nuclear-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 05:00:01.281926

That news came just a week after its rival, Trina Solar, opened a smaller factory in Central Java province.

During the first six months of this year, Indonesians bought nearly as many electric vehicles as they did in all of 2024 — almost all from Chinese brands.

As competition among clean energy firms intensifies in China, its biggest EV and renewables companies are making inroads into Indonesia, positioning themselves for the day Southeast Asia weans itself off fossil fuels.

One example: Trina’s 1.5 trillion rupiah ($90 million) solar panel factory at Kendal Industrial Park in Central Java. PT Trina Mas Agra Indonesia (TMAI), the company’s joint venture with a local partner, employs 640 workers producing 1 gigawatt (GW) of next-generation solar panels that last longer and perform better in cloudy conditions.

TMAI chief financial officer Martha Octavia told Mongabay the factory could triple production if needed.

“The important point is that we are fully prepared, both in terms of technology and infrastructure, to scale when the timing is right,” Octavia said in emailed remarks.

For now, the company is positioning itself to supply panels for some of the nearly 15 GW of utility-scale solar projects in Indonesia’s pipeline, according to data published in February by Global Energy Monitor.

At present, Indonesia has just over 560 megawatts (MW) of solar power feeding the grid — roughly the same as Honduras, and far behind smaller neighbors like Malaysia, which has 2 GW.

Indonesia’s slow uptake of clean energy risks slowing the pace of Chinese investment that otherwise would be coming as producers there seek new markets.

Indonesia remains a largely untapped renewables market, while Chinese solar panel makers face brutal competition at home and mounting losses after Beijing ended solar incentives amid a domestic supply glut.

That presents a rare opportunity for Indonesia to woo investment from China, said Edwin Widjonarko, co-founder of Xurya Daya, which installs and maintains rooftop solar panels for clients such as Tokopedia, the Indonesian e-commerce giant.

“There’s been a bit of a shock for them,” Widjonarko said of conditions at home for Chinese panel makers.

“Indonesia is not yet developed in terms of solar usage. You can produce panels here for the domestic market and you wouldn’t have to export. This is a really big market.”

The problem is that tight quotas, set by Indonesia’s state-owned utility PLN, limit rooftop solar installations for PLN customers, dampening enthusiasm among foreign investors.

PLN’s latest 10-year electricity supply road map caps rooftop solar capacity at 3 GW. Annual quotas range from 162 MW next year to 410 MW in 2028.

By comparison, China installed 198 GW of solar capacity — hundreds of millions of panels — during the first five months of this year alone.

In June, LONGi announced it would build a 1.4 GW solar panel factory in West Java in partnership with Pertamina’s renewables arm, Pertamina New and Renewable Energy.

“Indonesia holds immense potential in renewable energy, and LONGi is proud to contribute our world-leading solar technology to this transformative journey,” Dennis She, the company’s global vice president, said in a statement at the time.

TMAI said its Central Java factory simplifies supply chains, supports domestic suppliers, and reduces demand for energy imports.

Falling battery storage costs and greater grid investments should improve prospects for intermittent renewables such as wind and solar.

TMAI said it’s taking the long view of the Indonesian market.

“Over time, technologies like energy storage, smarter grids and better management will help balance variable supply and keep systems stable,” Octavia said.

According to PLN’s 10-year blueprint, published in May, Indonesia will add about 53 GW of renewable generating capacity and storage over the next decade, though nearly three-quarters of it is slated for the second half of the 2025-2035 period, after a surge in gas-fired capacity scheduled for the first half.

“Global outlooks show that integrating renewables is both feasible and increasingly cost-effective, especially as storage becomes cheaper.”

Electricity generated by solar or wind costs roughly three-quarters that of coal, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a U.S. nonprofit, reported last year.

Beijing is scaling back incentives after hitting its clean-energy goals six years early. With more than half of China’s installed generating capacity now coming from renewables, clean-energy projects that go online from June no longer benefit from guaranteed minimum tariffs.

That has many Chinese companies scrambling for new markets.

Since 2022, Chinese renewable energy firms, EV battery makers and automakers have announced about $70 billion in investments in Indonesia, spanning mining, processing and manufacturing.

One of those, a $6 billion power battery venture launched in 2022 by Indonesian Battery Corporation and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL), is scheduled to begin operations at the end of next year.

In June, Indonesia’s deputy energy and mineral resources minister, Yuliot Tanjung, said CATL would also begin making EVs in Indonesia by next March.

Consultancy PwC estimates EVs will account for 29% of new car sales in Indonesia by 2030, up from 15% in 2024.

Growth in the EV sector is a bright spot in Indonesia’s otherwise shrinking vehicle market, buoyed by rebates on value-added tax and luxury goods tax. The government earmarked 5 trillion rupiah ($301 million) for rebates in 2025, but has said it will end subsidies for imported EVs at the close of this year.

Failing to deal with red tape and ending incentives too soon risks failing to capitalize fully on the sudden shift in Chinese clean energy investment, Xurya’s Widjonarko said.

“This is a rare opportunity — probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance for us to build a reliable domestic supply chain with Chinese technologies,” Widjonarko said.

“The timing is quite sweet.”

Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
“The US has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.” No large coal power plants have come online in the US since 2013.","US officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

RUSHING TO APPROVE PROJECTS

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive US coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a September 23 speech to the UN General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of US supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling USD 8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernise coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centres.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

COAL DEMAND PLUMMETS

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over USD 126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of USD 35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

AGEING PLANTS AND OPTIMISM

The largest US coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the US could increase by 250 million tons annually — up almost 50 per cent from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants could burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""US coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The US has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the US since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost USD 25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at the remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.

By equipping aspiring entrepreneurs with the necessary skills and knowledge, the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program aims to foster a new generation of leaders in the clean energy sector.

Background and Rationale for the Proposal

The urgency of transitioning to clean energy sources has never been more apparent. Climate change poses significant risks to our planet, affecting ecosystems, weather patterns, and human health. As governments and organizations worldwide commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, there is an increasing demand for innovative solutions that can facilitate this transition.

However, many aspiring entrepreneurs lack the resources and support needed to bring their ideas to fruition. This gap presents an opportunity for targeted intervention through a dedicated program focused on clean energy entrepreneurship. Moreover, many communities, particularly those in low-income areas, are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and climate change.

These communities often face barriers to accessing clean energy technologies and resources. By empowering individuals from these backgrounds to become clean energy entrepreneurs, we can create pathways for economic development while simultaneously addressing environmental injustices. This proposal seeks to bridge the gap between aspiration and action by providing the necessary support for aspiring entrepreneurs to thrive in the clean energy sector.

Objectives and Goals of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program

The primary objective of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program is to empower aspiring entrepreneurs with the skills, knowledge, and resources needed to develop successful clean energy businesses. To achieve this objective, the program will focus on several key goals. First, it aims to provide comprehensive training on various aspects of entrepreneurship, including business development, marketing strategies, and financial management.

This training will equip participants with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of starting and running a business. Another goal of the program is to foster collaboration among participants by creating a supportive community of like-minded individuals. Networking opportunities will be integral to this effort, allowing participants to share ideas, experiences, and resources.

Additionally, the program will facilitate connections with industry experts who can offer mentorship and guidance throughout the entrepreneurial journey. By building a strong network of support, participants will be better positioned to succeed in their ventures.

Target Audience and Beneficiaries

The target audience for the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program includes aspiring entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds who are interested in developing clean energy solutions. This includes individuals who may have innovative ideas but lack the resources or knowledge to bring them to market. The program will specifically prioritize participants from underserved communities who are often marginalized in traditional entrepreneurial ecosystems.

Beneficiaries of the program will extend beyond the participants themselves. As these aspiring entrepreneurs develop their businesses, they will create job opportunities within their communities, contributing to local economic growth. Additionally, by promoting clean energy solutions, these businesses will help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate environmental impacts.

Ultimately, the program aims to create a ripple effect that benefits both individuals and communities while advancing the transition to a sustainable energy future.

Methodology and Implementation Plan

The implementation of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program will follow a structured methodology designed to maximize participant engagement and learning outcomes. The program will begin with an application process to select participants based on their passion for clean energy and their potential for entrepreneurial success. Once selected, participants will undergo an intensive training curriculum that covers essential topics such as business planning, market research, funding sources, and regulatory considerations.

In addition to formal training sessions, the program will incorporate hands-on workshops where participants can apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. These workshops will include activities such as developing business models, conducting feasibility studies, and creating marketing strategies for their clean energy solutions. Furthermore, participants will have access to mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and industry professionals who can provide personalized guidance tailored to their specific needs.

Budget and Financial Plan

A comprehensive budget is essential for ensuring the successful implementation of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program. The financial plan will outline projected costs associated with training materials, workshop facilitation, venue rentals, marketing efforts, and participant support services. Funding sources may include grants from government agencies, private foundations, corporate sponsorships, and individual donations.

To ensure transparency and accountability, the budget will be regularly reviewed and adjusted as needed throughout the program’s duration. Additionally, participants may be encouraged to contribute a nominal fee to cover some costs while still ensuring accessibility for those from low-income backgrounds. This approach not only fosters a sense of ownership among participants but also helps sustain the program’s financial viability in the long term.

Evaluation and Impact Assessment

To measure the effectiveness of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program, a robust evaluation framework will be established. This framework will include both qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess participant progress and overall program impact. Key performance indicators may include participant satisfaction rates, business launch success rates, job creation statistics, and environmental impact assessments related to clean energy solutions developed by participants.

Regular feedback sessions will be conducted throughout the program to gather insights from participants regarding their experiences and challenges faced during their entrepreneurial journey. This feedback will inform ongoing improvements to the program structure and content. At the conclusion of the program, a comprehensive impact assessment report will be generated to highlight successes, lessons learned, and recommendations for future iterations of the program.

Sustainability and Long-Term Impact

Sustainability is a core principle of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program. To ensure its long-term viability, strategies will be implemented to secure ongoing funding and support beyond initial grant funding. This may include establishing partnerships with local businesses that can provide resources or mentorship opportunities for participants.

Additionally, creating a network of alumni from the program can foster continued engagement and collaboration among past participants. Alumni can serve as mentors for new cohorts while also sharing their success stories to inspire future entrepreneurs. By cultivating a strong community around clean energy entrepreneurship, we can create lasting change that extends well beyond the duration of the program itself.

Partnerships and Collaborations

Building strategic partnerships is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program. Collaborations with local universities can provide access to research resources and expertise in clean energy technologies. Additionally, partnerships with established clean energy companies can offer valuable insights into industry trends and best practices.

Engaging with local government agencies can also facilitate access to funding opportunities and regulatory guidance for aspiring entrepreneurs. By leveraging these partnerships, the program can create a comprehensive support system that empowers participants while also contributing to broader community goals related to sustainability and economic development.

Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program represents a significant opportunity to empower aspiring entrepreneurs while addressing critical environmental challenges. By providing training, mentorship, and resources tailored specifically for clean energy solutions, we can foster innovation that leads to sustainable economic growth. Next steps involve finalizing the grant proposal for submission while actively seeking potential partners who share our vision for promoting clean energy entrepreneurship.

Engaging with community stakeholders will also be crucial in refining our approach and ensuring that we meet the needs of our target audience effectively. Together, we can pave the way for a brighter future powered by clean energy innovation.

In the pursuit of advancing clean energy entrepreneurship for a net-zero world, it is essential to explore various funding opportunities and initiatives that align with this goal. One such initiative is the International Climate Initiative, which supports projects focused on climate change mitigation and biodiversity. This program offers a platform for innovative solutions that can contribute to a sustainable future.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

[Running Out: Texas’ water crisis — and the path forward]

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

[Data centers are thirsty for Texas’ water, but state planners don’t know how much they will need]

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers”

Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there’s better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water”

Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

Town halls are expected to begin in November.

We also want to stay ahead of regulations,” said Bryan Celik, a contract engineer for the Port of Cleveland.
The goal covers the port’s direct Scope 1 emissions, as well as its Scope 2 emissions for energy use.
For Brito, this sort of collaboration is key to the success of port electrification.
“Realizing that potential will require buy-in from — and coordination with — the regional networks of industry, nonprofit, and government actors affected by ports’ electrification,” he said.","One of the largest ports in the Midwest is officially starting to decarbonize, thanks to a Biden-era grant program that has so far survived the Trump administration’s assault on all things clean energy.

Late last month, the Port of Cleveland began renovating its main warehouse on the shore of Lake Erie. When the work is complete, Warehouse A will have roughly 2 megawatts’ worth of rooftop solar panels, plus battery storage and numerous charging ports for cargo-handling equipment.

Cleveland, which received a $94 million award from the Clean Ports Program announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last fall, is one of three Great Lakes port groups benefitting from the funding. Although the agency has reneged on many other funding commitments under President Donald Trump, work and payments for the $2.9 billion ports program are still moving ahead.

The country’s more than 300 ports, which ship and receive the materials, food, and other products that Americans rely on, are mostly powered by fossil fuels. Their cranes, forklifts, and other freight-handling equipment burn diesel fuel, and so do the ships and boats docked at those ports, sending not only planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere but toxic pollution that can harm the people who work and live nearby.

To address both problems, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority has set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. ​“We want to have a lower impact on surrounding communities. We also want to stay ahead of regulations,” said Bryan Celik, a contract engineer for the Port of Cleveland. The goal covers the port’s direct Scope 1 emissions, as well as its Scope 2 emissions for energy use.

Global shipping companies face increasing pressure to decarbonize boats and ships, and technology for wind-powered and battery-powered vessels has improved in recent years.

The U.S. has previously taken steps toward decarbonizing shipping, including by partnering with Norway on the Green Shipping Challenge, but the Trump administration has scuttled progress this year. Trump also opposes a proposed global fee on greenhouse gas emissions that the International Maritime Organization will consider formally adopting this month.

The nearly $3 billion in Clean Ports Program funding nationwide ​“has transformative potential for U.S. ports,” said Jerold Brito, a program associate with the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that helped coordinate a Sept. 25 event on regional port electrification hosted by the Port of Cleveland.

Indeed, Cleveland is not alone in its efforts to clean up its port. The Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority, for example, has an even more ambitious goal of reaching net-zero for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, said its sustainability manager, Taylor Mitchell.

Because so much is shipped through ports, Mitchell says, electrifying these hubs of commerce is a ​“cool opportunity to have a really huge impact on the planet.”

Getting everyone on board

During the late September event organized by the Electrification Coalition, representatives from Cleveland, Detroit, and Hamilton, Ontario, met with contractors and others in industry and nonprofit organizations to share plans and address challenges.

For Brito, this sort of collaboration is key to the success of port electrification.

“Realizing that potential will require buy-in from — and coordination with — the regional networks of industry, nonprofit, and government actors affected by ports’ electrification,” he said.

For example, work at Cleveland’s Warehouse A necessitates collaborating with Cleveland Public Power, the city’s municipal utility. While solar panels and battery storage at the warehouse will eventually provide much of the port’s electricity needs, it still requires more grid power in order to fully electrify.

Other phases of the work will add cabling and connections for vessels to operate with electric power while they’re in port. That ​“shore power,” or cold ironing, could let boats and ships shut off their diesel engines until it’s time to get underway again.

Additionally, Logistec USA, the port operator, will acquire an electric crane and electric forklifts. And the Great Lakes Towing Co. will build two electric tugboats.

Coordination with other stakeholders also presents challenges for the Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority. ​“We really don’t have much of a footprint ourselves,” except for a cruise dock, noted Mark Schrupp, executive director for the port authority.

Instead, most cargo carried by boats and ships moves through private docks in industrial port areas around the city. ​“We’ve definitely got to think of ways to get the private sector on board.”

But companies may not want to take some steps on an individual basis, such as constructing and installing power lines and charging equipment at privately owned docks that would only be used part-time.

So the Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority is exploring alternatives, such as how hydrogen could produce clean electricity aboard a boat that could then act as a mobile plug-in port for docked vessels’ shore power.

Developing shore power calls for even more groups working together on a broader scale. ​“We really need a standard as much for a port as for a ship, because if there is a mismatch, you would have invested all of that for nothing,” said Hugo Daniel, a doctoral candidate at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec who researches engineering challenges in shore power. Ideally, Canada and the United States will join forces on a strategy for the Great Lakes that aligns with practices from California, the European Union, and China, he said.

Without standards set at the regional and national level, states and cities that try to compel changes on their own could see shippers simply move to other ports with more lax rules, Schrupp said. While some firms looking to slash their supply-chain emissions might prefer to work with a port that is decarbonizing operations, others might avoid areas that could restrict their diesel use.

Great Lakes ports are big economic drivers. More than 23,000 jobs and about $7 billion in annual economic activity are tied to Cleveland’s port alone, Celik said. Yet it and other inland ports handle a smaller volume of business than most of their counterparts on the East and West coasts, making it that much harder to spread costs and recoup major investments like electrification.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/image-11_2025-10-03-210334_mqua.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=bcc2c37f7f3fedd13e3c02fc5e1e9470,N,,2025-10-06 03:58:44.039221

That in turn allowed that consumer to spend their money on products and services that applied to them.","When President Donald Trump’s administration sent agents from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement department to Los Angeles in droves, activity at Welcome Tech began to pick up.

The Brentwood-based tech platform, aspirationally built to be the digital Ellis Island of the U.S., connects immigrants to jobs, health care services, school enrollment programs and financial institutions. It essentially acts as an onboarding system for anyone new to the country. When deportation became an immediate reality, several members turned to the platform to figure out next steps.

As government programs lost funding and resources thinned out, Welcome Tech quickly became the premiere platform for companies experiencing acute labor shortages, especially in sectors like construction, manufacturing, agriculture and hospitality.

“Ironically, it has led to a lot of growth because when you take a scenario where the consumer segment that we serve has less places to turn,” said Amir Hemmat, the co-founder and chief executive of Welcome Tech. “There are certainly less players coming into the market, and there are many players who are just disappearing because they don’t have the ability to navigate this.”

The interplay between nimble, fast-moving tech startups and the slow bureaucratic federal government has evolved over the last 20 years. There was once a time when technology and legislation operated parallel to one another. It took years for the federal and state governments to understand new categories of services like the gig economy or digital likeness. As a result, government agencies have put restrictions on such tech firms.

Today, the health of the startup sector depends heavily on federal priorities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Homeland Security, Energy and the National Science Foundation are among the top 10 most active investors in the country, according to PitchBook. Weapons, logistics, manufacturing and clean energy startups have rushed to gobble up federal innovation funds, navigate ongoing tariffs and establish themselves as the solution to carbon-related tax penalties.

However, for companies like Welcome Tech that specifically cater to populations increasingly under scrutiny by the Trump administration, that means navigating growth under new conditions.

“Corporations and their choices could be some sort of counterweight to the actions of the administration,” said Ramesh Srinivasan, a professor at the department of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There are levels to power and counter power.”

Operating under uncertainty

Grindr Inc. understands what it’s like to be a company treading through hostile waters. Founded in 2009, the West Hollywood-based queer dating app is restricted in some form in at least 20 countries, cutting the publicly traded company off from swathes of potential users.

“We really do see a link between helping our users connect in the product and our success as a public company,” said AJ Balance, the chief product officer of Grindr.

The company reported favorable second quarter earnings in August, and it announced plans to capitalize on its first-mover success in queer dating by expanding its travel capabilities. The new option came after the company noticed users often changed their location to places they were traveling to in order to get a feel of queer-friendly spaces – like bars, local bookstores or historically queer neighborhoods – in a new area.

Over a quarter – 27% – of Grindr users are traveling more than 50 miles from their home in any given week. But the company still must navigate the privacy implications for its users when developing new product offerings. After years of struggling, Grindr was finally able to add a map feature earlier this year without compromising users’ personal information.

“The gayborhoods in some ways are really special places in the world because they’re gathering places for the community that have played a part in advancing its rights,” said Balance. “We kind of facilitate that on a global scale.”

Ever-changing policies

Grindr isn’t the only one operating under ever-changing federal conditions. When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed pharmacies to deliver abortion pills by mail during the pandemic, the goal was to limit foot traffic in overburdened health care facilities.

Culver City-based Honeybee Health became the first U.S. pharmacy to provide abortion pills, like mifepristone and misoprostol, by mail. Last year, the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas revived a lawsuit that would require the FDA to severely limit access to abortion medication.

“The Court of Appeals’ decision, which eliminates access to this vital health care service, will immediately and irreparably harm the public interest, users of mail-order mifepristone in particular, and companies like Honeybee, whose business depends on distributing mail-order mifepristone,” Honeybee Health wrote in a 2024 amicus brief to the Supreme Court.

Changing federal legislation has drastically impacted several other institutions as well. Children’s Hospital Los Angeles cut 439 positions in September after shuttering its gender-affirming care unit over the summer, citing Trump-related cuts as the impetus for both. Columbia, Brown and the University of California, Berkeley, have cooperated with federal probes regarding on-campus protests in order to access federal funding. UCLA is presently facing similar pressure from the Trump administration.

“Many companies we’ve seen, and media organizations and legal firms have all just decided it’s in their own self-interest to just go with what the administration wants them to do,” Srinivasan said. “It depends on value gained versus value lost.”

Tapping into a new consumer base

When Hemmat and Raul Lomeli first started Welcome Tech, they knew it would be a tough sell to venture firms. Immigrants were decidedly a difficult category to reach. Health care and financial services companies often concluded that their customer base wasn’t interested in traditional access to services, and didn’t want to adopt the conventional technological infrastructure used in the U.S.

“Brands and companies and organizations would create this narrative of high acquisition cost to hide or make up for the fact they were just horrible at reaching this customer base,” Hemmat said. “And what you’d realize is: no, this is just an audience that’s either lacking information or is unable to get a product or service at the right experience. Just like how we don’t want to get fees or be overcharged, why would we assume that these customers or these consumers would want that experience, right?”

Nevertheless, in late August, Welcome Tech announced it raised $7.5 million to scale the company. The recent fundraise came from the likes of Mubadala Capital, CityRock Ventures Partners and Next Legacy Partners – all of which are generalist funds. That’s a far cry from the family offices and social impact investors that gave Welcome Tech a boost when it first started out. The notion that immigrants were not a reachable category was pervasive.

“We built technology on the backend that allows us to have a very granular view into the data insights that nobody else really has today,” Hemmat said. “One of our monetization paths is being the resource to market researchers and brands who really are flying blind when it comes to this demographic.”

The company tripled its partnerships with brands and nabbed 4.5 million members in one year. Welcome Tech suddenly amassed a treasure trove of data-generated insights on a population that historically evaded companies, allowing brands to understand buying behaviors and develop products and services for that type of consumer.

,Clean Energy ,2025-10-06 07:02:27+00:00,Mercomindia.com,Month in a Minute: Top Headlines from the Indian Renewable Sector in September 2025,Staff,,,,,https://www.mercomindia.com/month-in-a-minute-top-headlines-from-the-indian-renewable-sector-in-september-2025,"In March 2025, several developers in Rajasthan received notices from the regional load dispatch centres about time-block-wise curtailment of renewable energy.
The regulations are designed to facilitate the purchase, sale, and banking of renewable energy by consumers, generators, and traders.
The regulation specifies a minimum share of renewable energy consumption for electricity distribution licensees, open access consumers, and captive users.
The target of 43.33% RCO by FY 2030 comprises 3.48% from wind energy, 1.33% from hydro energy, 4.5% from distributed renewable energy, and 34.02% from other renewable energy sources.
The investigation was initiated following a joint application filed by FS India Solar Ventures, Jupiter International, Tata Power Solar, and TP Solar.","India’s solar sector is entering a decisive new phase. Starting September 1, 2025, all tenders require developers and installers to use solar modules compliant with the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-II for solar cells. While the government’s push for domestic manufacturing is widely supported, the transition is expected to be uneven, with developers warning of cost increases and possible delays, and manufacturers racing to add capacity in time.

India added 2.8 GW of rooftop solar capacity in the first half (1H) of 2025, according to Mercom India’s newly released Q2 2025 India Rooftop Solar Market Report. The installations grew 158% year-over-year (YoY). During the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, 1,618 MW of rooftop solar systems were installed, an almost 33% increase from 1,216.6 MW in Q1 2025, and an over 121% increase from the 731 MW installed in Q2 2024. The installation growth in 1H and Q2 of 2025 was mostly driven by the clearance of delayed registrations under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, the commissioning of new systems, and enhancements to the PM Surya Ghar portal.

Nearly 4 GW of wind-solar energy has been curtailed in Rajasthan since March 2025 due to delays in transmission projects and lower power demand resulting from above-normal rainfall in north India. In March 2025, several developers in Rajasthan received notices from the regional load dispatch centres about time-block-wise curtailment of renewable energy. The curtailment, which started at 8.5% in March, rose to 51.5% by August. Solar and wind projects were granted a ‘must-run’ status in 2021.

The average system cost of large-scale solar projects fell again in the second quarter of 2025, continuing the steady downward trend. Indian TOPCon-based projects remain the most expensive, while Chinese mono PERC projects continue to come in at the lowest cost. On a quarterly basis, costs declined across the board. Indian DCR TOPCon dropped 1.3%, Indian DCR mono PERC 1.2%, Indian TOPCon 1.6%, Indian mono PERC 3.5%, Chinese TOPCon 1.5%, and Chinese mono PERC 1.5%. Chinese mono PERC accounted for the lowest share of total project cost at 38.9%, while Indian DCR TOPCon stayed at the top at 61.9%.

India added nearly 3.8 GW of solar open access capacity in 1H 2025, an over 4% decrease from 3.9 GW installed in the same period of 2024, according to Mercom India’s Q2 2025 Solar Open Access Market Report. Installations in 1H 2024 were higher as many open access developers expedited project commissioning before the reimposition of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers. However, installations for 1H 2025 saw a slight dip, mainly due to delays in connectivity approvals and the limited availability of transmission infrastructure in Q1.

The reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 12% to 5% on solar cells and other renewable energy devices is likely to lower power costs for consumers while enhancing project viability for developers. Besides solar cells, windmills, and wind-operated electricity generators, as well as ocean/tidal wave devices, will also benefit from the GST cut. The tax rate also applies to fuel cells for motor vehicles, including those powered by hydrogen. The GST on non-lithium batteries was reduced to 18% from 28%.

The landed costs for third-party solar open access projects increased in 11 of 15 states for high-tension industrial consumers, primarily driven by higher power purchase agreement tariffs, according to Mercom India’s Q2 2025 Solar Open Access Market Report. In Q2 2025, India added approximately 2.7 GW of solar open access capacity. This represented a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase of more than 143% and a YoY rise of over 60%.

India imported solar cells and modules worth over $839.4 million (₹71.9 billion) in Q2 2025, an 8.3% YoY increase, according to data from the Department of Commerce. Solar cells made up 72.4% of the total import value, while modules contributed the remaining 27.6%. In a QoQ comparison, module and cell imports dropped by 35.6% from over $1 billion (~₹112.9 billion). While imports of solar cells rose 24.1%, imports of solar modules fell 71.5% in Q1 2025.

Maharashtra led solar open access installations in Q2 2025, accounting for 30% of the country’s capacity additions. Installations in the state rose 161% QoQ and 240% YoY, with nearly 59% of the projects delivered by three major developers. High grid tariffs drove several commercial and industrial consumers to opt for solar open access. The demand primarily came from consumers in sectors such as chemicals, fast-moving consumer goods, and textiles, which benefited from savings in electricity costs by switching to solar energy.

India added 44.2 GW of solar module capacity and 7.5 GW of solar cell capacity in 1H 2025, according to the recently released Mercom India research report, “State of Solar PV Manufacturing in India 1H 2025.” The manufacturing capacity additions in 1H 2025 were primarily driven by strong demand from the large-scale solar project pipeline of 186 GW between 2025 and 2027. Module manufacturing capacity also increased due to the 2030 solar installation targets and policy-driven domestic demand for solar modules compliant with the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.

A delay of over 18 months in commissioning a transmission system strengthening program has created bottlenecks for evacuating 8.1 GW of power from a renewable energy zone in solar-rich Rajasthan. The Phase II (Parts E, G, and G1) transmission system strengthening project was scheduled to be completed in November 2023, but has remained uncommissioned, according to Grid-India’s ‘Operational Feedback on Transmission Constraints (April-June 2025)’ report. Several transmission project components, which were to be commissioned by November 2023 and September 2024, are yet to be completed.

Accelerating its push for creating domestic manufacturing capacities across the solar value chain, the government has proposed mandating the use of India-made wafers under ALMM starting June 1, 2028. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), in a draft amendment to the ALMM order, proposes creating an ALMM List-III for wafers, on the lines of solar modules and cells. Stakeholders are invited to submit their comments and suggestions by October 11, 2025.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy issued the National Policy on Geothermal Energy to advance research, exploration, drilling techniques, reservoir management, and cost-effective power generation, along with wider adoption of direct-use technologies. Geothermal projects will receive the same support mechanisms as other renewable energy sources under the policy, including interstate grid access, interstate transmission system, and open access charge waivers, as well as must-run status, renewable purchase obligation eligibility, and participation in the Indian Carbon Credit Trading Program.

The Ministry of Power has notified the Electricity (Amendment) Rules, 2025, introducing changes in the regulatory framework governing the energy storage systems (ESS) usage. In June this year, the Ministry proposed the amendment to permit the sale, lease, and renting of ESS. The rules amend provisions of Rule 18 of the Electricity Rules, 2005, with a focus on broadening the scope of energy storage utilization and ownership. The revised sub-rule (2) states that an ESS can be used either as an independent storage facility or as part of generation, transmission, or distribution.

The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission petitioned the Supreme Court to allow it to liquidate its existing regulatory assets over seven years instead of four years, to mitigate the impact of tariff shock to consumers. The petition follows a Supreme Court direction to all states to clear the pending dues of ₹1.74 trillion (~$19.72 billion) owed to distribution companies within four years. It had also said new dues created after April 1, 2024, must be liquidated within three years.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy added a total of 4.8 GW of new solar cell capacity to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers List-II, taking the total enlisted capacity to 17.88 GW. Tata Power Renewable Energy has secured approval for a facility with an enlisted capacity of 280 MW/year. The facility manufactures bifacial mono-crystalline PERC cells. The enlisted model achieves an average efficiency of 22.89% with a wattage of 7.54 W, offering a range of 20% to 23.5% efficiency, corresponding to 6.6W to 7.75 W. TP Solar, a Tata Power subsidiary, has received approvals for two entries at its facility.

The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission issued a comprehensive framework for renewable energy transactions through the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission’s Terms and Conditions for Green Energy Open Access Regulations, 2025. The notification outlines the terms for non-discriminatory access to green power using intra-state transmission and distribution networks. The regulations are designed to facilitate the purchase, sale, and banking of renewable energy by consumers, generators, and traders.

The Ministry of Power prescribed a renewable energy consumption obligation for designated consumers to achieve a 43.33% target by the financial year 2030. The regulation specifies a minimum share of renewable energy consumption for electricity distribution licensees, open access consumers, and captive users. The target of 43.33% RCO by FY 2030 comprises 3.48% from wind energy, 1.33% from hydro energy, 4.5% from distributed renewable energy, and 34.02% from other renewable energy sources.

The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) imposed antidumping duties up to 30% on imports of solar cells, whether or not assembled into modules, originating in or exported from China for three years. The duty imposition follows the conclusion of the antidumping investigation initiated by DGTR in December 2024. The investigation was initiated following a joint application filed by FS India Solar Ventures, Jupiter International, Tata Power Solar, and TP Solar. The probe was conducted for the period between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024. The injury period was between 2020 and 2021.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Standard-Mercom-2025-09-25T191610.624.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 03:58:58.368075

The discussions focused on the implementation of the Net Zero Industry Act and other initiatives aimed at reshoring solar manufacturing to strengthen Europe’s position as a global leader in clean energy. The meeting brought together EU ministers, representatives from the European Commission, and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to address challenges facing the solar sector and explore ways to enhance supply chain resilience, competitiveness, and sustainable growth.

Dries Acke, Deputy CEO of SolarPower Europe, welcomed the engagement of key European institutions on the issue but emphasized that meaningful progress requires concrete follow-up actions. He highlighted a recent joint letter from SolarPower Europe and the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), which proposed a roadmap to revitalize solar manufacturing in Europe.

The recommendations include revising EU public procurement legislation to favor EU-made content, launching an EU Solar Manufacturing Booster similar to the recently introduced Battery Booster, expanding State Aid rules to cover all segments of the solar value chain to prevent factory closures, and increasing the EIB’s support role for European solar manufacturing. According to SolarPower Europe, achieving the EU target of 30 gigawatts of annual solar manufacturing capacity will require investments of between €1.4 billion and €5.2 billion per year, and these measures can boost domestic manufacturing without relying on protectionist trade policies.

America’s loss could be Canada’s gain in a world searching for trustworthy places to build the future energy system

Canada has been handed an opportunity it did not ask for. When the US Environmental Protection Agency moved to scrap mandatory greenhouse gas reporting, it did not just hobble climate policy. It undermined basic business infrastructure.

Every company tapping the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilisation and storage depends on credible measurement, reporting and verification.

Bankers will not finance billion-dollar projects on vibes; insurers will not underwrite storage liabilities without verifiable data; boards will not approve multiyear capital expenditure when the cash flows hang on numbers no one must prove. Pull that thread and the 45Q sweater unravels.

Bankers will not finance billion-dollar projects on vibes; insurers will not underwrite storage liabilities without verifiable data

Then came US President Donald Trump’s speech at the UN dismissing climate change as a hoax. He called it the “greatest con job ever perpetuated”, essentially holding up a neon sign that says, “global green capital: we don’t want your money”.

Canada should treat this moment as a competitive strategy problem, not a morality play. Markets reward jurisdictions that make risk legible and time predictable.

Trust over opacity

If the US chooses opacity, Canada can differentiate on openness and trust. That begins by treating emissions data like infrastructure: standardised, assured and available on a single, durable platform.

Imagine a banker in London or Singapore opening a Canadian project deck and seeing the same investor-grade emissions reporting across the supply chain, assured by third parties and tied contractually to incentive payments.

Now imagine that same banker trying to diligence a US project where the core revenue line — 45Q — has just disappeared. Where does cheaper capital flow?

Lack of credible data is not theoretical or limited just to CCUS. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s carbon emissions disclosure rules are in a legal limbo, affecting all businesses negatively.

Multinationals with science-based emissions targets are already rationing suppliers on the quality of their data. If American inputs go opaque, Canadian paper and steel mills, miners and shipping companies that can prove their numbers become the safer choice.

Engineers and founders notice too. The places that win talent are the ones where work “counts” — where a tonne abated is a tonne paid, and where the rules will not change at the next press conference.

In a world of rising greenwash risk, trust is not a slogan — it is an asset you can amortise

The playbook writes itself. Keep the prose short and the contracts long. Make clear in statute that Canadian incentives — from investment tax credits to contracts for differences — pay only for verified tonnes.

Do not bury this in guidance; write it into law so a chief financial officer can model cash flows without guessing the minister’s mood.

Pair that certainty with permitting that rewards readiness: projects that arrive with credible storage geology and community benefits should move through predictable timelines. When companies show their maths, the state should show its clock.

Strategy, not compliance

For businesses, the opportunity is blunter still. Treat transparency and disclosure as strategy, not compliance. The companies that win the cost of capital race will be the ones whose emissions data could pass a sceptical buyside analyst’s test.

Publish a transition plan that ties capex to measurable milestones and link executive pay to outcomes someone outside the company can verify. The reward is not a gold star from activists; it is cheaper debt and equity, and preferred status in customer supply chains that need to prove their own numbers. In a world of rising greenwashing risk, trust is not a slogan — it is an asset you can amortise.

Sceptics will say Canada has its own credibility issues: targets missed, timelines slipped, increasing emissions from oil sands. Fair — but verifiable data is how you turn ambition into bankability.

Even imperfect trajectories earn investor patience when the numbers are consistent, comparable and assured. That is the point of making disclosure boring and mandatory: not to scold, but to lower the cost of capital and speed real projects into the ground.

So yes, Washington just made a mistake — twice. First, by weakening the data backbone that keeps 45Q investible, then by amplifying the notion that climate is a hoax, which tells capital markets that commitments are reversible.

Canada does not need to answer with bigger rhetoric; it needs to be the jurisdiction where the numbers add up in a credible way.

If we have measurements with verification, if we pay only for proven outcomes, if we lock the rules in place for a decade rather than a news cycle, the business will come.

As the world marvels at the computational miracles of artificial intelligence, a pressing question emerges: Is there enough power to sustain this new intelligent era? The answer is now being written in the investment blueprints of energy giants. The Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipeline operators, is responding with a definitive “yes,” backing it with a $3.1 billion bet.

The AI boom and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles are placing unprecedented strain on the U.S. power grid, igniting an investment race centered on power supply. Industry forecasts project a 31% surge in national electricity consumption by 2030—a stark contrast to the mere 5% cumulative growth over the past 15 years. This tidal wave of demand, driven largely by AI data centers and EVs, is profoundly reshaping America’s energy landscape.

Seizing this opportunity, Williams is leading the charge. The company recently announced an additional $3.1 billion investment to construct two large-scale natural gas-fired power plants. Notably, the projects are backed by a 10-year, primarily fixed-price power purchase agreement with a financially strong customer, and are expected to commence operations by the first half of 2027.

Williams’ strategic pivot reflects a broader industry trend. Rival Energy Transfer is building eight gas-fired generation facilities in Texas, while Kinder Morgan has seen its backlog of natural gas infrastructure projects swell by $6.4 billion to a total of $8.6 billion. These moves signal a collective push by midstream energy companies into the power supply sector.

“We are leveraging our pipeline network advantages to deliver power solutions directly to high-load customers like data centers,” Williams’ CEO recently stated at an investor conference. The company currently has $1.6 billion of power projects under construction, capable of delivering 400 megawatts of electricity. The new $3.1 billion investment will boost its total power project backlog to $5 billion.

On the financial front, Williams offers a dividend yield of 3.06%. Analysts note the company has maintained a mid-single-digit annual dividend growth rate in recent years. A robust $14 billion pipeline expansion plan, extending through 2033, provides a solid foundation for continued earnings and dividend growth.

Industry observers see this power supply investment wave creating a multi-win scenario. For energy firms, it represents a strategic opportunity to break through growth constraints in traditional businesses. For data center operators, securing a stable power supply has become crucial in the race for computational supremacy. For investors, the steady cash flow generated by infrastructure assets is particularly valuable in the current interest rate environment.

As the 2030 power demand peak approaches, more energy companies are expected to join this supply-side transformation. Williams, with its first-mover advantage, is positioned to see the benefits of its early bets play out in the competitive years ahead.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/natural-gas-fired-power-electricity.png,N,,2025-10-06 05:00:17.367215

Nor do those suggestions demonstrate how such changes would fit into a coherent overall scheme for the future industry, or truly bring down soaring prices that are crippling households and businesses.

NZ First’s Shane Jones seems to agree, and recently called for his party to consider a policy of renationalising the big “gentailers” (the combined generation and retail companies). But his solutions appear designed to lock in dependence on fossil fuels rather than hasten the 100% renewable energy future that now beckons.

From the outset, it’s important to set clear goals for the electricity industry. Mine are: reliable abundant supply, and the lowest possible price to end-users, especially households.

Those were the goals of the old New Zealand Electricity Department, and they had been largely achieved by 1986. So-called reforms since then have reduced reliability while massively increasing prices and profits for the benefit of asset owners (including the government).

So, it’s also important to remember there are now entrenched vested interests whose incomes and asset portfolios are dependent on high prices and monopoly profits.

Bringing prices and profits down will mean writing down the asset values of the gentailers, the national grid and the lines companies – at the expense of their shareholders.

New Zealanders in general may be big winners. But there would be powerful and noisy losers. The sums involved will be large, and the politics will be difficult.

Rents and rising prices

Most of New Zealand’s electricity is generated from low-cost renewables – hydro, geothermal and wind – but also some high-cost thermal generation (mainly from the coal-and-gas-fired Huntly power station).

Before reform, the wholesale electricity price was set to cover the average cost of generation. Since reform, the wholesale price has been set by the highest-priced supplier, which these days mostly means Huntly.

That highest price is paid to all generators, despite the fact most of them will have offered to supply (and would have covered their genuine costs) at much lower prices.

As long as Huntly is kept in the mix as the highest-cost supplier that sets the market price, the market design will keep prices high – far above the cost of the solar and wind generation, whose entry to the market is being blocked by that same market design.

The result has been to enrich the owners of low-cost hydro and geothermal plant inherited from the old New Zealand Electricity Department.

From the moment this market mechanism was proposed in the mid-1980s, it was obvious it would drive prices up and deliver large rents (pure excess profits) on the legacy hydro and geothermal assets.

Equally, from the moment the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter’s cut-price supply contract was signed in 1960, it was clear that exceptions could be made. It was – and is – possible to impose long-term contracts to have electricity supplied to target groups of consumers at a low price.

In 1992, I and colleagues suggested how a contract similar to Tiwai Point’s could have provided 20,000 gigawatt-hours per year at two cents per kilowatt hour, to be passed through to consumers. The same contract structure remains an option today to lessen the burden of energy poverty on residential consumers.

However, what would have been simple back in 1992 was rejected as too “regulatory” by the head of Electricorp, which was overseeing the deregulation of the electricity market in the 1980s and 1990s. Now, it is politically hard because of the overblown asset values, dividends and tax revenues that have flowed from the high-price regime.

Worse, the first beneficiaries of monopolistic prices and asset values throughout the 1990s and 2000s have in many cases taken their capital gains and departed. The investors who bought their shares at high prices are now exposed to regulatory risk if the flow of economic rent is cut back.

Energy poverty and job losses

In 2012, in my submission to the select committee considering the Mixed Ownership Model Bill, I warned that future governments might find themselves forced to restrain anti-consumer and anti-competitive behaviour, which would push down the gentailers’ asset values and share prices.

I wrote then that this would “be financially devastating for the balance sheets of the companies, in precisely the same way as their conduct since 1990 has been devastating for the household budgets of millions of ordinary people”.

In the 13 years since, the conflict between monopoly profit and the public interest has worsened steadily, producing energy poverty for households and job losses in manufacturing, while asset values have soared.

Meanwhile, the arrival of energy-hungry computer data centres threatens to preempt any low-cost new generation that comes online.

Bringing down prices

Governments seem paralysed, both by their own conflicts of interest as owner-shareholders and by the prospect of backlash from powerful corporate and shareholder interests that benefit from the status quo.

Several broad solutions are straightforward in principle:

breaking up the gentailers

bringing in enough wind, solar, geothermal and battery power to remove the need for Huntly, even in dry years

and redirecting the legacy hydro assets to operate as a battery-equivalent rather than a profit centre.

But for electricity prices to come down significantly, the government would need to do at least these four things:

break down monopoly power and the sympathetic regulatory regime of the Electricity Authority and Commerce Commission

resurrect local electrical supply authorities to operate “energy communities”, combining the cost benefits of local small and medium-scale sources of renewable supply, with local network operators as coordinators

tender out procurement contracts for large-scale offshore wind, onshore solar and battery storage, owned and operated outside of the gentailers

and factor the true economics of renewable energy into the market by forcing the established vested interests to genuinely compete in the face of the renewables revolution.

Consumers and small business deserve a break after three decades of the current system. The outlook, alas, is for more of the same government fiddling while the economy suffers.

Entergy Arkansas’ plans drew recent scrutiny from the Arkansas Public Service Commission staff, the Arkansas attorney general’s office and industry groups like the Southern Renewable Energy Association and the Arkansas Advanced Energy Association.","With demand for electricity soaring, Arkansas utilities are looking everywhere for new generation possibilities, including up in the air.

Entergy Arkansas and the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. both recently put major power plant plans before state regulators, and both have connected new solar farms within the last 10 months. Entergy’s 200-megawatt Flat Fork Solar came online just last month.

But AECC also thought outside the box — or, rather, inside — to create 100 new megawatts of capacity at its Fitzhugh Generating Station.

It added two large turbines derived from the aerospace industry to increase the natural gas plant’s output from 170 to 270 megawatts.

“If you’ve ever taken a transatlantic flight, those large Boeing jetliners typically have very large engines,” AECC President and CEO Vernon “Buddy” Hasten said in an interview. “That engine hanging off the wing is made for the aerospace industry. If you take that same engine and use it to make electricity, it’s called an aero derivative.”

It was a crucial addition at a time when grid operators are requiring more excess generation capacity, new power-guzzling data centers are coming in and two giant coal-burning plants that Entergy and the cooperative co-own are set to either shut down or shift to other fuels.

“We basically took a 747 and tied it to the ground and turned it on and made electricity,” Hasten joked about the Fitzhugh expansion. “Actually, they are engines that General Electric has configured to make electricity. It was sort of like buying a power plant in a box.

“As a co-op, we’re always looking for bargains, and this was a good deal,” he said. “Maybe someone else couldn’t meet their obligations. The seller was really looking to sell.”

The utility further saved money by installing the big transformer from its decommissioned Carl E. Bailey gas-fired plant near Augusta to connect the new aero-derivative power to the grid.

The Bailey property is also the site of a 122-megawatt solar plant that AECC commissioned at the end of last year.

The co-op’s next generation proposal is an $800 million simple-cycle 850-megawatt gas power plant in Texas near Texarkana. Entergy also has gas-burning plants on the drawing board, including a 754-megawatt combined cycle combustion turbine near the White Bluff generating facility, to be called the Jefferson Power Station.

Entergy settled a Clean Air Act lawsuit by the Sierra Club by agreeing to stop burning coal at the White Bluff plant near Redfield by 2028. Under the 2018 consent decree, it will also stop burning coal at its Independence Station in Newark in 2030. Together, Independence and White Bluff supply Entergy, AECC and municipal utilities with a combined 3,500 megawatts of electricity.

That’s more than one-fifth of Arkansas’ net summer capacity of 15,000 megawatts as of 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Under a plan outlined to lawmakers and municipal utility leaders in Jonesboro and Conway, the Independence plant will continue generating electricity by converting to burning gas. The new facility will be majority-owned by AECC, which owns 35% of the current plant.

The city of Jonesboro would own 15% of the new operation, and Conway and West Memphis would have smaller stakes. The White Bluff plant would stay under Entergy’s primary ownership, and the utility is considering converting it to burn natural gas.

AECC hasn’t confirmed that the Independence plant will turn to natural gas. Spokesman Rob Roedel said that details “on the replacement generation source” are not available.

But Hasten explained that natural gas was basically the only choice for building a new baseload power plant quickly, like the one he’s planning near Naples, Texas.

“As you look at our integrated resource plan, it looks that way,” Hasten said in a witty 35-minute interview. Coal-burning plants are not being built today, he said, and new nuclear plants are at least 10 to 15 years away from feasibility. That’s why the power plant in Texas will burn gas.

“I get asked all the time. ‘Why Texas?’ Well, if you were a rancher, you’d be looking for good grass, good water, natural protection against predators,” he said. “The ideal location for this power plant is someplace with proximity to a natural gas pipeline, proximity to high-voltage power lines, and not right in the middle of an urban area. … We looked at many sites, and the Texas location is by far the most cost effective.”

It’s also in the footprint of Southwest Power Pool, a regional transmission organization whose market is requiring more accredited capacity from AECC.

2 Entergy Plants

Kristin Dalrymple, who became Entergy Arkansas’ vice president for business operations in March, offered some historical context to today’s resource planning crunch.

“The last time Entergy Arkansas really built units was when we built our coal units in the early 1980s and when we built Arkansas Nuclear One,” she said. “About 20 or 30 years after that, in a period when we needed new generation, we were able to acquire existing units.

“So now we are again in a period where there’s additional growth, but there’s also a backdrop where we’ve entered a consent decree to cease burning coal. So beyond our growth strategy, we have a replacement strategy to replace generation at White Bluff,” Dalrymple continued. “If you look at our last Integrated Resource Plan filing … you will see that we had a preferred resource plan that included a number of resources, and it also acknowledged that we were expecting to see growth.”

Earlier this year, Entergy won approval for a new natural gas plant to replace Lake Catherine Unit 4, which will close in 2027 after 50 years of service. The new 446-megawatt facility will bolster Entergy’s reliability and support load growth across its 730,000-customer footprint, the company said. It could begin operations in 2028.

Designated as Ironwood CT, it would be a simple cycle combustion turbine. Unlike the Jefferson design, it will not use combined cycle technology, which creates extra power by turning a turbine first by burning gas and then by using the exhaust to heat steam to spin a second turbine.

“In that filing for Jefferson Power Station, we talked about the benefits of combined cycle capacity to serve customer needs,” Dalrymple said. “It has an excellent load-following capability, and it’s an energy-efficient source of power.

“That doesn’t mean that we are necessarily shutting down the White Bluff units altogether. We are also evaluating potentially extending the lives of those units by converting them to burn natural gas.”

Taking a Hard Look

Arkansas utilities release formal resource planning documents every three years. Entergy’s integrated resource report came out about a year ago, and AECC submitted its plan in February.

The reports are complex, often running hundreds of pages, but they lay out how public utilities plan to allot resources to ensure reliability and stable costs to customers.

Entergy Arkansas’ plans drew recent scrutiny from the Arkansas Public Service Commission staff, the Arkansas attorney general’s office and industry groups like the Southern Renewable Energy Association and the Arkansas Advanced Energy Association.

The core concern is that the Jefferson Power Station doesn’t meet requirements to be paid for as it’s being built under the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025.

The JPS project is the first in the state to be proposed under the act, which lets utilities apply a “construction work in progress” (CWIP) process to have ratepayers shoulder costs as construction goes along. Previously, ratepayers would foot the bill after new plants started operating.

Utilities argue, with some justification, that the CWIP process can save consumer money by reducing financing costs. But the new Arkansas law requires that new projects be tied to strategic investments to attract significant new economic development.

Arkansas PSC resource planning guidelines require utilities to ensure that any new generation projects serve the public interest and generally represent the lowest cost to ratepayers, though there are exceptions. Entergy calculated that the Jefferson Power Station will increase average residential non-fuel charges on electric bills by $2.85 per month.

Lauren Waldrip, director of the Arkansas Advanced Energy Association, said Entergy was trying to use the new process to pay for a plant that has “been in the works for some time” without justifying the switch from the traditional regulatory review timeline. “There are other concerns, one of which is that there’s no customer protection,” Waldrip said.

Entergy Arkansas is asking for retail customers to bear 100% of the JPS costs. “The PSC staff points out that for the project they’re seeking to have approved, the costs are unknown, and that the utility didn’t provide any benchmark against comparable projects. And the attorney general’s office filing says that Jefferson Power Station will drive significant ratepayer impact,” Waldrip said.

Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, wrote in PSC filings that JPS does not meet the law’s definition of a strategic investment, and that it isn’t being proposed to serve a new large power user like a data center.

“[Entergy Arkansas] has known about the retirement of White Bluff for almost a decade, and has effectively waited until the last minute to announce public plans,” Mahan wrote.

Entergy spokesman Matt Ramsey said on Sept. 23 that the utility believes that the attorney general’s office and the PSC general staff actually support plans to build the Jefferson station. “All they were asking for is additional information, which we provided as of last Friday. This is part of the normal regulatory process, which is a key component that other media outlets might have missed.”

More than 25 state officials have written letters of support for JPS to the PSC.

“The governor, the General Assembly, the Department of Commerce and economic professionals from across the state have all said the same thing: Arkansas needs more electrical power to compete,” Ramsey said. “We are enabling the state’s vision to be an economic leader by investing in these resources.”

He pointed out that energy consultant Scott Norwood, who testified on behalf of the AG’s office, found that Entergy had demonstrated that it needs the power the JPS would generate, despite noting some “deficiencies” in the application.

Whatever happens in the JPS docket, Waldrip said regulators must keep consumers in mind.

“At the end of the day, we know that energy prices are going up,” she said. “We’re not naive, but we want to continue to make sure that mechanisms are in place to put some downward pressure on costs.”",https://arkansasbusiness.wppcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/JBP_7607.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 05:00:55.649501

Phil Murphy’s administration.

In all, New Jersey has increased its green economy workforce by 12% since 2021, resulting in a gain of more than 6,000 jobs, according to the report from the state Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy.

Although the policy landscape has shifted in a different direction at the federal level, the nearly 140-page report projects there remains an opportunity for additional growth in this sector over the next decade.

More than 14,000 net green jobs are expected to be generated through 2035, according to the report.

Some examples of the green economy include infrastructure technologies such as water, waste, and wastewater treatment and management, as well as stormwater and resiliency infrastructure, administration officials said.

Clean energy technologies include grid infrastructure and storage, renewable energy generation and fuels, energy efficiency and alternative vehicles, the officials said.

“As the growth of our green economy adds thousands of family-sustaining jobs in New Jersey, this report will help guide our continued commitment to meeting the demand for workforce development and coordination across our educational institutions, unions, and training providers,” Murphy said in a statement issued along with the report.

Questions remain

The release of the report comes as New Jersey is facing some uncertainty when it comes to the trajectory of the economy and job market, even as the Murphy administration has been portraying the state as a regional leader in growth and economic development.

In the most recent jobs report, New Jersey’s unemployment rate ticked up to 5%, well ahead of the 4.3% national jobless average.

“Our goal is to continue ensuring every New Jerseyan has the opportunity to thrive in this emerging industry, transforming not just careers but entire communities as we transition to a more environmentally responsible future,” — Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner of the NJ Department of Labor and Workforce Development

Across the nation, clean energy jobs grew by nearly 3% last year, according to an annual report published by the Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) business group.

That outpaced the national rate of job growth more than three times over, adding nearly 100,000 new jobs to the national economy, the E2 report said.

“Since 2020, the sector has added more than 520,000 new jobs, growing 17 percent overall — much faster than the rest of the economy and far surpassing job growth in the fossil fuel, gas and diesel motor vehicle, and the rest of the energy industry,” the E2 report said.

With a total of nearly 63,000 clean energy jobs as of 2024, New Jersey ranked 21st among U.S. states, the report said.

According to the report released by the Murphy administration, a total of 130 green economy projects in New Jersey were funded through federal initiatives launched during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. These include the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

However, President Donald Trump, a Republican who took office earlier this year, has worked with a GOP Congress in more recent months to undo many of the policies enacted by Biden, including those related to clean energy and electric cars.

“Recent policy decisions to revoke energy incentives, cancel permits, and add additional administrative burdens to clean energy projects puts the continued growth of clean energy jobs in America at serious risk,” according to the E2 report.

For his part, Murphy, a second-term Democrat, has sought to improve New Jersey’s standing in the green economy, including by establishing aggressive goals for clean energy generation over the next decade.

But not all of these efforts have panned out, and Murphy is due to leave office early next year under term limits written into the state Constitution. It remains to be seen whether his successor will carry on the current administration’s environmental policies.

In all, a total of 12 different occupations could continue to see gains under Murphy’s push to boost New Jersey’s total number of green economy jobs, with electricians projected to see the most growth, according to the state report.

What the report revealed

Other high-growth occupations documented in the report are plumbers, heating and air conditioning system mechanics and installers and solar installers, according to the state report.

Among these occupations, most require only a high school diploma or equivalent credential. The report also suggests wages in high-priority green-economy occupations outpace the national average.

Earlier this year, the Murphy administration announced the availability of more than $4 million in Green Workforce Training Grants through the state Economic Development Authority to help develop training programs to prepare New Jersey residents seeking careers in the green economy.

The state report also identified opportunities to improve access to training opportunities for the green economy in southern New Jersey.

“Cultivating a skilled workforce has long been a cornerstone of New Jersey’s vision for sustainability, and the Department of Labor is proud of our ongoing success in developing clear pathways to employment in this area through strategic investments in education, training, and apprenticeship programs,” said state labor commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo, who also serves as co-chair of the New Jersey Council on the Green Economy.

Founder of NJ Outdoor Alliance discusses state’s energy needs

Says plan should balance environment, economy, affordability

NJ Outdoor Alliance endorses one gubernatorial candidate’s energy approach

New Jersey faces a crisis, not just rising energy costs, but environmental missteps and economic strain.

Skyrocketing utility bills, stalled offshore wind projects, and degraded marine ecosystems are the consequences of an energy agenda that prioritizes ideology over practicality. New Jerseyans are being asked to pay the price, literally and figuratively.

The Murphy administration’s Energy Master Plan sought to electrify transportation and home heating while phasing out in-state electric generation. In theory, it promised a cleaner future. In practice, it has delivered higher costs, reduced reliability, and environmental harm.

Offshore wind, the master plan’s flagship initiative, has become its most visible failure. Developers like Ørsted and Shell have abandoned multibillion-dollar projects off our coast. Ørsted canceled Ocean Wind 1 and 2 in 2023, while Shell wrote off nearly $1 billion from its Atlantic Shores investment. Taxpayers are left with the bill, and New Jersey is left with a looming energy shortage.

Meanwhile, ratepayers have endured utility cost increases of more than 20%, with another 5% expected by 2026. Families are cutting back on the very activities that define quality of life.

Why it matters

Outdoor recreation is more than a pastime — it’s a pillar of our economy. Fishing, boating, hunting, and wildlife tourism generate over $2 billion in direct retail spending and support thousands of jobs. Their ripple effect contributes $4.1 billion to our economy, sustaining marinas, hatcheries, seafood processors, guides, and restaurants.

When energy costs soar, these businesses suffer. Higher overhead and reduced consumer spending threaten livelihoods and entire communities.

The impact doesn’t stop at the balance sheet. Offshore wind survey work has raised concerns among scientists and fishermen over the disruption of marine ecosystems, displacing whales, dolphins, and fish from critical habitats. If offshore wind construction proceeds, seabed disturbance can bury clams, crabs, and other keystone species. Both construction and early operating turbines can alter the migration and movement patterns of marine life.

New Jersey should not be forced to choose between a healthy environment, a thriving economy, and affordable energy.

Jack Ciattarelli offers a practical, science-based alternative. His pledge to rewrite the Energy Master Plan is more than campaign rhetoric; it’s a necessary step to restore balance.

Ciattarelli supports a diversified energy mix – natural gas, nuclear, and solar – that lowers emissions without sacrificing affordability or reliability. He understands that economic vitality, environmental health, and energy security must work together, not compete against each other.

Energy price freezes may sound appealing, but they merely delay the inevitable, leading to steeper hikes when the freeze ends.

New Jersey should not be forced to choose between a healthy environment, a thriving economy, and affordable energy. With the right leadership, we can have all three.

Clint Vince: I fell into the energy and environmental field totally by accident. I was a student at Georgetown Law School, looking for a way to earn some money, and I clerked with a firm that happened to work on these issues. I wanted to become a trial lawyer. After I graduated, I joined the firm full-time when they offered to make me the head of their litigation department. I later went to Dentons and founded their energy and environmental practice, so I’ve been steeped in this area of the law my whole career.

The subject of oceans is very near and dear to my heart. I was on an ocean racing team with sailboats for several decades, and I still sail—it’s in my DNA. I care a lot about oceans, and I’ve seen their deterioration. The more work that can be done there, the better.

What do you most appreciate about RFF?

I consider the people at RFF to be honest truth-tellers, and that type of dependable, nonpartisan research is more valuable now than ever. There’s so much misinformation out there. I love reading RFF reports on everything about climate and transportation decarbonization, especially on heavy-duty vehicles. I also think RFF’s work on critical minerals has been strong. The economic analysis that RFF contributes is unparalleled. I can’t think of anyone that tackles economic analysis with the rigor that RFF does.

Because RFF is nonpartisan, it doesn’t choose technologies, and it doesn’t choose winners or losers. Technology changes often, and something that’s popular this year might morph into something completely different in a few years. What RFF does is provide economic analysis of different technologies and their applications, and I think that’s incredibly helpful.

In terms of RFF’s value to my own work, I have a broad-based practice. I argue cases before state courts, federal courts, and the US Supreme Court, and I also do advocacy in Congress, with government agencies, and at the state level. It’s helpful to have RFF’s data so that I can advance my own position or argument. I expect RFF to be quoted in even more legal decisions in the future.

Finally, what do you think sets RFF apart from other organizations?

There are a lot of organizations that are conveners, but what stands out to me about RFF is that it produces economic analysis at the highest possible level.

As communities around the globe grapple with the impacts of climate change and the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, empowering local populations to take charge of their energy futures becomes paramount. Local capacity building involves equipping individuals and organizations with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to develop, implement, and maintain renewable energy projects.

This approach not only fosters self-sufficiency but also ensures that projects are tailored to the unique needs and contexts of the communities they serve. Moreover, local capacity building enhances community resilience. When local stakeholders are actively involved in renewable energy initiatives, they are more likely to support and sustain these projects over time.

This engagement leads to a deeper understanding of the technology and its benefits, fostering a sense of ownership among community members. As a result, renewable energy projects are more likely to thrive, creating jobs, reducing energy costs, and contributing to environmental sustainability. By prioritizing local capacity building, NGOs can create a ripple effect that empowers communities to become leaders in the transition to renewable energy.

Key Takeaways

Local capacity building is essential for sustainable renewable energy projects

Identifying potential renewable energy projects in the local community is the first step towards capacity building

Engaging stakeholders and building partnerships is crucial for successful capacity building efforts

Assessing the skills and resources needed for renewable energy projects is important for effective planning

Developing training programs for local community members is key to building local expertise in renewable energy initiatives

Identifying Potential Renewable Energy Projects in the Local Community

The first step in fostering local capacity for renewable energy is identifying viable projects that align with community needs and resources. This process begins with a thorough assessment of the local environment, including geographical features, existing infrastructure, and energy consumption patterns. For instance, a community situated in a sunny region may benefit from solar energy initiatives, while those near rivers might explore hydroelectric options.

Engaging with community members through surveys or focus groups can provide valuable insights into their energy needs and preferences. Real-world examples abound where communities have successfully identified and implemented renewable energy projects. In rural India, for instance, villages have harnessed solar power to electrify homes and schools, significantly improving quality of life.

Similarly, in parts of Africa, wind energy projects have been developed in areas with consistent wind patterns, providing clean energy while creating jobs for local technicians. By leveraging local knowledge and resources, NGOs can help communities pinpoint projects that are not only feasible but also beneficial in the long term.

Engaging Stakeholders and Building Partnerships

Engaging stakeholders is crucial for the success of any renewable energy initiative. This involves identifying key players within the community—such as local government officials, business leaders, and residents—and fostering collaborative relationships among them. Building partnerships can amplify resources and expertise, making it easier to navigate challenges and implement projects effectively.

For example, an NGO might partner with a local university to access research expertise or collaborate with businesses to secure funding or technical support. Successful stakeholder engagement requires transparent communication and a commitment to inclusivity. Regular meetings and workshops can facilitate dialogue among stakeholders, allowing them to share ideas and concerns openly.

Involving diverse voices ensures that the project reflects the community’s values and priorities. A notable example is the partnership between NGOs and local governments in Brazil, where collaborative efforts have led to the successful implementation of community-based solar projects that prioritize social equity and environmental sustainability.

Assessing the Skills and Resources Needed for Renewable Energy Projects

Once potential projects have been identified and stakeholders engaged, the next step is to assess the skills and resources required for successful implementation. This assessment should encompass both technical skills—such as installation and maintenance of renewable energy systems—and soft skills like project management and community engagement. Conducting a skills inventory within the community can help identify existing capabilities as well as gaps that need to be addressed.

For instance, if a community is planning to install solar panels but lacks technicians trained in installation, it may be necessary to develop training programs or seek external expertise. Additionally, understanding available resources—such as funding opportunities, materials, and equipment—can inform project planning. A case study from Kenya illustrates this point: a community identified a lack of trained solar technicians as a barrier to implementing solar projects.

By partnering with vocational training institutions, they were able to develop a program that equipped local youth with the necessary skills, ultimately leading to successful project implementation.

Developing Training Programs for Local Community Members

Training programs are essential for building local capacity in renewable energy projects. These programs should be tailored to meet the specific needs of the community while also considering varying levels of prior knowledge among participants. A combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience can enhance learning outcomes.

For example, workshops that include both classroom instruction on renewable energy principles and practical sessions on system installation can effectively prepare community members for active roles in projects. Moreover, leveraging local expertise can enrich training programs. Inviting experienced practitioners from within the community or nearby regions to share their knowledge can foster a sense of pride and ownership among participants.

In South Africa, for instance, community-led training initiatives have empowered individuals to become solar technicians, leading to job creation and increased access to clean energy. By investing in training programs that build both technical skills and confidence, NGOs can help communities take charge of their renewable energy futures.

Accessing Funding and Resources for Capacity Building

Securing funding is often one of the most significant challenges faced by NGOs working on renewable energy projects. However, various funding sources exist that can support capacity-building efforts. These include government grants, international development funds, private sector investments, and crowdfunding campaigns.

NGOs should actively research potential funding opportunities that align with their project goals and develop compelling proposals that clearly articulate the benefits of their initiatives. In addition to traditional funding sources, innovative financing models such as social impact bonds or green bonds can provide alternative avenues for securing resources. Collaborating with local businesses or philanthropic organizations can also yield financial support while fostering partnerships that enhance project sustainability.

A successful example comes from a community in Bangladesh that utilized microfinance to fund solar home systems for low-income households. By combining financial resources with technical training, they were able to create a sustainable model that empowered residents while addressing energy poverty.

Implementing Renewable Energy Projects with Local Expertise

With funding secured and training completed, it is time to implement renewable energy projects using local expertise. Engaging community members in every stage of implementation not only builds trust but also ensures that projects are culturally relevant and sustainable. Local technicians who have undergone training can take on roles in installation and maintenance, while community members can participate in project management tasks.

A notable example is found in Nepal, where community-managed micro-hydro projects have been successfully implemented across rural areas. These projects rely on local knowledge and labor for construction and maintenance, resulting in increased ownership and sustainability. By empowering local experts to lead implementation efforts, NGOs can create a sense of pride within the community while ensuring that projects are maintained effectively over time.

Monitoring and Evaluating the Impact of Capacity Building Efforts

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are critical components of any capacity-building initiative. Establishing clear metrics for success allows NGOs to assess the effectiveness of their efforts in real-time and make necessary adjustments along the way. M&E should encompass both quantitative data—such as energy output or cost savings—and qualitative feedback from community members regarding their experiences with training programs or project implementation.

For instance, an NGO working on solar energy projects in rural Mexico developed an M&E framework that included regular surveys of participants’ satisfaction levels as well as tracking changes in energy access over time. This approach not only provided valuable insights into project effectiveness but also helped build accountability among stakeholders. By sharing M&E findings with the community, NGOs can foster transparency and encourage ongoing engagement in future initiatives.

Addressing Challenges and Overcoming Barriers in Local Capacity Building

Despite best efforts, challenges will inevitably arise during capacity-building initiatives for renewable energy projects. Common barriers include limited access to technology, resistance from certain community members, or insufficient funding. To address these challenges effectively, NGOs must adopt a proactive approach that includes open communication with stakeholders and flexibility in project design.

For example, if resistance arises due to misconceptions about renewable energy technologies, conducting informational sessions or workshops can help dispel myths and build understanding within the community. Additionally, forming alliances with local leaders who support renewable energy initiatives can help sway public opinion in favor of projects. A case study from Tanzania illustrates this point: when faced with skepticism about solar technology among some villagers, an NGO collaborated with respected local leaders to advocate for the benefits of solar power, ultimately leading to widespread acceptance.

Sharing Best Practices and Lessons Learned with Other Communities

As communities successfully implement renewable energy projects through capacity building, it is essential to share best practices and lessons learned with others facing similar challenges. This exchange of knowledge can foster collaboration among communities and inspire innovative solutions tailored to specific contexts. NGOs can facilitate this sharing through workshops, conferences, or online platforms where communities can showcase their successes and learn from one another.

For instance, an NGO working across multiple regions might organize an annual conference where representatives from different communities come together to share their experiences with renewable energy projects. Such gatherings not only promote learning but also create networks of support among communities striving for similar goals. By fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing, NGOs can amplify the impact of their capacity-building efforts across broader regions.

Sustaining and Expanding Local Capacity for Future Renewable Energy Projects

Sustaining local capacity for future renewable energy projects requires ongoing commitment from both NGOs and community members. This involves continuous training opportunities to keep skills up-to-date as technology evolves and ensuring that local experts remain engaged in project management roles. Additionally, establishing mechanisms for ongoing support—such as mentorship programs or peer networks—can help maintain momentum within the community.

Expanding local capacity also means exploring new opportunities for innovation within renewable energy sectors. As communities gain confidence in their abilities to manage existing projects, they may be inspired to explore additional technologies or approaches—such as energy efficiency measures or hybrid systems that combine multiple renewable sources. A successful example comes from a cooperative in Brazil that began with a single solar project but has since expanded its efforts to include wind energy initiatives as well.

In conclusion, building local capacity for renewable energy projects is a multifaceted process that requires careful planning, collaboration, and ongoing support. By understanding community needs, engaging stakeholders effectively, providing targeted training programs, securing funding resources, implementing projects with local expertise, monitoring progress diligently, addressing challenges proactively, sharing knowledge widely, and sustaining efforts over time—NGOs can empower communities to take charge of their renewable energy futures while contributing meaningfully to global sustainability goals.",https://fundsforngosmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/19141120/icon.png,N,,2025-10-06 01:58:50.872627

Robotic mining is a national project — it requires continuity across decades, not political terms.","Canada has always been a mining nation.

Our identity has been forged in the toughness of the North, the endurance of long winters, and the resource wealth beneath our land. But today, toughness is not enough. To survive and prosper in a competitive, technology-driven world, Canada must move beyond traditional mining and embrace robotic mining as the foundation of its future.

Critical minerals — nickel, cobalt, uranium, lithium, rare earths — are no longer just economic assets. They are strategic imperatives, essential for clean energy, defence, and advanced manufacturing. The world needs them, and Canada has them. But without robotic mining, we cannot deliver them safely, sustainably, or competitively.

Why robotics is essential

Traditional mining is labour-intensive, hazardous, and environmentally costly. Robotics transforms all of that:

safety: robotic systems keep people out of dangerous environments;

sustainability: precision drilling, blasting, and haulage reduce waste and environmental damage;

productivity: automation enables continuous operations and higher ore recovery;

data-driven decision-making: AI and geospatial blockchain track every tonne of ore, every blast, every drill hole in real time.

Robotic mining is not a luxury. It is the only viable path forward if Canada wants to lead in supplying critical minerals to the world.

Lessons from Sudbury

Canada has already shown what is possible.

In the 1990s, NASA came to Sudbury to test whether robotic drilling could be trusted in extreme conditions. My team had developed tele-operated systems to modernize Canadian mines and protect workers underground. Those demonstrations proved that robotic mining works — and under some of the toughest conditions on Earth.

That capability gave NASA confidence to use robotic drills on Mars, where they ultimately helped uncover evidence of life. The point is not that Canada alone made Mars exploration possible, but that Canadian robotic mining innovation has already proven itself on the world stage.

From survival to leadership

Canada’s environment — vast, cold, and unforgiving — once demanded resilience for survival. Today, those same conditions can inspire innovation for leadership. Robotic haulage trucks, autonomous drilling systems, swarming drones, optical networks that transmit terabits of data, and blockchain-secured ore tracking are not abstract ideas. They are Canadian technologies, developed in response to our environment. What was once about survival can now be about global leadership.

Pilots that prove commitment

But bold rhetoric will not be enough. Canada must act by launching multiple robotic mining pilots. These must demonstrate safe, sustainable, automated operations across different mineral sites. And they must be built with broad support:

government ministries, to provide incentives and policy frameworks;

the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), to coordinate standards;

Indigenous nations, as partners in design, stewardship, and benefit-sharing; and

unions, to ensure workers are retrained and included in the next generation of mining.

Most importantly, these pilots must be insulated from election cycles. Too often, bold initiatives collapse when governments change. Robotic mining is a national project — it requires continuity across decades, not political terms.

A Canadian identity for the future

Modernizing mining through robotics is not just about minerals. It is about redefining Canadian identity. If we prove that mining can be clean, safe, and automated, Canada will not only be the world’s trusted supplier of critical minerals. We will also be seen as leaders in clean energy, defence readiness, and space exploration.

This is about showing that Canadians are not just polite and resilient — we are inventive, bold, and capable of leading in the technologies that matter most.

The choice before us

If we fail to modernize, Canada will be bypassed. Allies will look elsewhere for secure supply chains, and adversaries will continue to weaponize resource control. If we succeed, Canada can redefine mining for the world, turning our resource wealth and harsh conditions into a platform for innovation and leadership.

The lesson of Sudbury is clear: robotic mining works. The lesson of Mars is even clearer: Canadian innovation can change the course of discovery. Now we must apply that spirit at home.

The choice is stark: modernize through robotics — or decline. For Canada, there is only one path forward.

China is now showcasing its remarkable capacity for innovation, with its cutting-edge innovations increasingly setting the pace in multiple global industries.

Western narratives about innovation have long been shaped by a narrow historical lens that privileges recent developments in Europe and North America.

This perspective often dismisses the capacity of developing nations to innovate, portraying them as copycats rather than originators. Such a view overlooks the historical reality that China and India were the world’s largest economies and centres of innovation until the early 19th century.

From papermaking and gunpowder to advanced agricultural practices and astronomical instruments, China’s legacy of innovation is transformative and enduring.

The resurgence of Chinese innovation in the 21st century is not an anomaly, but a continuation of a long tradition, now reconfigured through top-down guidance, market competition and global integration.

China’s modern innovation trajectory began in earnest with its economic reform and opening-up in the late 1970s. Initially, the country leveraged its comparative advantage in low-cost mass production to stimulate growth. This strategy earned China the proud moniker “factory of the world”, producing goods for global markets without developing indigenous brands.

To sustain its industrial base and workforce, China adopted a pragmatic approach: imitating successful foreign designs and brands, in the footsteps of the Japanese industries in the initial stages of its economic recovery after World War II. The approach was not a sign of intellectual deficiency but a calculated move to build industrial capacity and technological expertise in the shortest possible time.

The turning point came in 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organisation, facing increased scrutiny over intellectual property practices.

Recognising the limitations of competing in internal-combustion engine technologies dominated by Western companies, Chinese policymakers pivoted toward electric vehicle, or EV, technology.

A special EV project was launched in 2001 under the nation’s 863 Plan, prioritising research in pure EVs, hybrid EVs, and fuel cell vehicles. This strategic foresight bore fruit when BYD introduced the F3DM plug-in hybrid in 2008, marking China’s entry into the global EV market. The 863 Plan is a top national high-tech development program initiated in March, 1986.

The US-China trade war initiated in 2018 further catalysed China’s innovation drive.

President Xi Jinping’s call for “high-level sci-tech self-reliance “spurred massive investments in high-tech manufacturing, artificial intelligence and renewable energy. Xi’s vision is not merely defensive but aspirational: to make China a global leader in emerging technologies.

The State’s role in this transformation is pivotal. Unlike Western innovation models driven by market forces and individual entrepreneurship, China’s approach is State-led, co-ordinated and systemic. Central to China’s innovation strategy is the “innovation chain”, a conveyor belt that transforms ideas from State-run laboratories and universities into commercial products.

This model has accelerated progress across multiple sectors.

In the EV industry, companies such as BYD, NIO and Xpeng have introduced groundbreaking innovations, including battery swapping, sideways motion and even flying.

While critics argue that the Chinese EV market suffers from overcapacity — with 129 brands competing in 2024 and only 15 expected to survive by 2030 — this “survival of the fittest” strategy has quickly winnowed down to a relative few that cannot only survive but thrive under fierce competition with their ever-improving technologies.

In AI development, China has made remarkable strides despite US export bans on advanced semiconductors. Domestic tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have mobilised to develop indigenous AI chips, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, exemplifies this resilience by training models on Huawei chips. This strategic pivot not only ensures continuity in AI development, but also fosters innovation within China’s semiconductor industry, laying the groundwork for long-term self-sufficiency.

China’s prowess in information technology is equally notable. Companies such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have redefined commerce, financial services and entertainment, often surpassing their Western counterparts in scale and sophistication.

China now leads the world in patent applications, a testament to its innovation capacity. This surge in intellectual property generation reflects not only quantity but also improving quality, as Chinese enterprises expand their global footprint.

In renewable energy, China has emerged as a dominant force. The country’s new renewable energy plan emphasises solar, wind and hydropower, supported by robust infrastructure and policy incentives. China is not merely adopting green technologies, but also shaping their global evolution. According to Harvard’s Fairbank Center, China’s leadership in clean energy is underpinned by strategic investments, supply chain control and technological innovation.

China’s innovation model diverges fundamentally from Western paradigms. In the West, innovation is often driven by free-market forces and individual actors — scientists, engineers, and investors — operating with minimal government intervention.

In contrast, China’s top-down model facilitates innovation through strategic planning, targeted funding and robust institutional support. A prominent example is Theseus, a computer-vision sensor company based in Chongqing that originated from informal partnerships between scientific researchers and local government officials. The enterprise was initiated through discussions among members of the Xi’an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, ultimately securing both financial support and infrastructure from district authorities. By 2024, Theseus had become a national leader in its field, collaborating with China Mobile to promote advancements in AMOLED display technology.

The integration of universities, local governments and industry is another hallmark of China’s flexible innovation strategy by adopting whatever configuration of partnerships works (the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous black cat-white cat winning formula comes to mind). Science parks and industrial zones facilitate the commercialisation of research and the emergence of new industries. Xiaomi’s rapid transition from smartphone manufacturing to EV production within three years exemplifies this agility. Moreover, China’s expertise in EVs and drones has enabled it to lead in the nascent field of flying taxis, showcasing the synergies across sectors.

As China consolidates its role as the world’s manufacturing hub, its aspiration to become a global innovation leader is a logical progression. Western scepticism about China’s innovative capacity reflects outdated assumptions and a failure to grasp the evolving dynamics of global technology. China’s State-led model, while distinct from Western norms, is producing tangible results across multiple domains. From EVs and AI to renewable energy and information technology, China is not merely catching up – it is setting the innovation pace.

Across the country, parks have been forced to close, operate under reduced staffing or rely on outside donations to keep the lights on as the shutdown continues.

The lack of a unified plan across all parks and sparse details outlined by official government resources has sparked confusion about which places parkgoers can visit or if the shutdown has caused sites to temporarily shutter their services.

""National parks remain as accessible as possible during the federal government shutdown,"" a notice on the NPS website reads.

""However, some services may be limited or unavailable,"" it continues, with a link directing readers to a site with contingency plans outlining how funds would be appropriated during the shutdown.

A contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails ""will generally remain accessible to visitors"" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.

""As part of their orderly shutdown activities, park staff will post signs notifying visitors that only basic or no visitor services, maintenance, or other management activities will be conducted, and emergency services will be limited,"" according to the plan.

At some park locations that collect fees, the memo stipulates that basic services can be provided such as those that maintain restrooms, collect trash and road maintenance.

But at some closed park locations, services will be stripped to the bone, including no trash collection, restrooms, road or walkway maintenance or visitor information.

NPR reached out to the NPS on Saturday for comment but has not received a response.

States step in and donations for some relief

Several states have taken it into their own hands to see to it that their parks remain open during the federal funding spat, either directly funding the sites themselves or collecting third-party relief to help keep the doors open.

According to National Parks Traveler, parks in states including West Virginia, Utah and Hawaii, have managed to secure funds and donations necessary to keep operations temporarily rolling.

Visitors in other states have not been so lucky.

Kathy Ten Eyck flew from Utica, New York into New Mexico to visit the glistening dunes of White Sands National Park. Instead, she was met with a notice of closure.

""I just couldn't wait — could not wait to — get here,"" Ten Eyck said. ""We stopped at the [PistachioLand] right up the street there, and that's where we heard that it was closed.""

Kathy Theriot was similarly heartbroken outside of the New Mexico Park. She had driven her children more than five hours from their home in Taos and hoped that they could experience the white sands she remembered from her childhood.

""I've been waiting 10 years to show my kids White Sands and the day we come it's closed, which is very disappointing,"" Theriot said.

""But it is really, really sad though that we get to the side of the road to enjoy part of our country because our elected officials can't get along.""

Vandalism and safety concerns

Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.

Some of Texas' famed national parks, such as Big Bend and Padre Island National Seashore, will remain open during this time but may have limited staffing, according to Texas Public Radio (TPR).

A previous government shutdown, TPR reported, saw an ancient rock at Big Bend vandalized amid the lack of staffing.

Those concerns have caused some park advocates to recommend all parks with a reduction in force be closed until federal funding is sorted.

""Keeping our national parks open after Trump and Republicans forced a government shutdown is stupid, short-sighted and incredibly dangerous,"" said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.

""We've seen the irreparable harm that can happen when our parks go understaffed. Vandalism, trash and human waste will tarnish natural treasures that are the envy of the world. But apparently nothing says 'Make America Great Again' like turning Yosemite into one giant toilet.""

Support the campaign: Lift The Ban On New Scottish Nuclear Power","Across the UK, momentum is building behind a new era of nuclear power. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband hailed a “golden age of nuclear” backed by a landmark energy security partnership with the United States. This agreement should attract billions in private investment to power industry and data centres.

Developments from British and American companies like Rolls-Royce and Last Energy are already lining up projects. These developments are set to deliver thousands of skilled jobs. Centrica and X Energy’s £10bn deal could lead to the building of 12 advanced nuclear plants creating 2,500 jobs on Teesside and providing clean, homegrown energy for decades to come.

The PM recently created a Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce to capture this opportunity. Their interim report declared Britain’s nuclear regulation is not fit for purpose. The Taskforce was empowered to look at safety and environmental rules, but there was one area where they were forced to stay silent. Holyrood’s effective ban on the technology.

Why Scotland Is Being Left Out

Scotland risks being left behind. While energy policy is set at Westminster, planning rules are devolved. The SNP government has used its planning powers to impose an effective ban on new nuclear construction.

This position is hard to defend. The SNP claims nuclear power is too expensive, but that’s hardly a matter for the planning system. DP World, Centrica, and Tritax are all investing in UK nuclear projects to power data centres and industrial sites, clearly nuclear being ‘too expensive’ isn’t deterring them. Nuclear costs aren’t fixed either. France and Finland have built reactors for half the cost of the UK. South Korea builds at a sixth of the cost.

Crucially, Scotland cannot rely on renewables alone. Even in one of the windiest countries in Europe, the wind does not always blow. When Torness shuts, Scotland will lose its last source of zero-carbon baseload power. Without nuclear, the backup will not be more wind farms or batteries, it will be fossil fuels or imports from Norway. Fossil fuel prices have fluctuated wildly in recent years, and amidst rising energy prices, Norway has been threatening to cut off their interconnectors and will likely seek renegotiation to secure higher prices. This is not energy security.

Why the SNP’s Arguments Don’t Add Up

Nationalist politicians fall back on two arguments: nuclear is unsafe and nuclear is too costly. Both collapse under scrutiny.

On safety, the data is clear. Nuclear is one of the cleanest and safest energy sources available, safer on a deaths-per-unit-of-power basis than wind. Most of the fatalities associated with nuclear have come not from radiation, but from poorly managed evacuations, such as after Fukushima.

On cost, pointing to Hinkley Point C ignores international experience. France builds nuclear plants for half the UK cost; South Korea for a sixth. Regulatory reform and economies of scale can deliver affordable nuclear here too.

And nuclear vs. renewables is a false choice. We need both. Nuclear is reliable, compact, and provides power around the clock.

What Scotland Thinks

The SNP ban doesn’t just defy economic and engineering logic, it also defies public opinion.

A Britain Remade poll found 51% of Scots support new nuclear in Scotland’s energy mix, rising to 68% among those with an opinion. New nuclear is essential to meet the SNP’s own net zero target of 2045 according to 56% of those polled. Support for SMRs is even higher, with 77% of those expressing a view in favour of them.

Crucially, even those who voted SNP in 2024 are on board. A plurality of 47% believe nuclear is necessary to meet net zero and 56% of those who express a view back the construction of SMRs.

The Opportunity at Torness and Hunterston

Scotland already has the sites and the expertise. Torness in East Lothian and Hunterston in Ayrshire have hosted nuclear power for decades. They have skilled workforces, grid connections, and community support.

We’ve consistently found that support for nuclear power is strongest in areas where stations already exist or existed in the recent past. Britain Remade has tapped into this by drawing large audiences to pro-nuclear events in former nuclear communities. Across these sites, we’ve found a deep local pride in their nuclear heritage. In Dunbar, near the Torness station, we packed a hall with residents calling clearly for new nuclear investment.

UK ministers have made clear that Torness and Hunterston are prime candidates for new nuclear power if the SNP lifts its ban. Gigawatt-scale plants would mean billions of pounds of investment and thousands of jobs. Even SMRs would deliver hundreds of millions in investment and hundreds of new jobs.

In other words, these sites are ready to go, if only Holyrood steps aside.

Why It Matters Now

For years, the SNP’s nuclear ban didn’t matter. Westminster wasn’t building nuclear, so Scotland wasn’t missing much.

That era is over. Scotland faces a choice: embrace nuclear and share in the investment, jobs, and clean power, or stick with an outdated ban and watch opportunity flow elsewhere.

Investment is not just from taxpayers and bill payers. Technological progress means there are billions of pounds’ worth of private investment in SMRs available. This could power Scottish industry through the 21st century.

Torness alone has generated enough clean power to supply every home in Scotland for 36 years. Yet when it shuts, Scotland could be left with no nuclear power for the first time since 1959. At the very moment when nuclear matters most, the SNP want to lock it out.

A decade ago, the SNP’s nuclear ban was the equivalent of the London Borough of Lambeth declaring itself a ‘nuclear free zone’. Pointless, but largely costless posturing. Now Scotland is at risk of missing out on billions of investment. Scotland needs to change course, fast.

Data centers have almost no local economic effects, with one possible exception.

That’s the result of my recent study examining the effects of data centers on Texas employment and incomes. Texas provides an ideal case study because it offers both property tax abatements and sales tax exemptions for data centers, it posts transparent data on tax incentives, and it experienced the data center rush before other states.

To understand the economic impact, I measured employment in counties with new data centers against those without, focusing on total employment and the sectors most likely affected: information, construction, and professional and technical services.

The results were pretty clear.

No data center had a measurable effect on employment. To double check that finding, we performed a second type of analysis designed to detect whether jobs come early, as in a construction phase, or later, once the data center is operating.

There was no evidence that data centers led to more employment or incomes. There’s just no effect at all, which is not terribly surprising. After all, these are not complex buildings. Much of the value comes from purchased equipment, not the structure. Also, there’s very little labor used to operate them after they’ve been built.

This Texas study offers data center proponents little evidence to justify attracting them in the name of economic development. But there is one potential exception.

Large data centers — those over 100,000 square feet — did appear to influence professional and technical employment. The average effect was reasonably strong, but many places experienced no effect. This finding suggests some future benefits, but it is far from definitive. It is difficult to know precisely how these very large data centers would differ from smaller ones.

The likeliest explanation is that smaller data centers support cloud computing, while larger ones are used for artificial intelligence. The AI facilities might bring with them technicians and engineering or computing staff in larger numbers. That would be a hopeful sign for the local effect of data centers, but it is a very tentative hope.

One finding was very clear. Statewide tax incentives for data centers are unjustifiable. It shouldn’t take an economic study to determine this. Large fiscal incentives for businesses without an employment effect have always been an especially dubious venture.

There’s no real support for local incentives either. But, in the rare case when there are economic development benefits, it will be very localized. Again, there is low probability of these incentives ever paying off, but that should be a local choice, not something taxpayers across Texas (or Indiana) should bear.

It’s also worth noting that, as part of this study, I tested the effect of data centers on electricity prices and price changes for residential consumers from 2010-2023. Again, there was no evidence that data centers led to higher residential electricity prices.

Indeed, the share of the family budget Americans spend on electricity has never been smaller than it is today. Any claims that data centers are driving higher electricity prices likely fail on a number of facts, not least of which is that inflation-adjusted electricity prices are low by historical standards.

Of course, this study only evaluated jobs and electricity prices through 2023 or 2024. There could be changes in the future, so it is best to keep an open mind.

Despite these results, data centers are important to our economy today and will grow in importance as data storage and the computing power of AI becomes more critical to household, government and business applications.

The big takeaway from this research isn’t so much that data centers aren’t a local economic benefit. I think even a modicum of judgment would make that clear. The lesson is that the rush to attract the newest fad blinded legislators, economic developers and county and city councils across the country.

Take Indiana, for example. In the coming weeks, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. is set to release a data center study. It’s worth reiterating: Any study that doesn’t attempt to assess the causal effect of data centers on local employment, wages and other economic measures is probably useless.

The IEDC’s work is unlikely to use rigorous experimental design — we don’t yet have enough variation in the location and timing of Indiana’s data centers to make such analysis possible.

Yet, Indiana’s first attempt at analysis comes more than five years after the state effectively gave the farm away to any new data center that wanted to move here. It’s part of the collapse of judgment that accompanied economic development policy in 2019 and 2020.

That failure cost Hoosier taxpayers billions of dollars and has saddled the Braun administration with many difficult choices. It is a case study on poor oversight, mission creep and a culture of accommodation to any business request for tax relief. In short, a very costly mistake.

The data center lesson should be simple. Do your homework on economic effects, be reluctant to give special tax deals and don’t wait until there’s a taxpayer rebellion to perform due diligence. Those are evergreen policy recommendations.

The project was led by RPG Energy Group for one of the world’s top 100 industrial multinationals.

A pioneering project in manufacturing

The installed ORC system converts residual heat generated by manufacturing processes into usable electricity. The installation comes at a time when industrial companies are seeking to reduce operating costs amid constant pressure on margins. The project is described as one of the first of its kind to be fully operational in a U.S. manufacturing facility.

Clean Energy Technologies states that this technology enables the use of an often overlooked energy source in industrial processes. In this installation, previously wasted heat is now converted into electricity, thereby reducing dependence on external energy sources while increasing the site’s overall energy efficiency.

An industrial partnership overcoming integration challenges

The project was completed in partnership with RPG Energy Group, which provided development and integration services for the ORC solution. According to the companies, teams overcame several technical challenges associated with integrating this technology into the site’s existing infrastructure.

“The Martin project shows that industrial heat recovery is achievable at scale when properly managed,” said Jami Krynski, Chief Executive Officer of RPG Energy Group. Kam Mahdi, Chief Executive Officer of Clean Energy Technologies, stated that the system in place helps reduce energy costs while delivering a strategic advantage for manufacturers.

Towards replicability in the U.S. industrial sector

The Martin installation is viewed by the partner companies as a model that could be replicated at other industrial sites in the United States. RPG Energy Group indicated that this project may pave the way for further deployments at facilities seeking to enhance their energy performance without major modifications to their industrial processes.

Clean Energy Technologies believes that its Clean Cycle II™ technology can be adapted to a variety of industrial sites producing residual heat. The system may attract a wide range of industrial players facing the need to control energy spending in a constrained economic environment.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/en_114051055540-1.webp,N,,2025-10-05 21:59:04.785297

Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline and L.P.’s Quality Grades

Like the Value Grade, AAII’s A+ Investor Quality Grade comes from the percentile rank of key metrics. Specifically, the Quality Score is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of return on assets (ROA), return on invested capital (ROIC), gross profit relative to assets, buyback yield, change in total liabilities to assets, accruals, Z double prime bankruptcy risk (Z) score and the F-Score.

The score is variable, meaning it can consider all eight measures or, should any of the eight measures not be valid, the remaining measures that are valid. To be assigned a Quality Score, stocks must have a valid (non-null) measure and corresponding ranking for at least four of the eight quality measures.

The Quality Score is used to assess the underlying “quality” of a particular stock. A higher-quality stock possesses traits associated with upside potential and reduced downside risk. Backtesting of the Quality Grade shows that stocks with higher grades, on average, outperformed stocks with lower grades over the period of 1998 through 2019.

Stocks receive better grades (higher scores) for having higher scores for the quality subcomponents and worse grades (lower scores) for lower scores for the subcomponents.

Cheniere Energy, Inc. has a Quality Score of 81, which is Very Strong. Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. has a Quality Score of 60, which is Average.

The Quality Grade Winner: Cheniere Energy, Inc.

Other Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline and L.P. Grades

In addition to Momentum, Quality and Estimate Revisions, A+ Investor also provides grades for Value and Growth.

Growth investing builds on the idea that stocks of companies exhibiting strong, consistent and prolonged growth outperform those of slower-growth companies. AAII measures growth through consistency of annual sales growth, five-year sales growth rankings adjusted for extreme levels, and consistency of positive annual cash from operations.

Successful stock investing involves buying low and selling high, so stock valuation is an important consideration for stock selection. Buying stocks that are going to go up typically means buying stocks that are undervalued in the first place, although momentum investors may argue that point.

These 2 key factors, when combined with the above, provide a holistic view into a particular stock. Further, by joining A+ Investor you can see whether Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline and L.P. pass any of our 60+ stock screens that have outperformed the market since their creation.

First unveiled about two decades ago, community solar entails a small-scale solar model wherein customers purchase shares in a new solar farm in their service area, developers build the project then subscribers receive credits that cut their utility bills by ~10%. Community solar offers a viable solution to the roughly half of American households that are unable to install rooftop solar due to factors like roof shading, issues with property ownership or specific regulations. Further, these solar projects tend to offer friendlier contract terms for people with lower credit scores.

Unfortunately, the community solar boom could be over before it has even properly begun. A fresh report by global data, research, and consulting services provider, WoodMackenzie, has revealed that U.S. community solar installations dropped 36% year over year in the first half of the current year, with just 437 MW installed, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. OBBBA gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects, with the bill’s impact expected to get worse as the years roll on. WoodMac is now decidedly bearish on the sector, and expects community solar installations to contract 12% annually through 2030.

Wood Mackenzie does not see much upside in the sector, and has predicted that installations could exceed the forecast figure by 1.3 GW on favorable state policy while further tax credit complications could lower the outlook by 1.2 GW.

“The final bill offers a crucial four-year window for projects already under development to come online and secure the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), supporting near-term buildout,” Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told PV Magazine. “As of mid-2025, there are over 9 GW of community solar projects under development, with over 1.4 GW known to be under construction,” she added.

Wood Mackenzie has attributed this year’s big decline to falling volumes in New York and in Maine, after the former program was recently overhauled. New York alone is expected to contribute nearly 30% of the U.S. decline in community solar installations in 2025. The analysts have noted that Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey are also facing similar problems as they transition between program iterations, adding that multiple states have generally struggled to pass new legislation.

Solar Stocks Shine

Nevertheless, solar stocks have been defying the bearish sentiment pervading the clean energy sector. Back in July, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’, rolling back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. As widely expected, OBBBA is far from beautiful for various industries within the solar and wind energy sectors. However, the solar sector has continued to outperform, thanks in large part to robust U.S. and global solar demand as well as specific provisions within the OBBBA that favor solar manufacturing in the United States. The solar sector’s favorite benchmark, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), has comfortably outpaced its oil and gas peers, returning 40.5% in the year-to-date compared to 4.2% return by the oil and gas benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), and 14.8% gain by the S&P 500.

OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the companies heavily favored by OBBBA, with the stock up 33.6% YTD. UBS recently reiterated its Buy rating and hiked its price target on FSLR to $275 from $255, saying the company will receive a significant boost to the bottomline from OBBBA credits. According to UBS, the present value of 45X tax credits for the company is worth $75 per share, while the company is expected to grow net cash to $25 per share by the second quarter of 2026. UBS says its PT is conservative, pointing out that it did not factor in extra earnings when First Solar’s finishing factory comes online. First Solar's 3.5 GW per year manufacturing facility in Louisiana is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2025. This facility is part of First Solar's broader strategy to scale its American manufacturing footprint to over 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2025, according to Made in Alabama. The Louisiana factory, along with a new facility in Alabama, is are key component of this expansion.

Israel-based SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) leads the sector with YTD returns of 172.4%. Regarding regulatory changes under OBBBA, SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir says the company’s multi-year strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. will help it preserve 45X advanced manufacturing credits over the next 7 years.

Meanwhile, some residential solar companies are also defying bearish projections. California-based residential solar company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) has surged 107.8% YTD thanks to the company’s robust cost efficiencies as well as a record 70% storage attachment rate in its latest quarter. Sunrun installed a record 392 MWh of storage capacity during the second quarter, good for a 48% Y/Y increase, while solar capacity installations clocked in at 227 MW, up 18% Y/Y. Meanwhile, subscriber additions grew 15%, bringing the company’s total subscribers to 941,701 as of June 30.

New York alone is expected to contribute nearly 30% of the U.S. decline in community solar installations in 2025. The analysts have noted that Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey are also facing similar problems as they transition between program iterations, adding that multiple states have generally struggled to pass new legislation.

Solar Stocks Shine

Nevertheless, solar stocks have been defying the bearish sentiment pervading the clean energy sector. Back in July, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', rolling back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. As widely expected, OBBBA is far from beautiful for various industries within the solar and wind energy sectors. However, the solar sector has continued to outperform, thanks in large part to robust U.S. and global solar demand as well as specific provisions within the OBBBA that favor solar manufacturing in the United States. The solar sector's favorite benchmark, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), has comfortably outpaced its oil and gas peers, returning 40.5% in the year-to-date compared to 4.2% return by the oil and gas benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), and 14.8% gain by the S&P 500.

OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the companies heavily favored by OBBBA, with the stock up 33.6% YTD. UBS recently reiterated its Buy rating and hiked its price target on FSLR to $275 from $255, saying the company will receive a significant boost to the bottomline from OBBBA credits. According to UBS, the present value of 45X tax credits for the company is worth $75 per share, while the company is expected to grow net cash to $25 per share by the second quarter of 2026. UBS says its PT is conservative, pointing out that it did not factor in extra earnings when First Solar's finishing factory comes online. First Solar's 3.5 GW per year manufacturing facility in Louisiana is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2025. This facility is part of First Solar's broader strategy to scale its American manufacturing footprint to over 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2025, according to Made in Alabama. The Louisiana factory, along with a new facility in Alabama, is are key component of this expansion.

Israel-based SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) leads the sector with YTD returns of 172.4%. Regarding regulatory changes under OBBBA, SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir says the company's multi-year strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. will help it preserve 45X advanced manufacturing credits over the next 7 years.

Meanwhile, some residential solar companies are also defying bearish projections. California-based residential solar company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) has surged 107.8% YTD thanks to the company's robust cost efficiencies as well as a record 70% storage attachment rate in its latest quarter. Sunrun installed a record 392 MWh of storage capacity during the second quarter, good for a 48% Y/Y increase, while solar capacity installations clocked in at 227 MW, up 18% Y/Y. Meanwhile, subscriber additions grew 15%, bringing the company's total subscribers to 941,701 as of June 30.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said as the federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases expires on Sept. 30, he expects EV sales to plummet in the next month, but he said Ford is prepared to meet what he sees as the new demand: hybrids.

Farley, who spoke during a summit at Michigan Central Station in Detroit on Sept. 30, also outlined what Ford needs to do going forward to raise its stock price and become a world-class profit-maker as he reflected briefly on his five-year tenure at the helm of the company.

Farley made the comments during his summit called Ford Pro Accelerate: The Essential Economy. There, some 300 leaders convened at the station to talk about ways to accelerate productivity across what Farley dubs as the Essential Economy: industries like manufacturing, utilities, transportation, construction, and energy. Ford spent nearly $1 billion renovating Michigan Central Station and both Farley and Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford said none of it could have happened without skilled tradespeople doing the work.

Bill Ford said he hoped the daylong summit, which featured Roger Penske, owner of Penske Automotive Group, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, along with CEOs of various large corporations, including Union Pacific railroad and FedEx, would result in some new ideas on how to better attract and retain skilled tradespeople to manufacturing professions.

The future of EVs

In a discussion with David Westin, host of ""Bloomberg Wall Street Week,"" Farley was asked about the future of EVs as the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used EV expires.

""Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting and fast, they're efficient ... but they're expensive,"" Farley said. ""We think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be way smaller than we thought especially with the policy change to tailpipe emissions and the $7,500 going away.""

Ford is working to provide EV shoppers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31 to help with the transition off the federal tax credit incentive.

Farley told reporters that he expects there will be ""a period of time when we'll have to transition consumers out of the government's support. But as far as how long we do that, and how deep we do it, you know, we'll see.""

Farley said Ford's EV inventory is down given that the government set the Sept. 30 date for the tax credit expiration that all automakers built and sold down EV inventory toward. He said in a month, EVs sales will drop to 5% of the industry compared with 10% to 12% of the industry sales EVs are on pace for this month.

At that time, prices will probably go up, he said, ""which is also, you know, good, because right now they're artificially subsidized.""

Farley said Ford has learned that there are parts of electrification that customers find more interesting than Ford had initially thought they would.

""Plug-ins, special hybrids ... F-150 is now one-third hybrids, hybrid and F-150? Really? But now they can power your house for six days,"" Farley said. ""We think hybrids, EV plug-ins, E-REVs, those kinds of electrification, America's going to fall in love with and already is in love with.""

He said it means shifting Ford's product plans to make those hybrids in the factories that would have made EVs and that will require the work of skilled tradespeople in what he calls the Essential Economy.

For that reason, Farley is calling on federal, state and local government and community leaders to provide more vocational training and encouragement to recruit people into the skilled trades profession.

Making Ford a North Star company

On the sidelines of the event, Farley told reporters he's proud of the progress Ford has made as a company under his leadership, which is coming up on five years on Oct. 1.

""With restructuring, we got $1 billion of year-over-year costs down, which is a big deal. We've created a really good foundation as a company to create that North Star company that Ford really deserves, and it is going to take more work,"" Farley said. ""We need to get more capital efficient, we need to have higher margins than 4% or 5% and we need to be more resilient to economic cycles. To me, those three things are going to take a lot of work.""

Farley acknowledged one of his biggest challenges has been bringing down Ford's high number of recalls, which he called ""really difficult."" Ford leads the industry so far this year with 116 recalls, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Farley said getting Ford's quality improved was ""harder than I thought.""

""It took longer, it was deeper in the company,"" Farley said. ""There've been a lot of surprises but with a job like this ... I just didn't know where the surprises were, but I knew there'd be a few.""

Under Farley, Ford's stock price has risen close to 80% since he took over, which is good, but many analysts say it should be in the mid-teens to $20 range versus the $11 range it's in now. To buoy it will take getting Ford to be a North Star company, meaning a company that gets profits from a variety of revenue streams.

""We've got to work through a couple of these policy issues, and then that could be a big tailwind for the company,"" Farley said, alluding to President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""I don't think the market has understood the benefit of the EPA rule change and that's going to be big for our industry, for companies like Ford.""

Ford sells a lot of big trucks and SUVs so lowering environmental regulations will help it. Farley also said Ford has to get through Trump's tariffs on imported autos and auto parts, which are currently costing it an additional $2 billion in net costs.

""But we're working really hard with the Trump administration and that could be a tailwind,"" Farley said. ""But I think, longer term, people really want Ford Pro business to be what it could be, which is 30% of the profit of nonvehicle, we've never had that in the auto industry: That's parts, that's software.""

Farley said currently 17% of the profits from Ford Pro, which is the company's commercial vehicle business, come from parts and services and he believes it can hit 30% in two years.

Ford's success will also mean building out the ""emotional brands"" such as the Bronco SUV and Mustang muscle car to full lineups.

Finally, ""to take on the Chinese globally to prove that we can win against BYD in Australia and Thailand will be ... that's what the market's looking for.""

Other key points

Farley first addressed the essential economy in June during a discussion with biographer and historian Walter Isaacson (who wrote biographies about Steve Jobs and Elon Musk) at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

There he delivered a speech about appreciating the working class and why investment in the skilled trades is what he sees as the future of America.

Farley said on Sept. 30 that Ford hears from its Pro customers daily that ""they are suffering staffing issues"" and it is leading to a lack of productivity. He said Ford dealers are impacted, too, noting, ""This morning, there'll be 6,000 empty stalls in our dealerships with no technicians to work in them.""

He said he cannot stand people who just observe problems and it was time to bring together the best minds to solve the problems. Farley proposed on Sept. 30 that the solution to the problem is easing up permitting processes, spending more on vocational training and destigmatizing blue-collar work.

Farley said he had his epiphany during the UAW negotiations of 2023 when entry-level plant employees told him they had to work three jobs to make ends meet and ""the old timers were saying, 'It's no longer a career, Mr. Farley.' ""

Farley said while AI might take some white-collar jobs in the future, in the near term, the blue-collar jobs will be needed to build cars and factories.

As Ford targets profitability in its EV division by 2026, gemba could prove instrumental in identifying “waste” in battery production or software integration.","In the competitive world of automotive manufacturing, where electric vehicles are reshaping production lines and corporate strategies, Ford Motor Co.’s chief executive is turning to an unlikely source for inspiration: its Japanese rival, Toyota Motor Corp. Jim Farley, who has led Ford since 2020, has openly embraced a management philosophy known as “gemba,” a Japanese term that translates to “the real place” or “the actual spot.” This practice, deeply rooted in Toyota’s lean manufacturing ethos, emphasizes leaders physically visiting the sites where work happens—be it factory floors, dealerships, or even customer interactions—to observe problems firsthand and make informed decisions.

Farley, a former Toyota executive himself, credits this approach with helping him navigate Ford’s transition to an electric future. By going to the gemba, he says, executives avoid relying on abstract data or secondhand reports, instead gaining unfiltered insights into operational inefficiencies. For instance, Farley has recounted visiting Ford’s assembly plants to witness quality issues directly, which has informed cost-cutting measures and product redesigns amid the company’s push into EVs.

Adopting Rival Wisdom in Detroit

This adoption of gemba isn’t just a personal quirk; it’s part of a broader effort to modernize a 122-year-old American icon facing stiff competition from Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers. According to a recent article in Business Insider, Farley explained that “before you make a big decision, you have to go and see the real problem—where the waste is.” This hands-on method contrasts with traditional boardroom strategizing, echoing Toyota’s legendary Toyota Production System, which has long prioritized waste elimination and continuous improvement.

Industry analysts note that Farley’s strategy comes at a pivotal time. Ford has invested billions in EV development, including models like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, but has grappled with supply-chain disruptions and profitability challenges. By applying gemba, Farley aims to streamline processes, much like Toyota did to dominate hybrid technology decades ago. Reports from Yahoo Finance highlight how this practice is aiding Ford’s efforts to compete in the EV market, where rapid iteration and efficiency are key.

From Toyota Roots to Ford Revival

Farley’s background adds credibility to this cross-cultural borrowing. He spent 17 years at Toyota, rising through the ranks in marketing and product planning before joining Ford in 2007. This experience exposed him to gemba as a core principle, one that Toyota’s leaders, including current executives, continue to champion. A piece in AOL details how Farley is now instilling this mindset across Ford’s leadership, encouraging managers to leave their offices and engage directly with frontline workers.

The implications extend beyond Ford. As the auto sector grapples with electrification, supply shortages, and geopolitical tensions—such as tariffs that could favor Japanese imports—gemba offers a timeless tool for agility. Farley has even tied it to broader workforce issues, like the U.S. shortage of skilled tradespeople, as noted in related coverage from Business Insider, where he discussed encouraging his own son to take a blue-collar job to appreciate hands-on labor.

Challenges and Broader Industry Impact

Yet, implementing gemba isn’t without hurdles. Critics argue that in a globalized industry with remote work norms post-pandemic, physically “going to the gemba” can be logistically challenging for a company as vast as Ford, with operations spanning continents. Moreover, while Toyota has used it to maintain dominance in reliability and efficiency, Ford must adapt it to its own culture, which has historically emphasized bold innovation over incremental tweaks.

Looking ahead, Farley’s embrace of this Toyota tactic signals a humility rare in Detroit’s executive suites, potentially setting a precedent for other legacy automakers. As Ford targets profitability in its EV division by 2026, gemba could prove instrumental in identifying “waste” in battery production or software integration. Insights from BizToc suggest this approach is already yielding decisions that prioritize real-world problem-solving over theoretical models, positioning Ford to better rival not just Toyota, but the influx of nimble EV startups.

Both parties have something the other wants, but without ever working to reach an agreement with you, the seller hands you a contract far exceeding the original asking price, and says “sign here,” and if you don’t, they set the house on fire and blame you for arson.

This take-it-or-leave-it attitude is what led to the shutdown of the federal government when it ran out of money on Oct. 1.

Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and instead of working in a bipartisan way to avert a shutdown, they chose a strategy that guaranteed one. Shutdowns are harmful, costly, and disruptive. Because Republicans know that Democrats care deeply about our federal workforce and communities, they thought they could shove a contract in our face and force us to sign a blank check for Donald Trump.

There was no way I could support their partisan spending bill. I’d like to explain why and what else is at stake.

The House Republican strategy all year has been to “go it alone” because they control the House and have the majority required to pass laws and funding bills. The Republican majority in the Senate, however, needs a handful of Democratic votes to pass a Continuing Resolution to fund the government because of the filibuster. Instead of collaborating with Democrats to pass a short-term bill that both parties could agree to, Senate Republicans pushed the contract across the table to Senate Democrats and said, “sign here.”

This impasse is about your health care and about Trump following the law.

For months, Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the health care crisis Republicans created when they slashed funding for Medicaid. It’s about to get worse with the expiration of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits that make health insurance affordable for millions of Americans. Without those tax credits, many Americans who buy their health insurance through the ACA won’t be able to afford coverage. Those tax credits expire at the end of the year unless Congress acts quickly to renew them.

In Texas, renewal notices will soon go out, and if allowed to expire, 92,000 El Pasoans will see their premiums skyrocket, and half will lose their health care altogether. Data provided by the House Budget Committeeshows that in El Paso, for a family of four earning $129,800, their premiums will increase by $9,073 (86%). A family of four earning $64,000 a year will see their premiums increase by $2,571 (263%), and for a 60 year-old couple earning $82,800 a year, their annual premiums will increase by $17,290 (265%).

Congress can prevent this. Americans are already paying more for groceries because of Trump tariffs and higher utility costs because of Trump and Republicans’ cancellation of clean energy subsidies. Layer that on top of these soon-to-be soaring insurance costs and millions of Americans — including thousands of El Pasoans — will be plunged further into economic crisis.

This will create real suffering for people in our community. Cancer patients, expectant moms, people with chronic health conditions will lose their insurance because they can’t afford it, and it will be nearly impossible for them to access the health care they need.

Republicans continue to spread the lie that Democrats are fighting for free health care for undocumented people. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and they are also ineligible for Medicaid, Medicare and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

Secondly, Democrats want language in the funding to require Trump to follow the law and administer the funds as Congress directed. He cannot simply end programs, move money or fire people as he has been doing. As one of my Republicans colleagues, Rep. Steve Womack said: “If you’re a Democrat — even just like a mainstream Democrat — your predisposition might be to help negotiate with Republicans on a funding mechanism. Why would you do that if you know that whatever you negotiate is going to be subject to the knife pulled out by Russ Vought?” (Vought is Trump’s Office of Management and Budget Director, and author of Project 2025).

These are not normal times. Normally, both sides come together to agree on a bill and avoid a shutdown. That didn’t happen, and it needs to immediately.

None of this makes the pain of a shutdown easier, and my team and I worked to create a resource page for the public and federal employees with information we hope is helpful. Among the resources are zero-interest loans to furloughed federal employees through many of our local credit unions, as well as resources from utility companies. Our offices in El Paso and Washington will remain open to help constituents with federal agencies and other issues that arise during a shutdown. To view my full resource page, please visit escobar.house.gov/shutdown.

It is my hope that Republicans recognize that Americans are hurting, the economy is not doing well, and forcing Americans off their health care will exacerbate the economic crisis hard-working citizens are living through. And I hope those Republicans who privately complain about Trump’s illegal funding cuts will find the courage to stand up with us for the constitution.

Republicans control all of government, and their “go-it-alone” strategy is not appropriate. It’s time for bipartisan compromise.

The specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill.
After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day.
The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.
Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities.","The Trump administration is canceling about $8 billion in grants for energy projects in mostly Democratic-led states — but is allowing funding to continue for similar projects in states that voted for Trump.

The canceled grants, which were first announced last week by the Office of Management and Budget’s director, Russell Vought, don’t total anywhere close to all of the energy investments made by the Biden administration, which Vought called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

For now, energy project money appears to be continuing to flow to companies and institutions located in red and swing states, even though the work these institutions are doing is very similar to the work that was cut, according to a NOTUS analysis of hundreds of projects across the country, including the latest cancellations.

For example, the administration canceled $460 million in funding for the Democrat-led state of Minnesota to build much-needed interregional transmission lines (power lines that connect the country’s separated parts of the grid).

It left in place a $700 million grant from the same program that will connect the Eastern and Western U.S. grids in Montana, a state that voted for Trump and is led by Republicans.

The administration also canceled funding to improve the resilience of the power grid in Hawaii from wildfires and other extreme weather, as well as $40 million in funding for a project to build a resilient backup microgrid for Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and the island of Oahu.

It did not cut the $160 million that was awarded in the same funding round from the same program for Georgia Power to make the state’s electric grid more resilient.

And of the 17 projects the Department of Energy awarded for battery recycling and reprocessing innovations, the list of cuts included just three: one in Colorado and two in California.

There’s no obvious difference between those three projects and the remaining 14 that appear to still be funded, beyond the fact that some of the others are located at national labs or in states that either voted for Trump or are led by Republicans, like Utah, Virginia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

And while the administration canceled billions in funding for hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, hubs that touch states including Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Indiana appear fine for now.

The specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill. There is discussion on the Hill between some Democrats and Republicans in the states affected by the cuts about pushing for a restoration of the funds as part of a deal to end the shutdown, one source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested as much to Fox News last week when asked about the program cuts.

“Pass the clean, continuing resolution and all of this goes away,” she said, directed at Democrats.

But just hours later, Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested that a reversal of the cuts was not on the table. In an interview on CNN on Thursday night, he said that the decision to cancel the funding had nothing to do with the shutdown.

When asked about why the affected projects were all in states that voted for Kamala Harris last November, Wright denied that the administration was targeting Democrats and said that more cancellations were coming down the pipe — including in red states. “This is a partial list of an ongoing process. More project announcements will come,” he said.

The Trump administration’s announcement sowed confusion for the companies and states affected. After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day. Some local authorities said they have still not received official notice from the DOE, including the state of Colorado and the California Energy Commission.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said he had lunch with Energy Secretary Chris Wright “minutes before” the cancellations were announced, but received no warning.

“He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included 10 projects in my state, projects that affect real jobs and real families,” Heinrich said in a statement. “That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions.”

The grant cancellations span projects aimed to improve electrical grid infrastructure, innovate on battery recycling, create new forms of energy storage, lower buildings’ energy usage and advance hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Many of the projects would carry benefits and jobs outside of the states they are based in, especially those that would affect the resilience and performance of the nation’s aging electric grid.

A number of recipients are losing multiple projects, including some institutions whose goals could serve the Trump administration’s interests. GTI Energy, which is focused on modernizing the natural gas industry, lost 13 grants. Both GE Vernova, a maker of wind and gas turbines, and the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit electricity research organization, lost 11. The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.

Many of the projects on this list have already begun operations, which means the money that has been distributed for these projects so far will be wasted if operations halt, another source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

Lindsay VanLaningham, a spokesperson for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a community-owned electric utility, said in a statement to NOTUS that as of Thursday evening, the DOE had not yet notified them of any changes to their grant, which funds “a portion of a project already in flight.”

Some of the canceled awards are listed by the Energy Department as targeting blue states, but the impacted projects themselves are located in red states. For instance, a $19.7 million federal award to IBM related to methane emissions research is categorized under awards cancelled to entities New York — but a description of the project published in 2024 said it will be carried out entirely in Western states that voted for Trump, including Utah, Montana and Alaska.

There are more areas for confusion: The list of cancellations includes some, but not all, grants that the DOE first announced in May that it was canceling, primarily for clean energy industrial demonstrations.

And some of the affected entities are getting information that conflicts with the DOE news release. The department says entities have 30 days to appeal the cancellations, but one affected group told NOTUS their instructions say they have only 10 days to appeal.

Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities. For example, the administration has issued executive orders and memos emphasizing the importance of mineral development and extraction in the United States. Recycling used batteries is one way to increase the availability of minerals and metals like lithium, but three of the grants in that program have been axed.

Some companies have confirmed with NOTUS that they are now receiving cancellation notices. Those include Smartville, a Carlsbad, California-based company that was building a long-duration battery storage project, and Sublime Systems, which was originally told in May its grants had been cancelled and has been in the appeals process since then.

“Regardless of the political fighting in Washington, D.C., hydrogen remains a viable product for energy dominance and represents a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars that generates millions of jobs. While we are disappointed in the Department of Energy’s decision to cut funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, there is still immense opportunity for our region to finish what we started,” a spokesperson for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen hub said.

Tags: climate change, pollution,","PITTSFIELD, Mass. — Climate activists are demanding that top polluters pay for their impact on the environment.

In late September, community members and elected officials gathered at the Westside Riverway Park for a ""Bridges to the Future"" event, featuring state Sen. Paul Mark, state Rep. Tricia Farley-Bouvier, and grassroots organizations from across the region.

""We're here to meet and learn about the awesome work that incredible change makers in this community are already doing to not only educate community members about the impacts of climate change, but are also doing the necessary work on the ground to help keep our communities safe from what is currently happening and what will only get worse,"" said Rachael Boyce, co-lead of the Massachusetts Make Polluter's Pay campaign.

""Especially in the face of the federal government that is withdrawing funds that are meant to keep our communities safe.""

The Climate Change Superfund bill, or the Make Polluters Pay, would require the worst carbon emitters to pay for climate-related damages through a superfund. This is expected to generate billions of dollars over 25 years to be spent on projects that protect communities from the effects of climate change.

""As we have this political chaos at the federal level. This is a great reminder that we have a tremendous amount of power to enact real change on the local level,"" Boyce said.

""It does not matter who is in the White House.""

She explained that there is not nearly enough money for the work that needs to be done, and policy solutions that have come forward ultimately fall on the taxpayer. Make Polluters Pay intends to fill the gap between resilience, adaptation, and mitigation work being done now and what needs to be done in the future.

""These are the world's top fossil fuel companies that have made trillions off the extraction and exploitation of our environment, and we are paying to clean up their mess,"" Boyce said.

""They will pay into this fund. It will cover, we're thinking, at minimum, $75 billion over the next 25 years to pay for climate adaptation and mitigation projects across the state, to help bolster the work that is already happening in your communities, as you're about to hear about today.""

There were presentations from the Berkshire Environmental Action Team's Breathe Easy Berkshires air quality monitoring program, Greenagers environmental stewardship program, the Housatonic Valley Association, and 350 Mass Berkshire Node, and Sunrise Movement activists from Smith College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

""One of the problems with fossil fuel pollution, that we're finding is the most prevalent, whether it's from vehicles or from things like power plants, is particulate matter,"" Rosemary Wessel, of BEAT, explained while detailing the Breathe Easy Berkshires air quality monitoring program being conducted in Pittsfield.

""Particulate Matter is little specks of material that come when you burn fossil fuels, and there's this one type called PM 2.5, it's actually 2.5 microns, and that's small enough that it can get into the nasal passages, down into the lungs, and into the bloodstream. So it not only affects your lungs, but it can get into the bloodstream and get to other organs, and it starts to have some real consequences, especially over time. It's just a fraction of the width of a human hair.""

Erik Reardon, of the Housatonic Valley Association, pointed to the $20 million removal of the Bel Air Dam as an example of the price tag on climate resilience projects. He also cited the 2023 torrential flooding in North Adams that caused more than $4 million in damage to upwards of 20 streets and roads.

He cautioned, ""Flooding isn't just a distant worry. It's happening here in Berkshire County, and it's happening with increasing frequency.""

""Unfortunately, part of what makes the Berkshire so special also tends to make us uniquely vulnerable in our geography, our topography. We have steep hillsides of the Taconic mountains to our west, with the Berkshire hills to our east,"" Reardon explained.

""During major storm events, these headwater streams rise, they fill up, they flow down into valley bottoms, where a lot of our towns and communities are located, and we've been, for about two centuries, meddling with the course of rivers as well. We've been straightening them. We've been disconnecting them from their floodplains. That tends to make them less resilient, less able to naturally store and absorb flood water, and so much of our infrastructure, our roads, our culverts, our dams, were built for storms of the past. They are not ready for the climate reality that we know we are facing today.""

He pointed to nature-based solutions such as reconnecting floodplains, stabilizing river dams, and keeping culverts and bridges in good shape. While partnering with local towns, HVA has found that a new, 10-foot culvert costs around $800,000.

Legislators pushed for homegrown solutions in Massachusetts, citing federal uncertainties.

Mark said the idea now is to invest in the next four to eight years, ""invest in ourselves, invest in our future, and invest in our sustainability.""

""The federal government has abdicated its responsibility to pretty much everything, but certainly to progress in the environmental sector and in sustainability and green jobs and renewable energy. And it's a problem, and it's probably a bigger problem than we all realize,"" he said, explaining that the best-case scenario the United States can hope for is that more climate-friendly candidates win seats in Congress next year.

""... The best we can hope for is three years of less harm happening, because nobody federally is going to be helping us at all. And so the problem with that is, assuming this administration does end in four years and someone more committed to our future and our green renewable future takes office, they're still going to have a lot of work to do to get us back on track so we've been set back at least six to 12 years, and we have to think seriously about what that means all of us as a community, and then all of us in state government specifically.""

In Massachusetts, if the federal government is no longer a reliable partner, Mark said that doesn't mean the commonwealth will give in or give up. He explained that Massachusetts knows what it cares about from a philosophical, political, and ideological point of view, and how to have a healthy, green, sustainable state.

""Over the last couple of years, we have seen so often climate events that have become more and more frequent happening, and they're happening here in Western Massachusetts, where most of the communities I represent do not have the resources on their own to make a difference, to make an impact without significant help,"" he said.

""So the more we can do as a commonwealth, as a state of Massachusetts, to take ownership on our own and make sure we're doing the right thing, the more important it can be.""

He cited Pittsfield's pollution from General Electric's former presence as a classic example of why the Climate Superfund is important.

""They took what they wanted, they polluted what they wanted, and they left. And there's been some recourse, and there's been some ability to hold them accountable, but for the most part, we've been on our own,"" Mark said.

""We can't allow that to happen. We need the people that are causing this, the organizations that are causing this, to be partners into the short, medium, and long term, on helping make sure that we are able to sustain our own infrastructure, our own future, and our own energy future as well.""

He has been working on legislation to establish a Green Bank so there is funding available for renewable projects.

Farley-Bouvier added, ""We're pretty sick and tired of having people make bajillions of dollars and then we have to clean up their messes, and that's what this bill does,"" speaking about the Make Polluters Pay bill.

She pointed to increasing environmental disasters and extreme weather events happening as a result of climate change, explaining that people have profited from causing it.

""And so this is something that we are doing to reduce it,"" she said.

""We are not relying on the federal government to send us those dollars to do it, but we're we have homegrown solutions here in Massachusetts, so for that, that's why this bill does make a lot of sense.""

The event was hosted by the Make Polluters Pay campaign, in partnership with BEAT, 350 Mass Berkshire Node, Housatonic Valley Association, and Food & Water Watch.

A Celebration of Life will be held on Sunday, November 2 at 2:00 pm at the Armitage Educational Center located in the Kansas University Field Station. All who knew and loved Ed are encouraged to attend.

Ed was the retired Director of KU's Biological Survey and Professor of Biology. In his capacity as Director, he provided excellent leadership and support to many scientists focused on ecological research on environmental problems. Ed gave expertise in places around the world including University of New England in Australia. Nationally in the USA he worked at NASA and the US Environmental Protection Agency. In Kansas, he served as President of the Entomological Society and the Kansas Water Authority. At KU, he served on 20 committees. He would be most pleased and remembered for the contribution he made to bringing the Field Station to maturity. It is now open to the public and does amazing programming for all ages but especially schoolchildren.

Ed was the Primary Investigator and author of over 100 research grants that provided KU and the State of Kansas with over twenty-one million dollars. He also had over 100 presentations and written articles. Many of these were about his interest and expertise in remote sensing in agriculture and preservation of natural resources. Ed was the recipient of many awards for his contributions to various professional endeavors.

Ed was born in August 1945 in Colorado Springs. His boyhood and K-12 education were spent there, graduating from Wasson High School. While growing up he enjoyed singing in various choirs and playing the accordion. And won prizes for his accordion playing. Upon graduating from Wasson High, Ed decided to exchange his home in the mountains for the Flint Hills of Kansas. He used his Merit Scholarship to attend College of Emporia, a small Presbyterian liberal arts school. He majored in biology and was also active in singing, travelling around the country with the C of E Chorale. Four years later he returned to his home state, to work on a master's degree in biology at University of Colorado. After receiving his MS degree, he received a graduate fellowship to begin work on a doctorate in biology at KU. Soon, he received his Ph.D. in Biology and began a lifelong academic career at the University of Kansas.

On May 28, 1977, a day he considered ‘the best day of my life’ he married Nancy Hale, a Lawrence native. They remained a ‘dynamic duo minus the capes’ travelling the world together until Nancy's death in 2021. They had many friends in Lawrence. They had very special friends, Paul and Stacey in Kentucky, Bob and Alice, as well as Jerry and Gwen in Tennessee who will miss Ed. He is survived by a sister, Patricia, Nephew Joe and Niece Julie, and Nancy's brother Ken.

The incident was one of the most perilous events in the refinery’s 114-year history, adding to a long list of environmental and safety violations, according to public records reviewed by The Times.
But, for the Chevron refinery explosion, there is no guarantee such an investigation will take place.
The Trump administration proposed eliminating the budget for the Chemical Safety Board this fiscal year, starting Oct. 1, sunsetting the 27-year-old federal agency.
OSHA records show the agency conducted at least 15 inspections at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo over the last decade, identifying 17 violations.","The explosion and hours-long fire at Chevron’s refinery Thursday night in El Segundo deeply unnerved communities in the South Bay.

The blast sent shock waves throughout the refinery grounds, allegedly injuring at least one worker, and jolting residents as far as a mile away. A 100-foot-tall pillar of fire cast an orange glow over the night sky. And towering plumes of smoke and acrid odors drifted eastward with the onshore winds.

While local regulators are investigating the fire, environmental advocates lament that federal safety agencies likely won’t be joining in the effort to find the cause of Thursday’s explosion — perhaps preventing similar hazardous chemical releases in the future. The incident was one of the most perilous events in the refinery’s 114-year history, adding to a long list of environmental and safety violations, according to public records reviewed by The Times.

Most staff at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency tasked with investigating workplace safety, is not working because of the ongoing federal shutdown. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board, which determines root causes from dangerous chemical releases, is also furloughed and could lose its funding because of proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration.

“The Trump administration has defunded the Chemical Safety board, and the federal government is shut down right now,” said Joe Lyou, a resident of nearby Hawthorne and president of the Coalition for Clean Air, a statewide nonprofit. “So there is a very good possibility we are never going to know what really caused this, because the experts in figuring this stuff out are no longer there to do that.”

Without clear answers, labor unions are fearful that a similar disaster could endanger thousands of workers at California’s 15 refineries, which are mostly clustered in Southern California and the Bay Area.

“Companies are making billions in profits and still are making it nearly impossible to make sure we’re safe from terrible disasters,” said Joe Uehlein, board president of the Labor Network for Sustainability. “In California, we’ve seen horrific injuries to workers and tens of thousands of residents have had to seek medical attention in refinery accidents. This time, we got lucky.”

The Chemical Safety Board has identified causes of scores of refinery incidents over its history, including the 2015 explosion at the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance that injured at least two workers.

In that incident, the board’s investigation found multiple safety failures, including a severely eroded safety valve that allowed flammable gases to dangerously seep into unwanted areas. The board also discovered that a large piece of debris almost struck a tank of hydrofluoric acid, which could have resulted in a deadly release of the highly toxic chemical, leading to pressure to cease using the chemical.

But, for the Chevron refinery explosion, there is no guarantee such an investigation will take place. The Trump administration proposed eliminating the budget for the Chemical Safety Board this fiscal year, starting Oct. 1, sunsetting the 27-year-old federal agency. Environmental advocates say that is a mistake.

“They’re undermining our ability to prevent these accidents by taking away the accountability mechanisms in the federal government,” said Lyou. “That’s a huge concern. It’s not politics. Democrats and Republicans live around the Chevron refinery, and they both want to make sure that the refinery is operating safely.”

In the absence of federal regulators, the South Coast Air Quality Management District is investigating potential violations of air quality rules and permit conditions. The refinery will also be required to submit a report analyzing potential causes and equipment breakdowns within 30 days.

So far, the air district has said the fire originated in the refinery’s ISOMAX hydocracking unit, which uses hydrogen to refine oil into jet fuel and diesel. The refinery’s air monitors detected a spike in airborne chemicals after the fire broke out, but air district officials say conditions returned to normal levels after a few hours.

Environmental advocates say the extent of the fallout may not be known until there is a larger examination of air quality monitors.

“I was very surprised that the air district reported they weren’t seeing terribly high levels of pollution,” said Julia May, senior scientist for California-based nonprofit Communities for a Better Environment. “Sometimes in a big refinery fire like this, it goes straight up. But then the smoke comes down in other areas. And that’s a lot of pollution that’s going someplace.”

The Chevron facility had been cited numerous times for environmental and safety violations, according to local and federal records.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District has issued 13 notices of violations over the last 12 months, and 46 in the last five years. Most recently, on Sept. 22, the air district cited the facility for a large chemical leak and failing to keep its equipment in proper working condition.

In August, Chevron representatives had also asked the air district for leniency in assessing compliance with air quality rules while it was working to remove unwanted buildup inside its furnace tubes — conditions that they said risked equipment overheating and potentially failing.

OSHA records show the agency conducted at least 15 inspections at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo over the last decade, identifying 17 violations.

In September 2023, OSHA issued citations related to heat illness prevention requirements, ladderway guardrails and a failure to conduct a thorough hazard analysis — an internal assessment intended to control fires, explosions and chemical releases.

In October 2022, after conducting a planned inspection of the Chevron refinery, OSHA records show the agency identified a “serious” violation of an agency standard requiring employers to “develop, implement and maintain safe work practices to prevent or control hazards,” such as leaks, spills, releases and discharges; and control over entry into hazardous work areas.

During the government shutdown, it’s unclear if OSHA’s pared-down staff will be investigating Thursday’s refinery fire. An OSHA media office phone number went straight to a recorded message stating that the line is not being monitored and “due to a loss of funding, certain government activities have been suspended and I’m unable to respond to your message at this time.”

For some environmentalists, the Chevron refinery fire has underscored why it’s necessary to transition away from fossil fuels altogether.

“They [the refineries] have great workers and great fire departments to respond, but this is an inherently dangerous operation that handles hundreds of thousands of barrels per day of flammable explosive materials under high temperature and high pressure,” said May, the senior scientist for Communities for a Better Environment.

“When something goes wrong, you can have a runaway fire. They did a great job at getting it under control. But do we really want antiquated dirty energy in our communities?”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/577dcda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5272x2768+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F46%2F01%2Ff7e28ed14433b1d3a9392ee4ca8b%2F1524698-me-chevron-refinery-fire-drone-ajs-25.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 17:59:19.637489

Are You Working on Solar Innovation or Clean Energy Access? Join us to receive updates.

The Importance of Renewable Energy in Addressing Climate Change

Renewable energy is at the forefront of the global fight against climate change. Unlike fossil fuels, which release significant amounts of greenhouse gases when burned, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power produce little to no emissions during operation. This fundamental difference makes them essential in reducing the carbon footprint of energy production.

As countries around the world commit to ambitious climate goals, transitioning to renewable energy is not just beneficial; it is imperative. Moreover, renewable energy contributes to energy security and independence. By harnessing local resources, countries can reduce their reliance on imported fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile market fluctuations and geopolitical tensions.

This shift not only stabilizes energy prices but also fosters economic resilience. The integration of renewable energy into national grids can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and promote technological innovation, making it a multifaceted solution to both environmental and economic challenges.

Criteria for Eligibility and Application Process for Global Grants

Navigating the world of global grants can be daunting for many organizations. Each grant program has its own set of eligibility criteria, which typically include factors such as project scope, geographical focus, and organizational capacity. Generally, applicants must demonstrate a clear understanding of their project’s objectives, potential impact, and sustainability.

Additionally, many grantors prioritize projects that involve collaboration with local communities or stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity in renewable energy initiatives. The application process itself often requires a detailed proposal outlining the project’s goals, methodologies, budget, and expected outcomes. Successful applicants usually provide evidence of prior experience in managing similar projects or demonstrate a strong partnership with established organizations in the field.

To enhance their chances of success, applicants should invest time in researching the specific requirements of each grant program and tailoring their proposals accordingly. Engaging with previous recipients or attending workshops can also provide valuable insights into crafting compelling applications.

Case Studies of Successful Renewable Energy Projects Funded by Global Grants

Examining successful case studies can provide inspiration and practical insights for organizations seeking global grants for renewable energy projects. One notable example is the Solar Sister initiative in Africa, which empowers women entrepreneurs to distribute solar energy solutions in their communities. Funded by various global grants, Solar Sister has not only provided access to clean energy but has also created economic opportunities for women, demonstrating the intersection of gender equity and renewable energy.

Another compelling case is the Wind for Prosperity project in Kenya, which aimed to provide affordable electricity to rural communities through wind power. Supported by international grants, this initiative successfully installed wind turbines that generated clean energy for schools and health facilities. The project not only improved access to electricity but also enhanced educational outcomes and healthcare services in the region.

These examples illustrate how global grants can facilitate transformative projects that address both energy needs and social challenges.

Available Resources and Support for Applicants of Global Grants

For organizations looking to apply for global grants in renewable energy innovation, numerous resources are available to assist them throughout the process. Online platforms such as GrantWatch and Foundation Center provide comprehensive databases of available grants, including eligibility criteria and application deadlines. Additionally, many governments and international organizations offer workshops and webinars aimed at educating potential applicants about grant writing and project development.

Networking with other NGOs and stakeholders in the renewable energy sector can also yield valuable support. Collaborative platforms like the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) foster connections among organizations working on similar initiatives. By sharing experiences and best practices, applicants can enhance their proposals and increase their chances of securing funding.

The Impact of Renewable Energy Innovation on Local Communities and Economies

The impact of renewable energy innovation extends far beyond environmental benefits; it has profound implications for local communities and economies as well. Access to clean energy can significantly improve quality of life by providing reliable electricity for homes, schools, and businesses. In rural areas where traditional energy sources may be scarce or unreliable, renewable energy solutions can empower communities by enabling access to modern amenities such as lighting, refrigeration, and communication technologies.

Economically, renewable energy projects can create jobs across various sectors—from manufacturing solar panels to installing wind turbines. These jobs often provide stable employment opportunities in regions that may have limited economic prospects. Furthermore, by reducing energy costs through local production of renewable resources, communities can redirect funds towards education, healthcare, and other essential services, fostering overall development.

Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing Renewable Energy Projects

While the potential benefits of renewable energy projects are substantial, challenges remain in their implementation. One significant hurdle is securing adequate funding to cover initial capital costs. Many renewable technologies require substantial upfront investment before they can generate returns.

This financial barrier can deter potential investors or limit the scope of projects. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation. For instance, innovative financing models such as pay-as-you-go solar systems have emerged as effective solutions for low-income households in developing countries.

By allowing users to pay for solar power incrementally rather than upfront, these models make clean energy more accessible while ensuring a steady revenue stream for providers. Additionally, fostering public-private partnerships can leverage resources from both sectors to overcome financial constraints and drive project success.

Collaboration and Partnerships in Renewable Energy Innovation

Collaboration is a cornerstone of successful renewable energy initiatives. By forming partnerships with local governments, businesses, NGOs, and community organizations, project developers can enhance their impact and sustainability. Collaborative efforts often lead to shared resources, knowledge exchange, and increased community buy-in—essential elements for the long-term success of any renewable energy project.

For example, the partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and local governments in various countries has led to successful implementation of solar microgrid projects that empower rural communities. These collaborations not only provide technical expertise but also ensure that projects align with local needs and priorities. By fostering a sense of ownership among community members through participatory approaches, these partnerships enhance the likelihood of project sustainability.

The Role of Technology and Research in Advancing Renewable Energy Solutions

Technological advancements play a pivotal role in driving innovation within the renewable energy sector. Research institutions and universities are at the forefront of developing new technologies that improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with renewable energy production. For instance, breakthroughs in battery storage technology have made it possible to store excess solar or wind energy for use during periods of low generation.

Moreover, ongoing research into alternative materials for solar panels or more efficient wind turbine designs continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in renewable energy generation. By investing in research and development (R&D), organizations can stay ahead of industry trends and position themselves as leaders in the field. Collaborating with academic institutions or participating in research consortia can further enhance access to cutting-edge technologies and methodologies.

Best Practices and Lessons Learned from Previous Global Grant Recipients

Learning from the experiences of previous global grant recipients can provide invaluable insights for new applicants. One key lesson is the importance of thorough project planning and stakeholder engagement from the outset. Successful projects often begin with comprehensive needs assessments that involve input from community members and local leaders to ensure alignment with their priorities.

Additionally, maintaining transparency throughout the project lifecycle fosters trust among stakeholders and enhances accountability. Regular communication about progress, challenges faced, and lessons learned can help build strong relationships with funders and community members alike. Finally, documenting successes and challenges allows organizations to refine their approaches over time and share valuable insights with others in the field.

Future Trends and Opportunities in Renewable Energy Innovation and Funding

As we look ahead to the future of renewable energy innovation and funding opportunities, several trends are emerging that could shape the landscape significantly. The increasing urgency of climate action is driving governments and private investors alike to prioritize funding for clean energy projects. This trend is likely to continue as more countries commit to net-zero emissions targets.

Additionally, advancements in digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are poised to revolutionize how renewable energy systems operate and are financed. For instance, AI can optimize energy consumption patterns while blockchain technology can facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading among consumers.

In 2023, truck manufacturers struck a deal with the California Air Resources Board to drastically reduce emissions and invest in electric trucks. This summer, however, several of the companies — Daimler Truck, Volvo Group, Paccar and Traton — backed out of the partnership and sued California, with support from the Trump administration. Now fossil-fuel-aligned corporations are leveraging political connections to weaken oversight, erode environmental protections and entrench their dominance.

This is no longer just about truck emissions. It’s about who gets to write the rules that govern our economy and who gets to decide how polluted our state will be. It’s about defending democracy from corporate overreach.

Likely seeing an opportunity to profit from diesel under new federal leadership, the major truck manufacturers doing business in California are injecting instability into the very market they once sought to stabilize. This is political opportunism, plain and simple.

The 2023 deal, known as the Clean Truck Partnership, was rooted in trust and a shared interest in predictable, stable rules during the transition away from fossil fuels. It wasn’t a regulation or a law; it was a collaboration — an experiment in handshake agreements that now looks like a cautionary tale for regulators and communities everywhere: Corporations can walk away from deals like this the moment political winds shift or the quarterly earnings dip.

The manufacturers’ gratuitous lawsuit comes alongside a proposed rollback of the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas standards and a surprise Federal Trade Commission move to condemn the partnership. The commission issued a statement closing an investigation it never publicly announced, after the companies sent letters playing victim. Is it any surprise that Trump’s federal lawyers jumped in days later to sue California along with the truck makers?

The consequences of breaking the agreement are real and devastating. Diesel freight pollution has long hit hardest in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color near ports, warehouses and freight corridors, causing higher rates of asthma, heart disease and cancer. Rolling back the Clean Truck Partnership means more diesel trucks on California roads, more hospital visits and more lives cut short. It’s an assault on environmental justice that tells Californians their health is expendable.

And everyone pays. Delaying clean truck adoption locks fleets into high and volatile diesel prices and undermines U.S. competitiveness. The manufacturers themselves are maintaining that crisis by discouraging the shift to electric trucks: California has documented a $94,000 markup on some electric trucks in the U.S. compared with Europe.

When a handful of corporations can derail public policy this way, states must push back. California tried a compromise; now it must defend its right to set stronger standards, invest in clean infrastructure and refuse to subsidize companies that break their commitments.

California’s leadership on clean transportation has helped it become the world’s fourth-largest economy. Its authority to set its own standards has driven innovation, created jobs and put more zero-emission vehicles on the road than in any other state. The public wants clean air and modern infrastructure. The choice is clear: double down on clean truck commitments or cede leadership to China and watch our industries and economy fall behind.

A predictable market is essential for corporate investment in the energy transition. California brokered this partnership to give manufacturers the certainty they said they needed and say they still need. Now some of those same manufacturers are adding uncertainty by trying to revert to older standards and delay the transition. But it must come, and the sooner the better — for manufacturers, Californians and the nation.

There’s still time to do the right thing. The truck makers who broke their word can still step up to electrify trucks. And the manufacturers who have not joined the lawsuit against California — Cummins, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — should publicly reaffirm the goals of the Clean Truck Partnership, follow through on their commitments and reap the rewards. If these companies choose to stand with California now, they won’t just be honoring a promise; they’ll be helping build an economy that creates good jobs, drives innovation and secures a competitive future for American freight.

She’s concerned about how the rise of data centers will impact the coal industry and prolong its existence.","Although Ashley Williams is disappointed to see a federal agency endorse the nation’s coal industry, she isn’t surprised.

“It’s just environmentally and economically reckless to resuscitate a dying industry,” said Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “It’s a disservice to every worker, every coal-impacted resident out there. … (The government) should support coal-impacted communities to be able to transition to the next stage beyond fossil fuels.”

The U.S. Department of Energy, in a Monday news release, announced that it’s investing $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” coal plants nationwide.

Indiana environmental activists worry about what this means for the future of renewable energy statewide, especially with the rise of data centers.

The DOE’s funding is in accordance with two executive orders from President Donald Trump, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” and “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electrical Grid,” according to the news release.

“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the (artificial intelligence) race,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the news release. “These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption. Coal built the greatest industrial engine the world has ever known, and with President Trump’s leadership, it will help do so again.”

Through funding, the DOE will allocate $350 million for coal recommissioning and retrofit; $175 million for rural capacity and energy affordability projects; $50 million for the development and implementation of advanced wastewater management systems; $25 million for engineering and implementation of dual firing retrofits; and $25 million for the development and testing of natural gas cofiring systems, according to the department’s website.

In April, the DOE announced it would “unleash American coal production,” including assessing accessibility of federal lands to “expedite coal leasing and lift barriers to coal mining on federal lands.”

Williams called the actions by the agency a “ridiculous and insulting use of taxpayer dollars.”

“I think this is really a despicable distraction,” she added. “It’s using this dying industry to prop up big tech and the proliferation of hyperscale data centers across Indiana, especially in this region.”

In September, the Michigan City Common Council passed four resolutions related to a potential data center in the area, which Williams and various other Michigan City residents were opposed to. The council heard more than one hour of public comment before voting on the data center resolutions.

Resolutions included granting tax abatements; designating the area as an economic revitalization area; and approving a taxpayer agreement for “Project Maize,” also known as a data center at 402 Royal Road.

Hobart residents also opposed a data center in the city, according to Post-Tribune archives, which was proposed to be built on a 168-acre parcel on 61st Avenue, about half a mile from the roadway’s intersection with Colorado Street. City officials have voted for that project to move forward.

“Big tech is just competing with each other to be able to win this race,” Williams said. “That’s what this is about. It’s not about bringing us into the next era and doing this for the American public. It has nothing to do with us and everything to do with greed.”

Senior Campaign Organizer Megan Anderson also isn’t surprised by the DOE’s coal industry funding announcement on Monday. She’s concerned about how the rise of data centers will impact the coal industry and prolong its existence.

“This is very dangerous,” Anderson said. “If you’re concerned about climate change, we have to phase out the use of coal, and now we’re seeing this massive uptick in gas use. We’re seeing coal plants being left online to serve data centers.”

Anderson is also worried about how Hoosiers’ health will be impacted by these actions, especially with air pollution from coal plants.

According to the American Lung Association’s April “State of the Air” report, Lake County has received failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only passed in annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm birth and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. The organization also found particle pollution can cause lung cancer.

“It’s not just higher bills or public health damage — it’s part of a series of actions,” Anderson said. “It’s not entirely unexpected, but nonetheless, it’s going to be bad for Americans.”

With data centers, Anderson and Citizens Action Coalition Program Director Ben Inskeep are worried about how Hoosiers’ energy bills might be affected.

According to a Citizens Action Coalition report, electricity bills have increased more than $28 per month statewide, or 17.5%. NIPCSO residential customers were hit hardest, according to the July 23 report, with about $50 per month, or 26.7%, increase in one year.

The organization created an accountability campaign called “Stop Mike’s Hikes,” which has several asks for Gov. Mike Braun, including to fight for realistic and transparent energy planning; keep bills in check; embrace wind and solar power; and make large energy consumers like data centers pay their fair share, according to Post-Tribune archives.

Inskeep worries that utility bills will continue to rise throughout the Midwest to keep coal plants open.

“My concern is that some utility executives, in an attempt to gain favor with the Trump administration, might pursue something that’s uneconomic for the ratepayers to simply get political benefits from it,” Inskeep said.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association — which NIPCSO is a member of — previously told the Post-Tribune that the state’s energy future “cannot be reduced to a debate of ‘this resource versus that one.’”

“The reality is our state needs a balanced mix of resources to ensure energy is reliable, affordable, and available when and where it’s needed,” McGrath previously said in a statement. “While wind and solar play an important role, they cannot meet Indiana’s energy needs on their own. Natural gas, coal, nuclear, and other dispatchable resources remain critical to keeping the lights on, supporting job growth, and maintaining our state’s economic competitiveness.”

Inskeep said the use of coal is expensive, dirty and unreliable as other energy alternatives are available. He also believes that utility companies should focus on energy sources that will be efficient after the Trump administration leaves office.

Energy-efficient resources that would benefit from more investment include wind and solar power, Inskeep added.

“(Utility companies) need to think about protecting their customers over the coming decades,” Inskeep said. “An investment to reopen a coal plant, in terms of it being a good deal for customers in the long term, that just seems very unlikely, given today’s economy.”

The legislative text says that any appeal or motion filed more than two years ago needs to be scheduled for hearing by December 2026. The hearing has to take place by December 2027.

The law will ensure that certain violent offenders are denied cashless bail, and will limit judges' authority over pretrial release while requiring more defendants to undergo mental health evaluations.

Brown, a schizophrenic homeless man with a prison record, was let go free on cashless bail. Brown, who has now been charged with first-degree murder, was arrested several times in the past since 2011 for felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and communicating threats. He served five years in prison for the robbery with a deadly weapon charge.

More about the new law

According to the Death Penalty Information Center, “HB 307 impos­es stricter pre­tri­al release con­di­tions, requires invol­un­tary men­tal health eval­u­a­tions for defen­dants under cer­tain cir­cum­stances, short­ens the time­line for cap­i­tal case appeals, and pro­vides an alter­na­tive to the cur­rent method of exe­cu­tion — lethal injec­tion. North Carolina last car­ried out an exe­cu­tion in 2006. Legislators say the leg­is­la­tion is a response to the death of Iryna Zarutska, who was killed on Charlotte, North Carolina’s pub­lic tran­sit sys­tem in August 2025.”

Changes to North Carolina’s death penal­ty sys­tem are among the most important provisions of the bill. The Death Penalty Information Center says, “The leg­is­la­tion estab­lish­es strict time­lines for pend­ing appeals and motions in cap­i­tal cas­es, requir­ing any fil­ing more than 24 months old to be sched­uled for a hear­ing by December 2026, and no lat­er than December 2027. This expe­dit­ed time­line would require North Carolina courts to hear and decide near­ly all of the state’s more than 120 death row cas­es in the next two years, a feat that risks wrong­ful exe­cu­tions in a state where 12 peo­ple have been exon­er­at­ed from death row since 1972. In direct response to Ms. Zarutska’s death, HB 307 adds a new aggra­vat­ing fac­tor that allows pros­e­cu­tors to seek the death penal­ty when a cap­i­tal felony is com­mit­ted against some­one on public transportation.”

The legislation even changed the state’s avail­able meth­ods of exe­cu­tion.

""If you pay taxes, if you make money legally, you can get tax credits when you buy solar,"" Heineman said.
Heineman also pointed out that the U.S. Treasury has changed its rules surrounding the solar tax credit.
Illinois, for example, offers tax credits that, when added to federal credits, can result in up to 70% in total savings.
If that's the case, but you still want to experience at-home solar energy, leasing solar panels could be the solution.","If you're on the fence about getting solar panels, an expert has sage advice: Get up and act now.

During an interview with Fox 32's Good Day Chicago, Windfree Solar CEO Eric Heineman encouraged homeowners to act quickly on getting solar panels to take advantage of a 30% federal tax credit that expires at the end of 2025.

""If you pay taxes, if you make money legally, you can get tax credits when you buy solar,"" Heineman said.

Solar panels allow homeowners to reduce their reliance on dirty, polluting energy sources while taking advantage of clean energy that can also bring monthly electricity bills way down.

And thanks to rebates and tax credits, the upfront cost may be lower than you'd expect. That's especially true when using EnergySage's free tools, which allow homeowners to compare quotes from several installation companies to find the right deal.

Heineman also pointed out that the U.S. Treasury has changed its rules surrounding the solar tax credit. Previously, panels had to be fully installed by Dec. 31 to qualify for the credit. Now, Heineman said, homeowners need to have a signed contract and to have paid at least 5% of the total cost to qualify.

Along with the federal credit, many states offer rebates and credits that will extend into next year and beyond.

Illinois, for example, offers tax credits that, when added to federal credits, can result in up to 70% in total savings. To see what's available for your home, EnergySage offers a free mapping tool that shows incentives and the average installation cost by state.

""When you compound it all, it's like a three- to five-year payback,"" Heineman told Good Day Chicago. ""Without the tax credits, it can be a six- to eight-year payback.""

In total, EnergySage estimates the average homeowner can save up to $10,000 on solar installations. Of course, even with credits and rebates, the upfront cost may be prohibitive for some.

If that's the case, but you still want to experience at-home solar energy, leasing solar panels could be the solution. Palmetto's LightReach program allows homeowners to do just that, providing leasing options that require little to no money down.

And getting solar panels can be just the start of your eco-friendly home upgrades. Pairing those panels with electric appliances, like an energy-efficient heat pump, not only further reduces your carbon footprint, but it also drives your utility costs down even more. Mitsubishi can help you find not only the right heat pump for your home, but also the right installer for your budget.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar-tax-creditimage-reckZx15h5V3uTyGb.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 01:59:11.293180

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","BLASDELL, N.Y., Oct. 5, 2025 (AP) – More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

This family-friendly forest preserve is free to the public and welcomes the community with its organic beauty.

Dutro-Ernst serves to inform and encourage everyone in the community to explore the local nature. This forest preserve contains several features that cater to the public. Located right at the preserve’s entrance is a nature play area stacked with logs and rocks for children to play on. In addition to this, signs are located all throughout the trail to teach kids about the land and the species that reside around the area. These are meant to promote environmental literacy in the youth of Muncie.

Beyond serving the children in Muncie, Dutro-Ernst has become a beacon of communion for community members. If you travel down the gravel path, you will pass by a stick village built and maintained by community members themselves. Red-tail Land Conservancy Outreach Coordinator Kendalynn Ross recognized the importance of establishing a relationship with the environment.

“I think it’s really important that the community knows that people are allowed in nature,” Ross asserted. She continues, saying, ""I feel like having urban nature areas, like Dutro, allows the community to see that there are ways that you can get involved.

The community plays a big role in keeping the conservation of Dutro-Ernst alive. The public has access to unique opportunities such as helping in efforts to reseed the prairie, or weeding out invasive species on the preserve’s grounds.

Ross encouraged Muncie residents to connect to the wildlife.

“I always say just reach out. Going on our website, looking at social media, and signing up for those events, that’s all great ways to help us see that the community still cares, but also for us to know what the community is looking for and what role they want to play in this,” said Ross.

India is among the worst polluters in the world, and the country’s cities are regularly blanketed in a cloud of smog, which has an inevitable effect on the health of its citizens. The Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) announced recently that it has added 4.8 GW of new solar cell capacity to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-II.

The Indian government is working hard to promote the solar power sector with its list of approved manufacturers

The Indian government established the list in 2021, and the solar sector has seen massive benefits thanks to the pioneering approach to the sector being led by the ALMM list for modules. The government-led list of solar manufacturers, primarily Indian-based, allows for the companies’ modules to be used in government-supported projects, of which there are many.

Over the past four years, the 21 registered module manufacturers in the ALMM have increased to 100, operating 123 separate manufacturing plants across the vast Indian country.

The previously approved solar cell capacity comes from a wide range of companies that include:

PV manufacturers Adani

Emmvee

Premier Energies

Mundra Solar

ReNew

Jupiter International

First Solar

Industry stakeholders have welcomed the addition of the new solar cell manufacturers to the ALMM list

For a country as industrious as India, more effort is needed to develop the country’s solar cell manufacturing sector. Solar power could play a vital role in India’s decarbonization ambitions.

The first update to the list comes from two main manufacturers, although they both fall under the utility Tata Power. The majority of the capacity added to the list is for Mono passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells. Of that, TP Solar is enlisting nearly 4.5GW of annual capacity and Tata Power Renewable Energy 280MW.

TP Solar’s facility is located in the state of Tamil Nadu, while the Tata Power Renewable Energy cell processing plant is located in the nearby state of Karnataka. The ALMM List-II comprises more than half of the operational capacity for solar cells in India. Data from industry observers has shown how the annual nameplate capacity for solar cells tripled from 9GW to 25GW between March 2024 and March 2025.

The update to the list comes just days after the Indian government announced that it plans to add wafers to the ALMM starting from June 2028. The announcement has been welcomed by India’s vast number of solar cell manufacturers, including Premium Energies’ chief business officer, Vinay Rustagi, who stated that the move was a logical next step for the country to be self-reliant in solar manufacturing.

“We believe that the policy is very well thought out and is aligned with the government’s intent,” – Premium Energies’ chief business officer, Vinay Rustagi

Adding to the reputation of solar power globally, the Energy Information Agency has noted that solar power will continue to play a vital role in the future in the United States.

Peabody Energy Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Peabody Energy shareholder, you need to believe that recent U.S. policy support, including expanded federal land access, regulatory rollbacks, and new coal funding, can power a sustained “coal comeback” despite ongoing global trends toward renewables. These tailwinds have been the most important short-term catalyst, reflected in Peabody's sharp share price surge, while the biggest risk remains the enduring threat of long-term coal demand decline and policy shifts if political priorities change. The latest news materially strengthens the short-term narrative but long-term risks tied to decarbonization persist. The company's completed buyback, retiring over 17% of its outstanding shares, stands out against this backdrop. Increased federal support may boost near-term cash flow, supporting capital returns like buybacks and dividends, but long-term revenue visibility still hinges on domestic coal demand and regulatory certainty. However, investors should also consider the potential for abrupt changes in political support for coal...

Peabody Energy's narrative projects $4.9 billion revenue and $468.2 million earnings by 2028. This requires 6.4% yearly revenue growth and a $327.3 million earnings increase from $140.9 million today.

Most Popular Narrative: 56.7% Overvalued

Despite analyst consensus raising Bloom Energy’s fair value to $57.63, the last close at $90.29 indicates a substantial premium being priced in by the market. The narrative builds its outlook on sector tailwinds and anticipated future profitability, which together support a bold growth story for the years ahead.

Ongoing product cost reductions and digital-twin-enabled operational improvements, fueled by AI-driven analytics from a large installed base, are lowering cost per watt and raising manufacturing efficiency. These trends are poised to drive continued operating margin and net margin expansion.

Staying updated on how the U.S. uses nuclear power is crucial to keeping our communities safer.","The U.S. Department of Energy has made a surprising announcement: It's bringing nuclear energy into the modern era.

Interesting Engineering reported that the DOE will conditionally provide high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, to three U.S. companies. HALEU is necessary to develop and run advanced nuclear reactors.

""The HALEU allocation program is a win for the economy, energy security, and the American people,"" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a statement.

The DOE defines nuclear fission as the process of splitting the nucleus of an atom into two or more smaller particles. Nuclear power plants use the heat generated by this process to create electricity.

Nuclear fission doesn't pollute as much as coal does. It's cleaner in that it doesn't release polluting gases into the air. But it still creates radioactive waste that must be stored properly.

Indigenous peoples living in the U.S. are also speaking out about how nuclear energy has disproportionately affected them. According to Prism, Indigenous communities in the Southwest have been contaminated by uranium mining since the 1940s.

The White Mesa Mill in Utah was built on an ancestral site of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe in 1979. After uranium prices dropped, the mill started processing imported radioactive waste, which it stored on the land.

In addition to the cultural impact of this extraction, Indigenous communities are concerned about their drinking water. If radioactive waste gets into the local aquifer, residents won't have clean drinking water. They'll also be at higher risk for a whole host of health issues.

Finding better ways to store radioactive waste away from native lands will keep communities safer. One solution scientists are working on is using gamma rays to turn waste itself into energy. It could even be used to create rechargeable batteries.

For now, the DOE may distribute the HALEU it has conditionally committed to giving as early as the end of the year. It plans to allocate more HALEU to more companies in the future.

Shares of Centrus Energy (NYSEMKT: LEU) increased 53.7% in September, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Centrus Energy, a leading U.S. supplier of nuclear fuel and enrichment services, benefited from news that the U.S. government is supporting policies aimed at boosting domestic production of nuclear materials. The company also announced it would expand its U.S.-based enrichment plant to support U.S. production and reduce reliance on foreign entities. Here's what investors need to know.

Centrus Energy's leap comes amid growing support for U.S. nuclear production

On Sept. 15, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration announced that it would take steps to support domestic nuclear materials production and enrichment.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright recommended that the U.S. increase its strategic uranium reserve to help buffer against Russian supplies. Russian supplies were banned in August 2024. This ban won't be fully phased in until 2028, when waivers allowing limited Russian deliveries expire. This creates a significant need to replace approximately 25% of enriched uranium currently imported from Russia.

The recommendation to boost the uranium reserve boosted confidence across the industry, driving several uranium and nuclear stocks higher during the month.

Increased support from the federal government is a positive development for Centrus, which plans a major expansion to boost production of Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU). Centrus currently has two commercial agreements to sell LEU, one of which is with TEXEX, a Russian entity.

In the long term, Centrus aims to produce LEU and HALEU at its Piketon, Ohio plant, utilizing its advanced centrifuge technology. It is the only Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed producer of HALEU currently operating at scale for both commercial and national security applications.

The expansion of its Ohio plant hinges on Department of Energy funding, private investment, and long-term customer commitments. Centrus has raised over $1.2 billion and secured contingent purchase commitments of $2 billion from utilities. However, the full scale and timing of the expansion remain contingent on federal funding decisions from the Department of Energy.

With the U.S. signaling a willingness to support domestic production of key mineral resources, this is a good sign that Centrus could secure the necessary funding to expand its operations and become a top domestic supplier of LEU and HALEU uranium. While HALEU is not currently used in commercial reactors, it is essential for advanced reactor designs under development, making it critical for next-generation nuclear technology.

Centrus is well-positioned for a nuclear revival

Centrus Energy is riding the wave higher as uranium and nuclear power-related stocks surge. This demand is likely to persist, too, given the massive amount of energy required to power the data centers behind artificial intelligence (AI).

The company's Piketon facility has the potential to be crucial to domestic fuel production. However, scaling it will require time and capital and hinges on securing funding. The stock trades at a premium today, but for investors who believe in the long-term nuclear revival, Centrus is one way to gain exposure to it.

The DTI said its premier investment promotion agency, Board of Investments (BoI), endorsed 65 strategic projects worth P1.78 trillion for Green Lane Certification, expected to generate 157,330 jobs, spanning the renewable energy, infrastructure, manufacturing and agri-food sectors.

Renewable energy remains the backbone of investments granted green lane privileges, with 50 projects accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total project costs, equivalent to P1.33 trillion.

In comparison, infrastructure and PPP initiatives contribute significantly, totaling P415.87 billion across four projects. Smaller but strategic bets include food security, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing, each signaling the government’s intent to catalyze value chains beyond commodity sectors.

Since the Green Lane’s launch in 2023, its cumulative footprint is even more striking: 216 projects valued at P5.9 trillion, poised to generate 392,827 jobs.

This institutional mechanism has become central to channeling investments into the country’s highest-potential, future-ready sectors.

“Through the Green Lane mechanism, we are accelerating high-impact investments that create jobs, enable technology transfer, and advance our transition to a sustainable, innovation-led economy,” Trade Secretary and BoI Chairman Cristina Roque said.

The impact of these Green Lane projects is felt nationwide. In Compostela, Cebu, SteelAsia’s Compostela Works, inaugurated by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., now stands as the largest and most modern steel mill in the country, producing one million tons of rebar annually.

The facility reduces import dependence and strengthens domestic manufacturing capabilities, embodying industrial self-reliance.

In Pampanga, the President also led the inauguration of Farm Fresh Milk, a Malaysian-Philippine joint venture dairy processing plant that underscores the administration’s drive for agricultural resilience and dairy self-sufficiency.

Clean energy milestones continue to rise as well: The Terra Solar Project, one of the country’s largest renewable energy undertakings, is poised to power millions of homes with clean, reliable electricity. Meanwhile, the SMN Poultry facility in Davao del Sur, as well as global firms like Unilever and Procter & Gamble, through its new Lighthouse Factory, demonstrate how both local and multinational investors are scaling up their Philippine operations with modern, digital, and sustainable facilities.

Parallel to this, the BoI’s regular investment approvals for January to September 2025 reached P653.5 billion across 206 projects, with nearly 26,000 jobs expected.

“These investment figures demonstrate the sustained trust of both local and foreign investors in the Philippines’ capability to provide a stable and enabling business environment,” Ma. Corazon H. Halili-Dichosa, BoI executive director for Industry Development Services, said.

“They also affirm that our policies to strengthen key industries, particularly energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure, are creating real value for the economy and for Filipino workers.”

Hub for sustainable businesses

“At the same time, these projects reflect the success of our ongoing efforts to promote the Philippines as a hub for smart, sustainable, and future-ready investments,” Evariste M. Cagatan, BoI executive director for Investments Promotion Services, added.

“By channeling strategic capital into high-growth sectors such as renewable energy, logistics, and ICT, we are ensuring that investor confidence translates into inclusive growth and stronger regional competitiveness.”

During this period, approved investments were heavily concentrated in the Energy and Efficiency sector, totaling P423.52 billion, garnering the largest share of the total approved funds among the industries.

Other leading sectors in 2025 included Airports and Seaports at P144.95 billion, Manufacturing at P29.35 billion, Mass Housing at P25.56 billion, and Information and Communication at P9.34 billion, which notably has the biggest surge among the industries, soaring by 6,293 percent compared to last year’s P146.15 million.

Local investments accounted for the majority of the total approved amount, with P569.30 billion worth of assets.

On the other hand, foreign investments also constituted a substantial portion of the approved projects, amounting to P84.2 billion.

“The DTI and the BoI remain dedicated to attracting more investments through a whole-of-government approach to position the Philippines as a prime investment destination. These figures highlight the significant opportunities offered by the Philippines’ strong and rapidly expanding economy, especially in emerging sectors such as electric vehicles, smart manufacturing, semiconductors, renewable energy, high-tech agriculture, and data center infrastructure,” according to Roque.",https://media.assettype.com/tribune%2F2025-10-05%2F43fdgd9r%2F06leadfoto.png?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-05 14:00:18.173124

This initiative marks a major shift in how the Detroit-based automaker approaches vehicle design and manufacturing. With a total investment of $5 billion—$2 billion into the Louisville Assembly Plant and $3 billion for battery production in Michigan—Ford is betting on radical transformation to stay competitive in the evolving EV market.

CEO Jim Farley described the move as “the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,” during an event announcing the new platform. The company is introducing both a new product and a new industrial method, reflecting a broader effort to align legacy manufacturing with the demands of electric mobility.

A Redesigned Production Model to Cut Complexity

At the core of this shift is the creation of the Ford Universal EV Platform and an all-new manufacturing approach dubbed the Universal EV Production System. Rather than following a traditional single-line assembly belt, Ford’s new “assembly tree” breaks down the production process into three sub-lines that converge into one.

Doug Field, Ford’s EV chief of digital and design, called it “the first time anyone’s done this anywhere in the world,” as reported by CBS News. The approach is expected to streamline the workflow, improve ergonomics, and increase production speed. The truck will reportedly be built 40% faster than current models produced at the Louisville plant, which is being modernized specifically for this purpose.

According to InsideEVs, the system will use 20% fewer parts, 25% fewer fasteners, and 40% fewer factory workstations. This reduction in complexity is a key component of Ford’s plan to bring the price of its electric truck down to $30,000 without sacrificing size or performance.

Toyota Boosts Range of Its First Electric SUV And Drops Prices

A Platform to Support a Family of Next-Gen EVs

The electric pickup is just the starting point. The new Universal EV Platform is designed to be modular and flexible, capable of supporting multiple vehicle types. A graphic presented by Ford includes outlines for a pickup truck, a three-row SUV, a small crossover, and a cargo van, though not all variants have been confirmed.

Ford aims to address one of the most persistent challenges for legacy automakers: electrical architecture. The company is adopting a zonal approach, significantly reducing wiring—by more than 4,000 feet compared to the Mustang Mach-E—and enabling a simpler yet more powerful setup using fewer electronic control units.

Kevin Young, Ford’s head of advanced manufacturing programs, emphasized the importance of this change: “Wiring is the nemesis. If you don’t change that input, then nothing else is ever going to change.” This strategy mirrors efforts by Tesla and Rivian, both of which have made similar changes to wiring harnesses in order to boost efficiency.

U.S.-Made Batteries and Focus on Affordability

Ford’s decision to localize battery production is central to its effort to control costs. The upcoming pickup will use lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in a prismatic cell format—built at the BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan. The battery tech will be licensed from CATL, but production will take place domestically.

This will make Ford the first American automaker to use U.S.-made LFP batteries. These cobalt- and nickel-free batteries are cheaper and more stable than traditional lithium-ion alternatives, allowing Ford to reduce dependency on expensive imported materials.

Unlike stripped-down EV models in the same price bracket, Ford’s midsize electric truck is being developed with comfort and utility in mind. It will feature a frunk, more interior space than a Toyota RAV4, and faster acceleration than the Mustang EcoBoost, which reaches 60 mph in about five seconds.

Jim Farley addressed the industry’s track record of failed affordable car projects in Detroit, stating: “Nobody wants to see another good college try by a Detroit automaker to make an affordable vehicle that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty.” He noted that Ford’s new approach involved a small, dedicated team that reimagined the moving assembly line from scratch.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Close-up-of-the-front-of-a-FORD-SUV.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 15:01:08.771269

But Louisiana’s own $1 million bycatch study tells a different story - one that underscores how sustainable and responsible the menhaden fishery is.
The adoption of new hose-end cage technology industry-wide , for example, has reduced the menhaden industry’s red drum mortality by 24% in 2025.
The buffer zone expansions, therefore, do little to protect prized game fish but impose enormous costs on the menhaden industry and the communities it supports.
The recent half-mile buffer zone extension has introduced quantifiable challenges for the menhaden fishery, limiting areas where vessels can operate and reducing access to historically productive waters.","Louisiana’s working coast has long depended on the Gulf menhaden fishery - a sustainable industry that supports more than 2,000 jobs, contributes $419 million annually, generates $25 million in state and local tax revenue, and purchases $62 million in goods and services from 32 parishes. Yet, despite this enormous positive impact, recent regulatory changes threaten to undermine this lifeline industry and the communities that depend on it.

At issue is the decision to extend the state’s menhaden buffer zone in recent years. Historically, the fishery operated along the Inside/Outside Line and Double Rig Line - longstanding boundaries for commercial fishing that had already limited where menhaden vessels could operate. In 2021, the buffer zone was extended by one-quarter mile, and again in 2024 to a half-mile from the original line.

While these changes may sound incremental, the impact has been anything but small. The half-mile restriction has excluded thousands of acres of historically productive fishing grounds. In just 3 years, the industry experienced a 25% reduction in fish caught. For an industry already operating on tight margins, this loss is unsustainable, harming not only the companies that fish for menhaden but also thousands of Louisiana families whose livelihoods depend on this fishery.

An Industry That Fuels Local Economies

Louisiana’s menhaden industry is powered by two companies - Westbank Fishing out of Empire, LA (Plaquemines Parish) and Ocean Harvesters out of Abbeville, LA (Vermilion Parish). Contrary to the misinformation that has been spread, both these companies are U.S.-based, U.S.-owned and are totally controlled by U.S. citizens. Together with the two processing companies (Daybrook Fisheries and Omega Protein), they employ more than 800 people directly on vessels and in processing plants, while another 1,200 jobs ripple across rural communities through suppliers, service companies, and transportation providers. These are stable, year-round jobs that anchor small-town economies in parishes where economic opportunities are limited.

Beyond economics, menhaden plays a critical role in global supply chains. These small, oily fish are processed into fishmeal and fish oil essential for petfood, animal feed, and aquaculture. Without a reliable domestic menhaden supply, the United States would be forced to rely on imports, raising costs for consumers and weakening food security.

Bycatch Numbers Tell The Real Story

Bycatch Numbers Tell the Real Story Too often, buffer zone expansions have been driven by perception rather than science. Proponents cite concerns about bycatch, particularly the unintended capture of red drum. But Louisiana’s own $1 million bycatch study tells a different story - one that underscores how sustainable and responsible the menhaden fishery is.

The study found the menhaden fleet accounts for just 3.4% of red drum caught. In addition, the fishery operated well below the 5% total bycatch set by the State of Louisiana as a maximum bycatch threshold. By contrast, the recreational sector - nearly 407,000 licensed saltwater anglers in 2023- 24 according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries - accounts for 96.6% of all red drum mortalities off Louisiana’s coast. In fact, LDWF data show red drum are experiencing overfishing driven by this recreational pressure.

What’s more, the bycatch study found that 84% of red drum survive after being rolled out of the nets after the completion of menhaden sets. Industry-led innovations are driving this survival rate even higher. The adoption of new hose-end cage technology industry-wide , for example, has reduced the menhaden industry’s red drum mortality by 24% in 2025.

The menhaden fleet has also invested heavily in improving gear to prevent past issues. Since 2023, companies have spent $6.5 million upgrading to Spectra/Plateena nets, which are stronger, more durable, and significantly reduce net tears that once led to unintended spills.

Taken together, the data show a fishery that is meeting bycatch standards, innovating to improve, and ensuring red drum populations are not negatively impacted.

The Myth of Predator Dependence

Another argument often cited against menhaden harvesting is that predator fish like speckled trout and red drum depend almost exclusively on menhaden as food. Yet new research disproves this claim. A University of Southern Mississippi study found Gulf predator species do not exclusively rely on menhaden. Instead, they consume a variety of prey, including shrimp, crabs, and other forage fish.

This evidence underscores that the ecological role of menhaden, while important, is not the sole factor sustaining predator populations. The buffer zone expansions, therefore, do little to protect prized game fish but impose enormous costs on the menhaden industry and the communities it supports.

A Call for Balance

Louisiana has long prided itself on balancing conservation with economic opportunity. The recent half-mile buffer zone extension has introduced quantifiable challenges for the menhaden fishery, limiting areas where vessels can operate and reducing access to historically productive waters.

Williams Companies Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Williams Companies today, you need to believe in the ongoing strength of natural gas and the crucial role of pipelines and power infrastructure in the digital economy. The recent announcement of a US$3.1 billion investment in power projects targeted at data centers does not materially affect the most important near-term catalyst, accelerating demand from LNG exports and AI-driven data center growth, but does incrementally increase the company's long-term capital commitments, which may bring higher execution and leverage risks.

Of the company's recent developments, the successful commissioning of the Southeast Energy Connector and Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway stands out. These projects, completed just months before the new data center power initiative, directly addressed system constraints while increasing natural gas delivery capacity, underpinning Williams’ ability to keep pace with rising service demand and reinforcing the company’s reliance on growing infrastructure throughput.

Examples of Successful Clean Energy Initiatives Supported by NGOs and Carbon Credit Funds Numerous successful clean energy initiatives demonstrate the potential of leveraging carbon credit funds effectively.","Carbon credit funds are financial instruments designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by allowing organizations to invest in projects that either prevent emissions or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Each carbon credit typically represents one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) that has been avoided or sequestered. These funds are crucial in the global effort to combat climate change, as they provide a mechanism for businesses and governments to offset their emissions while simultaneously funding sustainable development projects.

Clean energy initiatives, on the other hand, focus on generating energy from renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, which are essential for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing environmental degradation. The intersection of carbon credit funds and clean energy initiatives creates a powerful synergy. By investing in renewable energy projects, organizations can generate carbon credits that can be sold or traded, creating a revenue stream that can be reinvested into further sustainability efforts.

This not only helps to finance clean energy projects but also encourages innovation and the adoption of new technologies. Understanding this relationship is vital for NGOs looking to leverage carbon credit funds to support their clean energy initiatives effectively.

Key Takeaways

Carbon credit funds support clean energy initiatives by providing financial incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

NGOs play a crucial role in promoting clean energy solutions by raising awareness, advocating for policy changes, and implementing projects on the ground.

Identifying opportunities for carbon credit funding involves assessing potential emission reduction activities and understanding the requirements of carbon credit standards.

Developing projects to utilize carbon credit funds requires careful planning, implementation, and monitoring to ensure the success of clean energy initiatives.

Building partnerships with private and public sectors is essential for accessing funding, expertise, and resources to support clean energy projects.

The Role of NGOs in Promoting Clean Energy Solutions

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a pivotal role in promoting clean energy solutions, particularly in underserved communities where access to reliable energy sources is limited. NGOs often act as intermediaries between local populations and funding sources, helping to identify needs and mobilize resources for clean energy projects. Their grassroots connections enable them to understand the unique challenges faced by communities, allowing them to tailor solutions that are culturally appropriate and sustainable.

Moreover, NGOs are instrumental in raising awareness about the importance of clean energy and its benefits. Through educational campaigns, workshops, and community engagement initiatives, they can inform the public about renewable energy options and their potential to improve quality of life. By advocating for policy changes and supporting local governments in implementing clean energy strategies, NGOs can help create an enabling environment for sustainable development.

Their ability to mobilize community support and foster collaboration among stakeholders is essential for the successful implementation of clean energy projects.

Identifying Opportunities for Carbon Credit Funding

Identifying opportunities for carbon credit funding requires a strategic approach that involves assessing local needs, understanding market dynamics, and aligning with regulatory frameworks. NGOs should begin by conducting thorough assessments of potential projects that could generate carbon credits. This may include renewable energy installations, reforestation efforts, or energy efficiency improvements.

By analyzing local resources and community needs, NGOs can pinpoint projects that not only have the potential to generate carbon credits but also address pressing social and environmental issues. Additionally, staying informed about the evolving landscape of carbon markets is crucial. This includes understanding the different types of carbon credit programs available, such as compliance markets and voluntary markets, as well as the specific requirements for each.

Engaging with experts in carbon finance can provide valuable insights into emerging trends and opportunities. By leveraging these insights, NGOs can position themselves to access funding sources that align with their mission and project goals.

Developing Projects to Utilize Carbon Credit Funds

Once opportunities for carbon credit funding have been identified, NGOs must focus on developing robust projects that can effectively utilize these funds. This involves creating detailed project proposals that outline objectives, methodologies, expected outcomes, and financial projections. A well-structured proposal not only demonstrates the feasibility of the project but also highlights its potential impact on both carbon reduction and community development.

Collaboration with local stakeholders is essential during the project development phase. Engaging community members in the planning process ensures that projects are designed with their needs in mind, increasing the likelihood of successful implementation. Additionally, involving local experts can enhance project credibility and effectiveness.

NGOs should also consider integrating monitoring and evaluation frameworks into their project designs to track progress and measure impact over time.

Building Partnerships with Private and Public Sectors

Building partnerships with both private and public sectors is critical for NGOs seeking to leverage carbon credit funds effectively. Collaborating with private companies can provide access to additional resources, expertise, and innovative technologies that can enhance project outcomes. For instance, partnerships with renewable energy firms can facilitate the deployment of solar panels or wind turbines in local communities, while also generating carbon credits.

Public sector partnerships are equally important, as they can help NGOs navigate regulatory landscapes and secure necessary permits for project implementation. Engaging with government agencies can also open doors to additional funding opportunities and support services. By fostering relationships with various stakeholders, NGOs can create a network of support that enhances their capacity to implement clean energy initiatives successfully.

Ensuring Compliance with Carbon Credit Standards and Regulations

Compliance with carbon credit standards and regulations is a critical aspect of successfully leveraging carbon credit funds. Each carbon credit program has specific requirements that must be met to ensure the credibility of the credits generated. NGOs must familiarize themselves with these standards, which may include guidelines set by organizations such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or the Gold Standard.

To ensure compliance, NGOs should establish clear protocols for project implementation, monitoring, and reporting. This may involve conducting baseline assessments to measure existing emissions levels, implementing robust data collection methods during project execution, and preparing detailed reports for verification purposes. Engaging third-party auditors can also enhance credibility by providing independent assessments of project performance.

By prioritizing compliance, NGOs can build trust with stakeholders and maximize the value of the carbon credits generated.

Monitoring and Reporting on Clean Energy Impact

Monitoring and reporting on the impact of clean energy projects is essential for demonstrating accountability and transparency to stakeholders. Effective monitoring involves collecting data on key performance indicators (KPIs) related to both environmental outcomes (such as emissions reductions) and social benefits (such as improved access to energy). Establishing a baseline before project implementation allows NGOs to measure progress accurately over time.

Regular reporting is crucial for maintaining stakeholder engagement and attracting future funding opportunities. NGOs should develop comprehensive reports that highlight project achievements, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Utilizing visual aids such as graphs and infographics can enhance the clarity of reports and make them more engaging for diverse audiences.

By effectively communicating their impact, NGOs can strengthen their credibility and attract further support for their clean energy initiatives.

Engaging Communities in Clean Energy Projects

Community engagement is a cornerstone of successful clean energy projects. Involving local populations in every stage of project development fosters ownership and ensures that initiatives are aligned with community needs. NGOs should prioritize participatory approaches that encourage input from community members during planning sessions, implementation phases, and evaluation processes.

Educational initiatives play a vital role in community engagement as well. Providing training on renewable energy technologies not only empowers individuals with new skills but also fosters a sense of agency within the community. Workshops that demonstrate how clean energy solutions work can demystify technology and encourage adoption.

By actively involving communities in clean energy projects, NGOs can create lasting change that extends beyond mere access to energy.

Addressing Challenges and Risks in Leveraging Carbon Credit Funds

While leveraging carbon credit funds presents significant opportunities for NGOs, it also comes with challenges and risks that must be addressed proactively. Fluctuations in carbon credit prices can impact project viability; therefore, NGOs should develop financial models that account for potential market volatility. Diversifying funding sources beyond carbon credits can also mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single revenue stream.

Regulatory changes pose another challenge; staying informed about evolving policies is essential for ensuring compliance and adapting project strategies accordingly. Additionally, NGOs must be prepared to address potential community resistance or misunderstandings regarding clean energy technologies. Building trust through transparent communication and demonstrating tangible benefits can help alleviate concerns and foster community support.

Maximizing the Social and Environmental Benefits of Clean Energy Projects

To maximize the social and environmental benefits of clean energy projects, NGOs should adopt a holistic approach that considers both immediate impacts and long-term sustainability. This involves integrating social equity principles into project design to ensure that marginalized groups benefit from clean energy initiatives. For example, prioritizing access to renewable energy for low-income households can help reduce energy poverty while promoting environmental sustainability.

Furthermore, NGOs should explore opportunities for co-benefits that extend beyond emissions reductions. Clean energy projects can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and improve public health by reducing air pollution from traditional fossil fuels. By emphasizing these co-benefits in project proposals and communications, NGOs can attract broader support from stakeholders who recognize the multifaceted advantages of investing in clean energy solutions.

Examples of Successful Clean Energy Initiatives Supported by NGOs and Carbon Credit Funds

Numerous successful clean energy initiatives demonstrate the potential of leveraging carbon credit funds effectively. One notable example is the Solar Sister program in Africa, which empowers women entrepreneurs to distribute solar-powered products in their communities while generating carbon credits through emissions reductions associated with traditional kerosene lamps. This initiative not only provides access to clean energy but also promotes gender equality by supporting women’s economic empowerment.

Another example is the reforestation efforts led by organizations like Eden Reforestation Projects, which focus on restoring degraded forests while generating carbon credits through sustainable forestry practices. These projects not only sequester carbon but also create jobs for local communities involved in planting trees and maintaining forests. These examples illustrate how NGOs can successfully leverage carbon credit funds to implement impactful clean energy initiatives that address both environmental challenges and social needs.

RelyEZ is already doing that – proving that storage is not just technology, but the real estate of the energy era.","“Turning Energy Storage into Assets: RelyEZ’s Value for U.S. Investors”

At RE+ 2025 in Las Vegas, the conversation was not only about technologies on display but about the financial future of clean energy. Solar and wind are now mainstream, but it is energy storage that determines whether renewables can truly stand on their own. In this new reality, RelyEZ is positioning storage not as a supporting component, but as a bankable asset class – one that investors can treat like real estate: tangible, reliable, and revenue-generating.

With recognition as a Top 10 BESS provider by S&P Global, more than 15 GWh of projects already executed, and an annual capacity of 20 GWh, RelyEZ is proving it has both the scale and credibility to lead this transformation. Backed by BloombergNEF Tier-1 ratings and Munich Re insurance, the company is de-risking storage investments on a global level.

From Hardware to Bankable Assets

Asked what makes RelyEZ different, Uri, RelyEZ’s U.S. Business Development Manager, was clear:

“We don’t just deliver hardware – we deliver confidence. With our scale, technology, and execution, RelyEZ is setting new benchmarks for reliability and performance.”

That confidence comes from the company’s full-spectrum strategy. RelyEZ covers the entire lifecycle of a project:

Origination & design with grid-forming capabilities and immersive liquid-cooling

Financing & insurance backed by global partners such as Munich Re

Deployment & integration at utility and C/I scale

Operations & trading through the EnergyHub EMS and EnergyCloud AI platforms

Operations, trading & tokenization through the EnergyHub EMS, EnergyCloud AI platform, and RWA-ready solutions

By aligning the technical, financial, and operational layers, RelyEZ transforms projects into predictable, multi-revenue assets. This is what makes the company resilient even in turbulent times – tariffs, supply chain disruptions, or policy shifts.

Why Timing Matters

Global demand for storage is accelerating. The U.S. alone is forecasted to need tens of gigawatts of capacity by the end of the decade, driven by data center load, electrification, and grid reliability needs. For Uri, this creates a unique moment:

“Energy storage is no longer optional – it’s essential. The market is scaling fast, and RelyEZ is ready with bankable solutions. Partnering with us now means joining the growth of a company that is defining how energy storage becomes a financial asset class.”

Unlike many entrants chasing short-term opportunities, RelyEZ is building for longevity. With its bankability framework, investors can secure stable returns while utilities and developers gain confidence that assets will perform for decades.

The U.S. Strategy: Global Scale, Local Fit

RelyEZ’s U.S. market strategy combines global leadership with local alignment. Its solutions comply with U.S. standards, meet investor expectations, and adapt to regional project needs – from C/I to utility-scale.

Uri explained:

“We combine global best practices with U.S. compliance. From design to long-term O&M, we bring certainty to projects, ensuring they’re not only technically sound but also financially secure.”

This balance allows RelyEZ to serve as a bridge between global innovation and local execution.

The Depth of Full-Spectrum Energy Asset Management

Full-Spectrum Energy Asset Management is not a slogan – it is the foundation of RelyEZ’s resilience. It means projects are conceived, financed, insured, operated, and optimized under a single framework.

This model enables:

Predictable returns through multi-revenue market participation (frequency regulation, capacity markets, trading)

Operational stability through predictive maintenance and AI-driven monitoring

Risk reduction by integrating financing, insurance, and technology into one package

Uri emphasized:

“Even in the face of tariffs or policy uncertainty, our model keeps assets profitable. It’s about making energy storage as investable as traditional real estate.”

Looking Ahead

RelyEZ’s vision extends far beyond project delivery. It is about reshaping how storage is valued – moving it from a cost line item to an asset class in its own right. The company’s “three-car strategy” – leading in project development, construction, and long-term operation/trading – is already showing results across global markets, and the U.S. is its next major frontier.

As RE+ 2025 made clear, the companies that will define the next decade are not those who can simply build batteries, but those who can turn gigawatts into financial assets.

RelyEZ is already doing that – proving that storage is not just technology, but the real estate of the energy era.

Texas electricity demand didn’t set records this summer, but here’s why usage is up | The Dallas Morning News

Good summary of what I take to be a very healthy trend: lower annual peak demands each of the last two years while overall energy use has increased by historically very high levels.

[T]otal energy consumption is expected to grow more than 5% this year compared to last, which Vegas said is five times faster than the national average annual consumption growth rate between 2000 and 2020. Between 2010 and 2020, Texas had about double the national average growth rate ― but now that’s doubled again...

“We’re seeing higher system utilization, which is good for a lot of reasons,” Austin-based energy analyst Doug Lewin said. “It’s healthy for generators, it’s good for distributing costs across a wider base, and, of course, having those lower peaks and net peaks makes a big difference for grid reliability.”

Many energy industry leaders have called for an “all of the above” approach to generation. Consumption is being driven higher as Texas adds to its already rapid population growth, the boom of data centers extends its march and oil and gas operations rely more on electricity.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!epKo!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ccb65-7cd0-4708-94f2-6d0cfc5957d3_1656x1358.png",N,,2025-10-05 13:00:36.281861

Stable, local clean energy also shields residents from the price volatility of natural gas, keeping energy bills more predictable over time.","California has secured a long-term clean energy commitment that will provide decades of stable power to millions of residents, according to Think Geoenergy.

Ormat Technologies signed a 25-year extension with the Southern California Public Power Authority to continue supplying 52 megawatts of renewable electricity from its Heber 1 geothermal power facility in Imperial Valley.

The agreement takes effect in February 2026 and runs through 2052, serving the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Imperial Irrigation District.

Geothermal energy, unlike solar or wind, provides a constant supply of baseload power by tapping heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. That reliability makes it especially valuable for cities seeking to diversify their clean energy mix and cut dependence on fossil fuels.

With the Heber 1 extension, the LADWP says the facility is expected to provide power to more than 77,000 households in Los Angeles.

The Heber complex was recently modernized after a fire incident forced a temporary shutdown in 2022. The repowering project replaced the facility's older water-cooled system with newer air-cooled technology, improving efficiency while reducing water demand in the arid Imperial Valley.

Together with its sister plant, Heber 1 will continue to generate about 91 MW of renewable electricity, which is enough to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people.

Ormat Technologies is based nearby in Reno, Nevada, and is one of the world's biggest companies in the field of alternative and renewable geothermal energy technology.

For communities, this deal means more than just reliable power. Expanding geothermal helps reduce pollution from fossil fuel plants, cutting emissions linked to respiratory illness and smog.

Stable, local clean energy also shields residents from the price volatility of natural gas, keeping energy bills more predictable over time. State and utility leaders framed the extension as both a climate action and an economic safeguard.

""Investing in geothermal energy is not just about meeting climate goals; it's a strategic decision that supports long-term energy security and environmental stewardship,"" said David Hanson, Senior Assistant General Manager of LADWP's Power System.

IID Board Chairwoman Gina Dockstader also welcomed the move, calling geothermal ""a reliable source of power"" for Imperial Valley and beyond.

Beneath the proliferation of EVs, Gebrüder Weiss Holding AG just launched two new electric trucks to bolster its fleet.

These two eActros 600 trucks will bolster a growing fleet that should include 14 by the end of the year, with more on the way throughout 2026. The Mercedes-Benz eActros 600 is an electric long-haul truck designed specifically for heavy transport with an extensive range.

Running on a 621-kilowatt-hour battery, the eActros 600 has a range of 500 kilometers (311 miles) and is capable of hauling 22 tons over the full distance. It features a ProCabin chassis built with aerodynamics in mind to achieve its maximum range with a full payload.

In 2022, long-haul trucks in the United States produced 413 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, a 75% increase in 12 years, according to data provided by Statista. Replacing them with electric variations would have a tangible impact on annual CO2 pollution.

Currently, long-haul diesel trucks maintain a range advantage of 1,000 to 1,200 miles between fuel stops, compared to the eActros' 310 miles. However, even with the range gap shrinking, environmental considerations are changing the dynamics of the conversation.

Unsurprisingly, most people want to breathe cleaner air, and although replacing entire fleets of diesel semitrucks with electric alternatives will take time, the result is a brighter, cleaner future for everyone, without breaking the large-scale transportation business.

While range is a legitimate comparison, electric long-haul variations offer some unique advantages of their own, such as significantly reduced transportation costs and less noise pollution, the former generating an immediate impact on the costs of goods for consumers.

Gebrüder Weiss Holding AG is based in Austria, where market adoption of EV long-haul trucks is more straightforward. In the U.S., the approach is more varied and complex.

For instance, California's Advanced Clean Trucks Act, aimed at fleet electrification, was effectively stopped this year. Additionally, the U.S. Senate revoked a federal electric truck sales mandate.

A government shutdown will likely lead to further dismantling of federal environmental science, enforcement and conservation agencies, advocates warned this week.

Previous government shutdowns have seen federal employees furloughed until funding resumes. But this time, Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has told federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.

“That is fundamentally different,” said Jeremy Symons, a climate policy advisor for the Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton administration, in a press call Monday hosted by the Environmental Protection Network. “The stakes of this year are different.”

The piecemeal, bipartisan funding bills Congress has put forth don’t include many of the deep cuts to these agencies the Trump administration requested. Symons pointed to the EPA funding bill that emerged from the Senate Appropriations Committee in July, which would force the Trump administration to re-establish the EPA’s Office of Research and Development and hire back the scientists laid off this year. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have also rejected the Trump administration’s plans to eliminate the research arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.

Vought, an architect of conservative policy roadmap Project 2025, has signaled that the Trump administration would use a standoff as an opportunity to further shrink agencies that already have seen massive layoffs, resignations and retirements this year.

Executing layoffs during a shutdown is part of the Trump administration’s effort to unilaterally dismantle agencies responsible for environmental science and enforcement, said Symons, a senior advisor to the EPN, a group of former EPA staff.

“This is a bigger fight of whether or not Congress is going to actually be able to step up and stop this. Because it will just continue to happen,” Symons said.

Trump’s political opponents have suggested the administration doesn’t want a budget deal and is angling instead to take executive actions during the shutdown.

Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, “if it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down.” On Sunday, he warned of “mass firings” in an NBC News interview. If the government shuts down, “we are going to cut a lot of the people that … we’re able to cut on a permanent basis,” he said.

It remains unclear how sweeping those cuts might be, who they would target or how they would stand up to likely challenges in court. Advocates for public health and the environment fear the cuts will target the same agencies already worn down by a confusing onslaught of layoffs, buyouts, re-hirings and legal challenges related to the administration’s downsizing agenda.

The White House referred questions on the shutdown’s impact on this work to the agencies. Representatives for the EPA and the commerce and interior departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the shutdown.

“I think the EPA is very susceptible to additional layoffs,” said Jeanne Briskin, former director of the EPA’s Office of Children’s Health Protection. She noted that expertise was already lost when the Trump administration eliminated the agency’s environmental justice office and its Office of Research and Development.

“The goal seems to be to remove the expertise and the experience necessary to implement our federal environmental protection laws, and so as long as there are people there who know how to do that, I think the goal is to strip that out as much as possible,” said Briskin, who retired in 2024 after 40 years at the EPA.

Other environmental groups have warned of threats to the national parks and the service that maintains them during a government shutdown. When the government partially shut down during the first Trump administration, national parks remained open and unstaffed for 35 days, leading to rampant vandalism, habitat destruction and accumulation of garbage.

Last week, 35 former superintendents of the National Park Service urged the government to close the parks if a shutdown occurs and prevent further degradation.

“If you don’t act now, history is not just doomed to repeat itself, the damage could in fact be much worse,” they wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

The letter said parks were already “pushed to the brink” by staffing and budget reductions this year. Both the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service were among the administration’s priority cuts as part of its “energy dominance” initiatives to increase production of oil, gas and minerals on public lands.

Conservation advocates have described the cutbacks as part of larger plans to dismantle the agencies so parks and forests can be privatized. The sale of public lands was part of the Project 2025 agenda.

“A government shutdown will make an already bad situation at national parks and public lands far worse,” said a statement issued Tuesday by the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks and the Association of National Park Rangers. “Already pushed to the brink by budget cuts and staff reductions, our parks are on an unsustainable and dangerous path.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1456778/story_image/AP25192620768017.jpg?1752597392,N,,2025-10-05 13:01:13.206562

But President Trump, a supporter of fossil fuel production, terminated the solar tax credit as part of his spending bill.
Solar companies say their business began picking up this summer with the news that the federal credit would be ending.
Hare and others expect a tapering off but not an abandonment of an energy system that no longer seems niche.
Like the federal tax credits, they’ve proved popular with consumers, he said.","Paula Dufour can watch the sun rise from the front porch of her Carroll County home and set from the porch in back. Soon, she anticipates, the solar panels that she is adding to her roof could capture so many of those passing rays that she’ll be considered a producer, not just a consumer of energy.

Dufour is among those getting in under the wire on a federal tax credit on solar energy systems that was ended by the Trump administration. With the credit expiring on Dec. 31, consumers and solar companies are racing to get installations completed in the final months of the year to save 30% of the cost.

“It’s sort of like a mad rush, losing-my-mind busy,” said Gailan Wensil-Strow, a vice president of American Sentry Solar, which is installing Dufour’s system. “I’m working everyone as much as I can. I’m asking, ‘Who can work Saturday?'”

The clock is ticking for those who haven’t started the process of selecting an installation company, applying for local government permits and arranging with BGE to connect to the power grid. Some companies have stopped taking orders in jurisdictions where permitting may take too long to get the installation done in time.

“With the change in the federal policy, we’ve seen a surge in interest,” said Tim Lattimer, administrator of Howard County’s Office of Community Sustainability. “People don’t like to leave money on the table.”

The county partners with a solar co-op, Switch Together, that leverages bulk-purchasing capacity to negotiate lower prices. Nearly 300 residents have accepted estimates and put down deposits, county officials said, filling the calendars of the three designated installation companies through the end of the year.

With some variations, the federal credit has been available since 2005, most recently as part of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that extended it through 2032. But President Trump, a supporter of fossil fuel production, terminated the solar tax credit as part of his spending bill. Passed in July, the bill also ended, as of Sept. 30, a tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying electric vehicles.

Trump has mocked clean energy as the “Green New Scam,” and called wind and solar worthless when it’s dark, ignoring the existence of battery storage. Nonetheless, renewables are part of the U.S. energy portfolio, while fossil fuels still dominate. In the first half of 2025, fossil fuels produced 58% of the nation’s electricity, while solar accounted for 11.2%, wind 10.8% and nuclear 18%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The solar credits have helped make the initial investment in a system more affordable, consumers and companies said.

“I need that third off,” said Dufour, 68, a retired electrical engineer and IT specialist.

She expects to get a $16,218 credit off the $54,060 cost of adding new panels and a storage battery to her 4-year-old solar system. She also is taking advantage of a $5,000 state grant for batteries.

Awaiting approval of her permit and expecting installation in November, Dufour said her expanded system will give her an 18-kilowatt capacity to fuel her all-electric ranch house. The battery will allow her to store energy, helpful during power outages when she would lose access to her well water.

“I’ll be independent,” she said. “I’ll be considered a small energy producer.”

She uses a phone app to monitor the amount of energy she produces and uses. Excess energy goes to BGE, she said, which then gives her a credit.

“I don’t really like fossil fuels,” Dufour said, despite hailing from Texas, where “oil is king. I’m a big advocate of solar.”

Another solar user, Alan Klein, 71, of Columbia, said his system makes both environmental and economic sense.

He said he’d been thinking “off and on” for years of going solar, but thought he’d have to chop down the mature trees that shade his home. But no trees were harmed in the project when it turned out panels could be installed on his detached garage’s roof.

With a tax credit of about $6,500, the cost of his system dropped to $15,500, he said, and the panels soon proved their value.

“My bills over the summer went from $200 to $35,” he said.

Factoring in the tax credit, the typical solar installation in Maryland begins to pay back in about six to eight years, said Sukrit Mishra, Switch Together’s program director for the capital region at its partner group, Solar United Neighbors, or SUN.

Switch Together works in 10 states, and is available in Howard, Montgomery and Frederick counties and the city of Bowie.

Solar companies say their business began picking up this summer with the news that the federal credit would be ending.

“For people who were dragging their feet for years … well, if they were going to do it, now’s the time,” said Zac Hare, vice president of residential sales for Lumina Solar.

His sales have soared as a result, to $64 million in the first nine months of this year, compared to $36 million during the same time period last year.

Hare and others expect a tapering off but not an abandonment of an energy system that no longer seems niche.

“I don’t think the market is over. I think it’s coming out of its infancy,” Wencil-Strow said. “Now it has to learn how to be a full industry without their parents supporting them.”

Kimberly Armstrong, co-founder of Baltimore Green Justice Workers Cooperative, said the tax credits “absolutely” helped homeowners who otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford a solar system.

“You have a lot of people that want to participate but they couldn’t because it was not affordable or it was not accessible,” said Armstrong, whose company, Urban Clean Energy Advisors, offers energy consultation to help reach underserved communities.

Baltimore’s rowhouse-dominated landscape is not always as conducive to solar installation, she said, given that sloped rather than flat roofs are preferable. Additionally, some rowhouses may provide too small a job to attract some companies, she said.

“A lot of solar companies don’t want to work in Baltimore City because it’s not as profitable for them,” Armstrong said. “It’s only profitable if you have an entire block.”

Still, even in the city, this has been a boom year for solar. The city issued 403 permits for solar installations in the first nine months of this year, compared to 233 during the same time period last year. The number of permits has been trending upward since 2020, according to DHCD, when 100 were issued.

The city also is addressing what some companies said can be a lengthy permitting process and prioritizing solar applications, said Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the department.

“Additional engineers have also been brought in to review plans and applications in order to keep up with demand,” she said.

Advocates say solar will continue to attract homeowners at a time when both energy costs and demands on the grid, particularly from data centers, are rising. Consumers who switch to solar ultimately help reduce that strain, said Robin Dutta, executive director of the trade group, Chesapeake Solar and Storage Association.

“With utility rates going up as they are — and not stopping soon — [going solar] is one of the things consumers can do,” he said. “And it’s not just helping the homeowner, it’s helping the grid as well.”

With the end of the federal credits, some are looking to local and state governments to help make up the difference, and help the state achieve what are some of the nation’s most ambitious climate goals.

Eric Coffman, division director of energy programs at the Maryland Energy Administration, said Maryland has a range of incentives and rebates, although some have income and other restrictions. Like the federal tax credits, they’ve proved popular with consumers, he said.

“We are seeing a very significant uptick in our programs and applications for funding,” he said. “We have a full array of programs that aren’t going away.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lwQqW9sPhQa0Chk2hb5y9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/baltimore_sun_tribune_local_552/ed5d8979f8911f5e90c867af48dd2294,N,,2025-10-05 12:01:47.711779

Governments worldwide have encouraged companies to invest in CCS in recent years, funding green energy projects to help reduce the carbon emitted from oil and gas operations, and to allow countries to continue using fossil fuels to bridge the energy gap over the coming decades. However, as we see delays in the rollout of CCS projects and more evidence that suggests most CCS installations do not work as well as anticipated, many are questioning whether investing in this type of decarbonisation is viable.

CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide at emission sources, to be transported and stored or buried in a suitable deep, underground location. There is now a range of CCS technologies being used in fossil fuel and industrial operations worldwide, including conventional CCS installations and direct air capture (DAC), which removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere.

Following significant support from governments and fossil fuel companies worldwide, the CCS market could attract as much as $80 billion in investment by 2030, to support an anticipated 270 million tons of carbon dioxide capture a year. However, many scientists now suggest that financing CCS is a waste of money, as the technology does not work as effectively as previously expected, and it could detract from funding long-term green energy projects. A new report suggests that globally, the maximum reduction that CCS operations could achieve for the atmosphere would be 0.7 degrees Celsius, which is far short of the 5 Â°C to 6 Â°C industry and governments claim.

The U.K. has committed $40.5 billion to CCS technology in support of its net-zero emissions aims for 2050. The country hopes to find a way to reduce emissions in the mid-term as it gradually incorporates more renewable energy capacity into the energy mix, while it continues to rely heavily on oil and gas for power and heating. However, getting CCS projects off the ground has been no easy feat, with decades of delays under several governments.

The increased funding into CCS technology in recent years is supposed to have led to technological improvements and design innovation that will help suck more carbon from the sky. However, technology glitches and the high costs associated with installing CCS equipment have delayed projects and deterred companies from investing in CCS operations. Thilo Trabner, a business development manager for the Zurich-based CSS provider ABB, explained, ""First-of-a-kind technology challenges continue to contribute to delays in some projects, and reliance on subsidies and offtake agreements continues to play a critical role in project viability.""

Some of the projects for the U.K. include a gas power plant on Teesside in the north of England, which is expected to be operational by 2028, with plans to capture 95 percent of its emissions - around 2 million tonnes a year, and capacity to transport and store up to 4 million tonnes of carbon a year. Another three projects in the first round of the project pipeline are under negotiation, with plans to capture carbon from a methane-based blue hydrogen plant and energy from waste.

Related: Supermajors Slim Down to Protect Shareholder Payouts A government committee has questioned the cost-effectiveness of the planned CCS projects, warning against an over-reliance on CCS activities rather than investing in the country's long-term green energy goals. The government has already acknowledged that its target to capture between 20 and 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030 is no longer viable.

In Switzerland, one of the world's most well-known CCS companies, Climeworks, announced in May that it would be cutting its workforce by more than 10 percent, citing economic uncertainty and ""reduced momentum"" for CCS technology. Climeworks is famous for constructing the world's first DAC facilities. However, the company has come under fire as two of its flagship plants in Iceland were found to be capturing significantly less carbon than originally anticipated. Climeworks said that it was uncertain whether a third facility planned for the U.S. would go ahead due to the uncertain energy environment under President Trump.

DAC technology is much more expensive than conventional CCS equipment, but many companies have invested in DAC activities in recent years in response to government pressure to decarbonise. Now, recent reviews suggest that DAC technology is struggling to grow out of the pilot phase, as interest in the sector wanes. Climeworks said that at its flagship Mammoth plant in Iceland, which is thought to have a carbon capture capacity of 36,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the equipment captured just 750 tonnes in the first 10 months of operations.

The outlook for CCS technology is uncertain. In recent years, several governments, industries, and oil and gas companies have invested heavily in CCS technology in a bid to decarbonise. However, many of the planned projects have been delayed due to technological constraints and high costs. Now, reports on existing CCS activities suggest that the technology may not be working as successfully as anticipated, which has cooled investor interest in the sector and could cause progress in the CCS rollout to stall in the coming years.

Background and Context of Bangladesh’s Coastal Belt

Bangladesh’s coastal belt stretches along the southern edge of the country, encompassing a diverse range of ecosystems, including mangroves, wetlands, and sandy beaches. This region is not only rich in biodiversity but also supports a large population that relies on fishing, agriculture, and tourism for their livelihoods. However, the coastal belt is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, with rising sea levels and extreme weather events threatening both the environment and the communities that inhabit it.

The socio-economic conditions in this region are challenging. Many families live below the poverty line, lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and healthcare. Traditional energy sources, such as kerosene and firewood, are commonly used but pose health risks due to indoor air pollution and contribute to deforestation.

The need for sustainable energy solutions is urgent, as access to reliable electricity can significantly improve living conditions and economic opportunities for these communities.

The Need for Clean Energy in Bangladesh’s Coastal Belt

The reliance on traditional energy sources in Bangladesh’s coastal belt has far-reaching consequences. Not only do these sources contribute to environmental degradation, but they also perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality. Many households spend a significant portion of their income on energy costs, which limits their ability to invest in education, healthcare, and other essential services.

Furthermore, the lack of reliable electricity hampers local businesses and stifles economic growth. Clean energy solutions are essential for breaking this cycle. Access to renewable energy can enhance educational opportunities by providing lighting for evening study sessions and enabling the use of technology in schools.

It can also improve healthcare services by powering medical facilities and ensuring that vaccines are stored at appropriate temperatures. By transitioning to clean energy, we can create a healthier environment and foster economic development in the coastal belt.

Overview of Solar Energy as a Solution

Solar energy presents a viable solution to the energy challenges faced by Bangladesh’s coastal belt. With abundant sunlight throughout the year, this region is well-suited for solar power generation. Solar panels can be installed on rooftops or in community spaces, providing a decentralized energy source that is both sustainable and accessible.

Unlike traditional energy sources, solar power does not produce harmful emissions or contribute to climate change. Moreover, solar energy systems can be tailored to meet the specific needs of communities. From small-scale solar home systems that provide electricity for individual households to larger solar farms that can power entire villages, there are various options available.

The implementation of solar energy not only addresses immediate energy needs but also promotes long-term sustainability by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

Goals and Objectives of the Grant Proposal

The primary goal of this grant proposal is to implement solar energy solutions in Bangladesh’s coastal belt to improve access to clean and reliable electricity for local communities. To achieve this goal, we have outlined several specific objectives: 1. Install solar energy systems in at least 500 households within the first year of the project.

2.

Provide training and capacity-building workshops for community members on solar technology maintenance and usage.

3. Raise awareness about the benefits of clean energy through community outreach programs.

4. Establish partnerships with local organizations to ensure sustainability and community involvement in project implementation.

Project Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented in several phases to ensure effective execution and community engagement. The first phase will involve conducting a needs assessment to identify target communities and understand their specific energy requirements. This will be followed by the installation of solar energy systems in selected households, with a focus on ensuring that installations are done by trained local technicians.

In parallel with the installation process, we will conduct training workshops for community members on how to operate and maintain solar systems. These workshops will not only provide technical knowledge but also foster a sense of ownership among residents. Community outreach programs will be organized to raise awareness about the benefits of solar energy and encourage participation in the project.

Budget and Financial Plan

A detailed budget has been developed to outline the financial requirements for implementing this project successfully. The total estimated cost is $250,000, which includes expenses for solar panel procurement, installation labor, training workshops, community outreach activities, and monitoring and evaluation efforts. Funding will be sought from various sources, including government grants, private donations, and partnerships with local businesses.

A transparent financial plan will be established to ensure accountability and effective use of resources throughout the project duration.

Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy

To measure the success of the project, a robust monitoring and evaluation strategy will be implemented. Key performance indicators (KPIs) will be established to track progress towards objectives, such as the number of households receiving solar installations and participant satisfaction levels from training workshops. Regular progress reports will be generated to assess outcomes and identify areas for improvement.

Feedback from community members will be actively sought to ensure that their needs are being met and that they feel empowered throughout the process.

Potential Impact of the Grant Proposal

The potential impact of this grant proposal is significant. By providing access to clean energy solutions, we can improve living conditions for thousands of families in Bangladesh’s coastal belt. Enhanced access to electricity will lead to better educational opportunities for children, improved healthcare services, and increased economic activities within communities.

Furthermore, this project will contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term benefits of transitioning to solar energy extend beyond immediate improvements; they pave the way for a more resilient future in the face of climate change.

Partnerships and Collaborations

Collaboration is key to the success of this project. We plan to partner with local NGOs, government agencies, and community organizations that have experience working in the coastal belt. These partnerships will enhance our capacity to implement the project effectively while ensuring that it aligns with local needs and priorities.

Additionally, we aim to engage with academic institutions for research support and knowledge sharing regarding renewable energy technologies. By fostering these collaborations, we can leverage resources and expertise that will strengthen our efforts toward achieving sustainable development in Bangladesh’s coastal belt.

Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, this grant proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to address the urgent need for clean energy solutions in Bangladesh’s coastal belt through solar energy implementation. By improving access to reliable electricity, we can enhance quality of life while promoting environmental sustainability. The next steps involve securing funding through grant applications and building partnerships with local organizations.

We are committed to engaging with community members throughout this process to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are prioritized. Together, we can create a brighter future for Bangladesh’s coastal belt through clean energy solutions that empower communities and protect our planet.

On Sept. 30, a federal subsidy worth up to $7,500 expired as part of President Trump’s spending bill, making a new EV decidedly more expensive – at least in theory. As it turns out, some car makers themselves will continue to offer the discount, at least for a limited time.

GM, Ford and Hyundai will still offer the deals on some models, with the Korean car maker dropping the price of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by as much as $9,800.

Kelley Blue Book Executive Editor Brian Moody told Nexstar he’s optimistic that other automakers may follow suit.

“I would wait like a week or two, because I know that within that time period some automakers and some dealers are going to come up with a way of discounting those cars,” Moody said. “Maybe it’s going to be a super low payment lease with no money down. Maybe it’s going to be super low financing or something like that.”

Moody also recommends considering a used EV.

“Many used electric cars are just really priced right, like they’re really good deals, because new electric vehicles tend to depreciate very rapidly,” Moody said, adding that fears over the battery failing are largely unfounded.

“Of course, you’re going to have some that do that, but most EVs have a warranty of at least 8 yeas or 100,000 miles,” Moody said.

On Sept. 30, a federal subsidy worth up to $7,500 expired as part of President Trump’s spending bill, making a new EV decidedly more expensive – at least in theory. As it turns out, some car makers themselves will continue to offer the discount, at least for a limited time.

GM, Ford and Hyundai will still offer the deals on some models, with the Korean car maker dropping the price of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by as much as $9,800.

Kelley Blue Book Executive Editor Brian Moody told Nexstar he’s optimistic that other automakers may follow suit.

“I would wait like a week or two, because I know that within that time period some automakers and some dealers are going to come up with a way of discounting those cars,” Moody said. “Maybe it’s going to be a super low payment lease with no money down. Maybe it’s going to be super low financing or something like that.”

Moody also recommends considering a used EV.

“Many used electric cars are just really priced right, like they’re really good deals, because new electric vehicles tend to depreciate very rapidly,” Moody said, adding that fears over the battery failing are largely unfounded.

“Of course, you’re going to have some that do that, but most EVs have a warranty of at least 8 yeas or 100,000 miles,” Moody said.

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company.
The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future.
""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts.","BILLINGS, Mont. -- U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse.

Trump rejected climate change as a ""con job"" during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as ""beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed.

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

""Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,"" Paliwal said.

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually -- up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody's projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. ""The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.""

Now, a new milestone from General Motors and Pilot Company could finally help put that fear to rest, according to Utility Dive.
According to the outlet, Pilot recently announced that it has opened more than 200 EV charging stations across almost 40 states, nearly halfway to its target of 500 sites and 2,000 fast-charging stalls.

Now, a new milestone from General Motors and Pilot Company could finally help put that fear to rest, according to Utility Dive.

According to the outlet, Pilot recently announced that it has opened more than 200 EV charging stations across almost 40 states, nearly halfway to its target of 500 sites and 2,000 fast-charging stalls. The stations are being built in partnership with GM and EVgo, with many located in rural areas where charging options have traditionally been scarce.

""Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel,"" said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot.

The new stations are also designed with convenience in mind, placed at busy interstate travel centers — often with restaurants, Wi-Fi, and rest areas available where drivers plug in.

For EV owners, charging up at home remains the most affordable option, saving hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars each year compared to public fast charging. Public chargers can cost double or triple what it costs to recharge from your own outlet, which is why many drivers are also installing Level 2 chargers at home. Companies like Qmerit are helping to make the process simple, offering free estimates after a few quick questions about your electric panel and garage setup.

Nevertheless, expanding the highway network remains key to making EVs practical for everyone, from big cities to farm country. The ongoing adoption and adaptability of EVs is great for the planet as well — every mile driven on electricity helps to reduce the harmful pollution tied to gas-powered vehicles, which harms the health of our communities and increases global temperatures.

For those looking to stretch those savings even further, pairing home charging with the power of solar can really make a dent in your monthly bills as well.

Generating your own clean energy can power your car with sunlight and reduce your household's utility bills, and EnergySage can help you compare solar quotes for installation.

While it started from a lower base than many other countries, it is now outperforming even nations that began from a much stronger starting point. The Kingdom deliberately took time to lay solid foundations for clean energy growth toward 2030 and is now entering a dynamic take-off phase.

Saudi Arabia’s journey started in the last two decades and UNDP has been partnering with the Ministry of Energy for over 15 years to supercharge its sustainable energy objectives. UNDP partnered with the Ministry of Energy on the $100 million National Energy Efficiency Program, which resulted in the establishment of the Saudi Energy Efficiency Centre. Since 2019, UNDP worked with the Ministry of Energy to build capacity, advance renewable energy integration and deliver techno-economic analysis of new renewable resources. UNDP has also worked closely with the Ministry to study R&Dresearch and development priorities in the power sector and facilitated delegations to study international best practices.

UNDP has partnered with the Ministry of Energy for over 15 years to supercharge its sustainable energy objectives.

Saudi Arabia is preparing to remain a global energy leader through growth in affordable and sustainable energy. It aims for 50% renewable electricity by 2030, driven by its National Renewable Energy Program (NREP), and underpinned by its Net Zero by 2060 goal. The Kingdom is also improving environmental outcomes whilst saving costs through the Liquid Displacement Program, where cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity replace Heavy Fuel Oil and diesel.

In addition to its successful energy efficiency efforts over the last 15 years, Saudi Arabia is deploying solar energy at a faster rate than any country in history. The first large-scale, grid-connected utility solar PV project under the NREP was the 300 MW Sakaka PV IPP in November 2019. Developed by ACWA Power, Sakaka marked Saudi Arabia’s entry into utility-scale solar power production feeding directly into the national electricity grid. Since then, it has connected over 10.2 GW of renewable capacity and has over 33 GW in different stages of the development pipeline. It aims to tender 20 GW of renewables annually to achieved 2030 targets subject to electricity demand growth.

Saudi Arabia is deploying solar energy at a faster rate than any country in history.

This new, clean electricity will not only decarbonize the country’s grid, but it will also help to decarbonize the factories and transport systems of Europe and the Far East, by producing and exporting green hydrogen made from water and renewable electricity. With the ambition to be a major player in Artificial Intelligence data centers, it will also help decarbonize AI and digital infrastructure.

Beyond wind and solar, the Kingdom is exploring its vast geothermal potential along the Red Sea coast where tectonic activity is highest. This could provide reliable, renewable baseload power and capitalize on the country’s strong experience with drilling and subsurface mapping.

Research into civil nuclear power is also ongoing. Saudi hosts national civil nuclear research centres at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE), alongside nuclear engineering degrees at three leading universities.

Saudi is confident in its trajectory because it has carefully built a strong foundation that de-risks clean energy investments and will lead to the lowest renewable energy costs in the world. It is deploying 1,200 “meteorological masts” (weather stations) across the country to develop a national database of wind and solar patterns covering an area of 850,000 km2. These reliable measurements build confidence in expected generation, improve revenue forecasts, reduce project development timelines, and de-risk new projects, which lowers the cost of capital for project finance.

Saudi is confident in its trajectory because it has carefully built a strong foundation that de-risks clean energy investments and will lead to the lowest renewable energy costs in the world.

Building solar panels, wind turbines and manufacturing clean energy value chain components are important foundational steps. But operating a robust electricity grid safely and reliably adds a layer of complexity to the energy transition that is often underappreciated.

Saudi Arabia is now complementing its healthy pipeline of renewable energy projects with a renewables integration plan that aims to leapfrog the world’s fastest adopters. This includes large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) to enhance grid flexibility and reliability, enabling higher penetration of renewables. Saudi Arabia has already operated four BESS projects with a total capacity of 2GW / 8GWh. In addition, the country is developing a pipeline of 5.5 GW / 22 GWh of additional BESS projects, with a national target of reaching 48 GWh of storage capacity by 2030 as a part of its energy mix. And it has engaged the national energy ecosystem to develop a shared list of research, development and innovation priorities for the power sector, which will inform where and how the Research, Development and Innovation Authority should invest.

Lessons emerging from the long-standing partnership between the Saudi Ministry of Energy and UNDP highlight the importance of establishing a strong foundation from the outset—anchored in sound public policies and robust regulatory frameworks. Such a foundation enables the rapid scaling of clean energy–for–development initiatives supported by sustainable financing and investment. This approach has positioned Saudi Arabia to further consolidate its regional leadership in the energy space, demonstrating how energy can drive economic transformation and setting an example by fostering a holistic approach to the energy sector both domestically and across borders.",https://www.undp.org/themes/custom/undpglobal/images/meta-undp-logo.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 13:01:02.731577

On Sept. 30, a federal subsidy worth up to $7,500 expired as part of President Trump’s spending bill, making a new EV decidedly more expensive – at least in theory. As it turns out, some car makers themselves will continue to offer the discount, at least for a limited time.

GM, Ford and Hyundai will still offer the deals on some models, with the Korean car maker dropping the price of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by as much as $9,800.

Kelley Blue Book Executive Editor Brian Moody told Nexstar he’s optimistic that other automakers may follow suit.

“I would wait like a week or two, because I know that within that time period some automakers and some dealers are going to come up with a way of discounting those cars,” Moody said. “Maybe it’s going to be a super low payment lease with no money down. Maybe it’s going to be super low financing or something like that.”

Moody also recommends considering a used EV.

“Many used electric cars are just really priced right, like they’re really good deals, because new electric vehicles tend to depreciate very rapidly,” Moody said, adding that fears over the battery failing are largely unfounded.

“Of course, you’re going to have some that do that, but most EVs have a warranty of at least 8 yeas or 100,000 miles,” Moody said.

As for the future of electric vehicles in the United States under the Trump administration, carmakers are tempering expectations.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” Ford Motor CEO Jim told an audience in Detroit Wednesday, according to CNBC. “We’re going to find out in a month.

The Tennessee Valley Authority agreed to buy electricity from a small nuclear power plant that’s expected to go into service in 2030 and will help power data centers owned by Alphabet Inc.’s Google.

Kairos Power LLC is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee and also plans to construct a 50-megawatt version that may be the first advanced reactor to go into service in the US, according to a statement from August. Terms weren’t disclosed.

TVA will be the first US utility to buy power from an advanced reactor, a move that shows growing confidence in the nuclear industry’s ability to build new types of power plants. Technology companies are clamoring for energy for data centers that are running artificial intelligence systems. That’s driving up demand for electricity, especially clean power from reactors. This agreement follows Kairos’ October deal to supply power to Google.

Kairos is developing a reactor that uses molten fluoride salt as a coolant instead of water typically used in conventional nuclear plants. That will allow Kairos’ facility to operate at higher temperatures so it captures more energy from the fission reaction.

Ford, GM Reportedly Extending EV Incentives

Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) are reportedly extending the EV incentives offered to customers through December. The companies have made the extension possible by making down payments to dealers via their respective financing arms before September 30 to qualify the units for the credit.

The dealers would then pass the benefits of this credit to owners when they're purchasing the vehicles. It could also lead to lower monthly payments.

Stellantis, Hyundai, Lucid To Also Extend Incentives

Meanwhile, Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA), which also has an HQ in Michigan, will also be extending the incentives on EVs like Ford and GM, according to the Detroit Free Press on Thursday. However, unlike its crosstown rivals, the automaker is offering the EV incentive as a cash bonus on existing dealer inventory.

Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. (OTC:HMLYF) has also announced it will extend the EV incentives on its Ioniq 5 EV, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The company has also cut the prices of the Ioniq 5.

Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) also announced it would be extending the EV credit offered on its vehicles till the end of the year, according to the company’s interim CEO Marc Winterhoff, who shared that the company had several orders and didn’t want buyers to miss out on savings during an interview with Brew Markets last month.

Tesla, Rivian, Honda, Toyota Offer No Extensions

Elsewhere, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (NYSE:HMC), as well as Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) are offering no extensions on the EV credit.

Tesla had urged customers to lock in their purchases by paying a fee via a nominal down payment or trade-in on or before September 30, as updated IRS terms said that customers can take delivery after the deadline, too, provided a purchase agreement was in place on or before September 30.

Former Tesla Sales Chief Thinks EV Sales Will Grow Without Incentives

Interestingly, Jon McNeill, former Tesla President for Global Sales and Service, who currently serves as a member of the GM board, said that EV sales in the U.S. would grow despite the rolling back of incentives by Trump. He highlighted that the availability of models by manufacturers, as well as affordable options, will drive adoption in the country.

Gene Munster Thinks EV Makers Would Benefit From Trump's Pro-Gasoline Stance

Meanwhile, Deepwater Asset Management's investor Gene Munster says that EV makers like Tesla would benefit from anti-EV measures like the end of the tax credit, as it lessens the incentive for traditional automakers to invest in developing EVs, giving EV companies a scale advantage.

Wildfire risk and the capacity to address the challenge are going in opposite directions.
Deregulation and disinvestment may ultimately exacerbate wildfire risk.","The western United States is facing another destructive wildfire season, with more acres burned in Colorado alone in 2025 than in the past four years combined. If global warming continues on its current trajectory, the amount of forest area burned each year could double or even triple by midcentury.

In other words, more fire is coming, more often.

As U.S. forests burn, Congress and federal agencies are asking an important question: What role should federal land management play in reducing fire risk?

About two-thirds of forest land in the western U.S. is publicly owned, with the majority of it managed by federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. These public lands are treasured for recreation, wildlife habitat, timber production and open space. They are also where many of today’s largest fires burn.

Historically, lightning- and human-ignited fires kept forests less dense and reduced forest litter and undergrowth that can easily burn. While some controlled burning continues today, the violent displacement of Native people, criminalization of Indigenous fire stewardship and more than a century of federal fire suppression have largely removed fire as a critical ecological process in fire-prone forests, leaving fuel to accumulate.

When those forests burn today, the result is often hotter and more severe fires that elude any attempt at control. And rising global temperatures are raising the risk.

Several of the current federal proposals for managing fire risk focus on increasing timber harvesting on federal lands as a solution. They also propose speeding up approvals for those projects by limiting environmental reviews and public oversight.

As experts in fire science and policy, we see some useful ideas in the proposed solutions, but also reasons for concern.

While cutting trees can help reduce the severity of future fires, it has to include thinning in the right places to make a difference. Without oversight and public involvement, increasing logging could skip areas with low-value trees that need thinning and miss opportunities for more effective fire risk-reduction work.

Harvesting timber to reduce fire risk

President Donald Trump cited wildfire risk in his March 2025 executive order calling for “an immediate expansion of American timber production.” And the U.S. Forest Service followed with a commitment to increase timber sales on federal land by 25% over the next four years.

Trump, federal officials and members of Congress who are advancing legislation such as the Fix Our Forests Act have also called for speeding up approval of timber-harvesting projects by reducing public comment periods on proposals, limiting environmental analyses of the plans and curtailing the ability of groups to sue to block or change the projects in court.

These proposals are often framed as pragmatic solutions to clear the way for action to reduce fire risk faster. The urgency is real, and this argument can seem intuitive. No one wants burdensome processes to stand in the way of reducing wildfire damage. But it’s important to take a hard look at the problem and real solutions.

Environmental reviews aren’t the problem

Research shows that environmental reviews are rarely the main barrier to forest projects aimed at reducing fire risk.

The bigger obstacles are the shrinking of the federal forest workforce over the past two decades, the low commercial value of the small trees and brush that need to be removed, and the lack of contractors, processing facilities and markets for low-value wood.

Data from the U.S. Forest Service supports these conclusions.

Between 2005 and 2018, over 82% of the U.S. Forest Service’s land management projects were approved using categorical exclusions. Categorical exclusions allow agencies to skip environmental assessments and are the fastest and least burdensome form of National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, review, with limited analysis or opportunity for public involvement.

Less than 1% of the projects were challenged in court, and most of those challenges targeted the largest and most complex projects, where public oversight and analysis are critical to getting it right on the ground, such as large mining operations or forest management projects that would cover hundreds of thousands of acres.

An analysis of the bulk of U.S. Forest Service land management projects between 2009 and 2021 found that complying with NEPA took between 7% and 21% of the projects’ timelines, often shorter than the timelines for issuing contracts.

Some degree of planning, intergovernmental coordination and public involvement must happen before starting a fuel-reduction project to know where the work is appropriate and necessary.

Why reviews and public oversight matter

What would be lost if environmental-analysis and public-involvement requirements were curtailed?

Oversight helps ensure that projects happen where they are needed to reduce fire risk. Without that, political and economic pressures can lead to more forest thinning in locations where there are mills and valuable timber – rather than in the areas where wildfire risk is higher but the trees aren’t as valuable.

Environmental review and public comment are among the few tools communities have to shape fire-mitigation projects.

These processes also ensure that the work doesn’t stop at federal boundaries. And they help partners, such as community organizations, state agencies and local fire departments, plan and work together.

Oversight doesn’t just protect the environment — it enables funding and partnerships, safeguards communities and builds shared ownership of adapting to fire.

Solutions that work

So, what can Congress and the federal government do to reduce fire risk to communities? The answer starts with investing in forest management and projects that can reduce fire risk.

Joint projects involving communities and state, tribal and local agencies, like those under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, build partnerships to reduce fire risk across large landscapes and lower the risk of fire spreading to homes and federal wildlands. The Good Neighbor Authority, created in 2001, enables federal agencies to contract with states, counties and tribes to provide forest management work on federal lands.

Yet federal funding for state, tribal and private forest management is on the chopping block. Wildfire risk and the capacity to address the challenge are going in opposite directions.

The Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, a bipartisan group of fire professionals, scientists, tribes, land managers and local officials, recently released recommendations for improving fire management that call for greater funding and collaboration at all levels to reduce the fire risk. The report emphasizes the importance of proactive solutions driven by local communities, shared decision-making and better use of prescribed fire. Achieving these goals will require sustained collaboration across jurisdictions and sectors, with communities engaged as full partners in the process.

Forest and fire management are complex jobs. It is reasonable to yearn for quick solutions to the wildfire crisis, but it’s important that any fixes lead to lasting progress. Deregulation and disinvestment may ultimately exacerbate wildfire risk.

10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›

Cars are continually becoming smarter as automakers integrate more advanced safety and semi-autonomous systems into their products every year. All types of vehicles, including those with combustion engines, are incorporating these features. However, electric vehicles (EVs) are uniquely suited for advanced technology, as they're built on software systems.

That's creating a huge opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company has been building automotive tech solutions for years, and as electric vehicles become more commonplace, a massive opportunity is coming into focus for Nvidia's artificial intelligence tech to power the next generation of EVs.

How Nvidia's powering next-gen vehicles today

For years, Nvidia developed technology platforms and systems for vehicles in anticipation that one day they'd become an integral part of advanced vehicle systems. Those days are already here.

Nvidia's artificial intelligence platform DRIVE AGX and its AI vehicle processors DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Thor are being used by leading electric-vehicle companies to enhance in-vehicle software, safety systems, and semi-autonomous capabilities.

For example, the world's largest EV maker, BYD, partnered with Nvidia several years ago to use Nvidia's centralized computing platform to bring ""safe and intelligent vehicles to market."" Similarly, China-based Xiaomi EV built its SU7 sedan with Nvidia's DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions and uses AI to make navigation decisions in unknown driving environments.

American companies are tapping into Nvidia's DRIVE technology, as well. Electric-vehicle specialist Rivian uses it to enhance its safety features and driving technology, and also uses Nvidia's RTX Pro GPUs to power artificial intelligence and virtual reality for vehicle design.

Most recently, General Motors announced a new partnership with Nvidia, saying that it has used the tech giant's graphics processor for AI training in the past -- and is now expanding its partnership to include in-vehicle hardware and even assisting with the design of automotive plants and operations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said of the partnership, ""The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we're transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they're made.""

This is just scraping the surface of Nvidia's hardware and software integration into electric vehicles and semi-autonomous safety systems. In all, more than 20 automakers use Nvidia's processors and DRIVE platform to help power their next-generation vehicles.

The next-gen vehicle opportunity is massive for Nvidia

One of the biggest opportunities for Nvidia from next-gen vehicles is for automakers to increasingly use it to power autonomous vehicles. GM made this point clear when talking about its future vision for its own vehicles and its expectation to launch personal autonomous vehicles, or PAVs, in the future.

GM's senior VP of Software and Services Engineering Dave Richardson said, ""The work we're doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes.""

Nvidia announced a new full-stack DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform that's in full production now, with plans to deploy into intelligent transportation systems soon. In short, Nvidia's tech could help make these new autonomous systems a reality. And the opportunity is massive.

""We believe automotive is a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia,"" said Ali Kani, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of automotive.

The company's not quite there yet. Its automotive revenue was just $586 million in Q2, though it did improve by an impressive 69% from the year-ago quarter. But some estimates put the projected revenue for autonomous vehicle platform providers near $2.6 trillion globally by 2030 -- making this a huge opportunity for Nvidia.

Worth the wait

Most new vehicles, electric and otherwise, have some level of semi-autonomous systems built into them these days. As these features become more commonplace and companies expand their in-vehicle technologies for EVs, Nvidia's current partnerships and tech make it well-positioned to benefit from the growth.

Considering that Nvidia is already a dominant artificial intelligence company that's tapping into huge demand for AI data centers, investors can benefit from owning Nvidia stock now -- while they wait for the company to benefit from powering next-gen vehicles in the coming years.

The Volkswagen ID.3, ID.4 and ID. Buzz, as well as the Skoda Enyaq and Cupra Born are among the affected models.

Without battery preconditioning, fast charging in cold climates can be very time-consuming. Now, though, there’s a solution.

The first batch of Volkswagen’s modern electric cars was not without fault. Many of the issues were eventually solved through software updates, but one major sticking point is still there for early customers of cars like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Skoda Enyaq.

In MEB-based EVs assembled anywhere from 2021 to early 2024, there is no way to preheat the high-voltage battery pack before plugging into a DC fast charger. As a result, it will take longer to charge when it’s cold outside because the battery restricts power if it’s not at the ideal temperature.

What makes it even more frustrating is the fact that these cars have all the hardware needed to keep the battery at the right temperature. There’s just no way to manually turn on preconditioning. Instead, the EV’s brain uses the heater and coolant pump to keep the battery temperature from dropping too low, but that’s it.

In newer cars with the latest software, owners can preheat the battery by tapping on the screen. Now, though, there’s a solution for pre-2024 MEB EVs too—you’ll just have to build it yourself.

Thankfully, it’s not too difficult. The solution, which was created by security engineer Fredrik Gustafsson, comes in the form of a small circuit board that taps into the car’s battery management system (BMS) harness. Gustafsson has instructions on his GitHub page, but here’s the gist of it.

The small circuit board that sends commands to the BMS needs to be programmed using a separate USB dongle. After the software is loaded onto the board, it needs to be connected to an extension cable that taps into the BMS connector, which is located behind the glovebox. Altogether, the parts cost roughly $40 to $50, plus the time it takes to build it all.

Here’s where things get a little inelegant. To activate the battery heater and associated coolant pump, the little circuit board needs to be powered from a USB power source via a USB-C cable. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s not exactly modern, either. Additionally, there’s no way of knowing what the preconditioning system is doing—what’s the battery temperature or what state the heater is in, this sort of thing.

Please note: Messing with your car's BMS is risky business, and doing this probably will void any warranties. We can't exactly recommend you go this route.

At the same time, Gustafsson says that the car has all the necessary failsafes in place to prevent any damage from happening. So when the battery reaches the right temperature, the heater turns off.

More details can be found on the creator’s GitHub page, as well as on the VWIDTalk forum. And there’s more good news, too. Gustafsson already has a second, more refined version of his system, which uses a smartphone app to control the battery heater and monitor all the information. Although version 2 is functional, Gustafsson said that he hasn’t figured out a way to reliably distribute the parts, as the circuit board for this second attempt is custom-made.

Until that happens, though, the first iteration with the USB-C cable is the best solution for Volkswagen, Skoda and Cupra EV owners who desperately need battery preconditioning. It’s not perfect, but it works.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9mpW3y/s1/volkswagen-id.4-battery-heating-mod.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:01:57.535412

Whether it is a beautiful bill from an investment standpoint is in the eye of the beholder. Like most new legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has winners and losers.

A larger tax credit, a bigger tax deduction, a more sizable write-off, a less-onerous regulation, or a booster shot from increased government spending can lift profits for companies that benefit.

On the flip side, the end of a sizable subsidy, the phasing out of a tax break or major cuts to government programs can impair sales, resulting in earnings headwinds for negatively affected companies.

Below, we list some of the biggest investment beneficiaries of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, and some of its victims, too. Prices and returns are as of July 31.

Play offense with defense

Trump's signature legislation delivered on his promise to spend more to strengthen the military. OBBBA increases defense spending by $150 billion, pushing the U.S. defense budget for fiscal year 2026 over $1 trillion, the largest in U.S. history.

A sizable chunk of the money will go toward priorities such as the Golden Dome missile defense shield. Other imperatives include building naval ships and developing next-generation munitions and unmanned drone weaponry, as well as replenishing weapons stockpiles.

Increased military spending by European allies and unstable geopolitics add to the case for the defense sector.

You don't have to be an army general to conclude that weapons-related companies have a tailwind. ""The defense industry is an overwhelming winner,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management.

Investors looking to boost exposure to the defense sector can mimic a precision-guided smart bomb and try to pinpoint individual stocks, or they can take a cluster-bomb approach and gain access to a wider array of munitions makers through a diversified exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the sector.

Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research and analytics at CFRA Research, likes the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which is up 36% this year and holds about 40 stocks, including top holdings such as GE Aerospace (GE), RTX (RTX), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).

Another option is the Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA), up 27% in 2025. Holdings include top defense contractors plus tech stocks with Pentagon ties, such as Palantir (PLTR), a data analytics company that uses artificial intelligence to support military operations and intelligence gathering.

Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), a leading shipbuilder that earns 80% of its revenue from the U.S. Navy, ""stands to benefit from the Department of Defense's renewed focus on expanding the Navy's fleet size,"" says CFRA analyst Matthew Miller, who rates the stock a Buy.

Seth Meyer, global head of client portfolio management at Janus Henderson Investors, is bullish on Howmet Aerospace (HWM). Its specialized aircraft components get kudos for being lighter, faster, stronger and more cost-effective.

Howmet's parts helped land the Apollo spacecraft on the moon and are used in military aircraft, such as Lockheed Martin's drones and F-35 fighter jet. The stock is a top-10 holding in the Janus Henderson Forty and Janus Henderson Contrarian funds.

Surf the reshoring wave

It's no secret that Trump wants companies to build their products on U.S. soil. The OBBBA offers tax incentives for firms to embrace the ""Made in America"" policy. ""The bill is incentivizing behavior change,"" says Meyer.

Growth-friendly OBBBA provisions include making permanent a 100% bonus depreciation — a type of tax break that allows companies to deduct a percentage of the purchase price of eligible assets.

Companies can now deduct the entire cost (up from 40% previously) of qualifying property, such as machinery and equipment, in the year it's put into service — no need to spread deductions over multiple years and wait to realize the tax benefits.

The new law also allows full expensing of domestic research-and-development expenses in the year they occur, cutting corporate tax bills and boosting cash flow.

Another perk aimed at encouraging investment in the homeland is 100% expensing, or immediate deductions, for certain manufacturing spending, such as upgrades to factories or assembly lines.

Manufacturing and heavy-machinery businesses such as Deere (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) will benefit if customers spend more on capital equipment due to savings on taxes, says Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management.

""If I need a new tractor, I'm going to invest while I know [the tax breaks] are on the books,"" he says. For broad exposure to the industrials sector, Stanley likes the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ), a fund that owns about 200 stocks.

Among individual stocks, consider Trane Technologies (TT), best known for its energy-efficient HVAC systems, says Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management.

Trane is likely to see higher demand from customers with more cash to plow into their business thanks to the OBBBA tax breaks, Teal says. Another plus: Trane has limited tariff risk, says Morningstar analyst Brian Bernard. (Trane is a member of the Kiplinger ESG 20, our favorite stocks and funds with an environmental, social or governance focus.)

Vulcan Materials (VMC), a producer of construction materials such as crushed stone, sand, gravel, asphalt and concrete, is a top pick of Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at wealth management firm Villere & Co. ""There's going to be a big tailwind with all the incentives for U.S. manufacturing,"" he says.

Catch the AI train

The new law is a potential accelerant for the already fast-growing artificial intelligence business.

""Getting semiconductor production on-shore is a key strategic focus of the Trump 2.0 administration,"" says Meyer. The OBBBA gives semiconductor makers incentives to break ground before 2026 on new plants to build high-powered chips.

The carrot? Boosting the tax credit to 35% from 25%.

Capital Group portfolio manager Matt Hochstetler says tech stocks that can benefit include Micron Technology (MU) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). (The latter is liable for U.S. corporate taxes and qualifies for the credit.)

There will be losers

Trump is not a big backer of clean energy. The OBBBA's December 31 phase-out of the tax credit allowing homeowners to deduct 30% of the cost of installing solar panels from federal taxes could lead to a 20% to 30% drop in home solar installations, denting the sales of U.S. solar panel makers, according to CPA firm Cerini & Associates.

And the end of the $7,500 tax credit on September 30 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle will cut into EV sales.

Sizable cuts to Medicaid are a negative for hospitals that treat low-income patients. Such hospitals may face lower revenues due to fewer patients, and they risk not getting paid by patients who lose coverage. The cuts will also harm health insurers that derive a large chunk of their revenue from Medicaid plans.

That's creating a huge opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia (NVDA -0.77%). The company has been building automotive tech solutions for years, and as electric vehicles become more commonplace, a massive opportunity is coming into focus for Nvidia's artificial intelligence tech to power the next generation of EVs.

How Nvidia's powering next-gen vehicles today

For years, Nvidia developed technology platforms and systems for vehicles in anticipation that one day they'd become an integral part of advanced vehicle systems. Those days are already here.

Nvidia's artificial intelligence platform DRIVE AGX and its AI vehicle processors DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Thor are being used by leading electric-vehicle companies to enhance in-vehicle software, safety systems, and semi-autonomous capabilities.

For example, the world's largest EV maker, BYD, partnered with Nvidia several years ago to use Nvidia's centralized computing platform to bring ""safe and intelligent vehicles to market."" Similarly, China-based Xiaomi EV built its SU7 sedan with Nvidia's DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions and uses AI to make navigation decisions in unknown driving environments.

American companies are tapping into Nvidia's DRIVE technology, as well. Electric-vehicle specialist Rivian uses it to enhance its safety features and driving technology, and also uses Nvidia's RTX Pro GPUs to power artificial intelligence and virtual reality for vehicle design.

Most recently, General Motors announced a new partnership with Nvidia, saying that it has used the tech giant's graphics processor for AI training in the past -- and is now expanding its partnership to include in-vehicle hardware and even assisting with the design of automotive plants and operations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said of the partnership, ""The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we're transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they're made.""

This is just scraping the surface of Nvidia's hardware and software integration into electric vehicles and semi-autonomous safety systems. In all, more than 20 automakers use Nvidia's processors and DRIVE platform to help power their next-generation vehicles.

The next-gen vehicle opportunity is massive for Nvidia

One of the biggest opportunities for Nvidia from next-gen vehicles is for automakers to increasingly use it to power autonomous vehicles. GM made this point clear when talking about its future vision for its own vehicles and its expectation to launch personal autonomous vehicles, or PAVs, in the future.

GM's senior VP of Software and Services Engineering Dave Richardson said, ""The work we're doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes.""

Nvidia announced a new full-stack DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform that's in full production now, with plans to deploy into intelligent transportation systems soon. In short, Nvidia's tech could help make these new autonomous systems a reality. And the opportunity is massive.

""We believe automotive is a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia,"" said Ali Kani, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of automotive.

The company's not quite there yet. Its automotive revenue was just $586 million in Q2, though it did improve by an impressive 69% from the year-ago quarter. But some estimates put the projected revenue for autonomous vehicle platform providers near $2.6 trillion globally by 2030 -- making this a huge opportunity for Nvidia.

Worth the wait

Most new vehicles, electric and otherwise, have some level of semi-autonomous systems built into them these days. As these features become more commonplace and companies expand their in-vehicle technologies for EVs, Nvidia's current partnerships and tech make it well-positioned to benefit from the growth.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/834068/red-cars-under-construction-factory-1733213138.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 14:00:48.969746

“The evidence is that targeted investments here connect innovators to entrepreneurs — and you see companies like Encore CO₂ form because the pieces are already nearby.” Can energy’s past be part of the energy future?
“And we need a world-class Louisiana workforce to do it.” The company points to a growing CCS pipeline and storage network stretching across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.","A Louisiana State University chemical engineering professor perfected electrolyzers that turn waste carbon dioxide into useful stuff.

At a local gym in Baton Rouge, he met the entrepreneur behind a nearby craft brewery. Joined by a risk-tolerant PhD coming back home, they formed Encore CO₂, a company that is using a hard seltzer product to demonstrate its other industrial uses for repurposing a waste product into a resource.

That satisfying mix of science and serendipity is backed by strategy, said Michael Mazzola, the executive director of Future Use of Energy in Louisiana.

FUEL is a consortium created to administer one of the National Science Foundation’s Regional Innovation Engines: a program that was billed as putting up to $1.6 billion into almost a dozen regional efforts to advance applied science.

Like the EDA Tech Hubs program, its US Dept. of Commerce cousin, the NSF Engines program is a well-regarded bipartisan test of modern industrial policy — government investments into favored industries. Whether both can survive, or even grow, under successive presidential administrations is a bellwether on the question of how the United States can respond to a perceived challenge from the Chinese Communist Party to “overwhelm” Americans in science and technology. That the Trump administration opened a funding call to tech hubs is a good signal, but the National Science Foundation has received even cuts than the Commerce Department, one federal budget watcher told me this month.

For now, FUEL is among the program’s bright lights: an “ecosystem approach” in a reliably Republican state that pairs serious scientific research with hard-charging entrepreneurship, reliable corporate stewardship and responsive workforce development.

Encore CO₂ is one of Mazzola’s first case studies, as FUEL invested a $200,000 grant into the startup. He’ll need more examples. Anyone who knows anything about startup investing, or scientific research for that matter, knows that a smart strategy needs lots of bets.

Government is famously less risk tolerant than (and at least as fickle as) private investors. So Mazzola, like the principal investigators leading dozens of other place-based industrial policy programs enacted in the last half-decade, has a tall order: Appease federal bureaucrats, local policymakers and a growing list of stakeholders while ensuring credible science leads to good-faith bets on the market.

Meanwhile, for Mazzola, all that hangs in the balance of his program that could be funded up to $160 million over years, is the future of energy.

‘People and place’

Any fair criticism of direct government funding of commercialized science, as opposed to basic research, typically starts from the idea that too many goals get heaped into the strategy to ensure political support.

FUEL, like its peers, has priorities that are economic, workforce, scientific and political.

One reason regions still covet these sorts of programs is they typically come with a satisfying reinforcement of a local identity. In FUEL’s case, its focus ensures Louisiana’s role in the future of energy — a foundational building block of modern life.

No question Louisiana already plays a major role. The state is a top five natural-gas producer in the United States, and top 15 for energy production overall — though little from renewables so far. It’s also a heavyweight in petrochemicals, as the group’s NSF application reinforced.

Wedged between the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, fully five of the top 15 American ports that handle the most cargo are in Louisiana, per 2023 data. Much of the value of that tonnage comes from shipping out an array of oil and gas products.

Louisiana’s argument is that it’s a crossroads, and a low-carbon economy must go through its state lines.

“This program is about people in place,” Mazzola told me. “The evidence is that targeted investments here connect innovators to entrepreneurs — and you see companies like Encore CO₂ form because the pieces are already nearby.”

Can energy’s past be part of the energy future?

Too many “ecosystem” initiatives announce a bootcamp and call it a day, argues FUEL’s workforce lead Lacy McManus. An existing workforce is helpful, but new energy forms will demand new skills.

“We go where there’s momentum and capital-stack our programs,” McManus said of piecing together existing programs to fill gaps. “We’re co-designing with employers from the jump.”

One example: a teacher professional-development intensive run through SOWELA Technical Community College that bakes carbon-management and entrepreneurship modules directly into rural classrooms. FUEL seeded it with $100,000, and oil and gas giant ExxonMobil expanded it after seeing generative outcomes.

Herein lies understandable skepticism. Can any leader from energy’s past really play a part in energy’s future?

This debate appears elsewhere: Can the “bridge fuel” of natural gas really be an “environmentally sustainable” way to power data centers in Pennsylvania? (Yes, if the transition isn’t allowed to be a stall tactic).

“We’re not standing still,” Michael Butler of ExxonMobil’s public and government told me of the obvious critique. Towering energy giants must be part of the transition, and so they’re building carbon capture and storage across the Gulf Coast — capturing CO₂ from hard-to-abate sites and storing it thousands of feet underground. “And we need a world-class Louisiana workforce to do it.”

The company points to a growing CCS pipeline and storage network stretching across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

What to watch

FUEL has put numbers on the table: 60 companies, with 80% building wealth in Louisiana, and a path toward $2 billion in impact from carbon-management innovation.

Mazzola joked that he’s competing against energy-giant Texas, which is half-true. He wears a place-based economic developer’s hat, and so Louisiana is his top priority. But if he manages to reach his goals, the energy problems his coalition helps address ought to benefit the rest of us.

If the energy transition is going to be real, it won’t be invented along in a think tank conference room. It will be commercialized in the places that already move the molecules — on river corridors, near refineries and along pipeline rights-of-way — by people who can turn a lab breakthrough into a payroll line.

Louisiana’s brewpub-to-bench-to-startup story is a reminder: The future shows up locally first, or it doesn’t show up at all.

Mazzola is here for it. He told me: “I hope everyone else is watching.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/encore-co2-founders-FUEL-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:59:41.071085

By adding the 40 new members, the total stakeholders in the alliance now sit at 49, with more on the way if the current trend continues.

The H2med Alliance has taken considerable steps to establish a cooperative relationship between its partners

Hydrogen was there at the beginning of the universe and remains the most abundant element in the known universe. For a very long time indeed, the nations of the world, in particular those with alternative energy generation ambitions, have sought to increase the attention paid to the hydrogen sector.

At an event in Germany’s capital city, Berlin, the stakeholders of the H2Med alliance revealed that it has added an astonishing 40 new members, which can only benefit the lofty ambitions of cooperative relationships in the most mature hydrogen corridor in the European Union.

The H2med Alliance was launched in December 2024 by the five promoters of the H2med Corridor, which include:

REN (Portugal)

Enagás (Spain)

NaTran and Teréga (France)

OGE (Germany)

Along with leading companies in the energy and technology sectors, the H2Med alliance aims to consolidate itself as a reference platform for the development of the H2Med corridor in the EU.

The Deputy Director-General for Energy of the European Commission, Mechthild Wörsdörfer, underscored the European Commission’s support for the priority “Energy Highways” presented by President Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union address on September 10.

Institutional representatives emphasized the importance of cross-border cooperation

Gone are the days when countries were left to their own devices to develop innovative energy solutions to meet the rising power demands in their regions. Nowadays, the global community is fostering cooperation with several cross-border institutions and companies in the energy sector.

The meeting in Germany saw a vast number of government representatives in attendance, which underscores the cooperative narrative that the H2Med alliance is developing. Industry insiders emphasized the need to coordinate timelines to ensure the economic viability of projects in the hydrogen sector.

The European Union’s leadership released a statement underlining the role that hydrogen plays in the region.

“Renewable hydrogen is a crucial component of our strategy for a cost-effective clean energy transition and to get rid of Russian fossil fuels in some industrial processes. Clear rules and a reliable certification system are key for this emerging market to develop and establish itself in Europe. These delegated acts provide much-needed legal certainty to investors, and will further boost the EU’s industrial leadership in this green sector.” – Kadri Simson, Commissioner for Energy

In contrast to the developments that the H2Med alliance has reported, the Energy Information Agency has reported that the outlook for the hydrogen sector will decline by 2030, pointing to a need for more cooperation in the sector.

Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.
There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.
Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
Aging plants and optimism The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.

The funding will cover the entire cost of the project, which is expected to be completed by October 2026.

The project will consist of rehabilitating the city’s wastewater collection system to make a fully functioning wastewater collection system. When complete, the project is expected to result in reduced sanitary sewer overflows and will extend the wastewater system’s life and efficiency so that it can continue serving the city well into the future.

Project funding consists of a $2.48 million loan and a $3.5 million grant, both through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. The department’s funding is estimated to save the city’s ratepayers $3.5 million in principal and approximately $1.2 million in interest over the loan’s 20-year term.

“Today’s announcement of nearly $6 million for water infrastructure projects provides critical funding for the community of Mountain View to keep its residents healthy and help protect the environment while keeping utility bills affordable,” said Kurt Schaefer, Director of the department of Natural Resources.

The department’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund finances improvements to wastewater treatment facilities, sewer collection system rehabilitation and extensions, and combined sewer overflow corrections. The fund also finances security, efficiency and conservation measures. Communities that borrow from the fund benefit from the below-market interest rate and from a department project manager’s assistance throughout the project.

The department is committed to assisting Missouri communities with water and wastewater infrastructure improvement projects. Through its Financial Assistance Center, the department provides funding opportunities for qualified communities with water quality, wastewater and drinking water infrastructure needs.

That’s where Gov. Jeff Landry seemingly found himself last Sunday after new aerial drone video footage from photographer Eric McVicker revealed the sorry state of the cleanup at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Tangipahoa Parish – more than five weeks after the Aug. 22 explosion and fire. The video showed an adjacent large pond covered in petroleum products that leaked from the plant, and it pans over to show an oily slick extending into the nearby Tangipahoa River.

That petrochemical runoff has flowed some 40 miles downriver toward Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say that body of water has not been affected so far.

The governor was so moved by what he saw on McVicker’s footage that he posted his own video from the Governor’s Mansion to express his dissatisfaction with remediation efforts.

“They’re not going fast enough,” he said about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led effort.

Landry said he arranged a call with EPA Regional Administrator Scott Mason, Louisiana Environmental Quality Secretary Courtney Burdette and state Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.

“Starting tomorrow morning, things are getting ready to start changing on the cleaning up of that site,” the governor said Sunday.

But when the governor led a news conference Wednesday in Tangipahoa Parish, his tone had softened considerably. In response to reporters’ questions about the enhanced response measures Landry had promised, he came to the EPA’s defense.

“While I know it’s real easy to throw popcorn from the stands and it’s easy to make criticisms when you’re not on the ground, I will tell you that this incident is a unique incident. It falls between regulatory bodies,” Landry said.

Chief Executive Officer Robert Feurle struck an optimistic tone, stating that ""Wolfspeed has now entered a new era.""","The semiconductor manufacturer Wolfspeed has successfully concluded its independent restructuring process, formally exiting Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the end of September. This corporate turnaround, however, came at a steep cost for existing shareholders, who saw their investments nearly wiped out as creditors assumed control of the reorganized company. The development marks a pivotal moment for this pioneer in silicon carbide technology.

Shareholder Wipeout Paves Way for Financial Overhaul

A drastic financial restructuring has positioned Wolfspeed with a significantly stronger balance sheet. The company slashed its total debt burden by approximately 70%, eliminating some $4.6 billion in liabilities. Terms for the remaining debt were extended out to 2030, and the firm anticipates its annual interest expenses will drop by about 60%.

This financial reset delivered a devastating blow to equity holders. All previously outstanding common shares were cancelled entirely. In exchange, former shareholders received a minuscule allocation of new equity—roughly one new share for every 120 old shares they held. This equated to a harsh exchange ratio of just 0.008352 new shares per cancelled share. The majority stake in the newly formed entity was allocated to the former creditors. Trading in the old shares was suspended on September 29, with their formal delisting from the NYSE scheduled for October 10.

A Fresh Start for a Leading-Edge Technology Provider

Despite its financial collapse, Wolfspeed's underlying business remains focused on cutting-edge semiconductor materials. The company specializes in producing silicon carbide and gallium nitride chips, which are critical components for electric vehicles, 5G infrastructure, renewable energy systems, and artificial intelligence applications.

Chief Executive Officer Robert Feurle struck an optimistic tone, stating that ""Wolfspeed has now entered a new era."" The improved capital structure is expected to help the corporation meet rising demand in its core markets. The board of directors has also been strengthened with the addition of five new, experienced members.

Scaling Operations and the Upcoming Quarterly Test

Looking ahead, Wolfspeed is focusing on scaling its operations. This strategy includes the recent commercialization of its 200mm silicon carbide product portfolio and ramping up output at new manufacturing facilities. The John Palmour Manufacturing Center for Silicon Carbide in North Carolina is poised to play a central role in this expansion.

The first major test for the reborn company will arrive in early November with the release of its inaugural quarterly earnings report since completing the restructuring. This financial update will reveal whether the drastic financial overhaul has successfully set the company on a stable path to growth or if further challenges lie ahead.

What's the used car market been like? And and how does that compare to some of these newer vehicles on the market?

Well, one thing we know is that electric cars tend to depreciate very rapidly. So whenever you see analysis of the cost to own, factor in initial purchase price and depreciation. The good news for consumers is that if you're looking for an electric car, a used electric car will be an amazing bargain. Like they are really competitive in terms of pricing. But at the same time, you get lots of compelling features and you get lots of cool safety equipment. So it can work out for consumers if they're looking for a good used electric car.

And finally, for shoppers looking to buy or trade in, end of year is usually that time that we see the most deals, the more the most tax incentives. Is that still the case this time around or did that playbook change a bit with the expiration of these tax credits?

I I think there's a there's several things putting pressure on that. Of course, you're going to see a little bit of that. It's going to be model by model, not brand by brand. But the two things that we're seeing is the expiration of the incentives plus tariffs. All of those things could have the potential to make the 2026 cars more expensive so that you may be able to get a discount on the 2025, but that's probably it. Going forward, not every automaker can afford to absorb the tariffs as many are doing right now.

All right, Brian, a lot to think about as we head towards the end of the year. Appreciate it. Thanks so much.

At the end of the day, it's just a bit of pretty good news for Ford and GM for the fourth quarter.","Unless you've been hiding under a rock (and some days that may seem like a solid idea), you're probably aware of the Trump administration's stance on electric vehicles (EVs). The administration has suspended the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases effective Sept. 30 and rolled back a number of other EV policies. On top of that, new tariffs on imported vehicles and automotive parts have thrown uncertainty into the industry picture.

But here's a little good news for some investors: Ford Motor Company (F 3.52%) and General Motors (GM 1.20%) have figured out a mini-loophole to help extend the federal tax credit to customers in the fourth quarter.

What's going on?

Ford and GM are working smarter, not harder, to extend the $7,500 federal tax incentive on EVs in the U.S. to help mitigate what was expected to be a fairly large slump following the end of the credit.

The Detroit automakers are cleverly using their finance arms to offer the incentive beyond its Sept. 30 expiration date. The way this is achieved is for Ford and GM's finance arm to make down payments on the EVs even before finding customers wanting to lease the vehicles.

""If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before September 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after September 30, 2025.""

That's what the IRS guidance says, according to Automotive News, which confirmed the existence of these programs.

Essentially, these down payments will qualify the financing arms for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles, and from there, dealers can offer leases on those cars to retail customers per usual for several more months, with the subsidy factored into the lease rate.

These clever programs are aimed at mitigating the impact of the ending tax credit, which, to the surprise of many, has been in place for more than 15 years, trying to push EV adoption. Further, Ford confirmed to Reuters that it was working on its program to provide customers with competitive lease payments through Ford Credit until Dec. 31, effectively extending the federal $7,500 tax credit through leasing through the fourth quarter and pushing back some of the expected upcoming EV sales slump into 2026.

For those wondering if this will impact Tesla (TSLA -1.41%), the answer is unclear. Tesla does indeed have its own in-house finance arm, known as Tesla Finance LLC, but it's yet to be confirmed as of this writing if Tesla developed a similar program through its finance arm -- although, because the impact for Tesla is likely to be much larger than Ford or GM's EV divisions, it's a development for investors to watch for.

What it all means

EV sales have yet to gain the traction in the U.S. market once anticipated by automakers just a few years ago, and for the most part, they're still money losers. But the only way to make these vehicles profitable is to substantially increase scale, which the loss of the $7,500 tax credit works directly against.

In a way, this is the best of both worlds for Ford and GM. On one hand, it can still drive demand for its EVs during the fourth quarter, perhaps when competitors cannot, helping build more scale and delay the eventual slowdown of EVs in the post-tax-credit era. Meanwhile, as that continues to drive fourth-quarter EV demand, as consumers shift back slightly toward internal combustion engine options, the automakers stand to benefit from sales of much more profitable vehicles in the near-term.

At the end of the day, it's just a bit of pretty good news for Ford and GM for the fourth quarter.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835777/2024-silverado-ev-rst-020.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 05:58:56.665739

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse.

Trump rejected climate change as a ""con job"" during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as ""beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed.

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

""Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,"" Paliwal said.

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually -- up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody's projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. ""The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.""

Cambodia’s clean energy transition took center stage this week as policymakers, investors, and development partners gathered for Clean Energy Week 2025, organized by EnergyLab Cambodia. The event underscored both the vast opportunities and the sobering challenges in transforming the Kingdom’s energy system into one that is competitive, sustainable, and investment-ready.

A Vision for Smarter, Sustainable Growth

At the Clean Energy Summit, Hem Vanndy, Minister of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, urged Cambodia’s industries to embrace renewable energy as the cornerstone of future growth.

“Clean energy is no longer an alternative; it is the imperative,” he said. “To remain competitive, Cambodia must embed clean energy into every factory, every supply chain, and every industrial policy.”

Vanndy said renewables such as solar, hydro, and wind can lower costs for manufacturers and make “Made in Cambodia” products more attractive to global brands increasingly demanding sustainability in their supply chains. Yet, he cautioned that the shift must go beyond rhetoric. “Our energy system must evolve from simply providing power to providing power smartly, sustainably, and strategically,” he added.

Backing from Partners, But Financing Challenges Persist

Australian Ambassador to Cambodia Derek Yip reaffirmed Australia’s long-term support through the Cambodia-Australia Partnership for Resilient Economic Development (CAPRED), highlighting new initiatives to improve renewable energy forecasting and grid management.

“We’re working closely with the Royal Government to strengthen the country’s capacity to integrate variable renewable energy,” Yip said. He also announced the Cambodia Climate Financing Facility, expected to unlock around $350 million for climate-friendly investments.

UNDP Resident Representative Enrico Gaveglia said Cambodia’s clean energy transition holds the key to achieving its sustainable development ambitions but warned of the capital intensity of the shift. “UNDP stands ready to support the Royal Government in mobilizing green finance and de-risking what is certainly a major transformation,” he said.

Investors Weigh Opportunities Against Practical Hurdles

EnergyLab Asia’s Regional Director, Natharoun Ngo Son, described Cambodia’s renewable drive as a “generational opportunity” to reshape its economic competitiveness and attract new capital. “Cambodia can show it’s ready to lead in the new clean energy paradigm,” he said.

Chhe Lidin, Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, highlighted significant progress, with 99 percent of villages and 95 percent of households now connected to electricity. “Renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives form the cornerstone of Cambodia’s energy policy,” he said.

However, analysts noted that scaling solar and wind capacity will require major investment in grid modernization and pricing reform to make renewable projects financially viable.

A Balancing Act Between Ambition and Execution

Under the theme “Unlocking a Clean Energy Economy,” Clean Energy Week 2025—organized by EnergyLab Cambodia in partnership with the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and co-founded by Australia and the United Nations Development Programme—runs until October 9.

The series of events aims to highlight how clean energy can drive Cambodia’s industrial and investment future while strengthening key sectors such as manufacturing and tourism.

While optimism ran high, many participants agreed that success will depend on aligning policy, finance, and technology to move from ambition to implementation. As Cambodia’s clean energy narrative evolves, the global investment community will be watching closely to see whether this optimism translates into long-term, sustainable growth.",https://cambodiainvestmentreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/557590685_1380171617449377_5124869061210388775_n-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 06:59:44.307403

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

""We're not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we're not going to take risk,"" said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet ""delusional"" green power goals - a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt Battery energy storage systems that suck up chepower during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the US, California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That's enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

Advt

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100 per cent foolproof.

Advt

""This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,"" Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way ""to protect us until we know more,"" said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

""They're banking on nothing happening, but I don't think you can place it where they're proposing and assume nothing's going to happen,"" Sokolowski said. ""It's just too risky if it does.""

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system ""poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.""

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will ""strengthen and modernize our grid.""

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-124316875,imgsize-465940,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etmanufacturing,resizemode-75/news/energy/fears-of-massive-battery-fires-spark-local-opposition-to-energy-storage-projects.jpg",N,,2025-10-05 06:59:50.256742

(AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.

“The law firm is authorized to work for the Secretary of State’s office, but I haven’t done any work,” Litchfield said.
Murrill also fired Celia Cangelosi, who has been an outside counsel for the Secretary of State’s office for more than 25 years.
Cangelosi’s current contract calls for payments of $375 per hour, up to $400,000 per year from the Secretary of State’s office.
Murrill said the legal conflict with Nancy Landry is awkward since they’ve known each other for so long.","Attorney General Liz Murrill has fired all of the outside lawyers working for Secretary of State Nancy Landry in an extraordinary high-stakes legal battle between two of Louisiana’s six statewide elected officers.

Murrill said she acted to protect her primacy as Louisiana’s chief legal officer after Landry, in her view, challenged that authority in advance of an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court hearing on whether Louisiana will have to redraw its congressional voting maps.

Landry believes Murrill has overreacted and questions whether the attorney general has the right to end her outside legal contracts. She declined to answer when asked whether she might go to court to block Murrill.

Adding to the legal and political drama, Murrill and Landry, while not close friends, grew up a block from each other in the Greenbriar neighborhood of Lafayette and went to Lafayette High School, LSU and LSU law school at the same time. Landry is one year older.

At the heart of the dispute is the Callais case, which is sure to draw national attention because Louisiana is asking the Supreme Court to overturn the decades-old Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. If the court invalidates Section 2, the state Legislature is poised to redraw Louisiana’s congressional boundaries to force either U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields or U.S. Rep. Troy Carter or both — they are Black Democrats — out of Congress, to be replaced by a Republican.

In Murrill’s view, Landry has recently attempted to insert her views into Callais before the Supreme Court, and in so doing has tried to usurp Murrill’s role.

In her most recent brief, Landry wrote that she has consistently opposed the Legislature’s decision in January 2024 to create a second Black-majority congressional seat won later that year by Fields. The Legislature’s decision – which had the full support of Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, to the dismay of conservatives subsequently – is the central question in the Callais case.

Murrill and Jeff Landry said they supported creating the second Black-majority district because of recent Louisiana court rulings. Nancy Landry now says she favored keeping the previous congressional map, where Carter was the only Democrat.

“What Nancy is trying to do, for whatever reason, is to stake out some political position,” Murrill said in an interview. “Maybe she believes the court is on the verge of making some consequential decision on redistricting, she wants to stake out a new place, a different place than she had taken before publicly, and rewrite history.”

That’s nonsense, Landry said in a separate interview.

“My actions are not politically motivated at all,” she said.

The Callais case

At issue is Landry’s decision to file her own legal brief in August and support the position of the Callais plaintiffs seeking to overturn the current congressional map, which includes four Republicans and the two Black Democrats. Landry also asked the Supreme Court to add 10 minutes to oral arguments to allow her outside counsel, Phillip Strach with the Nelson Mullins law firm, to present her legal position. The court said no to that request.

Landry said she was simply trying to make sure that her point of view was represented through legal counsel when the Supreme Court handles the redistricting case. Oral arguments are scheduled for Oct. 15.

“The remedy in this case intimately involves my office,” said Landry, who oversees elections in Louisiana. She is named as a defendant.

Landry said her lawyers offered comments to the brief that Murrill’s lawyers were preparing. Murrill’s team didn’t respond, Landry said. That prompted her to file her own brief, she added.

“I have been consistent throughout the case in the pleadings,” Landry said. “There’s nothing unusual or different in the filing of this brief.”

For her part, Murrill said Landry didn’t show her brief to the attorney general’s office before filing it and then wouldn’t discuss the matter.

“For her to parachute in at the 11th hour and then demand to have her lawyers stand at the podium and then refuse to even tell me or the governor what she wanted to say was just unacceptable,” Murrill said. “She’s a ministerial officer, so her legal position on the constitutionality of the law is irrelevant. That’s my job, not her job.”

By ""ministerial officer,"" Murrill means Landry’s role is an administrative, not a policymaking one.

Contracts canceled

Murrill struck back at Landry by canceling Nelson Mullins’ contract to represent the Secretary of State’s office on redistricting — and then went a big step further by canceling Landry’s other seven outside legal contracts on other matters.

“If they don’t cooperate with the attorney general, then they won’t get my approval,” Murrill said. “So I disapproved them. I have indicated I have the resources to supply her with legal assistance. That is what I will do.”

In doing so, Murrill ended one contract the Secretary of State’s office had with Jimmy Faircloth, a friend and supporter who gave her first state government job when he was executive counsel to then-Gov. Bobby Jindal.

“It had nothing to do with the merits of the work,” Faircloth said of Murrill’s decision, adding that he hadn’t done any work on the Secretary of State contract for some time.

Murrill also canceled the Secretary of State’s contract with the Berrigan Litchfield law firm in New Orleans. John Litchfield served as Murrill’s campaign chair when she was elected as attorney general in 2023.

“The law firm is authorized to work for the Secretary of State’s office, but I haven’t done any work,” Litchfield said.

Murrill also fired Celia Cangelosi, who has been an outside counsel for the Secretary of State’s office for more than 25 years. Cangelosi’s current contract calls for payments of $375 per hour, up to $400,000 per year from the Secretary of State’s office. Cangelosi did not return a phone call.

The top Nelson Mullins lawyers earn $475 per hour, up to $800,000 per year in payments. Strach did not respond to an email.

Besides the one with Nelson Mullins, Murrill said she severed the other outside legal contracts to ensure that Landry doesn’t try to put any of those lawyers on the redistricting case.

Murrill said her office and the governor’s office have to approve legal contracts for all state agencies.

Jay Dardenne, who served in various capacities of state government for more than 30 years, said attorneys general have sometimes refused to hire lawyers sought by the governor – a dispute between then-Gov. John Bel Edwards and then-Attorney General Jeff Landry ended up in court, with Landry winning and Edwards not getting the lawyers he wanted in a coastal lawsuits case.

But Dardenne could not remember an instance where the attorney general’s office simply canceled existing contracts.

Murrill said the legal conflict with Nancy Landry is awkward since they’ve known each other for so long.

“It’s not my preferred outcome,” Murrill said. “But I got to do what I got to do. Of course, I still consider her a friend.”

Landry said she and Murrill haven’t talked in over a month.

“Part of working with Liz is working through disagreements,” Landry said. “I’m just surprised that it’s become this involved with the firing of every attorney of the Secretary of State’s office employs over what I consider to be a very minor disagreement.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c6/8c64f12c-63bf-11ef-b8b4-4724aa5ee2d9/65d3c8675358b.image.jpg?crop=1751%2C919%2C0%2C132&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-05 05:59:06.158406

This boom is largely credited to the government’s Electric Car Grant, reintroduced in July 2025, which offers buyers up to £3,750 off the price of 36 electric car models.
“Our discounts have sparked a surge in electric car sales, making them cheaper and within reach of more households than ever before,” said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, as quoted by Carwow.
While gasoline models, especially the traditional Escalade, remain popular, Cadillac’s electric vehicle sales have increased 88% year-to-date compared to 2024.
For now, though, the road ahead for electric vehicles looks busier—and brighter—than ever.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer just a futuristic dream—they’re rapidly becoming a fixture on roads in the UK and the United States, breaking sales records and reshaping the auto industry. In September 2025, the UK saw a remarkable surge, with over 72,000 new electric vehicles registered, accounting for 23.3% of all new car sales, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) alone soared by 29% compared to the previous year, marking the best month ever for BEVs in the UK. When hybrids are included, electrified vehicles made up more than half of all new registrations, helping the UK car market achieve its strongest September since 2020 (as reported by Jang and Tech Digest).

This boom is largely credited to the government’s Electric Car Grant, reintroduced in July 2025, which offers buyers up to £3,750 off the price of 36 electric car models. Over 20,000 people have already claimed the discount, drawing from a £650 million funding pool. The grant’s impact has been immediate and dramatic. “Our discounts have sparked a surge in electric car sales, making them cheaper and within reach of more households than ever before,” said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, as quoted by Carwow. She added, “By cutting costs for families we’re supporting industry, backing British jobs, and powering up growth.”

The grant is not just making new EVs more accessible—used electric car prices have dropped by over 20% since last year, and the price gap between new petrol and electric cars has narrowed by 14%, now averaging £8,229. EV drivers can also save up to £1,500 a year on fuel and running costs compared to petrol cars, according to government figures cited by Carwow.

Industry leaders are quick to point out that this is not just a flash in the pan. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, emphasized, “Electrified vehicles are powering market growth after a sluggish summer—and with record ZEV [zero emission vehicle] uptake, massive industry investment is paying off, despite demand still trailing ambition.” John Veichmanis, CEO of Carwow, noted, “Since the scheme launched, EV enquiries on our platform have doubled. The grant is transforming curiosity into action, encouraging drivers to try an electric car for the first time—and once they do, most never look back.”

The government’s ambitions are clear: zero-emission vehicles are targeted to make up 28% of new car sales by the end of 2025. While the pure electric share is still a bit shy of that goal, industry analysts say that with various “flexibilities” built into the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, sales are generally ahead of where they need to be (Tech Digest).

Of course, incentives alone aren’t enough. The UK is also investing heavily in charging infrastructure, with over 85,000 public charging points across Britain and one being added every half hour. A further 100,000 are planned, backed by a £381 million local infrastructure fund. An additional £63 million is earmarked for innovative charging solutions, including pavement-to-home connections, which could allow some drivers to run their EVs for as little as 2p per mile.

But the grant isn’t without its limitations. It currently applies to about a quarter of BEVs due to price caps and manufacturing emission rules, which effectively block many Chinese brands. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing variety of eligible models—37 at present, including Ford, Nissan, Vauxhall, and Citroen—has helped drive demand, with some models seeing a 118% spike in enquiries.

The electric revolution is not limited to the UK. Across the Atlantic, Cadillac achieved a historic milestone in the third quarter of 2025, with electric vehicles accounting for nearly 40% of its new car sales in the US—a staggering 154% increase compared to the same period last year, according to UNN and InsideEVs. This surge was fueled by a now-expired federal incentive of $7,500, prompting buyers to rush dealerships before the benefit ended.

General Motors’ luxury division was well prepared, with its lineup ready to meet the demand. In just three months, Cadillac sold 18,383 electric vehicles, including 7,309 units of the Lyriq, 4,886 of the compact Optiq, 3,924 of the three-row Vistiq, and 2,264 of the Escalade IQ EV. The Optiq’s performance was particularly notable, achieving almost half of its annual sales in a single quarter. The Vistiq, resembling a smaller Escalade, accounted for 70% of its annual volume in just three months. While gasoline models, especially the traditional Escalade, remain popular, Cadillac’s electric vehicle sales have increased 88% year-to-date compared to 2024. The third quarter of 2025 was Cadillac’s best third-quarter and best full-year performance since 2013.

“Thanks to the tax credit and buyers’ fear of missing out on the benefit, GM’s luxury car division sold two out of every five new cars as electric vehicles, making this quarter the most successful in the brand’s history in the EV market,” reported UNN.

The UK and US stories offer both parallels and contrasts. In both countries, government incentives have proven to be powerful catalysts, giving hesitant buyers the final push to make the switch to electric. The results are clear: record-breaking sales, an expanding array of models, and a growing infrastructure network. Yet challenges remain. In the UK, the Electric Car Grant’s restrictive eligibility and the need for more private buyers to join the movement are ongoing concerns. Mike Hawes of the SMMT stressed, “The Electric Car Grant will help to break down one of the barriers holding back more drivers from making the switch—and tackling remaining roadblocks, by unlocking infrastructure investment and driving down energy costs, will be crucial to the success of the industry and the environmental goals we share.”

There’s also speculation that the intense demand for the UK grant could lead to the scheme closing earlier than planned, raising questions about what will sustain momentum once incentives run out. Meanwhile, in the US, Cadillac’s electric surge was tied directly to a temporary federal incentive. Now that the $7,500 tax credit has expired, the sustainability of such high EV sales is uncertain, especially in the face of broader economic and industry challenges.

What’s not in doubt is the direction of travel. With governments setting ambitious targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles—like the UK’s 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales—and automakers pouring billions into electrification, the electric car transition is accelerating. The coming years will test whether this momentum can be maintained as incentives wane and infrastructure is put to the test. For now, though, the road ahead for electric vehicles looks busier—and brighter—than ever.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/p5bo1JDiDsYPkJwpT9ncCxbvm0U=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F0dc70bec-36b7-41f3-8dcc-4f90f931789f.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 12:02:15.775632

And Russia is working on 19 nuclear power plants beyond its borders in places like Turkey, Iran, and Bangladesh, making it the biggest exporter of nuclear capacity.","Just like the dusty vinyl records your parents were on the verge of tossing for years, nuclear power is undergoing a renaissance.

For decades, the energy source fell out of favor due to safety concerns and high plant construction costs; its share of the world’s electricity supply plummeted to 9% in 2024 from 17% in 1996, according to the global energy think tank Ember.

But in recent years, amid advances in safety and experimental tech promising greater affordability, many countries have begun to view nuclear power generation as a source of scalable low-carbon energy. Meanwhile, tech giants have started bankrolling reactors to power the AI boom.

America united around splitting atoms

In the US, the embrace of nuclear energy has been bipartisan. During the Biden administration, Congress passed subsidies to incentivize the deployment of nuclear energy. And in his second term, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at reducing regulatory hurdles for new reactors, with the stated aim of quadrupling capacity by 2050.

Over a dozen reactors have been closed in the US since 2012, and no new large-scale nuclear power plants are getting built—yet. But as anticipated next-gen reactors undergo regulatory review, several older decommissioned ones are getting de-mothballed:

A decommissioned reactor at Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in American history, is due to go back online (it wasn’t involved in the 1979 accident). The reactor’s owner, Constellation Energy, signed a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Microsoft last year.

And this summer, the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan became the first decommissioned US nuclear power plant to return to operational status, financed in part by a $1.5 billion loan from the Department of Energy.

The world powers ahead

Despite the renewed enthusiasm in the US, the vast majority of new capacity is coming online in other countries.

China, which lacks fossil fuel reserves, has added 80% of the world’s new nuclear capacity in the past five years and is due to surpass the US in total nuclear power generation, according to the International Energy Agency.

Meanwhile, the EU gave nuclear power a boost when it recognized it as a clean energy source, making it eligible for government subsidies. France currently plans to build six new nuclear reactors.

The UK plans to increase its nuclear capacity to meet 25% of its electricity needs by 2050, up from 15% currently. And Russia is working on 19 nuclear power plants beyond its borders in places like Turkey, Iran, and Bangladesh, making it the biggest exporter of nuclear capacity.",https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2025-10-03/image-e03047069db278dce2007d49063bd0c18087db7c-5280x3624-jpg/GettyImages-2177851466.webp,N,,2025-10-05 03:58:11.672423

The strategy aligns with the directives set out in the 13th National Party Congress. Complementary legislation, including revisions to the Land Law and Water Resources Law, has been introduced to reinforce environmental governance and sustainable resource management.

Vietnam has also rolled out targeted policies such as the Hydrogen Energy Development Strategy to 2030, and initiatives promoting sustainable cultivation of one million hectares of high-quality, low-emission rice. The Government is mobilising significant resources to tackle climate change in vulnerable regions, notably the Mekong Delta, with 16 major projects receiving approximately 2.5 billion USD in funding.

Financial institutions have been mobilised to support the green transition. Green credit in Vietnamese banks has grown at an annual rate of 20% since 2017, accounting for nearly 4.5% of the nation’s total outstanding loans in 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, Vietnam issued green bonds worth around 1.16 billion USD. In a landmark move, the country successfully sold 10.3 million carbon credits through the World Bank in 2023, raising 51.5 million USD.

Despite these strides, experts note significant obstacles remain. Regulatory frameworks specifically designed to promote green economy practices remain underdeveloped, often limited to high-level policy directions rather than detailed, actionable laws. There is a need to enhance public awareness and commitment to environmental stewardship.

Moreover, financing gaps persist, and much of Vietnam’s production technology remains outdated and energy-intensive, resulting in low productivity and inefficient waste treatment. Renewable energy sectors such as wind and solar power, while growing, have yet to reach the scale necessary to meet national demand.

Deputy Minister of Finance Nguyen Thi Bich Ngoc highlighted ongoing efforts to refine the legal and institutional frameworks supporting ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria. She emphasised that these frameworks are critical to guiding investment decisions, resource allocation, and facilitating access to green finance both domestically and internationally.

Professor Dr Nguyen Dinh Tho, Director of the Institute of Strategy and Policy on Natural Resources and Environment, stressed the importance of green transformation across economic sectors. He advocated for embracing circular economy models to optimise resource efficiency toward conservation, underpinned by science, technology, and digital innovation, alongside sustainable infrastructure development.

At the 4th P4G Summit held in Vietnam in April 2025, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh outlined three key proposals for global cooperation on green growth. These include fostering green mindsets to drive innovation and digital transformation, building responsible green communities where governments provide stable frameworks and the private sector leads technology investment, and enhancing international partnerships, particularly public-private partnerships, to eliminate institutional barriers and accelerate flows of green capital and technology.

Broader Implications: A Reshaping of Global Industries

The ascendance of AI, Clean Energy, and Biotechnology signals more than just sectoral growth; it represents a fundamental reshaping of global industries, with far-reaching ripple effects across economic, social, and geopolitical landscapes. As of October 2025, these trends are not merely expanding in isolation but are increasingly intertwined, creating a synergistic effect that amplifies their transformative power.

AI's pervasive growth is the central driver of broader industry trends, emphasizing automation, data-driven decision-making, and the convergence of physical and digital realms. This ""AI gold rush"" is reorienting capital, sparking both excitement and concern across global economies. Generative AI, having moved beyond the experimental phase, is now delivering measurable business impact and significant ROI across sectors from consumer markets to financial services. AI is rapidly becoming the new infrastructure of business, compelling competitors to accelerate their own AI initiatives to avoid obsolescence. The high cost of AI development means established companies must carefully manage investments, while consulting firms and cloud computing companies are experiencing substantial growth due to increased demand for AI-related services. Historically, this mirrors the transformative periods of the Industrial Revolution and the Information Age, with AI extending human cognitive abilities and automating processes at an unprecedented scale, though its impact on employment is seen more as job transformation rather than simple replacement.

The clean energy sector's transformative trends are driven by a global commitment to emissions reduction and unprecedented investments. Clean energy technology is set to surpass investments in upstream oil and gas for the first time in 2025, with solar PV accounting for half of all cleantech investments. This growth is fueled by rapid cost reductions and amplified by the surging power demands of AI data centers and cleantech manufacturing. The geopolitical landscape is also influenced, particularly by China's dominance in the cleantech supply chain, which is pressuring international markets and forcing companies to rethink strategies. This shift towards sustainable solutions compels tech companies making green investments to push their suppliers and partners to adopt similar practices, extending the impact beyond their own operations. Historically, this energy transition is akin to past shifts in energy sources that drove industrial revolutions, with current geopolitical tensions over supply chains mirroring historical competition for critical resources.

Biotechnology is undergoing a ""biotech revolution"" in 2025, significantly impacting healthcare and numerous other industries. The global biotechnology market is anticipated to grow to $4.61 trillion by 2034, driven by the expansion of gene therapy, precision medicine, and sustainable biomanufacturing. CRISPR-based gene editing tools are finding broader applications, from targeted cancer therapies to climate-resilient crops. This growth leads to significant ripple effects, with larger pharmaceutical companies acquiring smaller biotech firms to diversify portfolios and access new technologies, especially as old drug patents expire. The increasing role of biotechnology in addressing global challenges like climate change and food security echoes the impact of past agricultural and industrial revolutions. The current surge in mergers and acquisitions in biotech is a common pattern in rapidly evolving sectors, where consolidation helps integrate new technologies and maintain a competitive advantage.

Regulatory and policy implications are complex and rapidly evolving across all three sectors. For AI, the global regulatory landscape is fragmented, with the EU's AI Act introducing a risk-based approach, while the US leans towards self-governance in some areas, though an executive order in January 2025 aims to eliminate perceived impediments to innovation. Concerns about algorithmic bias, market manipulation, and environmental impact are leading to calls for greater oversight. In clean energy, the US sector faces variability due to recent federal policy shifts prioritizing domestic fossil fuel production, potentially slowing clean energy growth despite strong economic fundamentals. Globally, industrial policies and carbon-related tariffs like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are reshaping trade strategies. Biotechnology faces a shifting regulatory environment, with a new US presidential administration potentially impacting FDA approval pathways, though an executive order in February 2025 aims to bolster oversight of independent regulatory agencies. Policies like the Biosecure Act could disrupt supply chains by prohibiting procurement from specified PRC-linked companies, leading to increased costs and altered market dynamics, while ethical considerations surrounding gene editing continue to drive calls for evolving regulatory frameworks.

The Road Ahead: Navigating Future Frontiers

The acceleration of ""agentic AI""—systems capable of autonomous decision-making and multi-step workflows—will transform industries from autonomous vehicles to financial trading. Long-term (1-5 years, late 2025 to late 2030), AI is projected to contribute nearly $20 trillion to the global economy, fundamentally boosting labor productivity. The global AI market is anticipated to reach $1.81 trillion by 2030, with some experts even suggesting Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could emerge by 2025 or systems broadly surpassing human capabilities by 2026-2027. Companies must strategically pivot by deeply integrating AI into core operations, focusing on practical, scalable, and industry-specific solutions. This includes addressing the skills gap in specialized areas like computational neuroscience and proactively managing AI ethics, data privacy, and liability. The primary challenge remains the immense capital expenditure required for AI infrastructure, estimated at $3.7 trillion to $5.2 trillion by 2030 for global data centers, alongside navigating increasingly stringent regulatory environments and geopolitical tensions.

For Clean Energy, the short term (late 2025-2027) will be defined by a race to overcome constraints and meet escalating demand, driven by cleantech manufacturing and the energy hunger of AI. Investment continues to surge, exceeding US$2 trillion per year, with renewable energy's share in global electricity generation expected to double to 25% by 2030. Long-term (2025-2030 and beyond), renewables are expected to generate nearly 50% of global electricity by 2030, and global energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to peak by 2025. Strategic pivots involve balancing hydrocarbon returns with the pace of transition, investing in technological innovation like carbon capture and green hydrogen, and adapting to evolving grid infrastructure. Significant opportunities exist in grid modernization, corporate commitments to 100% renewable energy, and the decarbonization of heavy industry. However, challenges include geopolitical tensions, particularly China's dominance in the clean tech supply chain, high upfront costs for renewable projects, insufficient grid and storage infrastructure, and the immense energy demands of AI data centers.

Biotechnology, with a global market estimated at $1.744 trillion in 2025, is projected to surge to over $5 trillion by 2034. In the short term (2025-2026), advancements in AI and digital transformation will accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials, with significant growth expected in oncology, rare diseases, and metabolic therapies. Long-term (2025-2030 and beyond), biotechnology holds the promise of curing or eradicating many common diseases within the next two decades, driven by advances in gene therapy, regenerative medicine, and personalized medicine. Strategic pivots will involve focusing on high-potential sub-sectors, diversifying funding models beyond traditional equity, and investing in adjacent areas like diagnostics and digital health platforms. The looming ""patent cliff"" (over $300 billion in sales at risk through 2030) will drive pipeline diversification and strategic acquisitions. Key challenges include navigating complex regulatory landscapes, high R&D costs, ethical and biosecurity concerns, and a shortage of skilled talent. Cybersecurity threats against sensitive biotech data are also a growing concern.

The overarching theme for all three sectors is one of rapid evolution and adaptation. Success will hinge on the ability of companies to not only innovate technologically but also to strategically manage regulatory complexities, attract and retain specialized talent, and secure substantial, diversified funding. The interplay between these sectors—for instance, AI's role in accelerating drug discovery and optimizing clean energy grids—will create new interdependencies and further amplify their collective impact on the global economy.

“The market’s established, and we’re probably ready to have a market that can … grow without subsidies,” he said.
He bolstered his case by highlighting the explosion of consumer choice, with 65 different EV models now available in the American market.
The bear case: an industry ‘cut in half’ On the other side of the argument is the powerful and influential CEO of Ford, Jim Farley.
“Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle.","A high-stakes and deeply divided debate has erupted at the highest levels of the auto industry, as two of its most influential figures offer starkly opposing visions for the future of the electric vehicle market in a world without subsidies.

The fierce war of words, sparked by the recent death of the $7,500 federal tax credit, pits the bullish optimism of a former Tesla executive against the dire warnings of Ford’s CEO, a clash of perspectives that will have profound implications for the future of American transportation.

The bull case: ‘the market’s established’

On one side of the divide is Jon McNeill, a former Tesla president of global sales and a current GM board member.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he projected a calm confidence, arguing that the US electric vehicle market is now mature enough to stand on its own two feet.

He pointed to Europe as a powerful case study, noting that when countries like Germany rolled back their own subsidies a few years ago, the EV market “surprisingly … continued to grow.”

McNeill believes the US is poised for a similar outcome. “The market’s established, and we’re probably ready to have a market that can … grow without subsidies,” he said.

He bolstered his case by highlighting the explosion of consumer choice, with 65 different EV models now available in the American market. When combined with hybrids, he noted, one out of every four cars sold in the US is now electrified.

The bear case: an industry ‘cut in half’

On the other side of the argument is the powerful and influential CEO of Ford, Jim Farley.

Speaking at a summit in Detroit, he took a virtually opposite and far more pessimistic tack, predicting that the death of the $7,500 consumer incentive is a “game-changer” that will cut the EV industry in half.

While he believes EVs will remain a “vibrant industry,” he also stated it’s “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,” projecting a steep drop in EV market share from its current 10 to 12 percent down to just 5 percent.

“The customers are pesky,” Farley said, delivering a blunt and sobering dose of reality.

“Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”

The X-Factor: a car that powers your house

But there is another, powerful X-factor in this debate, a technological evolution that could fundamentally reshape the value proposition of owning an EV: the car that can power your house.

McNeill argued that the emerging trend of “bidirectional” charging, which allows an EV to push energy back into the grid or directly into a home, will be a powerful driver of future growth.

He shared a personal example, stating that his Silverado EV can power his entire house for two weeks, completely eliminating the need for a separate, noisy generator.

He revealed that his local utility has already offered him a “big break on my utility bills” in exchange for access to just 20 percent of his vehicle’s battery.

On this point, Farley actually agreed, seeing a bright future for “partial electrification.” “We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with,” he said.

While the two titans may disagree on the immediate future, they both see a world where the line between a vehicle and a home power plant is beginning to blur, a technological shift that could prove to be the most powerful incentive of all.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 05:59:00.774836

For Jesse Lore, the owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, N.H., that means September has been busy. On Monday night, with a little over 24 hours left until the tax credit deadline, he was juggling several customers.

“It’s crazy, and the phone doesn’t stop ringing, but that’s a good thing,” he said. “Make hay while the sun is shining.”

Until Tuesday night, EV buyers could get a tax credit for $4,000 on a used car and $7,500 on a new car. As those credits drew closer to expiring, electric car sales accelerated across the country.

Lore says his business has seen about a 70% increase in September sales over last year. But come Wednesday, all the cars on his lot under $25,000 — the maximum price for the used EV tax credit — will get more expensive. And lots of people bought cars ahead of the deadline. Lore expects the combination of those factors to pump the breaks on his sales.

Green Wave, like other dealers, offered the tax credits as “cash on the hood,” selling cars for a discounted price and then getting reimbursed by the federal government. But in recent weeks, Lore says those payments have been stalled.

“We’re still out well over $100,000 in terms of cash that we have not been paid on. And that’s a lot for a small business,” he said.

Lore said his team discussed whether to stop offering the credit and ask their customers to file for it themselves. But ultimately, they decided to keep selling cars for the discount until the deadline.

“We believe that the law is clear. We believe that we will get paid,” he said.

As tax credits wind down, Lore says there may be an unexpected silver lining. Traditional dealerships may buy fewer electric vehicles, causing wholesale prices to drop.

“There’s a lot of fierce competition in the marketplace for car sales,” he said. “As wholesale prices go down, so too will retail prices.”

Lore says that price drop won’t make up for the loss of the credits, but could help consumers a little. And, he said, he’s hoping decreases in development costs and batteries will drive the cost of electric cars below gas cars over the next decade.

“That’s coming up,” he said. “But today it’s not necessarily there.”

Incumbent Carrboro Mayor Barbara Foushee, Carrboro Mayor Pro Tem Danny Nowell, Carrboro Town Council member Cristóbal Palmerand former Carrboro poet laureate Fred Joiner were present.

Executive director of the Community Empowerment Fund Donna Carrington moderated the forum.

Housing Access and Affordability

Carrington began by asking Joiner, the only non-incumbent candidate, what the Town is doing well to promote housing access and affordability, and what he would change if elected.

Joiner said he is still learning about the Town's processes and thinks streamlining engagement with developers would increase accessibility.

Carrington asked incumbent candidates on how their understanding of the Town’s affordable housing needs has changed since they have been in office, and how they would address those needs in their next term.

Nowell said the Town must focus aggressively on increasing affordable housing units through gap financing projects and innovative loan structures.

“Right now, we are in a crisis. We have fallen so far behind that it is not just a need to add housing — it is an emergency,” Palmer said.

Palmer also said the intersection between Town policies must be utilized to increase housing access and affordability.

Foushee said the Town did well in adding another half-cent to the property tax rate to be invested in affordable housing this past budget cycle. She said she looks forward to the Town’s new Unified Development Ordinance and collaborations with other municipalities.

Homelessness

Carrington asked candidates how they would address the needs of Carrboro’s unhoused population.

Foushee said she doesn’t want poverty or homelessness to be criminalized, but approached collaboratively by those impacted, business owners and organizations.

Palmer said he agreed with Foushee about preventing criminalization, and a disconnect exists between elected officials and those working with the chronically unhoused.

Nowell said the Town must use strategies like revolving loan funds to induce developers to create more affordable units.

Joiner said creative solutions are essential to ensuring housing for those who don’t meet area median income requirements but remain in need.

Response to Funding Cuts

Carrington asked candidates how they planned to build infrastructure support as federal and state financial resources are shifted away from the community.

Carrboro’s budgetary structure, which relies heavily on property taxes, makes the Town somewhat less vulnerable than other communities, Nowell said.

Nowell said he is looking to make the design process for infrastructure projects more efficient to increase the Town’s competitiveness.

Joiner said the community must strengthen mutual aid bonds to protect itself against funding losses.

Palmer said he believes in normalizing conversations around salary to better support those most vulnerable to the effects of cuts.

Foushee said appropriate action will be gauged as Carrboro recovers from Tropical Storm Chantal, which later downgraded to a depression, and that federal and state funding is becoming less reliable.

""I feel like, more and more, we can't rely on that much,"" Foushee said.

Transportation

Candidates were asked which active transportation projects they would prioritize in office and why. They were also asked about any projects they would like to introduce if elected.

Palmer said adding an East-West corridor connection to the North-South Bus Rapid Transit project would be ideal. He also said the most recent budget had effectively greenlit many impactful projects.

Joiner said he would like to expand sensibly on strategies to reduce the Town’s usage of cars.

Foushee said she is excited for the building of a sidewalk on South Greensboro Street and the implementation of the Vision Zero strategy, especially its Safe Routes to School traffic safety program. She wants investment in the expansion of public transit services for more frequent service, she said.

Nowell said community members should act on existing plans from the Town website’s project lists in collaboration with local organizations to target priority areas.

Climate Resilience

As a final question, Carrington asked candidates about making Carrboro more climate resilient.

Foushee said educating the community is key to safety during disasters.

Palmer said community members should consider Community Emergency Response Team training and involvement with the Green Neighborhoods Grant Program.

Nowell said actions to increase climate resiliency should incorporate mutual aid strategies. He also said that the Town should decrease dependency on cars.

""We will not have a climate resilient community or a climate resilient world if we are dependent on cars,"" Nowell said.

Joiner said climate resilience must be built into the community through infrastructure and housing choices.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with a skeletal staff and limited funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead ""the worst polluters"" to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

""Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,"" said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an ""environmental ethic"" in his first speech.

""Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.""

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it has also added fighting climate change to its charge.

The EPA's job is essentially setting standards for what's healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done, and then acting as Earth's police officer if it isn't.

""Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country's overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.""

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to ""restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making the U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the ""endangerment"" finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and other sources.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year, and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won't issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

""Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,"" Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. ""So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

,EPA,2025-10-04 23:37:47+00:00,Grants Pass Tribune,The Price of Scraps: America's Annual Food Waste Bill Keeps Climbing,John Oliver,,,,,https://www.grantspasstribune.com/the-price-of-scraps-americas-annual-food-waste-bill-keeps-climbing/,"From the latest financial study in 2023 alone, the United States generated an estimated 73.9 million tons of surplus food—food that was grown, processed, and purchased but never eaten.
Nationally, food waste accounts for roughly 30 to 40 percent of the total food supply, equivalent to about 120 billion pounds annually.
Wasted food represents lost dollars, but it also contributes to methane emissions in landfills and strains waste management systems.
The financial waste embedded in America’s food habits is so vast that even modest reductions could have significant effects.
As inflation continues to stretch budgets and supply chains remain under pressure, tackling food waste represents one of the clearest opportunities to reclaim lost value in the U.S. economy.","Every year, Americans discard an astonishing amount of edible food, and the financial fallout is massive. From the latest financial study in 2023 alone, the United States generated an estimated 73.9 million tons of surplus food—food that was grown, processed, and purchased but never eaten. The overwhelming majority of that surplus ultimately became waste. Economists estimate the direct value of that discarded food at roughly $338 billion, a figure that ripples across households, businesses, and supply chains.

For the average consumer, this waste is far more than an abstract statistic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calculates that each person effectively pays about $728 annually for food that ends up in the trash. For a typical household of four, that amounts to nearly $3,000 each year—money spent on groceries, restaurant meals, and take-out that provides no nourishment and no return. Much of this loss comes down to everyday behavior: overbuying at the grocery store, cooking more than is consumed, poor storage practices, and a widespread misunderstanding of date labels on packaging.

Expiration dates are a particularly costly culprit. Outside of infant formula, date labels in the United States are not federally regulated safety indicators. Most “sell by,” “best if used by,” and “use by” dates are suggestions for peak quality, not hard cutoffs for edibility. Yet consumers frequently treat these dates as expiration notices and throw out perfectly good food. This single misunderstanding sends billions of dollars’ worth of edible products into the garbage each year. It is a preventable form of loss that requires no new technology or infrastructure—only clear communication and more informed household decision-making.

The economic consequences extend far beyond family budgets. For retailers and restaurants, wasted food means thinner profit margins. Overstocking shelves, serving oversized portions, and poor demand forecasting lead to unsold inventory that must be hauled away at a cost. Farms and food processors face their own economic losses when perfectly good crops are left unharvested due to cosmetic standards, labor shortages, or volatile market conditions. Across the entire food system, this inefficiency represents squandered land, water, energy, and labor—resources that have already been paid for but ultimately generate no economic value.

Nationally, food waste accounts for roughly 30 to 40 percent of the total food supply, equivalent to about 120 billion pounds annually. While the numbers have stabilized somewhat since pandemic-era disruptions, 2023’s totals returned to pre-2020 levels, showing how persistent the issue remains. Retail sectors have made modest gains through improved inventory management, but plate waste and spoilage at the consumer level continue to dominate the problem.

The implications are both economic and environmental. Wasted food represents lost dollars, but it also contributes to methane emissions in landfills and strains waste management systems. Reducing waste offers a rare dual benefit: returning billions to household budgets and business balance sheets while lowering environmental impact without requiring large-scale new spending.

The financial waste embedded in America’s food habits is so vast that even modest reductions could have significant effects. Small changes in household behavior—more accurate meal planning, proper food storage, and a better understanding of labels—can collectively translate into billions of dollars saved each year. As inflation continues to stretch budgets and supply chains remain under pressure, tackling food waste represents one of the clearest opportunities to reclaim lost value in the U.S. economy.",https://www.grantspasstribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-waste.png,N,,2025-10-04 23:57:51.880899

An initial 2018 water quality certification and subsequent 2019 settlement were vacated by an appeals court in 2022, prompting a year of mediation that led to the new deal.
“This historic agreement ensures that our children and grandchildren will inherit a Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River that are cleaner and healthier than they are today,” he said.
The commitments are contained in a Revised Water Quality Certification issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and a companion settlement agreement.","ANNAPOLIS, MD—Maryland Governor Wes Moore this week announced a “historic agreement” with Constellation Energy valued at more than $340 million, aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of the Conowingo Dam and bolstering Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts.

The commitments, negotiated in partnership with Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, are intended to meet water quality standards and clear the way for the re-licensing and continued operation of the hydroelectric facility on the Susquehanna River.

“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” Governor Moore said at the dam site. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers.”

Comprehensive Environmental Investment

The $340 million commitment includes operational improvements and both upfront and ongoing annual payments, distributed across several key environmental initiatives over the dam’s license term:

Water Quality and Resiliency: $87.6 million for pollution reduction efforts, including shoreline restoration, forest buffers, and planting underwater grasses.

Trash and Debris Removal: $77.8 million to strengthen efforts to clear debris, which currently averages about 600 tons annually.

Aquatic Life Passage: More than $28 million for fish and eel passage improvements, aimed at helping American shad, river herring, and freshwater mussels rebound.

Freshwater Mussel Restoration: $23.3 million to build and operate a hatchery to seed the river with mussels, which act as natural water filters.

Dredging Studies: $18.7 million to support additional studies on dredging the dam’s reservoir.

The agreement resolves a long-standing legal challenge regarding the dam’s environmental impacts. An initial 2018 water quality certification and subsequent 2019 settlement were vacated by an appeals court in 2022, prompting a year of mediation that led to the new deal.

Economic and Clean Energy Impact

Constellation Energy’s President and CEO, Joe Dominguez, noted that the agreement supports the dam’s role as the state’s largest source of renewable energy.

“The Susquehanna watershed is home to one of the largest concentrations of clean energy generation in America, and Constellation is proud to build on that nearly century-old legacy,” Dominguez said.

State officials highlighted the economic benefits of a cleaner Bay, which underpins a $3.2 billion annual tourism economy and a seafood industry contributing nearly $600 million to the state each year.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown praised the collaborative effort. “This historic agreement ensures that our children and grandchildren will inherit a Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River that are cleaner and healthier than they are today,” he said.

The commitments are contained in a Revised Water Quality Certification issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and a companion settlement agreement. MDE Secretary Serena McIlwain confirmed that all parties, including the environmental groups who had challenged the previous framework, have signed on.

“With this agreement, we are protecting clean water and vibrant ecosystems for generations to come while supporting jobs, commerce, and energy security,” McIlwain said.",https://www.nottinghammd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Governor-Wes-Moore-Conowingo-Dam-Agreement-202510.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:26.330380

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, October 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- RadiansPlus Technologies, a pioneer in sustainable grid innovation, today announced the launch of PSN-DLM (Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management), a groundbreaking technology that redefines how electric vehicle (EV) charging and distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems interact with existing grid infrastructure.

As cities worldwide race toward net-zero targets, grid capacity constraints have emerged as a critical barrier to scaling EV charging and solar adoption—especially in high-density urban environments. Traditional approaches rely on expensive, time-consuming grid upgrades or battery energy storage systems (BESS), often passing significant costs onto consumers or taxpayers while generating additional embodied carbon during construction.

Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management (PSN-DLM) changes the game. Built on RadiansPlus’ patented Power System Neutral (PSN) architecture, PSN-DLM intelligently orchestrates real-time energy demand and supply by differentiating between power (instantaneous load) and energy (total consumption over time). The system dynamically manages flexible loads—such as EV charging—and modulates solar export to align with available grid capacity, ensuring seamless integration without overloading substations or feeders.

Key Benefits of Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management:

• Zero Grid Expansion Required: Enables full utilization of existing grid assets, deferring or eliminating the need for costly upgrades.

• 80%+ Cost Savings: Compared to conventional grid reinforcement or BESS deployment.

• Equitable Access: Makes EV charging and solar energy accessible in underserved communities, public housing, and dense urban zones.

• Grid-Friendly Integration: Real-time coordination between EVs, PV systems, and grid constraints ensures stability and maximizes renewable utilization.

• Rapid Deployment: Short certification and installation timelines accelerate time-to-value for charge point operators (CPOs), building owners, and utilities.

“PSN-DLM delivers the ‘friendly handshake’ the energy transition desperately needs—between EVs, solar panels, and the grid,” said Geoffrey Chan, Co-Founder & Technical Director of RadiansPlus Technologies. “By harnessing flexibility on both the demand and supply sides, we unlock the full potential of existing infrastructure, making decarbonization faster, fairer, and more affordable.”

The technology has already been validated across multiple pilot sites in Asia, including public housing estates in Hong Kong and Singapore, commercial hubs like VivoCity Mall, and transportation infrastructure managed by airport authorities. These deployments demonstrate grid utilization improvements of up to 90% and the ability to support EV charging loads up to 200% of original substation capacity—without hardware upgrades.

PSN-DLM is part of RadiansPlus’ integrated “Solution in a Box” offering, compatible with OCPP standards and is preparing for a future where it is ready for integration with BESS and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) networks. The company is actively engaging with utilities, regulators, CPOs, and real estate developers to scale deployment across Asia and beyond.

According to Mahfuzur Rahman, senior analyst at the Global Green Growth Institute Cambodia (GGGI), energy efficiency in the building sector is crucial due to its high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the sector accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the energy demand and emissions in Cambodia.
“The need for green and low-carbon building concepts is essential to contribute to the economy and meet national energy efficiency targets,” he said.
“If you look at the national energy efficiency policy, you see a long list of works or work plans,” Mola said.","PHNOM PENH — Cambodia has experienced dramatic economic growth in recent decades, fueled by energy-intensive industries and rapid urbanization. But experts warn that without energy-efficient practices in factories, businesses and buildings, the country risks unnecessary energy waste.

Cambodia aims to reduce energy consumption by at least 19 percent by 2030 according to its 2022-2030 National Energy Efficiency Policy, as the country sees the advantage of using lower energy for similar or better performance to reap the economic benefits.

Energy experts from different sectors gathered during the Clean Energy Week 2025 on October 3 to discuss Energy Efficiency (EE) significance, implementation issues and further prospects.

According to Mahfuzur Rahman, senior analyst at the Global Green Growth Institute Cambodia (GGGI), energy efficiency in the building sector is crucial due to its high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the sector accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the energy demand and emissions in Cambodia.

“The need for green and low-carbon building concepts is essential to contribute to the economy and meet national energy efficiency targets,” he said.

Rey Sopheak, national expert at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), said that energy efficiency is essential for industrial parks to save costs and improve competitiveness, adding that industrial parks need to address both energy and water consumption to ensure sustainability.

“The concept of agro-industrial parks can help integrate different industries and create value from waste,” he said. “Collaboration between different factories in an industrial park can create a stronger voice for energy efficiency improvements.”

The industrial sector's energy demand in Cambodia has notably increased, going from 8,850 GWh in 2010 to 20,411 GWh in 2019, reflecting heightened industrial activities and energy requirements. The national policy aims for a 20 percent reduction in thermal and electrical energy consumption in the Industrial Sector by 2030, targeting approximately 30,000 GWh, which would represent a saving of nearly 10,000 GWh.

Elaine Jarry, country representative of Geres—an NGO promoting sustainable energy and combating climate change—said that energy efficiency is crucial for garment factories due to climate change and the need for cleaner construction.

“The garment factories need to adopt energy-efficiency measures to stay competitive and relevant,” she said. “The adoption of energy efficiency can help factories reduce costs and ensure smooth transitions.”

Jarry emphasized the importance of energy efficiency to meet national targets and for the country to remain attractive to investors.

Tin Mola, infrastructure lead of the economic development program CAPRED funded by Australia, said that CAPRED has focused on demonstrating the viability of the ESCO [energy service companies] business model in Cambodia to ensure that investment in energy efficiency is supported, which involves an energy-service company providing capital and expertise.

“If you look at the national energy efficiency policy, you see a long list of works or work plans,” Mola said. “The ESCO business model is an alternative, innovative financing model because energy efficiency investment costs money.” The model assists large energy consumers in investing in more efficient equipment, which can help these companies lower energy expenses and boost their competitiveness, he added.

According to people in the field, despite national policies promoting energy efficiency, gaps in regulations, limited data and a shortage of skilled professionals continue to slow Cambodia’s push toward its ambitious energy transition goals.

Elaine Jarry of the NGO Geres said that the organization has worked with the government with the aim of reducing the gap between actual and ambitious energy efficiency targets through realistic solutions and multi-stakeholder approaches. Recent and ongoing projects have included improved cook stoves, charcoal projects, and innovative low-impact living projects.

Vongchanh Kinnaleth, researcher at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC), said that the institute has been playing a role in supporting the development of a skilled workforce in energy efficiency, focusing on training human resources, particularly in engineering.

“ITC offers training programs for certified energy managers and energy auditors,” she said. “The training programs aim to address the limited professional skills in energy efficiency.”

ITC collaborates with energy consumers and development partners to promote the importance of energy management and certify professionals, she added.

Tin Mola of CAPRED explained that the ESCO (energy service companies) model is challenging but promising due to the clear commercial incentives. However, the lack of data records from factories is a significant challenge in implementing the ESCO model, she said.

“CAPRED is working on developing energy performance contracts and measurement and verification processes [and] ESCOs need access to finance to scale up their operations,” she said, pointing out the bond policies to support energy efficiency in 2026 and calling for effective implementation of existing policies and tweaking them to make them better.

During the discussions, Mahfuzur Rahman of GGGI suggested implementing the energy management program and designating energy consumers, while Rey Sopheak of UNIDO stressed the need for actual numbers and results after policy implementation. Elaine Jarry of Geres added that awareness and basic settings for energy-consumption reduction are important.

Cambodia aims for a significant clean energy transition, targeting 70 percent renewable energy by 2030. The Cambodian government also intends to attract industries such as car-part production and electronics manufacturing, which are expected to raise energy demand to 38,600 GWh annually by 2030 due to their high energy consumption.",https://img.cambodianess.com/uploads/article/10-2025/1759566154.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:31.467062

Several high-ranking government officials have raised serious concerns about energy storage — namely, does it even exist, and even if it does exist, then isn’t it too expensive? Apparently those concerns are not top of mind for the judges of the prestigious Earthshot Prize. They have just tapped the US iron-air battery startup Form Energy to join 14 other finalists in the final round. The hotly competitive, highly selective global program saw almost 2,500 other promising nominees try and fail to make the final cut this year.

Does Energy Storage Actually Exist?

Regardless of the official US position on energy storage, the Founder and President of the Earthshot Prize seems convinced that it exists. That would be Prince William, who had this to say as the program arrives at its five-year anniversary:

“The Earthshot Prize has shown that the answers to our planet’s greatest challenges not only already exist, but that they are firmly within our grasp.”

Is he delusional? Maybe! Either way, Form Energy’s iron-air battery worked its way through the Earthshot Prize selection process to rise to the top of the Fix Our Climate category, so in all likelihood it does exist.

The finalist stage is also a rare, celebration-worthy achievement for the US. The EarthShot judges have tapped 60 finalists since the program launched in 2020. Only a scant handful of US-based firms have reached the final round.

The Form Energy Iron-Air Solution: Follow The Money

Of course, the real question about energy storage is not an existential one. It’s a duration one.

Today’s lithium-ion batteries typically last about four hours or less, enabling them to fill in during peak demand periods. They can also be paired with virtual power plants and other modern 21st century technologies to forestall the need to build expensive new gas peaker plants, and to introduce more wind and solar power into the grid.

However, we are 25% into the 21st century and gas power plants are still very much in demand. The need for more powerful, more economical wind and solar energy storage platforms was already clear when Form Energy launched in 2017, with plans to develop an iron-air long-duration battery based on the principle of “reversible rusting.” The company soon coalesced around a product that can deliver electricity for 100 hours. In addition to duration and cost, iron-air technology also gets points on supply chain and fire safety, too.

That sounds simple enough, but the devil is in the details. Iron has been explored as an energy storage material for decades without gaining much traction, two key challenges being scale-up and efficiency.

Form Energy has been hammering away at the problem since its launch in 2017, with a $9 million Series A assist from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and The Engine among others, followed by a $40 million Series B round in 2019, a $76 million Series C round in 2020, and onward to $240 million in Series D, and another $450 million (Series E), and then another $405 million (Series F) last year.

CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley has been following the company regularly up through last year, when he took note of the company’s forthcoming energy storage project in Maine. The article attracted dozens of comments ranging from “I think this is really promising” to “this does not look like a good battery.”

Safety & Cost-Cutting

Comments aside, Earthshot Prize is not the only entity to determine that Form Energy falls on the “really promising” side of the scale. Form already has a number of contracts and utility partners in hand. The company also passed a key fire safety test last December, when it demonstrated that the iron-air battery conforms to UL9540A standards at the cell level. When battery cells meet those standards, there is no need for further testing at the module or system level.

“UL9540A is a critical safety benchmark in the energy storage industry, designed to evaluate a battery’s potential for thermal runaway and its ability to prevent the spread of heat or fire,” Form explains.

“Form Energy’s iron-air battery cells underwent rigorous testing, including multiple short-circuit failure modes in both charging and discharging conditions,” the company adds. “Even when subjected to extreme scenarios, such as charging while short-circuited or overcharging for seven continuous days, the cells remained stable with no uncontrolled heating or thermal runaway,” the company adds.

The focus on safety is a significant cost advantage, eliminating the need for fireproofing systems. The inherent safety of the system can also smooth the way for approval in urban environments and other locations where fire risk raises public concerns.

Next Steps For Energy Storage In The US

No word yet on whether or not the White House will celebrate Form Energy’s selection as an Earthshot finalist, vaulting the US into the upper ranks of a high profile global competition. After all, it’s almost like being nominated for a Nobel Prize.

The Energy and Interior Departments have already weighed in on the matter, along with the Environmental Protection Agency. Having thoroughly investigated the question of whether or not energy storage costs too much, even if it does exist, the heads of these three agencies have determined, well, who knows what.

Meanwhile, innovation in the the energy storage field continues apace, and other long duration alternatives to lithium-ion batteries have been cropping up. Last year BloombergNEF ran the numbers and noted that these new systems face the challenge of Li-ion’s long head start on cost, including economies of scale and mature supply chains. Still, BNEF determined that thermal and compressed air systems have already closed the gap.

“Thermal energy storage and compressed air storage are the least expensive LDES technologies, at $232 per kilowatt-hour and $293 per kWh of capex, respectively, data from the survey shows. For comparison, lithium-ion systems had an average capex of $304/kWh for four-hour duration systems in 2023,” BNEF noted. The survey was based on the firm’s 6+ hour definition for long duration.

In case you’re wondering, Li-ion doesn’t lend itself to the long duration format, that’s a good question. BNEF has an answer. “The unit costs of most long-duration energy storage solutions typically drop with each hour of storage added, so LDES technologies can scale more efficiently compared to lithium-ion batteries,” BNEF notes.

Long duration or not, the US energy storage market is still holding firm, despite the fantasy of a battery-free world articulated by some high ranking federal officials. The US-based global consulting firm Coherent Market Insights, for example, has just issued a new report under the title “U.S. Advanced Energy Storage Market Set to See Incredible Growth 2025–2032.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/form-energy-factory-long-duration.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:49.544449

The Hatch Act was passed in 1939 after a scandal involving Democratic candidates in the 1938 election using Works Progress Administration workers to help with their campaigns and dangled agency jobs to help win votes.

The act was amended in 1993 and again in 2012 to relax prohibitions on federal employees engaging in political activity. While both amendments weakened the law they did not change the basic tenet of the law which is prohibiting the engagement in political activity while on duty, using federal resources, or wearing a uniform.

The law specifically prohibits federal employees of the Executive Branch while on duty from engaging in partisan political activities, such as campaigning, distributing political materials, or posting partisan messages on social media.

It also specifically prohibits federal employees of the Executive Branch from using their position or official authority to influence the outcome of an election or to coerce subordinates.

And it prohibits the use of government material for political activity.

The goals are to ensure non-partisan administration of programs, protect employees from coercion, and encourage merit-based employment.

In short it prohibits executive branch employees from using the power and authority of the federal government for partisan purposes.

The current activity of federal executive branch employees appears to totally disregard the law, but that should be a surprise with an administration that has disregarded federal laws time and time again.

The attitude is “do it and let them sue because we have the Supreme Court behind us.”

A federal court judge recently ruled President Trump lacked legal authority to order National Guard troops into Los Angeles to put down demonstrations against the activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement who were going to Home Depots to round up undocumented immigrants to deport and to farms as well often grabbing people off the street while agents were unidentified, wearing masks and in civilian vehicles.

Since that time, he has sent the National Guard and federal law enforcement officials into Memphis, Portland, Oregon, and into Chicago and surrounding areas.

And the Trump administration has usurped the constitutional “power of the purse” from Congress, and is deciding what money appropriated by Congress will be spent and what will not.

This weekend the federal government is in shutdown mode because there are not enough votes in the Senate to pass a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open.

Republicans hold the majority in the House, the Senate and hold the Oval Office, but due to Senate rules, 60 votes are needed to pass budget bills that are not dressed up as reconciliation, needing only a majority to pass, which is what the One Big Beautiful Bill was when it passed the Senate by the Vice President’s one vote, and the House by four votes.

That bill contained significant cuts to the Medicaid program which will have far reaching effects across the country and here in New Hampshire leaving millions without healthcare insurance.

The bill also did not include money for the tax credits for the Medicaid expansion program passed under the Affordable Care Act, which will send insurance premiums skyrocketing for people who purchase their health insurance through the marketplace established under the bill.

Democrats sought to include the funding for the tax credits in the continuing resolution in order to help those folks to continue to afford health insurance.

As we know in New Hampshire, uninsured people using the health care system who do not pay for the services, raise the premiums for those on private health insurance programs.

If you know you have to negotiate with Democrats in the Senate to gain the needed 60 votes, but refuse to budge at the urging of the president, you have a problem and most Americans will blame the party in power when the government shuts down.

But that is not the message the president and Republicans want the public to hear, they want to blame the “far left radical” Democrats who don’t have enough votes to pass anything in Congress.

So what has the Trump administration done to convince the American people they are not to blame for closing national parks and various other government services

This is the message on the White Mountain National Forest website since the shutdown began.

“The Radical Left Democrats shut down the government. This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

If that isn’t a violation of the Hatch Act, I don’t know what is.

The US Health and Human Services website has this message on its Home page.

“Mission-critical activities of HHS will continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Please use this site as a resource as the Trump Administration works to reopen the government for the American people.”

This is on the State Department’s home page.

“Due to the Democrat-led shutdown, website updates will be limited until full operations resume.”

The Housing and Urban Development website has this message:

“The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.”

The United State Department of Agriculture has the message in big bold letters on its homepage.

“Due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

Some agencies are nondescript like commerce which simply says because of the shutdown, the website will not be updated, which is similar to what NASA posted, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s website does not even mention the shutdown.

Maybe the Trump Administration has written off anyone who frequents the EPA website believing they are all anti-Trumpers.

What is being done in Trump’s executive department by executive branch employees is clearly illegal.

But who are you going to complain to, Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is in the president’s back pocket, or one of handpicked US District Attorneys?

And even if whoever is responsible for the messages on the federal agency websites is found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, he or she will not lose his or her job as the original law required, but will only be fined.

And if they do get caught red handed, all they have to say is the president ordered the messages be put up, because he and Vice President JD Vance are exempt from the Hatch law.

This is what happens when the power and authority of the federal government is used for partisan purposes or for one person’s agenda.

How can offices curb waste? How can industries reduce consumption? But hidden behind the rooftops glittering with solar panels lies a lesser-told story. Before a single ray of sunlight is ever captured, the making of that panel itself is a battle of efficiency, one that could define whether our clean energy future is truly sustainable.

Walk into a modern solar plant, and it does not feel like the gritty industrial units of the past. Instead, it resembles a high-tech operating room, humming with automation, precision robotics, AI scanners, and even circular water systems. These silent heroes are rewriting the rules of sustainability from the inside out. As India’s renewable capacity surges to 220.1 GW, nearly half from solar, the efficiency of these factories matters just as much as the panels they produce.

Automation: The Micron-Level Revolution

A solar panel’s story begins with wafers, thin slices of silicon that must be cut and aligned with near-perfect accuracy. Even a fraction of a millimetre off can lead to wasted material, higher defect rates, and greater energy use. This is where automation steps in like a surgeon’s scalpel. Robots now manage processes with micron-level precision, ensuring thinner cuts, cleaner edges, and consistent quality.

This is not just about output. Every avoided defect means fewer wasted wafers, fewer re-runs on energy-intensive machinery, and lower costs. In FY 2024–25 alone, India’s solar module manufacturing capacity doubled from 38 GW to 74 GW, a leap made possible by both scale and smarter processes. Automation has quietly become the foundation of this rapid rise.

Smart Testing: AI as the Silent Detective

Not long ago, solar panels were evaluated through repeated manual checks, often consuming time, workforce, and significant energy. Now, AI-powered defect detection and high-speed imaging work like detectives on the assembly line. Electroluminescence scans catch microscopic flaws in real-time, preventing waste before it even begins.

The result? Panels that consistently meet higher standards while cutting down on wasted resources during quality assurance. Smarter testing ensures that efficiency is not just about quantity, but about reliability, fewer rejections, fewer re-tests, and stronger products.

Water: The Invisible Resource

When we think of solar energy, water rarely enters the conversation. Yet plants are water-intensive, relying on it for cooling, cleaning, and chemical processes. Left unchecked, this could strain already scarce reserves. Technology is again shifting the paradigm.

Closed-loop systems now recycle water within the factory, reducing freshwater intake by as much as 80–90%. This quiet transformation shows that efficiency is not only about electricity saved, but also about conserving every resource, every drop.

A Blueprint for the Future

Put together, automation, digital testing, and circular water management are turning solar factories into models of efficiency. They are not merely production hubs but blueprints for the future of sustainable manufacturing.

This is where Energy Efficiency Day needs a wider lens. The focus should not end at homes, offices, or city infrastructure. It must extend to the very heart of clean energy production itself. If solar factories can cut waste, conserve resources, and embed intelligence into every process, then the lessons travel far beyond one sector.

Because the truth is this: building panels that capture sunlight is only half the challenge. The other half is ensuring the process of making them reflects the very sustainability we aspire to achieve.

On this Energy Efficiency Day, perhaps the most powerful message is this: efficiency is not just a choice, it is the DNA of the clean energy transition.

Half the world has reached a peak in fossil fuels for electricity.","Solar energy and wind power account for the majority of growth in electricity production globally.

Electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewable energy can reduce fossil fuel imports by 70 percent and save 1.3 trillion dollars annually.

China has reduced its use of fossil fuels for electricity production by 2 percent during the first half of 2025.

A technological transformation of the energy system

The energy system is undergoing the most extensive transformation since the transition from biomass to fossil fuels in the 18th century, according to a new report by Ember.

Three groups of technologies are forming what is called electrotech: renewable energy from solar and wind, electric demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps, and connections through batteries and digitalization.

Electricity is now driven by rapidly growing renewable energy sources and enables efficiency gains through electrification across the entire economy. For the world's countries, this offers a path to energy security.

Electrotech is three times more efficient

Electrotech is approximately three times more efficient than fossil fuel systems. Fossil systems waste two-thirds of primary energy, equivalent to 380 exajoules, as heat at a cost of 5 trillion dollars every year. Solar and electrification provide access to 100 times more energy than fossil fuels.

Costs fall with increased production

Electrotech is manufactured in modules, which creates clear learning curves. Costs fall by approximately 20 percent every time production doubles. Electrotech already accounts for two-thirds of global energy investments and all expected growth in energy jobs.

In 2023, electrotech contributed 10 percent of global GDP growth. In China, the figure was 22 percent, in India 5 percent, in the EU 30 percent and in the US 7 percent.

More countries can become energy independent

80 percent of the world's population lives in countries that import fossil fuels. Over 50 countries import more than half of their primary energy as fossil fuels. In contrast, 92 percent of countries have renewable energy potential that is more than ten times their current demand.

By replacing imported fossil fuels with electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewable energy, net imports of fossil fuels can decrease by 70 percent. This would save 1.3 trillion dollars globally each year.

Exponential growth for decades

Solar energy capacity has doubled every three years on average for 30 years. Since 2020, battery storage has nearly doubled every year. Solar energy has gone from being among the smallest to the largest capacity source in a decade.

Solar and wind dominate growth in electricity demand. Electricity accounts for almost all growth in final energy use in buildings, industry and road transport. In 2007, electricity surpassed oil as the largest supplier of useful energy.

Sales of vehicles with combustion engines have decreased since 2017. During the same period, sales of electric vehicles have increased 15 times to 17.5 million.

China drives the global transformation

China's domestic deployment of electrotech is extensive. The country accounts for half of global solar panel installations, 60 percent of electric vehicle sales and two-thirds of global growth in electricity demand since 2019.

During the first half of 2025, China's use of fossil fuels for electricity production decreased by 2 percent. This is significant because global demand for fossil fuels excluding China has been unchanged since 2018.

Emerging markets take the step directly

Led by China, emerging markets are deploying electrotech on a large scale. The global sun belt is beginning to benefit from its high insolation levels. 63 percent of electricity demand in emerging markets comes from solar as a share of production, which is higher than in the US.

The ASEAN region and Bangladesh have surpassed the US in terms of electrification of final energy demand.

Three-quarters of energy needs can be electrified

Leading regions and countries already get more than half of their electricity from solar and wind. A penetration of 70-80 percent from solar and wind at a reasonable price is within reach today.

Technical innovation in electric transport and heat pumps has increased the share of global final energy demand that can be electrified from 25 percent in 2000 to 75 percent in 2025. Further innovation is working on the remaining 25 percent in shipping, aviation and high-temperature heat.

Fossil fuels on track to decline

Demand for fossil fuels has been unchanged for industrial energy since 2014, for buildings since 2018 and for road transport since 2019. Two-thirds of countries have already reached a peak in demand for fossil fuels in end-use sectors. Half the world has reached a peak in fossil fuels for electricity.

If current trends continue for deployment of renewable energy and electrification, demand for fossil fuels will decline from 2030.",https://www.warpnews.org/content/images/size/w1200/2025/09/Solar-wind-cover.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:43.361916

That was the sentiment Thursday as local officials and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gathered to celebrate mixed-use development in Hudsonville's city center that was funded through a public-private partnership.

""Targeting brownfield assessment money allows a community and the developers to know what they're getting into,"" said Ann Vogel, Region 5 administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In May, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy announced that Ottawa County received a $500,000 brownfield assessment grant as part of a $6.7 million federal investment from the EPA.

Brownfield grants are used to assess what kind of contaminants or pollution might be on the property and what has to be done to clean it up. Some of the funds have been used to assess old properties in Hudsonville.

The money was for environmental site assessments, cleanup planning and community engagement in Grand Haven and Holland.

Abandoned properties sometimes don't have records documenting the parcel's previous uses. If it were used as an industrial site, hazardous waste could be left behind. The EPA funds pay for deep research and assessment of the property to gather the background information for potential developers.

After the EPA helps pay for the cleanup, Vogel said it's up to the local community to decide on the parcel's future uses.

In Hudsonville, the funds have been focused on housing projects, such as the recently completed Prospect Flats, and the under-construction Terra Station, both along Prospect Avenue in Hudsonville, west of 32nd Street.

""Hudsonville knew they needed more housing,"" Vogel said. ""They are a growing area of the state.""

Vogel pointed out the expanding job opportunities to both the east and west of Hudsonville, in Grand Rapids and Zeeland. However, she said, the EPA funds could be made available to support commercial development or even public buildings like schools.

""Whatever the case may be for the community,"" she said. ""But again, here in Hudsonville, what we're looking at is housing.""

Getting Prospect Flats built was a long road for the property, which once had blighted homes and buildings that the city tore down more than a decade ago. Moxie Group received some brownfield funds for environmental assessment and found some ground contamination that had to be cleaned up before new residences could be safely built there.

""Everything showed a fuel tank from the 1920s,"" said Trevor Petroelje, developer at Moxie. ""We searched for it for a whole day with an excavator and couldn't find anything ... so it must have been removed at some point.""

Remediation also often involves the removal and replacement of contaminated soils.

Petroelje said projects like Prospect Flats are virtually impossible without incentives through the state and federal government.

""The numbers do not work in today's financial climate,"" he said. ""And if they did work without the incentives, the rental rates would be at a place that, they would be unaffordable for people.""

In 2023, Michigan amended the Brownfield Redevelopment Financing Act to include financing for housing-focused development through the Ottawa County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority. Essentially, the state uses some tax revenue to reimburse a developer for building something they wouldn't build otherwise.

Q1 | 12:11: As the rain starts to fall once again, Florida faces a 3rd-and-6. Lagway drops back and finds Aidan Mizell, who gets 9 yards for the conversion. That's the first third-down conversion by the Gators since the LSU game.

Q1 | 14:34: On the opening play, Lagway finds freshman Dallas Wilson, who is blown up and he fumbles. He manages to recover. Not the way the true freshman wanted his first career catch to go.

KICKOFF: Will Stone boots it for the Longhorns, and we are underway. Vernell Brown III runs it out of the end zone, and is tripped up at the 15-yard line. Poor starting field position for the Gators.

PREGAME:

The Longhorns have won the coin toss and they choose to defer. Florida will start with the ball. It is 82 degrees outside, and the wind is blowing 7 miles per hour.

While the rain has halted, the wind has picked up once again. Skies are seemingly clearing, but in a slow matter.

The rain has picked up a little bit as pregame warmups conclude. No signs of lightning or any delay.

A light drizzle has started around 3:00, and fans begin to take out their ponchos. The wind is still heavy.

The wind here at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium is picking up, leaving a cool breeze. Forecasts call for rain in the next 30-45 minutes.

INJURY REPORT:

Florida is without eight players on Saturday, including running backs Ja'Kobi Jackson and Treyaun Webb. That paves the way for freshman Duke Clark to have an increased role in this afternoon's matchup.

On the defensive line, Caleb Banks, Joseph Mbatchou and LJ McCray are all out. In the secondary, Aaron Gates and Dijon Johnson are inactive.

Defensive lineman Brendan Bett, Michai Boireau and George Gumbs Jr. all return for the Gators. Meanwhile, true freshman wide receiver Dallas Wilson will officially make his Gator debut.

For Texas, running back CJ Baxter has been ruled out. Defensive back Malik Muhammad was a game-time decision, but did not warm up and is in street clothes.

Inside, some fans snapped photos with an oversized Lombardi Trophy made out of recycled plastic collected from the stadium while others strolled to their seats carrying beverages in recyclable aluminum cups.

“These are real nice cups,” said Tre Simon, a fan who was impressed at how cold the aluminum cup kept his drink. “Keep this going … I think it’s perfect.”

Stadium staff manually sort recyclables, and an on-site compactor crushes aluminum so the metal can be sold for recycling. The Linc recycled 18 tons of aluminum in 2024 and reinvested the money into the stadium’s sustainability program.

The venue is among several NFL stadiums, also including those in Atlanta and Santa Clara, that have made strides in lowering their carbon footprints by installing solar panels and creating composting and recycling programs. Powering jumbotrons, bright lights and air conditioning requires huge amounts of energy, which can take its toll on the environment. Experts said the moves are a step in the right direction and encourage fans of the most-watched sport in the United States to try similar approaches at home.

“You always want to root for a team that’s doing good by the environment and the community,” said Brendan Gee, an Eagles fan at another home game.

“Why not recycle when you can, and solar panels are pretty cool I guess,” said Jakub Dzafic, another Eagles fan, who added: “Any NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB team should try and do that when they can.”

Solar panels and energy credits

Lincoln Financial Field is considered a leader in venue sustainability. The solar panels produce about 40% of the stadium’s energy annually and renewable energy credits are purchased to offset the rest, said Norman Vossschulte, the Eagles’ vice president of fan experience and sustainability.

“Our hope is that our efforts will inspire our fans to do the same and take some of their own actions. If we all did something, I think it’d make a big difference,” Vossschulte said.

Large sporting events can produce a lot of waste and consume massive amounts of energy. Asked whether a stadium can ever be truly sustainable, Tony Lamanna, construction management professor at Arizona State University, said “every bit counts. “

“I don’t think you necessarily have to be net zero to be making an impact,” he said.

Lamanna said stadium sustainability encompasses both how the venue reduces its own footprint and how it influences fans’ habits.

“If you can model the right actions to the 80,000 fans or however many you have in your stadium, think of the impact,” he said.

Keeping waste out of landfills

Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home to the Falcons in Atlanta, became the first professional sports stadium internationally to achieve a Total Resource Use and Efficiency Platinum certification for diverting 90% or more of its waste from landfills.

“I’d say 98% of what you get out of a concession or point of sale is compostable,” said Adam Fullerton, the stadium’s vice president of operations.

The stadium has a garden that grows fruits and vegetables used by the culinary team, a 680,000-gallon (2,574,080 liter) cistern that collects rainwater that is used for irrigation and 4,000 solar panels. At games, fans who are spotted recycling can be featured on the stadium video board and win a signed jersey. Fullerton said fans seek out the sustainability team in hopes of being spotted.

“Start small and at least start doing something,” is Fullerton’s advice for venues that are interested in becoming more sustainable.

He said it costs about 10 cents per fan who attend events to run the zero waste program.

“In the grand scheme of things, that’s pretty cheap,” he said.

Waste created by tailgating outside the stadium remains a challenge because the parking lots can be outside the scope of the stadium’s waste management program. “It’s really difficult to control what a fan brings with them” to a tailgate, said Fullerton.

Fans can practice sustainability and minimize tailgate waste by packaging food and beverages in reusable containers and placing all waste and recyclables in their corresponding bins, taking public transit and adjusting home thermostats when they leave to save energy and money.

How sustainable marketing can lead to behavior changes

The visibility of stadium sustainability initiatives leads to a sense of group identity and increases the likelihood that fans will adopt that mindset as their own, said Karen Winterich, professor of sustainability and marketing at the Pennsylvania State University.

“One big thing we know about any sort of behavior change, and that includes sustainable behaviors, is that consumers are really motivated by identity, social norms and social pressures,” she said. When everyone puts their can into a stadium recycling bin, it increases the odds they’ll do so at home.

Climate change and renewable energy, especially solar and wind, are topics that are highly politicized. “I think it’s really strategic by the NFL … they’re talking about it for the benefits, but not in a polarizing way,” said Winterich. She said a strategy that often works to get people on board with sustainability is highlighting the benefits of on-site energy usage and how the local environment benefits from less pollution, composting and recycling.

NFL Green, the league’s sustainability program, aims to leave “a green legacy in the communities we visit,” said Anna Isaacson, the league’s senior vice president of social responsibility. For major events such as the Super Bowl, NFL Green hosts community feedback sessions that have inspired efforts such as the league financially supporting a coastal wetland project in Louisiana, where the 2025 Super Bowl was held.

The next Super Bowl will be held at the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Some of the stadium’s sustainable initiatives include 1,162 solar panels, a rooftop garden that yields about 10,000 pounds of crops annually, and recycling and composting 70% of all materials.

“The Bay Area is our home and it’s a unique place with tons of natural beauty. So our goal is to keep our community clean, not just for now, but for the future,” said Francine Melendez Hughes, executive vice president and general manager of Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.
A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody … we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she’s confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

Yet, the three-wheeled segment of electric mobility consistently manages to disappoint. I’ve previously noted the unrealistic optimism and gushing hype surrounding companies like Aptera, Arcimoto, and ElectraMeccanica Solo, but their current situations underline just how fundamentally flawed these business models have always been. After a couple of years of patiently waiting for Aptera to finally fold, the time has come to close off on this. Two of these ventures are effectively dead, while the third is barely clinging to life with no clear path forward.

Aptera epitomizes the chronic failure endemic to three-wheeled EV startups. Promising a lightweight, aerodynamic, solar-powered three-wheeler that captivated EV enthusiasts and media alike, Aptera quickly racked up tens of thousands of reservation deposits. Yet, despite a lot of puff pieces in the press and close to $200 million burned over 20 years, Aptera has not delivered a single vehicle to any of these hopeful customers.

According to its SEC filings in 2024, Aptera had just $13.6 million remaining in cash and had hemorrhaged $95 million in losses over the previous two years. To date, their primary deliverable remains glossy renderings rather than actual automobiles. With the automotive equivalent of no money, no confirmed and firm vendors, and ongoing changes to vehicle architecture, Aptera’s last statement on the subject was that they needed only $60 million to enter production. That’s been the story for two decades.

No credible industry analyst or observer seriously expects Aptera to begin production, let alone scale it profitably, given this stark financial reality.

The Bottom Line Judge Cain’s ruling guarantees offshore energy will remain a political and legal battleground well past the next election.","A ruling in Lake Charles just cracked open Biden’s “permanent” drilling bans—and gave oil markets a future they’d nearly written off.

LAKE CHARLES, La. — Inside a modest courtroom not far from the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. District Judge James D. Cain Jr. issued a decision on October 3 that could reshape America’s energy map for decades. In one stroke, he overturned President Joe Biden’s attempt to place sweeping offshore drilling areas off-limits forever, ruling that the president had reached beyond his legal authority.

The case may sound technical, but its stakes are enormous. The ruling touches vast swaths of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and even Alaska’s Bering Sea—waters federal experts believe hold around 90 billion barrels of oil and 327 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. More than a resource fight, though, this is about power. Judge Cain’s order signals that presidents can’t unilaterally lock away offshore territory forever, leaving the oil market to re-price opportunities it thought were gone for good.

When “Forever” Collides with the Courts

At the heart of the case sat a deceptively simple question: does the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act allow presidents to make offshore drilling bans permanent, or only temporary?

Judge Cain’s answer was blunt—permanent bans go too far. Biden’s orders, which carried no expiration dates, crossed into Congress’s lane. The judge leaned on the Supreme Court’s increasingly weighty “Major Questions Doctrine,” which says big-ticket decisions with massive economic fallout can’t rest on vague executive authority.

One analyst put it in plain English: “If you want to close the door forever on trillions of dollars in energy, you’ll need Congress to say so.”

The lawsuit came from the American Petroleum Institute and a group of Republican-led states including Louisiana, Texas, and Alaska. They walked away with a partial but powerful win.

What the Market Really Heard

On paper, the ruling doesn’t pump a single new barrel tomorrow. Offshore projects often take five to seven years before oil or gas flows. Still, Judge Cain effectively restored something Wall Street loves: optionality.

Instead of writing these waters off for good, investors now see them as “maybe, someday.” That subtle shift carries big weight. Drilling contractors, offshore service firms, and equipment makers suddenly hold call options on future work they thought had vanished. Risk premiums across the offshore supply chain may shrink, even before new lease sales hit the calendar.

As one Houston energy strategist put it: “Smart money isn’t chasing immediate barrels. It’s betting the U.S. offshore once again matters in the long game—especially when OPEC flexes or politics shift.”

A Legal Tug-of-War with No Clear Winner

The decision also deepens a messy contradiction in federal courts. Back in 2019, a judge in Alaska ruled the opposite—that Trump couldn’t undo Obama’s offshore withdrawals without Congress. Now Cain has said Biden couldn’t impose his own permanent bans.

So which is it—withdrawals that last forever unless Congress intervenes, or withdrawals that only last until the next president changes course? The split is stark, and the Supreme Court will almost certainly have to weigh in.

Scholars note the larger irony: the statute at the center of all this, OCSLA, hasn’t been meaningfully updated since 1978. It predates climate science as we know it and leaves courts to referee battles lawmakers have avoided for decades.

The Politics of the Seafloor

The ruling also puts more power in the hands of whoever sits in the Oval Office. President Trump, in his first months back in office, quickly reversed Biden’s bans and reopened affected waters. Cain’s decision validated that move, ensuring future presidents will enjoy the same freedom unless Congress rewrites the rules.

The result is a dizzying cycle: presidents sign orders, lawsuits follow, courts weigh in, the next president flips the script, and the whole dance starts again. For Gulf Coast shipyards and Alaskan fishing towns, that means whiplash between booms and busts. Oil giants, meanwhile, now plan projects not around reservoir lifespans but presidential terms.

State governments won’t sit idle either. Blue states are likely to use coastal zone laws and permitting tools to slow development, while red states grease the skids. Geography, not just geology, may determine which offshore fields ever see a drill bit.

Climate Advocates Shift Their Battle Plan

Environmental groups wasted no time announcing an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative benches in the country. If the court upholds Cain’s decision, the fight will almost certainly land at the Supreme Court.

But activists aren’t waiting. Recognizing that permanent withdrawals may be off the table, they’re already pivoting to procedural fights. Instead of sweeping bans, they’ll challenge individual lease sales under environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

“The strategy moves from ‘no’ to ‘slow,’” explained one law professor. That means case-by-case battles over whales in the Gulf, seismic surveys in Alaska, and climate impact reviews. Death by a thousand delays can be just as effective as an outright ban, especially since offshore projects rely on long-term certainty. A rig that makes sense with seven years of lead time may collapse under the math if it drags to fifteen.

Investors Look for Signals

For investors, this ruling doesn’t scream “green light” so much as “watch this space.” Don’t expect a rush of new rigs tomorrow. Do expect quiet increases in seismic surveys, acreage swaps between companies, and design work that lays groundwork for future drilling.

Companies with lighter exposure—drilling contractors, subsea equipment makers, and Gulf Coast yards with diversified businesses—stand to gain first. Offshore wind developers, on the other hand, may find themselves squeezed as federal agencies redirect attention back to oil and gas leasing.

Analysts recommend adjusting models: build in longer permitting timelines, higher compliance costs, and more frequent court delays. But factor in lower risk of a permanent federal shutdown.

The Bottom Line

Judge Cain’s ruling guarantees offshore energy will remain a political and legal battleground well past the next election. Expect narrower, time-limited withdrawals from the Biden administration, offset by aggressive leasing pushes from Trump’s Interior Department. Neither side will secure total victory.

The bigger lesson is clear. When Congress refuses to modernize outdated laws, the courts and the White House fill the void, leaving energy policy swinging between extremes. For markets, that means maximum uncertainty wrapped in the illusion of clarity.

Investors can now buy the idea of U.S. offshore potential, but whether those barrels ever come to market is anyone’s guess. The answer will depend on judges, elections, and a Congress that hasn’t touched the rulebook since bell-bottom jeans were still in fashion.",https://static.myboardtoday.com/app/fdcb87e3-3d43-4526-9db4-23dcf1b9f7ce/2892bd83-8838-4aec-acc9-af93aaf4c389_-_29b18b11-ae23-49bd-be16-4eaca83e996d-cover.webp,N,,2025-10-04 16:00:57.860627

Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.
There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.
Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
Aging plants and optimism The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.

Meta announced a $10 billion, four-million-square-foot AI data center in Richland Parish, its largest in the world, which will require new natural gas plants.","In a Supreme Court docket stuffed with blockbuster cases, it has been easy to miss the news about a dispute with a puzzling line-up of litigants: a deep-red, energy-rich state — Louisiana — suing the very energy producers that have been central drivers of the state and national economy.

This case, and other similar ones, are not just legally dubious — they could also harm the country’s efforts to meet our growing energy challenges.

At the outset of World War II, the U.S. government recognized that oil was going to be a key to victory. Partnering with industry, Uncle Sam entered into numerous contracts for the production of crude oil. Much of that activity happened in Louisiana, and since the war ended the energy production in the state has only continued to expand.

Companies, acting with valid state and federal permits, have built a sprawling system of offshore production, pipelines and terminals. The state now ranks third in natural gas production, has one-sixth of the nation’s refining capacity and is home to a growing liquefied natural gas export capacity.

But starting in 2013, multiple Louisiana parishes have filed more than 40 lawsuits against the companies. They claimed that decades of oil and gas activity accelerated coastal land loss, and they are seeking billions of dollars in damages. This spring, a Plaquemines Parish jury hit Chevron with a $744.6 million verdict.

Chevron, supported by the Trump administration, former U.S. attorneys general and former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has now petitioned the Supreme Court to move the dispute from state to federal court, arguing that it is a more appropriate and fairer venue.

The jurisdictional question matters, but even more important is the impact these Louisiana lawsuits, and others like them around the country, could have on U.S. energy security, the economy and even conservation projects.

President Trump has made U.S. energy dominance a central priority. His Unleashing American Energy executive order directed increased exploration and production on federal lands and waters. A subsequent, companion order, Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, sought to curb state-level barriers to energy infrastructure.

The Louisiana lawsuits do exactly the opposite: They add uncertainty, invite endless litigation and send a chilling message to energy producers considering billions in new investment.

And the need for energy has never been greater. The artificial intelligence revolution is fueling a massive surge in electricity demand. Data centers consume enormous amounts of power, much of it supplied by natural gas.

Louisiana is already cashing in. Meta announced a $10 billion, four-million-square-foot AI data center in Richland Parish, its largest in the world, which will require new natural gas plants. Hut 8 is building a $2.5 billion campus in West Feliciana Parish.

These projects promise thousands of jobs and billions in investment. Yet they depend on the very energy infrastructure now under legal attack in Louisiana. The contradiction is striking: Local governments and juries are punishing oil and gas companies while the state is welcoming data-hungry industries that will only deepen reliance on them.

And just this year, in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress raised the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act revenue-sharing cap by 30 percent, from $500 million to $650 million per year. Of that, $487.5 million will go to Gulf Coast states, including Louisiana, and $162.5 million to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.

Louisiana officials estimate this will mean an additional $46 million per year flowing directly into the state’s Coastal Trust Fund for restoration and environmental protection. But this increase only matters if production continues to grow, something that the lawsuits cut against.

So why is Louisiana pressing ahead? Many point to the influence of the trial bar. For years, trial lawyers have pushed these cases, which promise eye-popping payouts for local governments. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, despite his otherwise pro-industry profile, has thrown his weight behind the litigation.

It raises a blunt question: Are these lawsuits about saving wetlands, or about funneling billions from America’s energy backbone into the pockets of lawyers?

Louisiana should be leading the charge for American energy, not undermining it. The stakes here are bigger than Plaquemines Parish or even the Gulf Coast. They touch every American who depends on affordable and reliable energy.

The country should be pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy to meet our growing energy needs, supply energy to our allies, and build our economy. Policies that encourage responsible development are the way to go; lawsuits that seek to rewrite the rules and enrich trial lawyers are not.

Ecofin Agency: Endeavour Mining recently published its Q2 financial results. Can you reflect on your performance for the first half of the year?

Djaria Traoré : Our second-quarter results reinforced the strong momentum of the first half of 2025, with production of 647,000 ounces (over 18 tonnes of gold) at a sector-leading all-in sustaining cost of US$1,281 per ounce. In six months, we generated more than US$515 million in free cash flow, further strengthening our balance sheet and fully benefiting from a supportive gold price.

This performance reflects the quality of our portfolio and the consistency of our operational discipline. Beyond the numbers, it demonstrates our ability to deliver sustained value creation while maintaining strong local integration and resilience across our business.

Ecofin Agency: You hold a dual strategic role: ESG (environment, social and governance) and operations. What does this integration mean in practice for a group like Endeavour Mining? Can financial performance and social impact still be seen as separate in the mining industry? What is the link between operational resilience and ESG performance?

Djaria Traoré : This dual role highlights a fundamental reality: operational performance and ESG are directly connected. A mine that fails to invest in its people, build capacity for suppliers and host communities, or address its environmental impact increases its risk exposure and weakens its social licence to operate.

By contrast, embedding ESG into operations strengthens resilience and long-term value creation – reducing disruptions, lowering costs, reinforcing licence to operate, and driving measurable efficiency gains. ESG is not an add-on; it is a core driver of sustainable cash flow and portfolio strength.

“A mine that fails to invest in its people, build capacity for suppliers and host communities, or address its environmental impact increases its risk exposure and weakens its social licence to operate.”

That is why Endeavour has brought these two areas together within one department, ensuring ESG principles are fully embedded into daily operations and aligned with our long-term strategy.

Ecofin Agency: Your 2024 Annual Report highlights significant economic contributions (US$2.2 billion) and a local employment rate of nearly 97%. How do you explain the differentiated distribution of these contributions between Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire and Burkina Faso? How do these figures reflect a truly inclusive value creation model, and how can you ensure this value benefits mining regions sustainably?

Djaria Traoré : It is important to look beyond headline numbers and understand the impact they represent. Our mission goes further than producing gold – it is about creating meaningful value for the countries and regions where we operate.

In 2024, Endeavour delivered a total economic contribution of US$2.2 billion across our host countries. This included US$731 million paid in taxes, royalties and dividends to Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal, directly supporting national budgets and public services.

“In 2024, Endeavour delivered a total economic contribution of US$2.2 billion across our host countries. This included US$731 million paid in taxes, royalties and dividends to Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal, directly supporting national budgets and public services.”

We are also one of the largest private employers in West Africa, distributing US$271 million in salaries and benefits. Each direct job sustains many more through local supply chains, amplifying our impact across regional economies. In addition, 83% of our procurement – equivalent to US$1.23 billion – was spent in-country. This underscores our commitment to maximising local procurement, strengthening national supply chains, and ensuring that the value generated by our operations remains within host economies.

At the same time, we recognise that value is not measured in financial terms alone. Investments in education, healthcare, environmental protection and economic empowerment through our ESG programmes and the Endeavour Foundation are equally central to sustaining long-term value creation.

Ecofin Agency: Last year you launched a Sustainability Award for your employees. What ambitions do you hope to achieve through this initiative, and what types of projects or people do you want to highlight?

Djaria Traoré : The Sustainability Award embodies a simple but powerful belief: ESG should be a mindset shared by all our employees. It recognises those who, every day in the field, translate our commitments into concrete actions: protecting safety, preserving the environment, strengthening community ties, driving social innovation, or reducing our carbon footprint.

Beyond recognition, this award helps create momentum and demonstrates that everyone can contribute to our collective ambition. It is both a source of inspiration and a marker of company culture. Because being a responsible mining company means “bringing ESG to life” by enabling everyone to play their part.

Ecofin Agency: At Sabodala-Massawa, Endeavour has reduced its emissions by 24% thanks to the commissioning of a solar power plant. Do you now have a clear energy transition strategy for the whole group? How do you reconcile gold production with carbon neutrality?

Djaria Traoré : We are pursuing a clear decarbonisation roadmap: to reduce our emissions by 30% by 2030. To achieve this, we are deploying multiple levers such as grid connections, renewable energy, energy efficiency or alternative fuels.

In 2024, we inaugurated a 37 MWp solar plant at Sabodala-Massawa (Senegal), one of the largest in the mining sector in West Africa. Similar initiatives are under way elsewhere: renewable energy certificates at our Houndé and Mana sites (Burkina Faso), cleaner fuels at Ity (Côte d’Ivoire), and energy-efficient technologies at Lafigué (Côte d’Ivoire).

Gold production remains energy-intensive, but we are convinced that embedding climate ambition into industrial performance makes this reconciliation possible.

Ecofin Agency: Many stakeholders are asking mining companies to “do more” on transparency, inclusion or the environment. What are your concrete priorities for 2025? And in an African context where expectations are high and competition is intensifying, what distinguishes Endeavour Mining’s ESG approach?

Djaria Traoré : We fully integrate the expectations of strong governance, inclusion and responsibility into our activities. The taxes, royalties and dividends we pay are a vital resource for our host countries, directly funding public services and critical infrastructure.

That is why we commit to full transparency on these contributions. We apply the highest international governance and reporting standards, from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to the World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles. We were also among the first African gold producers to adopt the GRI 207 tax transparency standard, which goes beyond disclosing payments to cover tax governance, incentives and the presence in low-tax jurisdictions. This proactive approach sets us apart: we aim to remain a benchmark for responsible mining in Africa and to consolidate our role as a trusted partner for governments, communities and investors.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/8fc1defd33a0f3ef3b7c440137c19fde_S.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 23:58:01.140216

What Kern and the entire nation need is a balanced energy policy that includes support for fossil fuels and renewable energy.","Balance is the word we keep hearing in debates over local, state and federal energy policies.

No one energy source should be considered the only energy source to meet the nation’s growing needs. It requires oil production (one of Kern County’s major economic engines), as well as renewable energy.

Kern is rich in many energy sources — oil, solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biofuels, energy storage and likely other future sources.

For government to prioritize one source over others is short-sighted and damaging — to the people who work and live in Kern County, as well as the entire nation.

While other countries, notably China, are moving to dominate wind and solar energy development, the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie predicts renewable energy installations in the United States may be 18% lower over the next five years, as a result of the axing of federal tax credits, development grants and permits.

Citing “national security” concerns, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in August shut down construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind offshore project for Rhode Island and Connecticut. Work resumed after developers sued and a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C., ruled shutdown of the project, which is expected to power 350,000 homes, would irreparably harm developers. Continuing work was in the public’s interest. Already $5 billion had been spent getting the project to 80% completion. Construction delays were costing the company $2.3 million a day.

Declaring renewable energy projects to be a wasteful use of tax dollars, federal agencies over the past eight months have canceled or delayed support for more than 120 renewable energy projects across the nation. That amounts to nearly 14 gigawatts of energy — enough to power more than 8.4 million homes.

California’s plan to develop 25 gigawatts of floating offshore wind energy by 2045 was one of those projects. When federal funding was canceled, five ocean leases already had been granted to develop projects off the coast of Humboldt and Morro Bay. Last month, lawmakers and the governor reconfirmed state support for the plan, focusing money from Proposition 4, a bond measure California voters passed last year, to improve ports in Humboldt Bay and Long Beach to accommodate the wind energy project.

Nearly 25% of U.S. power generation is coming from renewable sources, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported in June. Renewable energy generation records are being broken in Texas, across the Great Plains states, in New England and the mid-Atlantic. In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the United States, wind has become a big energy commodity.

Among renewable energy supporters are some of the largest fossil fuel producers. As an example, Shell Oil has significantly increased its investments in renewable energy sources, focusing on wind, solar and bioenergy projects globally. The company is actively involved in partnerships and collaborations to enhance renewable technologies. Volatile weather, electric vehicles and AI-focused data centers are driving up demand for all types of energy.

Critics call renewable energy undependable because solar plants operate at the mercy of the sun and wind projects operate at the mercy of the weather. But that has fueled a foot race among tech giants to build battery facilities to store energy for distribution during down times.

National energy policy has long been a political football kicked around by both Democratic and Republican administrations. Former Democratic President Joe Biden pulled the plug on the Keystone XL pipeline, which was already under construction. Republican President Donald Trump campaigned for reelection calling for increased oil, gas and coal production, and the slashing of funding for renewable energy projects, including solar and wind.

What Kern and the entire nation need is a balanced energy policy that includes support for fossil fuels and renewable energy. It doesn’t need politicians scoring political points and raking in campaign dollars at the expense of America’s energy future.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-10-04 20:00:47.145038

Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.
There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.
Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts.","U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.

But they’ll soon have the opportunity to tap into larger state-level benefits starting next month.

Colorado is boosting rebates through the state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program for new and used electric vehicles by thousands of dollars starting on Nov. 3, according to an announcement on Thursday from Gov. Jared Polis’ office.

The program aims to incentivize more electric vehicle use by offering rebates to Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid. Starting on Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle will increase from $6,000 to $9,000, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones.

The incentive boost comes after Congress ended a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles, which expired on Sept. 30. Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit, the benefit was created under former President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a major climate and health law.

The tax credit was initially set to last through 2032, but Republicans in Congress cut that timeline short as part of the sweeping tax and spending-cut law they passed this summer, which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

Colorado remains a leader in electric vehicle adoption, with more than 200,000 registered in the state to date, according to Polis’ office. Electric vehicles account for a quarter of all car sales in Colorado so far in 2025.

Funding for Colorado’s vehicle exchange program comes from fees on package and food delivery services. Money for the higher rebates will come from the program’s existing budget for the 2026 fiscal year, according to Polis’ office.

The rebates are reserved for Coloradans changing from cars that are at least 12 years old or that fail a Colorado emissions test. Households must also make under 80% of their county’s area median income to qualify.

The state also has its own tax credit to further incentivize electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, is being reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting on Jan. 1, 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

The Maryland Offshore Wind Project and the Maryland Solar for All initiatives took significant blows after President Donald Trump cancelled grants for renewable projects across the nation.

Trump has described wind and solar as “expensive and unreliable energy sources,” seeking instead to promote domestic fossil fuel production.

Since the onset of his administration, Trump has signed 15 executive orders shifting federal policy away from renewable energy initiatives toward more traditional energy sources such as oil and coal.

Maryland Offshore Wind Project

On Sept. 12, the Trump administration filed a court order to reconsider approval of the Offshore Wind Project in its entirety. Despite a revocation of federal funding, Maryland Offshore Wind Project officials expect to win a legal challenge to the order.

“We intend to vigorously defend those permits in federal court, and we are confident that the court will uphold their validity and prevent any adverse action against them,” Nancy Sopko, US Wind’s vice president of external affairs said in a statement.

The Trump administration order is just the latest setback to the project. On Aug. 25, the administration filed a court order to revoke the federal government’s approval of funding for a steel manufacturing plant in Sparrows Point in Baltimore County.

The factory would provide steel for projects Marwin and Momentum Wind, which are wind energy farms being constructed off Maryland’s coast. The projects represent the first two of three planned phases of implementing offshore wind infrastructure in Maryland.

“The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) is in the process of reconsidering its prior approval of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project Construction and Operations Plan,” the suit states.

US Wind, the developer behind the offshore construction project, filed a counterclaim on Sept. 3, contesting the Trump administration’s environmental and economic concerns.

“Federal Defendants’ decision to vacate represents a drastic departure from their prior full-throated support and defense of the Project, and Federal Defendants have failed to acknowledge or offer a reasoned explanation for their about-face,” the filing in the U.S. District Court in the District of Maryland states.

The counterclaim also alleges that the revocation of US Wind’s permits was due to “political pressure…applied to the Federal Defendants’ decisionmakers.”

The Sparrows Point project is also slated to continue, according to Sopko.

On Aug. 29, the Department of Transportation announced that it would withdraw nearly $680 million from offshore wind projects, including nearly $50 million in federal funding for the nearly-completed wind turbine production facility in Maryland.

The Sparrows Point project and a dozen other wind projects lost federal funding due to a lack of alignment with the “goals and priorities of the administration,” according to a Transportation Department statement.

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy indicated that these funds likely would be redirected into supporting the domestic maritime industry.

As part of a larger Maryland Offshore Wind Project, US Wind established the manufacturing plant in Sparrows Point to supply materials for the in-state construction of wind turbines. In November 2023, the Department of Transportation’s Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) awarded the $47 million in grant funding to help construct the factory.

Talks of constructing a Maryland wind farm began as early as 2010, when the federal Bureau of Offshore Energy Management put out feelers for interest in wind energy ventures off the East Coast.

In 2014, US Wind, Inc. won a bid for the 80,000-acre lease off the coast of Ocean City that would be the base for its Maryland Offshore Wind Project facilities.

The wind farm project was approved for construction by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2024. Overall, the project was expected to cost around $2.6 billion.

The Maryland Offshore Wind Project includes the construction of up to 114 wind turbines, along with four offshore substations and a meteorological tower. If completed, the wind farm would be able to power over 700,000 homes across the Delmarva Peninsula.

Many Ocean City officials and business leaders have long opposed the project, citing concerns that the turbines will disrupt tourism and wildlife and hurt property values.

Phase 1 of the project’s construction was anticipated to be completed in 2029.

Maryland Solar For All

The Maryland Clean Energy Center, located in College Park, also saw a cancellation of over $62 million in EPA solar-related funding on Aug. 7. The grant was administered last year through the national $7 billion Solar For All program, which has since been cancelled.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the end of the Solar For All program, stating that the “EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The Solar For All program, created by the Biden administration in April 2024, aimed to provide resources for residential solar projects in low-income areas. The grant to the Maryland Clean Energy Center would have helped to fund around 1,000 solar projects, adding a projected 10,000 households to solar power infrastructure.

Trump has remained critical of solar projects’ impacts on farmland, disapproving of federal investment in such programs.

“We will not approve…farmer destroying Solar,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!”

The Department of Energy earlier this month posted on X: “Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.”

Critics pounced on the post as uninformed, pointing out that wind and solar systems use storage batteries.

California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office replied on X: “We’re excited for the Trump Admin to learn about BATTERIES (we have them here in California, and they’ve helped the Golden State shift to green, clean energy AND keep the lights on).”

Inside, some fans snapped photos with an oversized Lombardi Trophy made out of recycled plastic collected from the stadium while others strolled to their seats carrying beverages in recyclable aluminum cups.

“These are real nice cups,” said Tre Simon, a fan who was impressed at how cold the aluminum cup kept his drink. “Keep this going ... I think it’s perfect.”

Stadium staff manually sort recyclables, and an on-site compactor crushes aluminum so the metal can be sold for recycling. The Linc recycled 18 tons of aluminum in 2024 and reinvested the money into the stadium’s sustainability program.

The venue is among several NFL stadiums, also including those in Atlanta and Santa Clara, that have made strides in lowering their carbon footprints by installing solar panels and creating composting and recycling programs. Powering jumbotrons, bright lights and air conditioning requires huge amounts of energy, which can take its toll on the environment. Experts said the moves are a step in the right direction and encourage fans of the most-watched sport in the United States to try similar approaches at home.

“You always want to root for a team that’s doing good by the environment and the community,” said Brendan Gee, an Eagles fan at another home game.

“Why not recycle when you can, and solar panels are pretty cool I guess,” said Jakub Dzafic, another Eagles fan, who added: “Any NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB team should try and do that when they can.""

Lincoln Financial Field is considered a leader in venue sustainability. The solar panels produce about 40% of the stadium's energy annually and renewable energy credits are purchased to offset the rest, said Norman Vossschulte, the Eagles' vice president of fan experience and sustainability.

“Our hope is that our efforts will inspire our fans to do the same and take some of their own actions. If we all did something, I think it’d make a big difference,” Vossschulte said.

Large sporting events can produce a lot of waste and consume massive amounts of energy. Asked whether a stadium can ever be truly sustainable, Tony Lamanna, construction management professor at Arizona State University, said “every bit counts. ""

""I don’t think you necessarily have to be net zero to be making an impact,” he said.

Lamanna said stadium sustainability encompasses both how the venue reduces its own footprint and how it influences fans' habits.

“If you can model the right actions to the 80,000 fans or however many you have in your stadium, think of the impact,"" he said.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home to the Falcons in Atlanta, became the first professional sports stadium internationally to achieve a Total Resource Use and Efficiency Platinum certification for diverting 90% or more of its waste from landfills.

“I’d say 98% of what you get out of a concession or point of sale is compostable,” said Adam Fullerton, the stadium's vice president of operations.

The stadium has a garden that grows fruits and vegetables used by the culinary team, a 680,000-gallon (2,574,080 liter) cistern that collects rainwater that is used for irrigation and 4,000 solar panels. At games, fans who are spotted recycling can be featured on the stadium video board and win a signed jersey. Fullerton said fans seek out the sustainability team in hopes of being spotted.

“Start small and at least start doing something,” is Fullerton’s advice for venues that are interested in becoming more sustainable.

He said it costs about 10 cents per fan who attend events to run the zero waste program.

“In the grand scheme of things, that’s pretty cheap,” he said.

Waste created by tailgating outside the stadium remains a challenge because the parking lots can be outside the scope of the stadium’s waste management program. “It’s really difficult to control what a fan brings with them” to a tailgate, said Fullerton.

Fans can practice sustainability and minimize tailgate waste by packaging food and beverages in reusable containers and placing all waste and recyclables in their corresponding bins, taking public transit and adjusting home thermostats when they leave to save energy and money.

The visibility of stadium sustainability initiatives leads to a sense of group identity and increases the likelihood that fans will adopt that mindset as their own, said Karen Winterich, professor of sustainability and marketing at the Pennsylvania State University.

“One big thing we know about any sort of behavior change, and that includes sustainable behaviors, is that consumers are really motivated by identity, social norms and social pressures,” she said. When everyone puts their can into a stadium recycling bin, it increases the odds they'll do so at home.

Climate change and renewable energy, especially solar and wind, are topics that are highly politicized. “I think it’s really strategic by the NFL … they’re talking about it for the benefits, but not in a polarizing way,” said Winterich. She said a strategy that often works to get people on board with sustainability is highlighting the benefits of on-site energy usage and how the local environment benefits from less pollution, composting and recycling.

NFL Green, the league’s sustainability program, aims to leave ""a green legacy in the communities we visit,” said Anna Isaacson, the league's senior vice president of social responsibility. For major events such as the Super Bowl, NFL Green hosts community feedback sessions that have inspired efforts such as the league financially supporting a coastal wetland project in Louisiana, where the 2025 Super Bowl was held.

The next Super Bowl will be held at the Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Some of the stadium’s sustainable initiatives include 1,162 solar panels, a rooftop garden that yields about 10,000 pounds of crops annually, and recycling and composting 70% of all materials.

“The Bay Area is our home and it’s a unique place with tons of natural beauty. So our goal is to keep our community clean, not just for now, but for the future,” said Francine Melendez Hughes, executive vice president and general manager of Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.

RadiansPlus Technologies Unveils PSN-DLM: A Breakthrough in Dynamic Load Management Powered by Power System Neutral

Innovative solution eliminates grid upgrade bottlenecks, enabling rapid and equitable adoption of EVs and solar energy without costly infrastructure expansion

By harnessing flexibility on both the demand and supply sides, PSN-DLM unlocks the full potential of existing infrastructure, making decarbonization faster, fairer, and more affordable.”

— Geoffrey Chan

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, October 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- RadiansPlus Technologies, a pioneer in sustainable grid innovation, today announced the launch of PSN-DLM (Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management), a groundbreaking technology that redefines how electric vehicle (EV) charging and distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems interact with existing grid infrastructure.

As cities worldwide race toward net-zero targets, grid capacity constraints have emerged as a critical barrier to scaling EV charging and solar adoption—especially in high-density urban environments. Traditional approaches rely on expensive, time-consuming grid upgrades or battery energy storage systems (BESS), often passing significant costs onto consumers or taxpayers while generating additional embodied carbon during construction.

Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management (PSN-DLM) changes the game. Built on RadiansPlus’ patented Power System Neutral (PSN) architecture, PSN-DLM intelligently orchestrates real-time energy demand and supply by differentiating between power (instantaneous load) and energy (total consumption over time). The system dynamically manages flexible loads—such as EV charging—and modulates solar export to align with available grid capacity, ensuring seamless integration without overloading substations or feeders.

Key Benefits of Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management:

• Zero Grid Expansion Required: Enables full utilization of existing grid assets, deferring or eliminating the need for costly upgrades.

• 80%+ Cost Savings: Compared to conventional grid reinforcement or BESS deployment.

• Equitable Access: Makes EV charging and solar energy accessible in underserved communities, public housing, and dense urban zones.

• Grid-Friendly Integration: Real-time coordination between EVs, PV systems, and grid constraints ensures stability and maximizes renewable utilization.

• Rapid Deployment: Short certification and installation timelines accelerate time-to-value for charge point operators (CPOs), building owners, and utilities.

“PSN-DLM delivers the ‘friendly handshake’ the energy transition desperately needs—between EVs, solar panels, and the grid,” said Geoffrey Chan, Co-Founder & Technical Director of RadiansPlus Technologies. “By harnessing flexibility on both the demand and supply sides, we unlock the full potential of existing infrastructure, making decarbonization faster, fairer, and more affordable.”

The technology has already been validated across multiple pilot sites in Asia, including public housing estates in Hong Kong and Singapore, commercial hubs like VivoCity Mall, and transportation infrastructure managed by airport authorities. These deployments demonstrate grid utilization improvements of up to 90% and the ability to support EV charging loads up to 200% of original substation capacity—without hardware upgrades.

PSN-DLM is part of RadiansPlus’ integrated “Solution in a Box” offering, compatible with OCPP standards and is preparing for a future where it is ready for integration with BESS and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) networks. The company is actively engaging with utilities, regulators, CPOs, and real estate developers to scale deployment across Asia and beyond.

The reasonable implication here is that buyers are paying attention to tax credits, and prefer buying when these credits will apply to their purchases.
The takeaway: Expect EV demand to be lower in 2026 than previously expected.
As EV producers, Tesla, Lucid, and Rivian all earn credits under this program.
The elimination of the consumer tax credit will hit EV demand.","Earlier this year, electric car stocks across the board saw sharp declines after the U.S. government revealed that several critical EV subsidies would be eliminated. Since then, however, most of those initial losses have been erased. Yet the effect of these subsidies being eliminated remains.

If you have money invested in Lucid Group (LCID 2.68%), Rivian (RIVN 0.85%), or Tesla (TSLA -1.41%), be sure to understand the two problems below that all three of these automakers will face very soon.

1. Electric car demand may be lower than expected

Governments around the world have been offering incentives that lower the price of EVs for customers since the 1990s. In 2010, the U.S. began offering consumers a tax credit that ranged between $2,500 and $7,500 when buying a new or used electric vehicle. There were rules related to which cars qualified and who exactly could receive the credit. But all in all, these tax credits deployed billions of dollars to lower the upfront cost of buying an electric vehicle.

On Sept. 30, 2025, these tax credits will be formally eliminated. This effectively raises the final cost of an EV by up to $7,500. At a time when nearly 70% of Americans are hoping to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle purchase, the elimination of this subsidy should immediately hit EV demand. Already, we're seeing a small but noticeable bump in EV purchases -- a signal that people who have sat on the fence are buying before the tax credits expire. The reasonable implication here is that buyers are paying attention to tax credits, and prefer buying when these credits will apply to their purchases.

The takeaway: Expect EV demand to be lower in 2026 than previously expected. To counteract this, EV makers may be forced to cut prices, stoking demand, but reducing gross profits. Critically, both Lucid and Rivian expect to start production on vehicles with prices under $50,000 over the next six to 24 months. These budget vehicles are intended to massively increase their total addressable markets. Should those newer models have qualified, they will now be missing a key subsidy that would have made them even more attractive to cost-conscious buyers.

2. This little-known multi-billion-dollar subsidy won't exist in 2026

Many EV investors are already aware of the U.S. tax credits that are set to expire at the end of September. However, most don't realize that there's another program about to be axed that is equally valuable: CAFE regulatory credits, which are credits earned by auto manufacturers that exceed fuel economy standards.

As EV producers, Tesla, Lucid, and Rivian all earn credits under this program. These companies then sell these credits to other automakers that would otherwise face fines for not producing enough low-emission vehicles. Because these credits are earned automatically, they can be sold at essentially 100% profit margins.

The value of this little-understood program is immense. Tesla routinely earned billions of dollars per year from this program, accounting for 10% to 30% of its gross profit. Rivian has already told investors that it wouldn't realize $100 million in revenue from the sale of its credits, since these credits are no longer worth anything. Fines for non-compliance have been eliminated, taking away any incentive for competing automakers to value and purchase these credits. Lucid, too, has earned hundreds of millions of dollars in ""free"" profit from this program.

The elimination of the consumer tax credit will hit EV demand. But the elimination of automotive regulatory credits like this will have an equally damaging effect. Rivian and Lucid are still struggling for profitability, and now they will lose a highly profitable revenue source. Tesla, meanwhile, has benefited the most from this program on a sheer volume basis. The elimination of these credits may not make headlines, but it poses problems for all three companies in 2026 and beyond.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835557/gettyimages-152404829-1200x960-4134ff9.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 14:01:15.816233

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead ""the worst polluters"" to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

""Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,"" said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they ""significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough."" Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an ""environmental ethic"" in his first speech.

""Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.""

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it has also added fighting climate change to its charge.

The EPA's job is essentially setting standards for what's healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done, and then acting as Earth's police officer if it isn't.

""Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country's overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.""

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to ""restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making the U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the ""endangerment"" finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and other sources.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year, and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won't issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

""Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,"" Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. ""So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

QUITO (Reuters) -Ecuador’s government has revoked the environmental license granted to Canadian mining company DPM Metals for the development of Loma Larga, a gold project in an environmentally sensitive area, the government said on Saturday.

The decision follows strong opposition from residents and authorities in the Azuay province, where the Loma Larga project is located. They argue that its development would affect the Quimsacocha water reserve, posing significant health risks to local communities.

Ecuador’s Environment and Energy Ministry said in a statement the decision was the result of technical reports submitted by local authorities in Cuenca and Azuay that are responsible for local drinking water and irrigation systems.

“The national government reaffirms its commitment to the rights of nature, the defense of water sources, and, under the precautionary principle, the protection of the health and well-being of the people of Cuenca and Azuay,” it said.

DPM, which acquired the project in 2021, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Loma Larga project was expected to receive investments of $419 million for an average annual production of about 200,000 ounces of gold during its first five years of operation, according to DPM.

In August, the Ecuadorean government had already suspended activities related to the project until the company released an environmental management plan, despite having granted it a license a month earlier to begin construction.

Despite having significant gold and copper deposits, Ecuador’s recent legal rulings and local opposition has often halted mining projects. Currently, only two mining companies operate in the country.

The Quimsacocha Reserve spans more than 3,200 hectares and encompasses the Andean “paramo” ecosystem.

Its springs form one of the main water sources in the South American country. The company had pledged to implement efficient and responsible environmental management in the area.

Globally known for confectionery and pet food, Mars is also recognised for its integration of sustainable practices across its operations and supply chains.

Collaborating with Enel, the company is taking significant steps towards reducing its carbon footprint through its Renewable Acceleration programme.

“Many large companies are well on their way to sourcing renewable electricity for their own operations, but that’s just a part of the picture,” Kevin Rabinovitch, Global VP Sustainability at Mars says.

“For Mars, Renewable Acceleration is a performance accelerator, cutting emissions at a scale and speed we could never achieve through traditional value chain engagement approaches. It lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.""

This collaboration focuses on involving the entire value chain, aiming for a comprehensive shift to renewables, from sourcing to transportation.

Innovation in energy usage

The clean energy shift at Mars extends to its supply chain activities, from the farms producing ingredients through to the trucks delivering products.

""[The partnership with Enel] means sourcing renewable electricity to cover everything from the farms that grow our ingredients to the trucks that deliver products, and even the energy used by consumers at home to enjoy their favourite Mars products, like Ben’s Original and SNICKERS Ice Cream, or at their BANFIELD veterinarian’s office,"" says Alastair Child, Chief Sustainability Officer at Mars.

""By implementing this strategy, we could cut around three million tons of carbon emissions from the Mars full value chain, amounting to an estimated 10% of our current total footprint. This is a huge unlock for decarbonisation and we’re just getting started.""

Mars has committed to renewable electricity as a cost-effective and publicly supported solution for decarbonisation.

Building a sustainable future

The first substantial contract under this programme is with Enel North America, marking Mars' largest engagement in clean power agreements.

“Renewable Acceleration is a bold initiative to support the buildout of more clean energy capacity, which we know is among the fastest and most economical ways to decarbonise,” adds Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America.

“Mars is raising the bar for corporate sustainability strategies, taking a comprehensive and direct approach to addressing emissions across its entire value chain. Enel is proud to partner with Mars in launching this new program.”

Through Mars' global renewable energy contracts, the company is working towards making its operations more sustainable and encouraging other businesses to adopt similar strategies.

By forging multiple supplier relationships, Mars enhances its energy resilience and progresses towards its decarbonisation objectives faster.

The initial agreements with Enel are set to produce 1.8TWh annually, contributing to a significant reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.

Such initiatives not only transform Mars' supply chain but also set a precedent for others in the sector to follow suit.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/62a82981ab16dd951068ad0990034462:bb2455a98e9e7bd321a36d36f148c8ad/aurora-solar-farm-dual-use-solar-min.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 17:03:05.208711

It designates up to $7 billion in competitive grants to establish between six and 10 regional clean hydrogen hubs across the United States.
The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association is a collective of government, tribal, labor, energy, research, nonprofit, and private sector stakeholders aimed at creating a hydrogen center in the Pacific Northwest region.
“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt.
“Cutting these funds delays the inevitable as clean energy trends toward hydrogen production for industrial use.","Local lawmakers weighed in on the Trump Administration’s cuts to approximately $1 billion worth of federal funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), which supports clean energy efforts in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon.

The H2Hubs program was established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). It designates up to $7 billion in competitive grants to establish between six and 10 regional clean hydrogen hubs across the United States. These networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure help accelerate the use of hydrogen as clean energy and work toward achieving the goal of a 100 percent clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The cuts include the elimination of more than 10,000 jobs across the region (mainly in rural areas).

In Washington State these cuts include:

• Alare Renewables (Whatcom County): $102,797,603

• Atlas Agro (Benton County): $157,342,270

• Northwest Seaport Alliance (King/Pierce Counties): $11,800,670

• Lewis County Transit (Lewis County): $36,385,400

The White House Office of Management and Budget announced the cuts on Wednesday, October 1.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a collective of projects aimed at green hydrogen ecosystem spurring billions of dollars of infrastructure investment to provide alternatives to fossil fuels, has been years development and won a highly competitive national competition to receive the roughly $1 billion federal funding award.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) choose the Pacific Northwest Hub to demonstrate how clean hydrogen generated from hydropower could be utilized by a range of industries and transportation sectors.

In October 2023, the DOE designated PNWH2 as one of seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) across the nation, focused on harnessing the Pacific Northwest’s abundant and clean hydropower supplies to produce hydrogen through hydrolysis.

In July 2024, DOE announced that PNWH2 received Phase 1 award status and would receive an initial amount of up to $27.5 million to fund initial planning, permitting, and analysis activities to ensure that the overall Hub concept is technologically and financially viable, with input from relevant local stakeholders. Besides the $1 billion in federal cost-sharing, the Hub expected to be matched by over $5 billion in local investments.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association is a collective of government, tribal, labor, energy, research, nonprofit, and private sector stakeholders aimed at creating a hydrogen center in the Pacific Northwest region. This public-private partnership includes leaders from the Washington State Department of Commerce, the Oregon Department of Energy, Amazon, Washington State University, and others.

What local lawmakers are saying:

Following the federal government’s decision on Wednesday, October 1, several Democratic law makers in Washington weighed in on the matter and how it would impact clean energy efforts in Washington.

“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt. Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work. I will be fighting to restore these funds,” said U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

“President Trump’s campaign of political retribution continues, and hardworking Washingtonians are now part of the collateral damage. This politically motivated claw back of funds will result in significant job losses and increased utility bills in our state,” said Congresswoman Suzan DelBene. “The President of the United States is playing politics by targeting states that did not vote for him. I will fight this decision to save Washington jobs and avoid another hike on our energy bills.”

“The Trump administration is raising the cost of living by cancelling local clean energy projects. The Department of Energy is clawing back a billion dollars in funding for Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which has bipartisan support and is set to create thousands of good-paying jobs while decreasing energy prices across our region,” said Congressman Rick Larsen. “Cutting these funds delays the inevitable as clean energy trends toward hydrogen production for industrial use. The President is targeting his political opponents with these cuts, but the economic hurt of these decisions will be felt by everyone in our communities regardless of their politics. I will fight to reverse these cuts.”

Wholesale electricity costs have increased as much as 267 percent since 2020 in areas near data centers, and consumers are emptying their pockets for the power companies.

A very granular Bloomberg analysis of wholesale electricity prices across the country paints a picture of doubled wholesale prices and soaring consumer costs over the past five years. It’s complex, but one thing is for certain: those within 50 miles of data centers are bearing the brunt of it.

The issue is that about two thirds of the country’s power consumption runs on either a state or regional grid. This means the costs necessary for network expansion and maintenance is trickling down to residents and businesses’ electricity bills.

For example, according to Bloomberg‘s analysis of data provided by energy analytics firms Grid Status and DC Byte, Baltimore has seen an increase of 125 percent on its wholesale electricity price, and residents have experienced an average monthly electric bill increase of over $17 in the last year, with expectations of another jump of $4 in 2026. In Texas, data centers are unequivocally the largest new source of power consumption.

Bloomberg projects that the data center power demand will double by 2035. That would be equivalent to just shy of 10 percent of the total electricity demand in the country, and would be the biggest increase since air conditioning became popular in the 1960s, both of which carry significant climate change implications.

It’s also just unfair. Tech companies and their backers are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure right now, which may or may not ultimately pay off — but offloading costs onto regular people who are already struggling with sky-high inflation isn’t part of any reasonable deal.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3auWfKsQWcjYRSbMGQQ0xg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MzA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/futurism_981/39905d2f9813b26df237f545f5d78536,N,,2025-10-05 08:59:36.776300

The number of grants impacted totals $645 million in Minnesota, according to a statement from Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith's office.

Among the projects her office said were affected include $464 million to build new electrical transmission lines connecting Minnesota and other Midwest states, $50 million to upgrade an electrical transmission line between Minnesota and North Dakota, and $1.7 million for research to ensure solar projects save money.

The U.S. Department of Energy provided WCCO a list of the funding recipients across all 16 states expected to see the cuts. Xcel Energy is among them. A spokesperson said the utility company is still evaluating the impact, but it did receive confirmation that a future iron-air battery plant to store renewable energy like solar and wind in Becker, Minnesota, had been canceled. That award totaled $70 million.

In an interview on CNN, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the decisions about where to slash the grants were made over the last few months, even though the announcement came Wednesday, the day the first government shutdown since 2018 began.

""A team of seven or eight people have evaluated over 2,400 projects on business conditions and whether it makes sense for the American taxpayers or not,"" Wright said.

The Minnesota Department of Commerce was also on the list. A spokeswoman said the agency did not get any official notice from the Department of Energy about the termination of funding, but that if it is true, it would ""represent an unprecedented and politically motivated breach of federal law and funding norms.""

""Without these investments, Minnesota could face higher energy prices, slower infrastructure development, and increased burdens on low- and middle-income households — all while demand for clean, affordable energy continues to grow,"" a statement from the state's commerce department said.

U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, the Republican majority whip who represents Minnesota's Sixth District, told reporters Friday that the administration has to make tough decisions during the government shutdown and blamed Democrats for letting it happen.

The GOP-led House approved a continuing resolution in September to keep funding at current levels. But both parties are at an impasse over a funding measure in the Senate, where there is a 60-vote threshold to move forward. Republicans have 53 votes in the chamber.

Emmer suggested the funding could be restored when the shutdown ends.

""They're going to have to put the American people first. If they do that, I think Minnesotans will be pleased, and a lot of these projects will be back on the board,"" he said.

All of the states seeing funding rescinded, including Minnesota, were states won by Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, called it ""outrageous.""

Now, some technicians joke that every certificate is another step down the wage ladder, and EV training may be the steepest drop yet.

In a viral Facebook Reel that has been viewed more than 300,000 times, creator and lube tech The POV Mechanic (@thepovmechanic) doesn’t seem optimistic that his career trajectory will improve after becoming certified to work on electric vehicles. “I'll be replacing batteries and electric drive motors in about a month, pray for me,” he notes in the caption to the clip.

Payments Out Of Step

The irony is hard to miss. In many trades, expanding your credentials is supposed to open doors to better pay and more advanced work. However, the frustration evident in comment threads under that Reel suggests that many EV-certified mechanics feel the opposite has happened. One technician laments, “The more you learn the less you earn.” Another adds, “Learning how to use a lab scope was a bad idea.” Several blame warranty jobs and diagnostic-heavy work areas as being more common with EV service, which they say drives down their effective earnings.

To understand why these complaints resonate so widely, one must first examine the way many auto technicians are paid: the flat-rate or flat-hour model. Instead of being compensated for the time spent, technicians are paid according to pre-set time allowances for specific jobs (the “book time”), regardless of how long the work actually takes. When performing warranty work, this time the manufacturer often dictates allowances and tends to be more restrictive than comparable customer-pay estimates. Under those constraints, a complex EV task such as a battery replacement, module diagnostics or software calibration may last far longer than the allotted time, but the technician is paid no more.

The problem reflects a lag in compensation models keeping pace with evolving vehicle architectures. As vehicles become more software-intensive and electrified, the nature of repair shifts: fewer oil changes and brake jobs, more battery, electric drive, wiring and software work. Yet many dealerships and shops still rely on flat-rate systems built for mechanical, repeatable labor, which penalize time-intensive, variable or diagnostic tasks.

But some mechanics do report success. One commenter, Jake Casto, said EVs are “clean, easy, and … pay more.” Others mention employers who place higher value on EV skills and reward accordingly. There are service centers at EV brands and specialized independent shops that offer competitive wages to attract certified techs, capitalizing on the shortage of qualified EV repair professionals.

EV Techs Are Badly Needed

Meanwhile, the industry is keenly aware that demand for qualified technicians is rising.

According to the TechForce Foundation’s recent Supply & Demand reports, the U.S. will need roughly 795,000 new transportation technicians over the next five years. Their 2024 report suggests that growth in technician employment is outpacing the general U.S. labor force, yet the gulf between demand and supply remains crucial. In fact, in late 2024 TechForce adjusted its estimate further upward: It now expects nearly 971,000 total technician roles across automotive, diesel, collision and aviation to need filling through 2028. The automotive sector alone remains under pressure even as more graduates enter the workforce.

If EVs require less routine mechanical maintenance (for example, no oil changes, fewer fluid flushes, fewer moving parts), their part of the repair cake shrinks. That limits volume opportunities for work. Indeed, one of TechForce’s own methodology footnotes says that battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have lower scheduled maintenance costs per mile compared to gas-powered vehicles. In other words, fewer routine maintenance tasks mean fewer guaranteed hours across the board.

So, while the need for specialists rises, the nature of the work means that many tasks are one-off, diagnostic or warranty-related—categories that are poorly compensated under traditional flat-rate systems. That creates a financial squeeze for the very mechanics being trained to support the shift. As one industry article puts it: “Flat-rate technicians have been forced to cut corners” to focus on completing as many jobs as possible, which can reduce collaboration and overall customer experience.

Pressure for regulatory and legislative change is already bubbling. In New York State, a new law aims to close the two-tier compensation gap by requiring that warranty and recall labor be compensated at the same labor time allowances as those used for non-warranty work. If that reform spreads, it could realign incentives for technicians working under warranty schedules in EV-centric shops.

The crux of the issue is this: EV training is neither inherently bad nor a bad idea. The issue is the mismatch between evolving technical complexity and antiquated pay models. Techs are becoming better educated, more specialized and more capable, and yet the system still rewards them based on a clockwork grid that assumes repetitive mechanical labor.

In the end, the mechanic who quips, “I get my EV certification just to lose money,” may not be joking until compensation evolves.

The post Former Tesla exec sees continued growth for EVs; Ford's CEO warns of a collapse appeared first on Invezz","A high-stakes and deeply divided debate has erupted at the highest levels of the auto industry, as two of its most influential figures offer starkly opposing visions for the future of the electric vehicle market in a world without subsidies.

The fierce war of words, sparked by the recent death of the $7,500 federal tax credit, pits the bullish optimism of a former Tesla executive against the dire warnings of Ford’s CEO, a clash of perspectives that will have profound implications for the future of American transportation.

The bull case: ‘the market’s established’

On one side of the divide is Jon McNeill, a former Tesla president of global sales and a current GM board member.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he projected a calm confidence, arguing that the US electric vehicle market is now mature enough to stand on its own two feet.

He pointed to Europe as a powerful case study, noting that when countries like Germany rolled back their own subsidies a few years ago, the EV market “surprisingly … continued to grow.”

McNeill believes the US is poised for a similar outcome. “The market’s established, and we’re probably ready to have a market that can … grow without subsidies,” he said.

He bolstered his case by highlighting the explosion of consumer choice, with 65 different EV models now available in the American market. When combined with hybrids, he noted, one out of every four cars sold in the US is now electrified.

The bear case: an industry ‘cut in half’

On the other side of the argument is the powerful and influential CEO of Ford, Jim Farley.

Speaking at a summit in Detroit, he took a virtually opposite and far more pessimistic tack, predicting that the death of the $7,500 consumer incentive is a “game-changer” that will cut the EV industry in half.

While he believes EVs will remain a “vibrant industry,” he also stated it’s “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,” projecting a steep drop in EV market share from its current 10 to 12 percent down to just 5 percent.

“The customers are pesky,” Farley said, delivering a blunt and sobering dose of reality.

“Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”

The X-Factor: a car that powers your house

But there is another, powerful X-factor in this debate, a technological evolution that could fundamentally reshape the value proposition of owning an EV: the car that can power your house.

McNeill argued that the emerging trend of “bidirectional” charging, which allows an EV to push energy back into the grid or directly into a home, will be a powerful driver of future growth.

He shared a personal example, stating that his Silverado EV can power his entire house for two weeks, completely eliminating the need for a separate, noisy generator.

He revealed that his local utility has already offered him a “big break on my utility bills” in exchange for access to just 20 percent of his vehicle’s battery.

On this point, Farley actually agreed, seeing a bright future for “partial electrification.” “We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with,” he said.

While the two titans may disagree on the immediate future, they both see a world where the line between a vehicle and a home power plant is beginning to blur, a technological shift that could prove to be the most powerful incentive of all.

Founded by Henry Ford on June 16, 1903, the company revolutionized manufacturing with the moving assembly line and has since diversified its offerings under the Ford and Lincoln brands. Today, Ford stands as the sixth-largest automaker globally by vehicle production in 2022 and the second-largest American-based automaker, behind General Motors.

Ford is currently undergoing a significant strategic transformation, encapsulated in its ""Ford+"" plan. This initiative reorganizes its operations into three distinct units: Ford Blue (internal combustion engine vehicles), Ford Model e (electric vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial vehicles and services). This restructuring aims to accelerate innovation, enhance customer experience, and optimize profitability across its diverse product lines.

For investors, Ford presents a complex but compelling narrative. The company's stock often trades at a lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to pure-play EV competitors, appealing to value investors, and offers an enticing dividend yield exceeding 6%. The robust and consistently profitable Ford Pro commercial segment is a major draw, providing a stable and expanding revenue stream. However, the substantial and ongoing losses in the Ford Model e division (projected up to $5.5 billion in 2025), coupled with a relatively high debt-to-equity ratio and a low net margin, present notable concerns. Analysts currently hold a mixed sentiment, with a consensus rating of ""Reduce"" or ""Hold,"" suggesting potential downside from current stock prices. This article will delve into Ford's multifaceted operations, financial health, strategic direction, and market position to provide a comprehensive analysis for investors.

2. Historical Background

The story of Ford Motor Company is synonymous with the dawn of the automotive age and the advent of modern manufacturing. Henry Ford, a visionary born in 1863, harbored an early passion for mechanics, culminating in the completion of his first experimental car, the ""Quadricycle,"" in 1896. After initial unsuccessful ventures, Ford, alongside coal dealer Alexander Y. Malcomson and other investors, officially incorporated the Ford Motor Company on June 16, 1903, in a converted factory in Detroit, Michigan.

The company's early years saw a range of models, but it was the Model T, introduced in October 1908, that truly revolutionized transportation. Designed to be simple, sturdy, and, crucially, affordable, the Model T became known as ""the car for the masses."" To meet overwhelming demand, Henry Ford pioneered the moving assembly line on December 1, 1913, at the Highland Park factory. This innovation drastically cut production time from over 12 hours to just one hour and 33 minutes, a method that became globally known as ""Fordism."" By 1914, Ford was producing more cars than all other automakers combined, and the price of a Model T plummeted from $850 to less than $300 by 1925, making car ownership accessible to millions. In 1914, Ford also introduced the revolutionary $5-a-day wage for an eight-hour workday, doubling existing rates and boosting the purchasing power of its workers.

Ford's global expansion began early with Ford of Canada in 1904 and its first overseas branch in Paris by 1908. The company further expanded its portfolio by acquiring the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, entering the luxury market. After selling over 15 million units, Model T production ceased in 1927, making way for the Model A. In 1938, the Mercury brand was established to fill the gap between Ford and Lincoln.

A pivotal transformation occurred in 1956 when Ford Motor Company went public, listing its common stock on the NYSE on March 7, 1956. This was the largest IPO in American history at the time, driven by the need to diversify the Ford Foundation's portfolio. Despite public ownership, the Ford family retained significant control through special Class B shares, holding 40% of the voting rights, a structure that persists today.

Under Henry Ford II, the company modernized and introduced iconic models like the Thunderbird (1954) and the Mustang (1964). Ford diversified through acquisitions like Jaguar (1989), Land Rover (2000), and Volvo (1999). However, the 2008-2010 automotive crisis led to a major restructuring under CEO Alan Mulally's ""One Ford Plan."" This involved divesting luxury brands and refocusing on core Ford and Lincoln brands, emphasizing product development and efficiency.

More recently, Ford has made a significant strategic shift towards electrification and sustainable mobility. In 2018, the company announced it would largely cease passenger car production in North America, except for the Mustang, to focus on trucks, SUVs, and crossovers. Today, with substantial investments in EVs like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, Ford is committed to adapting to evolving consumer preferences and global market demands, including enhancing its digital sales platforms and integrating mobility services.

3. Business Model

As of October 4, 2025, Ford Motor Company operates with a dynamic business model, strategically segmented into three distinct, yet interconnected, operational units: Ford Blue, Model e, and Ford Pro. This structure, central to Ford's ""Ford+"" plan, aims to foster innovation, enhance customer engagement, and optimize profitability across its diverse product lines and services.

Revenue Sources

Ford's primary revenue streams are derived from:

Automotive Manufacturing and Sales: This encompasses the sale of a comprehensive range of vehicles, including traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, trucks, SUVs, commercial vehicles, and an expanding portfolio of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids. The truck and commercial segments, particularly Ford Pro, are significant drivers of revenue growth.

Financial Services: Through Ford Motor Credit Company, Ford provides financing, leasing, and insurance solutions to a vast customer base, representing a growing and strategically important revenue stream. In Q1 2025, Ford Credit contributed $1.7 billion in earnings before taxes.

Software and Connected Services: Particularly within Ford Pro, the company is generating increasing revenue from paid software subscriptions and integrated digital services. Ford Pro Intelligence paid software subscriptions grew by approximately 30% year-over-year in Q3 2025, reaching about 815,000 active subscriptions.

Primary Product Lines

Ford's business is organized around three customer-centric segments:

Ford Blue: This division focuses on strengthening Ford's iconic ICE and hybrid vehicle portfolio. It aims to drive growth and profitability from established models such as the F-Series, Ranger, Maverick, Bronco, Explorer, and Mustang, while also delivering new, connected driving experiences. Ford Blue is considered the ""profit engine"" of Ford, generating significant earnings to fund future innovations. In Q1 2025, Ford Blue generated $21 billion in revenue.

Model e: Dedicated to inventing and scaling breakthrough electric vehicles and developing embedded software that defines always-on digital experiences for all customers. Model e leads innovation in EV platforms, batteries, e-motors, inverters, charging solutions, and recycling capabilities. This division is also responsible for creating a new, simplified shopping, buying, and ownership experience for EV customers.

As of October 4, 2025, Ford Motor Company and the broader automotive industry are navigating a period of profound transformation, shaped by evolving market trends, significant macroeconomic pressures, persistent supply chain challenges, and inherent cyclical effects.

Automotive Industry and Market Trends

The global push towards electric vehicles (EVs) remains a central theme, though its trajectory and profitability are undergoing recalibration. Ford's electrified vehicle sales (hybrids, plug-ins, all-electrics) reached 85,789 units in Q3 2025, a 19.8% year-over-year increase, representing 15.7% of its total sales. The Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning continue to perform well. However, the EV market is experiencing a ""recalibration,"" with a slowdown in investment and consumer demand in key regions. Ford CEO Jim Farley suggests U.S. EV sales could fall to 5% of the market if tax credits expire and emissions rules relax. In response, Ford is adjusting its EV strategy to focus on lower-cost vehicles and a new universal EV platform, while prioritizing commercial vehicles, pickup trucks, and SUVs, and realigning battery sourcing to reduce costs.

Beyond electrification, Ford is heavily invested in autonomous driving technology, focusing on Level 3 systems through Latitude AI. Connected car technologies and digital services, such as Ford Pro Intelligence (815,000 active subscribers, up 30% year-over-year) and BlueCruise hands-free driving (exceeding 7 million cumulative hours), are significant growth areas.

Ford's traditional strengths in trucks and SUVs continue to drive sales. The F-Series remains America's best-selling truck, with strong sales in Q3 2025. Models like the Expedition and Bronco also posted robust sales. Ford's overall U.S. sales increased by 8.2% year-over-year in Q3 2025, marking seven consecutive months of gains.

Macro Drivers

Several macroeconomic factors are impacting Ford:

Interest Rates and Inflation: Rising interest rates increase borrowing costs for Ford and impact consumer financing, potentially dampening vehicle demand. High inflation also increases Ford's production costs and reduces consumer purchasing power.

Tariffs and Trade Policy: The U.S. government's 25% tariff on foreign-made vehicles and components is a critical issue for Ford in 2025, potentially increasing production costs by an estimated $3,000 per new car. Ford anticipates a full-year net hit of about $1.5 billion in adjusted operating earnings due to tariffs. The company is mitigating this by reshoring production and diversifying suppliers.

Economic Growth and Consumer Spending: Global vehicle sales growth is forecasted to be weak (2.7% in 2025) due to economic pressures. Economic downturns and high unemployment negatively impact Ford's sales. However, Ford's inventory data suggests robust underlying demand.

Regulatory Changes: Evolving emissions policies and environmental regulations continue to push the industry towards electrification, requiring significant investment from Ford.

Supply Chain Issues

Supply chain disruptions remain a critical challenge:

Semiconductor Shortages: A potential shortage in mature nodes is anticipated in late 2025 or 2026, as investment shifts to advanced nodes. The overall shortage is expected to persist for three to five years.

Raw Material Availability and Costs: Volatility in raw material prices and availability, particularly for rare earth magnets, has impacted Ford's production, leading to plant shutdowns (e.g., Chicago Assembly plant for 2025 Ford Explorer). Rising energy costs also increase manufacturing expenses.

Logistics and Diversification: Geopolitical tensions and natural disasters exacerbate problems. Ford is diversifying its supplier network to reduce reliance on single regions.

Labor Shortages: A persistent shortage of skilled labor in the automotive supply chain hinders production.

Cyclical Effects

The automotive industry is inherently cyclical:

Industry Position: As of Q3 2025, Ford is performing strongly with seven consecutive months of U.S. sales gains.

Economic Sensitivity: Ford's financial health is sensitive to economic downturns. Analysts note a significant decline in profitability of Ford's conventional car segment in 2025 due to inventory stocking.

EV Market Influence: The expected slowdown in EV adoption and expiration of federal tax credits could negatively influence the market in the short term.

Inventory Levels: New car inventory is gradually normalizing, which can stabilize prices, though supply chain pressures might still delay certain models.

Overall, Ford is demonstrating resilience through growing sales in its traditional and electrified segments. However, it faces significant headwinds from macroeconomic pressures, tariffs, persistent supply chain vulnerabilities, and the uncertain trajectory of the EV market. Strategic adjustments in its EV portfolio and supply chain management are crucial for navigating these complex trends.

10. Risks and Challenges

Ford Motor Company, as of October 4, 2025, is confronting a multifaceted array of operational, regulatory, and market risks, compounded by ongoing controversies. The company's ambitious pivot towards electric vehicles (EVs) is a central theme, presenting both opportunities and significant financial and operational hurdles.

Operational Risks

Supply Chain Issues:

Ford continues to grapple with supply chain disruptions. Outdated IT systems among some suppliers contribute to miscommunications and increased costs. The highly globalized supply chain for vehicles like the F-150 makes it vulnerable to external shocks, with only a third of its components manufactured in the U.S. or Canada. A critical shortage of rare earth magnets, for instance, led to a seven-day shutdown of the Chicago Assembly plant in June 2025, impacting 2025 Ford Explorer production. Ford is actively working to streamline supply chains and leverage economies of scale.

Recalls and Quality Control:

Ford is experiencing a significant ""quality crisis,"" with a record number of recalls in 2025. By mid-September 2025, Ford had issued 88 safety recalls, surpassing its total for all of 2024, and reaching 116 recalls by October 2025, making it the highest number of recalls in a single year by a major automaker. These recalls cover a wide range of issues, from electronic and mechanical defects to software-related problems. For example, a recall of 355,656 F-Series trucks was due to a ""memory protection fault"" in the instrument cluster software. These quality issues are costly, estimated at upwards of $4.8 billion annually, or approximately $6.5 billion CAD. Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, has acknowledged that fixing quality is a top priority but will take several years. The company has implemented measures such as delaying model launches for extra quality checks, hiring specialists, and benchmarking Toyota's processes.

Regulatory Risks

Tariffs and Trade Policies:

The potential introduction of 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada poses a significant threat to Ford's supply chain and profitability, as these regions are crucial for North American production. These tariffs could add approximately $400 to the production cost of each F-150. Ford anticipates a net negative impact of about $1.5 billion on its adjusted EBIT in 2025 due to tariffs, even after mitigation efforts. Persisting tariff impacts would necessitate ""major strategy shifts."" Broader U.S. tariffs on imports and China's export restrictions on critical minerals further complicate sourcing and increase costs.

Emissions and Safety Regulations:

Government regulations related to environmental improvements and public safety are a constant threat. Ford must continuously comply with new regulations, which often require significant investment in new technologies. Shifting emissions policies also create long-term planning challenges.

Labor Relations:

Strong labor unions represent a potential risk for Ford, as labor negotiations and strikes can significantly disrupt operations and increase costs.

Controversies

Shareholder Investigation:

An ongoing shareholder investigation poses potential legal and financial risks for Ford, demanding transparent management.

Legal Issues from Recalls:

The current surge in recalls could lead to further civil lawsuits and fines, as Ford has previously been penalized for not recalling vehicles swiftly enough.

Market Risks

EV Profitability Challenges:

Ford's ""Model e"" electric vehicle division is a major drag on the company's overall financial performance, with significant and anticipated ongoing losses (projected $5-5.5 billion in 2025). These losses are attributed to high development and manufacturing costs, aggressive pricing strategies in the EV market, and expensive battery components. Ford's ""Gen 1"" EVs are not yet profitable. While Ford is adjusting its EV strategy to focus on cost-cutting and lower-cost vehicles, achieving breakeven by 2026 is viewed as increasingly optimistic by some.

Competition:

Ford faces fierce competition from both traditional automakers (GM, Toyota) and new EV players (Tesla, Rivian, Chinese manufacturers). This intense competition contributes to pricing pressures and challenges Ford's ability to maintain its innovative position.

Economic Slowdown and Interest Rates:

Sluggish consumer sentiment and economic slowdowns pose a risk to Ford's sales and market share. Rising interest rates make car loans more expensive. While auto loan rates have seen some decline, a significant drop needed to spur the market is unlikely. Ford has offered aggressive financing deals, but critics warn that offering lower rates to subprime borrowers could lead to higher default risks.

Declining EV Demand (Post-Incentive):

Ford CEO Jim Farley predicts a significant decline in demand for fully electric vehicles in the U.S. due to the cessation of federal incentives, potentially halving the EV sector's market share. This creates uncertainty for Ford's factories and battery plants built for higher demand. In response, Ford is pivoting its strategy towards hybrid models, which are currently outperforming EVs in profitability.

Inventory Management:

Ford faced high inventory levels of 2024 model year vehicles in early 2025, leading to 100 to 130 days of inventory by mid-2025. This overcorrection in production necessitates incentives and discounts to clear older inventory.

In conclusion, Ford is at a critical juncture, balancing its EV transition with persistent quality issues, complex supply chain vulnerabilities, and a highly competitive market. The profitability of its EV segment remains a significant concern, while the high frequency and cost of recalls continue to strain its financial health and brand reputation. Regulatory changes, particularly tariffs and the winding down of EV incentives, further complicate its strategic planning and market outlook.

12. Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

As of October 4, 2025, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is experiencing a divergence in investor sentiment, with Wall Street analysts generally maintaining a cautious stance while options trading and retail investor chatter signal a more bullish outlook. Despite recent stock price increases, analysts' average price targets suggest a potential downside.

Wall Street Analyst Ratings and Price Targets

Wall Street analysts currently hold a consensus rating of ""Reduce"" or ""Hold"" on Ford (F) stock. Across approximately seventeen research firms, the breakdown typically shows:

Sell ratings: 3 analysts

Hold ratings: 11-12 analysts

Buy ratings: 2-4 analysts

The average twelve-month price objective among brokers ranges from approximately $10.57 to $11.00. This average target implies a potential downside of 10.0% to 15.94% from Ford's current trading price, which was around $12.22-$12.28 in early October.

Recent individual analyst updates reflect this mixed perspective:

Wells Fargo maintained ""Underweight"" but raised target from $8.00 to $10.00 (Oct 3, 2025).

Goldman Sachs maintained ""Neutral"" and increased target from $11.00 to $12.00 (Sep 29, 2025).

Jefferies Financial Group maintained ""Underperform"" (Sell), raising target from $8.00 to $9.00 (Aug 11, 2025).

J.P. Morgan maintained ""Overweight"" (Buy), boosting target from $12.00 to $13.00 (Jul 21, 2025).

The highest observed price target is $16.00, while the lowest is $7.00.

Hedge Fund Activities and Institutional Investor Sentiment

Institutional investors and hedge funds collectively own a significant portion of Ford's stock, approximately 58.74% to 61.62%. Recent activities indicate active interest, though with mixed signals:

In Q3 2025, several financial firms made new investments in Ford stock. Churchill Management Corp, for instance, acquired a $10.3 million stake in Q2 2025.

In Q1 2025, there was substantial hedge fund activity with 756 institutional investors adding shares and 786 decreasing their positions. Notable increases included Vanguard Group Inc., Pacer Advisors, Inc., and Blackrock, Inc.

While institutional ownership is strong, Ford's valuation metrics, such as a P/E ratio near its 2-year high and a P/S ratio suggesting potential overvaluation, lead some to a ""Hold"" position. The Altman Z-Score also places Ford in a ""distress zone,"" suggesting potential financial instability.

Retail Investor Chatter and Sentiment

Retail investor sentiment, particularly in options trading, appears notably more bullish compared to the cautious stance of many Wall Street analysts.

There has been a ""dramatic surge"" in call options volume, a direct indicator of bullish bets, with a recent jump of 154% above the daily average. This suggests a segment of the market is positioning for a significant near-term rally.

On September 26, 2025, Ford saw a significant increase in options trading, with call volume dominating over put volume, leading to a low put/call ratio and highlighting stronger demand for call options.

On platforms like Stocktwits, sentiment remained ""bullish"" with a surge in message volume following a stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 report. Many retail investors ""cheered the earnings beat,"" hoping the stock would climb past $10.

Overall, technical indicators and short-selling analysis also present a positive outlook from some retail-focused analyses, categorizing Ford as a ""Strong Buy candidate"" based on technical signals and decreasing short-sell activity.

In summary, while professional analysts exhibit caution with a ""Reduce"" or ""Hold"" consensus and average price targets suggesting a slight downside, institutional investors show significant ownership and some recent buying, and retail investors, particularly in the options market, are displaying a notably bullish sentiment for Ford Motor Company as of October 4, 2025.

13. Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Ford Motor Company is operating within a complex and rapidly shifting landscape of regulatory changes, government policies, and significant geopolitical dynamics as of October 4, 2025. These factors profoundly influence the company's electric vehicle (EV) strategy, supply chains, and international trade operations, particularly regarding tariffs and global trade policies.

Regulatory Environment and Policy Changes

Electric Vehicle (EV) Regulations and Incentives:

United States:

Federal EV Tax Credit (Section 30D): The popular $7,500 federal EV tax credit was officially set to expire on September 30, 2025. However, Ford, along with General Motors, has implemented workarounds through leasing programs. These programs allow their financing units to acquire eligible EVs before the deadline and then lease them to customers, effectively extending the tax credit's benefit through at least December 31, 2025.

New Tax Deduction: A new policy, effective October 1, 2025, introduces an annual tax deduction of up to $10,000 for auto loan interest on financed, U.S.-assembled electric vehicles.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Sourcing Requirements: The IRA continues to tighten eligibility for EV tax credits based on critical mineral and battery component sourcing. For 2025, 60% of the value of critical minerals in an EV battery must be extracted or processed in the U.S. or a free trade agreement country, or be recycled in North America, to qualify for the full credit. Crucially, starting in 2025, eligible clean vehicles cannot contain any critical minerals that were extracted, processed, or recycled by a ""foreign entity of concern"" (FEOC). This poses a significant challenge given China's dominance in midstream processing of these minerals. Currently, only select Ford F-150 Lightning trims (Flash, Lariat, and XLT) are eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, provided they meet MSRP and income thresholds. Other Ford EV models like the Mustang Mach-E and Escape PHEV are largely ineligible due to battery sourcing laws.

Market Impact: Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, has expressed concerns about the impact of these changes, predicting that U.S. EV sales could potentially fall by half after the expiration of the current federal tax credit, particularly for higher-priced models, even with EPA orders to roll back some greenhouse gas emissions targets.

European Union:

CO2 Emission Standards: From January 1, 2025, stricter CO2 emission performance standards take effect. New cars and vans registered in the EU must emit 15% less CO2 on average compared to 2021 targets, equating to 93.6 g CO2/km for cars and 153.9 g CO2/km for vans.

Compliance Flexibility: The European Commission introduced a temporary flexibility measure in April 2025, allowing manufacturers to meet CO2 targets for 2025-2027 based on a three-year average, rather than annually. This provides some leeway for compliance, with financial penalties for non-adherence.

Incentives for ZLEVs: To encourage the transition, manufacturers receive emission credits if zero- and low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs) constitute more than 25% of their total sales.

Euro 7 Emissions Standard: The new Euro 7 emissions regulation is scheduled to come into force in 2025, replacing the existing Euro 6 standards.

Tariffs and International Trade Policies

U.S. Tariffs:

Automotive Tariffs: As of May 2025, a 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts not manufactured in the U.S. remains fully enforced, in addition to a standard 2.5% base tariff for modern vehicles. This policy, enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act by President Trump, aims to bolster domestic manufacturing.

Broader Import Tariffs: A universal 10% tariff on almost all U.S. imports took effect on April 5, 2025. Following a retaliatory spiral, U.S. tariffs on many Chinese goods escalated to 145%, with China imposing duties as high as 125% on American imports by April 2025.

Steel, Aluminum, and Copper Tariffs: Tariffs on these materials were raised to 50%.

Impact on Ford: Ford anticipates a net negative impact of approximately $1.5 billion on its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2025 due to these tariffs, even after implementing strategic measures like using ""bonded transportation"" and recalibrating import strategies to offset $1 billion. The company ceased U.S. exports to China to manage these logistics. Ford, like other major U.S. automakers, has largely absorbed tariff costs on imported steel, aluminum, and auto parts to maintain production and sales volumes, impacting profitability.

North American Trade: In January 2025, President Trump announced broad tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which threaten the highly integrated North American auto supply chain. Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis have lobbied for exemptions, warning that these tariffs could harm American companies.

China's Export Restrictions: China has imposed and expanded export restrictions on critical minerals and high-tech materials crucial for EV components, including rare earth metals (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium), permanent magnets, gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite. These restrictions create supply chain bottlenecks, increase material costs, and could delay EV production globally.

Geopolitical Risks and Opportunities

US-China Rivalry and EV Supply Chains: The geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China has intensified, directly impacting the EV industry's supply chains. U.S. regulations now deny EV tax credits for vehicles containing critical minerals processed or recycled by Chinese-controlled entities starting in 2025. This forces U.S. automakers like Ford to re-evaluate their supply chains and reduce dependence on China, which dominates midstream processing of these critical materials. Ford's licensing models with Chinese battery giants like CATL will require strict legal and operational separation to comply.

Middle East Conflict: An escalating conflict involving Iran, Israel, and the United States as of June 2025 has led to significant disruptions in global energy markets. Oil prices have surged, raising concerns about increased gasoline costs and higher raw material prices for vehicle manufacturing, which could lead to higher production costs and potential supply chain bottlenecks for Ford.

Shift to Regional Manufacturing Hubs:

Mexico: Mexico presents a significant opportunity as a growing hub for automotive production, particularly for electric and hybrid models. Companies like Ford are increasing production in Mexican plants, leveraging a skilled labor force, competitive logistics, and a developing supplier ecosystem. This helps embed Mexico into global electrification efforts and can serve as a strategy to navigate tariffs.

Southeast Asia: Countries like Thailand and Malaysia are emerging as anchors for EV supply chains, attracting investment in battery and EV manufacturing, which could provide alternative sourcing for non-Chinese components.

UK Regulatory Impact on Exports: A specific policy change in the UK in April 2025, reclassifying double-cab pickups (like Ford's Ranger) from commercial vans to passenger cars, has sharply increased ownership costs. This led to a significant drop in demand for the South African-assembled Ranger exports to Europe, resulting in Ford cutting nearly 500 jobs in South Africa. This highlights how localized policy changes can have global reverberations for Ford's export markets.

Ford's Strategic Response: Ford is making strategic adjustments to adapt to these geopolitical challenges. This includes investments in next-generation EV platforms to achieve cost parity with Chinese rivals by 2027 and expanding its manufacturing footprint in China to compete in that market, which is projected to account for 80% of global EV sales by 2030. Simultaneously, Ford announced a $2 billion shift from planned all-electric SUVs to hybrid models in August 2024, reflecting a pragmatic approach to balancing consumer preferences with the economic realities of intense global EV competition. The company is also focused on boosting domestic sourcing for EVs, including battery manufacturing, to mitigate tariff impacts and build more resilient supply chains. The overall unpredictability driven by geopolitical tensions and fluctuating consumer incentives is pushing the industry, including Ford, towards more flexible production systems that can adapt rapidly to market shifts and policy changes.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

Ford Motor Company is navigating a transformative period, balancing its legacy internal combustion engine (ICE) business with a significant pivot towards electrification and software-driven services. As of October 4, 2025, the company's outlook presents a mix of strategic opportunities and persistent challenges, reflected in both optimistic (bull) and pessimistic (bear) scenarios for its future.

Short-Term Outlook (2025-2026)

Financial Projections:

For the full year 2025, Ford expects an adjusted EBIT between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion, with adjusted free cash flow projected between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion. Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $9 billion. This guidance was updated during the Q2 2025 earnings call, reflecting underlying strong first-half performance and continued cost improvement.

In Q2 2025, Ford reported a record revenue of $50 billion and an adjusted EBIT of $2.1 billion. Q3 2025 U.S. sales surged by 8.2% year-over-year, reaching 545,522 vehicles, marking seven consecutive months of sales growth. The company also reported Q3 2025 record electrified vehicle sales (hybrids, plug-ins, and all-electrics) of 85,789 units, a 19.8% increase year-over-year, accounting for 15.7% of total sales.

Market Share:

Ford maintained strong market positions in key segments. The F-Series remains a primary profit engine, contributing 58% of earnings from 43% of revenue. Expedition sales saw a significant boost of 47.4% in Q3 2025, raising its segment share to 23% between April and August. Ford Pro Intelligence software subscriptions grew approximately 30% year-over-year, reaching 815,000 active subscribers, demonstrating strength in its commercial vehicle segment. Ford holds nearly 13% market share in the U.S., about 10% in the UK, and under 2% in China.

EV Profitability:

Ford's Model e (EV) division continues to face profitability challenges. The segment reported an EBIT loss of $1.2 billion in Q3 2025, narrowing slightly from a $1.3 billion loss in Q2 2025. For the full year 2025, Ford expects Model e to incur losses between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, consistent with previous guidance. The company projects achieving EV profitability by 2026, targeting an 8% profit margin on EVs, driven by increasing sales, reduced battery costs, and improved research and design. However, some analysts view this timeline as increasingly optimistic given current market conditions. EV products currently yield 17% lower margins than traditional vehicles.

Long-Term Projections (2027-2030 and beyond)

Financial Projections:

Ford aims for a revenue mix by 2026-2030 of 40% full EV, 30% hybrid, and 30% efficient ICE vehicles, all built on a unified digital backbone. Subscription-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), fleet analytics, and energy management services are projected to generate over $20 billion in annual high-margin revenue by this period. Some analysts forecast a 56% upside potential for Ford's stock by 2030. Annual revenue could reach between $180 billion and $220 billion by 2030, representing 3-5% annual growth.

Market Share:

Ford is targeting 12-15% of the global EV market by 2030. Its dominant 43% commercial vehicle market share in North America is expected to be maintained.

EV Profitability:

The long-term profitability of the Model e division hinges on scaling production, reducing battery costs, and leveraging new platforms. Ford expects its next-generation EVs to be profitable, affordable, and high-volume. The company is prioritizing small and medium-sized trucks and utility vehicles in its EV strategy, which require ""much lower-cost batteries."" However, larger retail electric utility vehicles are seen as having ""unresolvable economics"" due to high battery costs and customer resistance to paying a premium.

Bull Case Scenarios

The bull case for Ford is predicated on several key factors:

Strong Performance in Legacy and Hybrid Segments: Robust demand for profitable ICE vehicles, especially trucks (F-Series) and SUVs (Expedition, Bronco), provides a crucial cash flow buffer to fund EV transition. Ford's hybrid vehicle sales are growing rapidly (record 55,177 units in Q3 2025), offering a profitable hedge against volatile battery electric vehicle (BEV) demand and outperforming EVs in profitability.

Successful EV Re-platforming and Affordability: The new Universal EV Platform, a $5 billion investment, aims to significantly reduce parts by 20% and assembly time by 15%, leading to more cost-competitive EVs. The planned launch of a $30,000 midsize electric pickup in 2027 is a critical step towards high-volume, affordable EVs, potentially expanding market reach.

Ford Pro Growth and Software Services: The Ford Pro commercial division continues to show strong earnings and growth in high-margin software subscriptions, transforming commercial vehicles into a platform for predictable service revenue. This segment provides a consistent revenue stream and strengthens the overall financial health of the company.

Narrowing EV Losses and Path to Profitability: Despite current losses, the Model e segment has shown some signs of narrowing losses (Q1 2025). Achieving the targeted EV profitability by 2026 would significantly de-risk the transition and boost investor confidence.

Strategic Partnerships and Supply Chain: Partnerships for LFP batteries with SK On and CATL aim to secure domestic supply chains and reduce costs, positioning Ford to compete in the affordable EV market.

Bear Case Scenarios

Conversely, the bear case highlights significant risks and challenges:

Persistent EV Losses and Delayed Profitability: The Model e division is still incurring substantial losses (projected $5-5.5 billion for 2025), and the timeline for EV profitability by 2026 is increasingly viewed as optimistic by some analysts. Continued heavy investment in EVs without commensurate returns could strain overall finances.

Volatile EV Demand and Policy Shifts: CEO Jim Farley has indicated that U.S. EV demand could decline sharply, potentially halving from 10% to 5% of the domestic market, due to the expiration of federal EV tax credits and other policy changes. This could lead to inventory issues and further pricing pressure.

Cost Pressures and Tariffs: Ford faces persistent cost pressures from tariffs, with an $800 million impact in Q2 2025 and an expected $3 billion hit by year-end. Global supply chain shifts and regulatory risks further exacerbate these cost headwinds.

Declining Profitability in Conventional Segment: While Ford Blue has been a cash cow, the conventional car segment experienced a significant decline in profitability in the first half of 2025, attributed to inventory stocking. This could reduce the financial buffer available for EV investments.

Financial Health Indicators: A high debt-to-equity ratio (3.56) and an Altman Z-Score of 1.01 (indicating a ""distress zone"") signal potential financial instability, raising concerns about leverage. Some analysts also project very low revenue growth (0.25% CAGR between 2024-2027) and consistently low operating margins (1.9% average over five years).

Quality and Recall Issues: Recent recalls affecting over 115,000 trucks (steering column defect) and 2020-2021 Expedition/Navigator SUVs (electrical short) could impact brand reputation and incur significant warranty costs.

Strategic Pivots as of 10/4/2025

Ford is actively implementing several strategic pivots to navigate the evolving automotive landscape:

Rebalancing Electrification Strategy: Ford is broadening its electrification strategy to include a wider range of hybrid options, acknowledging cooling demand for pure EVs in some segments. CEO Jim Farley stated that ""partial electrification, such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept."" This includes a substantial investment in hybrid advancements and new assembly techniques, targeting cost reductions of 20%.

Affordable EV Focus: The company is aggressively pursuing an affordable, high-volume EV strategy. A $2 billion investment in Kentucky's Louisville Assembly Plant is dedicated to producing a 2027 midsize electric pickup truck with a targeted MSRP of around $30,000, built on a new ""Universal EV Platform"" designed for efficiency and scalability. This platform aims to reduce parts by 20% and assembly time by 15%.

Commercial Vehicle Dominance (Ford Pro): Ford is strengthening its Ford Pro commercial segment, focusing on recurring revenue streams through software and services. Subscriptions for Ford Pro Intelligence grew by 30% year-over-year. The company will prioritize the introduction of a new digitally advanced commercial van in 2026.

Cost Reduction and Manufacturing Efficiency: Ford is committed to closing competitive cost gaps through operational efficiencies and inventory management, targeting $1 billion in annual cost savings. This includes streamlining product offerings and optimizing production processes. The company is also realigning battery sourcing to be more efficient and contribute to lower overall costs in its EV portfolio.

Global Market Expansion and Local Adaptation: Ford is establishing a new subsidiary in China to manage marketing, sales, and service, aiming to strengthen its presence in this critical market. In Europe, while facing challenges with EV uptake, Ford is also developing ""multi-energy"" models, including new ICE-powered SUVs and hybrid options, to cater to diverse customer preferences.

Software and Services Integration: The ""Ford+"" plan emphasizes an interconnected hardware, software, and services ecosystem. This includes continued development of features like BlueCruise hands-free driving, which has surpassed 7 million hours of use, and expanding mobile service capabilities. The goal is to generate high-margin recurring revenue from these digital offerings.

These strategic pivots collectively aim to balance current profitability from traditional and hybrid vehicles with future growth in cost-effective, high-volume EVs and value-added software services.

15. Conclusion

Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) presents a complex but evolving picture for investors as of October 4, 2025. While the company demonstrates resilience in its traditional and electrified vehicle sales, significant challenges remain, particularly in achieving profitability within its electric vehicle (EV) segment. Investors are advised to balance the company's established strengths with ongoing risks and monitor key developments in the near and long term.

Summary of Key Findings (as of 10/4/2025):

Ford reported strong U.S. vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2025, with an overall increase of 8.2% year-over-year. Electrified vehicle sales, encompassing hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs), saw a significant rise of 19.8%, accounting for 15.7% of total sales and outpacing some competitors. Truck and SUV sales also grew, with the popular F-Series up 7% and Mustang Mach-E sales increasing by over 50%.

Financially, the first half of 2025 reportedly saw a significant decline in net income, dropping to $435 million from $3.16 billion in 2024. The company's Q3 2025 financial results are scheduled to be released on October 23, 2025.

Ford's Model e (EV) division continues to incur substantial losses, losing over $5 billion in 2024 and on track for slightly less, but still significant, losses in 2025. While these losses are narrowing, profitability is still considered years away. The company is strategically shifting towards a new, lower-cost universal EV platform to enhance affordability and improve future profitability. Conventional vehicle profitability has also declined, largely attributed to inventory builds, which Ford views as transitory.

Debt levels remain manageable, with interest costs under 1% of revenue, although the debt-to-equity ratio of 3.56 indicates a high level of leverage. Ford offers an attractive dividend yield, with current earnings covering the payout, but future investment needs for the EV segment could pressure its sustainability.

Analyst sentiment is mixed, with a consensus ""Reduce"" rating from seventeen research firms (3 sell, 12 hold, 2 buy) and an average twelve-month price target below the current stock price. Some analysts suggest the stock might be overvalued given its P/E ratio, while others see it as attractively valued. Recent recalls of over 115,000 trucks due to steering column defects and an expansion of a recall for certain Expedition and Navigator SUVs due to fire risks highlight ongoing quality control challenges.

Balanced Perspective for Investors:

Strengths:

Strong Core Business: Ford maintains a dominant position in the profitable truck and SUV segments in the U.S., with robust sales of models like the F-Series, Expedition, Bronco, and Explorer.

Growing Electrified Sales: The company is successfully growing its electrified vehicle sales, outperforming some rivals and demonstrating increasing consumer demand for its hybrid and BEV offerings.

Ford Pro Momentum: The commercial vehicle division, Ford Pro, is performing strongly, with increasing software subscriptions, offering a source of recurring revenue and a comprehensive ecosystem for commercial customers.

Strategic Adaptability: Ford is demonstrating a proactive approach to the EV transition by developing a new, lower-cost universal EV platform and expanding digital services.

Resilient Capital Structure: Debt, excluding Ford Credit, is manageable, and the company has a track record of strong cash flow from its core operations.

Challenges:

EV Segment Losses: The most significant challenge is the substantial and ongoing losses in the Model e division, which continue to drag down overall profitability, with a clear path to profitability still uncertain and potentially years away.

Profitability Pressure: Ford's operating and net margins are relatively low, indicating difficulties in consistently converting revenue into profit.

High Leverage: The company's high debt-to-equity ratio signals a reliance on debt financing, which could pose risks in a rising interest rate environment or economic downturn.

Tariff Headwinds: Tariffs, including a projected $2 billion hit in 2025, create cost pressures and market uncertainty.

Market Slowdown Concerns: Forecasts for a slowing U.S. auto market from Q4 2025 into 2026 could impact sales volumes and pricing power.

Product Recalls: Persistent vehicle recalls impact brand reputation, incur costs, and reflect potential quality control issues.

Global Market Struggles: Ford faces declining sales in key international markets such as China and ongoing difficulties in the European market.

Opportunities:

EV Market Penetration: The shift to a lower-cost EV platform could unlock greater market share and accelerate the path to profitability for the Model e division, especially as EV demand grows.

Ford Pro Growth: Further expansion of Ford Pro's integrated solutions and software services offers a significant avenue for high-margin, recurring revenue growth.

New Product Launches: Upcoming vehicle launches, such as the Explorer Tremor and F-150 Lobo street truck, have the potential to boost sales and market excitement.

Hybrid Vehicle Demand: Continued strong performance and growth in hybrid sales can act as a bridge to full EV adoption and diversify powertrain offerings.

International Market Revitalization: Strategic moves like establishing a new subsidiary in China could help re-establish and grow Ford's presence in crucial global markets.

Risks:

Uncertain EV Profitability: The primary risk remains the long and uncertain road to profitability for the EV segment, which could continue to drain resources and depress overall financial performance.

Economic Downturn: As a cyclical industry, a significant economic downturn or prolonged high interest rates could severely impact vehicle sales and profitability.

Intense Competition: Ford faces fierce competition from both established automakers and new entrants in both the traditional and EV markets, which could pressure pricing and market share.

Regulatory & Policy Shifts: Changes in government incentives for EVs, emissions standards, or tariff policies can significantly impact manufacturing costs and consumer demand.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Ongoing vulnerabilities in global supply chains, particularly for semiconductors and battery materials, could disrupt production and increase costs.

Brand and Reputation Damage: Ongoing recalls or quality issues could erode consumer trust and harm brand perception.

What Investors Should Watch For:

Near Term (next 6-12 months):

Q3 2025 Earnings Release (October 23, 2025): The upcoming earnings report will provide crucial insights into Ford's latest financial health, the performance of its Model e division, and the profitability of its conventional business.

EV Segment Progress: Monitor the extent to which Model e losses continue to narrow and for any updates on the development and deployment of the new lower-cost EV platform.

Sales Momentum and Market Outlook: Observe if the positive Q3 sales growth, especially in electrified and truck/SUV segments, can be sustained into Q4 and early 2026, particularly given forecasts for a potentially slowing U.S. auto market.

Tariff Developments: Any clarity or changes in tariff policies, especially regarding U.S. auto production or imports from Mexico/Canada, will be critical.

Dividend Outlook: While the dividend yield is attractive, investors should watch for any signals regarding its sustainability as Ford continues to invest heavily in its future.

Long Term (1-5+ years):

EV Profitability and Scale: Ford's ultimate success hinges on its ability to transition its EV division from a significant loss-maker to a profitable and scalable business, driven by its new platform strategy and battery technology advancements.

Ford+ Plan Execution: Assess the long-term impact of the Ford+ plan, particularly the sustained growth and profitability of Ford Pro, and the overall efficiency improvements across the company.

Competitive Landscape: Ford's ability to maintain its competitive edge in key segments while effectively challenging rivals in the rapidly evolving EV market will be vital.

Financial Health Metrics: Look for improvements in profitability margins, a reduction in the debt-to-equity ratio, and stronger financial health indicators.

Global Market Performance: Evidence of a successful turnaround and sustained growth in challenging international markets like China and Europe will indicate broader global competitiveness.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with a skeletal staff and limited funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead ""the worst polluters"" to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

""Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,"" said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

""This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,"" Symons said. ""Whittling away at EPA's ability to do its job.""

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they ""significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough."" Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an ""environmental ethic"" in his first speech.

""Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.""

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it has also added fighting climate change to its charge.

The EPA's job is essentially setting standards for what's healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done, and then acting as Earth's police officer if it isn't.

""Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country's overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.""

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to ""restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making the U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the ""endangerment"" finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and other sources.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year, and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won't issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

""Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,"" Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. ""So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

governor Will the US mint a $1 coin with Trump’s face for the nation’s 250th birthday?","A group of Massachusetts lawmakers are demanding that the U.S. Energy Department explain why it killed around $466 million in grants bound for the Bay State.

In a Friday letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright shared exclusively with MassLive, the lawmakers, led by Democratic U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, argued that canceling the grants will “hamstring American competitiveness, drive up energy costs, and hurt domestic manufacturing.”

The Trump administration announced Thursday that it had pulled the plug on nearly $7.6 billion in funding for projects in 16 states, according to the Energy Department’s website.

All of the affected states were won by Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

Markey, joined by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and all nine Democratic members of the state’s U.S. House delegation, argued that the White House’s action will “undermine investments in American innovation for years to come— ceding ground to China and other nations that understand the merit of technological development and investment.""

In a statement, the Energy Department said many of the 223 projects affected by the decision were “rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” Wright said in the agency’s statement, adding that the “cancellations deliver on that commitment.”

“Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people,” Wright said.

In a post to X on Wednesday, Office of Management Budget Director Russell Vought telegraphed the administration’s decision, saying it would claw back “nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda ... The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA.”

An analysis by Politico, however, determined that states that congressional districts that voted for Trump also would be impacted by the White House’s decision.

A list of the projects showed that the decision would ripple across the Bay State, with such universities as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Massachusetts Amherst being affected, as well as regional energy titan National Grid.

The nonprofit Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod also made the White House’s cancellation list.

“President Trump is further weaponizing his government shutdown to cost people jobs and hurt our economy,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement.

“ ... He’s cutting nearly half a billion dollars for our businesses, universities and non-profits that are working on cutting-edge technologies to lower energy costs, create good jobs and build a more reliable grid,” Healey continued. “All of our residents will be harmed by this vindictive action. We need the Trump administration to restore this funding and reopen our government.”

Markey and his colleagues gave Wright until Oct. 10 to respond to a battery of questions that included details on the appeals process for the clawed-back federal cash and whether the agency had considered the impact on energy prices.

“The impact of any attempt to cancel these grants will not be restricted to the Commonwealth—it will affect subgrantees and company partners in North Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, and Texas, among other states,"" the lawmakers wrote.

“It also will sabotage the United States’ ability to compete on next-generation hydrogen and conductive material technologies, which China and other nations continue to lead on,” they continued.

North America: In the U.S. market, Stellantis competes intensely with General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota, and Hyundai/Kia.","Stellantis (NYSE: STLA, Euronext Paris: STLAP, Euronext Milan: STLAM) is a global automotive manufacturing corporation formed in 2021 from the merger of the French PSA Group and the Italian-American Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Headquartered in the Netherlands, this powerful alliance created the world's fourth-largest automaker by volume, boasting a vast portfolio of 14 iconic automotive brands, including Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall. The name ""Stellantis,"" derived from the Latin ""stello"" meaning ""to brighten with stars,"" symbolizes a new beginning and a unified vision for sustainable mobility.

As of October 4, 2025, Stellantis remains a significant focal point in the automotive industry due to its pragmatic and evolving electrification strategy, recent financial performance, and a renewed leadership focus on key markets. The company initially launched its ""Dare Forward 2030"" strategic plan with ambitious targets for battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales. However, it has since adjusted this aggressive roadmap, shifting to a ""multi-energy"" strategy that incorporates plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and mild hybrids (MHVs) alongside BEVs, and even reintroducing popular gas-powered models to meet diverse market demands and optimize capital efficiency.

This strategic pivot comes after a challenging 2024 and early 2025, which saw a significant decline in net revenues and profits, attributed to reduced shipment volumes, inventory reduction initiatives, and product transition gaps. However, a recent and robust 6% year-over-year increase in U.S. sales during the third quarter of 2025 has injected much-needed optimism. This turnaround ended a challenging two-year period of eight consecutive quarters of declining sales for its American subsidiary, with Jeep sales climbing by 11% and Ram retail sales by 26%, leading to an 8% surge in Stellantis's stock price on October 2, 2025.

Under the new leadership of CEO Antonio Filosa, who assumed the role in June 2025, Stellantis is prioritizing strengthening its position in the U.S. retail market, fostering collaboration with dealers, increasing advertising, and introducing competitive, affordable products. With a plan to launch 10 new models in 2025, including more affordable trims for the Ram 1500, the range-extended Ram 1500 Ramcharger, and gas-powered Dodge Charger models, Stellantis is aggressively refreshing its product pipeline. The company is also integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance products and services, expanding battery manufacturing, and exploring hydrogen fuel-cell technology.

Stellantis is at a critical juncture, actively recalibrating its strategy to navigate a dynamic automotive landscape marked by evolving consumer preferences, intense competition, and regulatory pressures. Its relevance stems from its massive brand portfolio, its strategic shift towards a multi-energy approach in vehicle development, and its ongoing efforts to innovate while navigating a complex and competitive global market.

2. Historical Background

Stellantis N.V. officially commenced operations on January 16, 2021, born from the 50:50 merger of two automotive titans: the Italian-American Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the French PSA Group. This union created the world's fourth-largest automaker by volume, a testament to the rich and often tumultuous histories of its constituent parts. The name ""Stellantis,"" derived from the Latin ""stello"" (to brighten with stars), was chosen to symbolize a new, ambitious future for the combined entity.

Predecessor Histories and Key Transformations

The journey to Stellantis is a narrative woven from over a century of automotive innovation, strategic acquisitions, and periods of significant challenge and transformation.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA):

FCA itself was a relatively recent creation, established on October 12, 2014, through the merger of Italy's Fiat S.p.A. and the U.S.-based Chrysler Group LLC.

Fiat S.p.A. Origins: Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino (FIAT) was founded in Turin, Italy, in 1899 by a group of investors, including Giovanni Agnelli. Fiat quickly grew to become Italy's largest car manufacturer, known for its reliable and affordable models such as the Fiat 501. Post-World War II, Fiat's iconic 500 Topolino (1936) and the later Fiat 500 (1950s) revolutionized urban mobility. Over decades, Fiat expanded its empire by acquiring prestigious brands like Lancia and Alfa Romeo. A significant strategic move in 2016 saw Ferrari spun off from FCA, allowing both entities to focus on their distinct market segments.

Chrysler Group LLC Origins: Chrysler was founded on June 6, 1925, by Walter P. Chrysler, following the reorganization of the Maxwell Motor Company. It rapidly ascended to become one of the ""Big Three"" American automakers. Chrysler's history is marked by various partnerships and ownership changes, notably its nine-year alliance with German-based Daimler-Benz AG (DaimlerChrysler) from 1998 to 2007. The 2008 financial crisis pushed Chrysler into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. This period proved pivotal, as Fiat began acquiring a stake in the struggling American automaker, eventually gaining full ownership in January 2014, which directly led to the formation of FCA.

PSA Group (Peugeot S.A.):

The PSA Group, headquartered in France, boasts an even longer lineage, tracing its industrial roots back to the early 19th century.

Peugeot Origins: The Peugeot family's industrial ventures began in 1810 with steel production. The company ventured into the nascent automotive industry in 1889, and Armand Peugeot formally established Société Anonyme des Automobiles Peugeot in 1896, initiating mass production of cars by 1929.

Citroën Origins: André Citroën founded his eponymous company in Paris in 1919, quickly earning a reputation for innovative and distinctive mass-produced vehicles.

Formation of PSA Group: The PSA Group was officially formed in 1976 when Peugeot S.A. acquired a majority stake in the financially struggling Citroën S.A.

Key Transformations: PSA expanded its European footprint by acquiring Chrysler Europe in 1978, subsequently rebranding these subsidiaries as Talbot. The company was renamed PSA Peugeot Citroën in 1991, and then rebranded as Groupe PSA in 2016, signaling a broader strategic shift. A major expansion occurred in 2017 with the acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall Motors from General Motors, solidifying PSA's position as Europe's second-largest carmaker at the time. The PSA Group's successful turnaround programs, such as ""Back in the Race"" (2014) and ""Push to Pass"" (2016), which focused on brand differentiation, complexity reduction, efficiency improvements, and strategic investment in growth markets.

The Merger of FCA and PSA Group

The genesis of Stellantis began with FCA's unsuccessful attempt to merge with Renault in early 2019. Following this, FCA turned its attention to the PSA Group.

Announcement and Agreement: On October 31, 2019, FCA publicly announced its intention to merge with the PSA Group. By December 18, 2019, both companies had signed a binding agreement for a 50/50 all-stock merger, valued at approximately $50 billion. The stated goal was to create an industry leader with the necessary scale and resources to capitalize on opportunities in sustainable mobility.

Naming and Approvals: The corporate name ""Stellantis"" was announced on July 15, 2020. The merger received crucial approval from the European Commission on December 21, 2020, and was overwhelmingly endorsed by shareholders of both FCA and PSA on January 4, 2021.

Completion and Leadership: The merger was officially completed on January 16, 2021, dissolving both FCA and Groupe PSA as independent entities. John Elkann, previously Chairman of FCA, became the Chairman of Stellantis, while Carlos Tavares, the former CEO of PSA Group, was appointed CEO. Although structured as a 50/50 merger, PSA was designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Stellantis established its headquarters in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, with significant operational centers remaining in France, Italy, and the United States.

Post-Merger Vision: Stellantis was formed with a portfolio of 14 iconic brands and immediately outlined ambitious strategic plans, including a commitment to invest over €30 billion in electrification and software development through 2025. The company aimed to become a leader in electric vehicles, with aggressive targets for BEV sales in Europe and the U.S. by 2030. Other priorities included global expansion, technological innovation (autonomous driving, connected cars), and leveraging merger synergies for substantial cost savings. Early post-merger milestones involved expanding software capabilities, forging partnerships with tech companies like Foxconn, and acquiring mobility startups, all while standardizing supplier requirements and IT systems across the newly formed entity.

Notable Stock Moves and Events:

Merger Completion (January 2021): The official formation of Stellantis from FCA and PSA Group created the world's fourth-largest automaker by global vehicle sales, aiming for projected annual cost savings.

Leadership Change (2024-2025): CEO Carlos Tavares resigned in December 2024 after a 70% drop in net profit for the company in 2024, alongside declining global shipments and U.S. market share. Antonio Filosa, a long-time executive, was appointed CEO effective June 23, 2025, with expectations for a renewed emphasis on the North American market. Filosa's actionable plans were well-received, contributing to a stock increase in September 2025.

H1 2025 Financial Challenges: Stellantis reported a net loss of €2.3 billion and significantly reduced adjusted operating income of €0.5 billion for the first half of 2025. Industrial free cash flows were negative at €3.0 billion. These challenges were attributed to €3.3 billion in pre-tax charges (program cancellations, impairments, restructuring), €0.3 billion in U.S. tariff costs, higher industrial costs, geographic mix factors, and product transition difficulties. Global consolidated shipments declined by 6% year-over-year in Q2 2025, with North American shipments falling by 25%.

Q3 2025 U.S. Sales Rebound: In a positive development, Stellantis announced a 6% increase in U.S. sales for Q3 2025, breaking a two-year negative streak. This news caused an 8% jump in the stock price on October 2, 2025.

The company also committed to an electrification strategy, planning to invest €30 billion in electrification and software development through 2025, targeting 100% battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in Europe and 50% in the U.S. by 2030 as part of its ""Dare Forward 2030"" plan.

Analyst Sentiment: The consensus analyst rating for Stellantis is ""Reduce,"" based on 15 Wall Street analysts, with an average price target of $12.04.

Key Influencing Factors:

Electric Vehicle (EV) Transition: Stellantis's ambitious EV targets are a major growth driver, with significant investments in new electric and hybrid models. However, a slowdown in EV adoption, driven by affordability concerns and charging infrastructure limitations, has impacted market share and created product portfolio gaps, contributing to the company's challenges in early 2025.

Macroeconomic Conditions: The cyclical nature of the automotive industry means sales volumes are sensitive to economic downturns, inflation, and interest rate changes.

Geopolitical Tensions and Supply Chain Disruptions: Global events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and U.S.-China trade tensions, have caused critical component sourcing disruptions and increased costs, particularly for semiconductors. Raw material costs, like steel, also significantly impacted industrial expenses.

Tariffs: U.S. tariffs have directly impacted Stellantis, costing €0.3 billion in H1 2025 and affecting imported vehicle production. Discussions around potential U.S. auto tariff relief can influence stock performance.

Product Portfolio and Market Strategy: The introduction of new models like the full-hybrid Cherokee and the Dodge Daytona BEV, along with a focus on strengthening its North American market presence under the new CEO, are crucial for future performance. Stellantis also faces the challenge of managing diverse brands and market shares across different regions, with strong performance in South America and the Middle East & Africa offsetting declines in North America and Europe in some periods.

Operational Efficiency and Restructuring: The merger aimed for significant cost savings, and the company continues to implement performance improvement actions. However, restructuring costs and program cancellations have weighed on recent financial results.

Competition: Stellantis operates in a highly competitive global automotive market, competing with major players like Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors, and Ford, as well as emerging EV manufacturers.

5. Financial Performance

Stellantis (STLA) has faced a challenging financial period in late 2024 and the first half of 2025, reporting significant declines in earnings and revenue, alongside negative free cash flow. However, the company is anticipating a gradual recovery and positive growth in the latter half of 2025, driven by new product launches and strategic adjustments.

Here's a detailed look at Stellantis's financial performance as of October 4, 2025:

Latest Earnings (H1 2025 and Q1 2025)

First Half (H1) 2025 (Ended June 30, 2025):

Stellantis reported a net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of 2025, a significant decline compared to a net profit of €5.6 billion in H1 2024. This loss includes €3.3 billion in net charges, which were excluded from Adjusted Operating Income (AOI).

Net Revenues: €74.3 billion, a 13% decrease compared to H1 2024. This decline was primarily attributed to year-over-year decreases in North America and Enlarged Europe, although partially offset by growth in South America. The results also reflect impacts from foreign exchange headwinds, tariffs, and lower European Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) industry volumes.

Adjusted Operating Income (AOI): €0.5 billion, with an AOI margin of 0.7%, significantly below H1 2024 levels of €8.5 billion and 10.0%, respectively.

Industrial Free Cash Flows: Negative €3.0 billion, as the subdued AOI generation was more than offset by capital expenditures and research and development (R&D) expenses.

Liquidity: Total industrial available liquidity stood at €47.2 billion at June 30, 2025.

Second Quarter (Q2) 2025:

For Q2 2025, Stellantis reported preliminary global consolidated shipments of 1.4 million units, a 6% year-over-year decline. Net revenue for Q2 was €38.4 billion. The company faced a significant miss on EPS expectations, reporting -€0.78 against a forecast of €0.35. Adjusted Operating Income was €540 million with a 0.7% margin, and industrial free cash flow was an outflow of €3 billion.

First Quarter (Q1) 2025 (Ended March 31, 2025):

Stellantis reported net revenues of €35.8 billion, a 14% decrease compared to Q1 2024. Consolidated shipments for the quarter were 1,217 thousand units, down 9% year-over-year. This was mainly due to lower North American production (affected by extended holiday downtime in January), product transitions, and reduced LCV volumes in Enlarged Europe. New retail orders in the U.S. in March 2025 were up 82% over the prior year.

Revenue Growth

2024:

For the full year 2024, Stellantis reported net revenues of €156.9 billion, a 17% decrease compared to 2023. This was attributed to a 12% decrease in consolidated shipment volumes, temporary gaps in product offerings, and inventory reduction initiatives. Organic revenue, excluding unfavorable currency effects, rose 9%, with volume and mix contributing 5% and net pricing contributing 4% growth.

2025:

As noted above, H1 2025 net revenues were down 13% compared to H1 2024. Despite the challenging first half, Stellantis re-established financial guidance and expects continued sequential improvement in H2 2025, with anticipated positive net revenue growth for the full year 2025.

Margins

2024:

The adjusted operating income for the full year 2024 was €8.6 billion, a 64% decline from the previous year, with an AOI margin of 5.5%. The operating margin was -2.69%, and the net margin was -1.64%, reflecting profitability challenges. The gross margin stood at 7.74%.

2025:

In H1 2025, the AOI was €0.5 billion, resulting in a significantly lower AOI margin of 0.7% compared to 10.0% in H1 2024. Stellantis expects low-single-digit AOI profitability for H2 2025 and a mid-single-digit AOI margin for the full year 2025, anticipating sequential improvement.

Debt

As of June 30, 2025, Stellantis's total debt was $47.88 billion (USD), an increase of 38.46% year-over-year. Short-term debt for the quarter ending June 2025 was $14.437 billion. Long-term debt for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, was $19.460 billion, a 116.51% increase year-over-year. For the fiscal semester ending December 2024, the reported debt was €37.23 billion. The debt-to-equity ratio is 0.56, indicating a moderate level of leverage.

Cash Flow

2024:

Industrial free cash flows were negative €6 billion for the full year 2024, reflecting the decline in income and a temporary enlarged working capital impact due to production adjustments. Annual cash flow from operating activities for 2024 was $4.337 billion, an 82.18% decline from 2023. Annual free cash flow for 2024 was -$6.995 billion, a 146.52% decline from 2023.

2025:

Industrial free cash flows for H1 2025 were negative €3.0 billion. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, was $10.490 billion, a 10.48% decline year-over-year. For the twelve months ending June 30, 2025, it was $4.125 billion, an 82.45% decline year-over-year. Stellantis expects positive industrial free cash flows for H2 2025 and the full year 2025, driven by stabilized working capital and normalized production schedules.

Valuation Metrics

As of October 2025, Stellantis's valuation metrics present a mixed picture:

P/E Ratio: Currently at 0, reflecting the company's negative earnings. The estimated P/E ratio for 2025 is 11.71.

P/S Ratio: 0.16, which is close to its 5-year low, potentially suggesting undervaluation.

P/B Ratio: 0.32, also near historical lows.

Market Capitalization: Approximately $27.59 billion to $48.11 billion (figures vary slightly across sources, with one reporting $26.66 billion as of Q4 2022).

Enterprise Value: One source reported an enterprise value of -$19.28 billion as of December 31, 2022.

Analyst Targets: The target price is $10.77, with a recommendation score of 3.3, indicating a ""hold"" position. Some analyst price targets range from $8.50 to $15.00 per share.

Altman Z-Score: 1.51, placing Stellantis in the distress zone, which implies a potential risk of bankruptcy within two years.

Q3 2025 Sales Update

Stellantis plans to launch 10 new models in 2025, including three STLA Medium products in H2 2025. The company anticipates ""Positive"" net revenue growth and ""Positive"" industrial free cash flows for the full year 2025.

6. Leadership and Management

As of October 4, 2025, Stellantis (STLA) has undergone significant leadership changes, recalibrated its strategic direction, and is navigating a shifting corporate governance landscape.

Stellantis CEO and Leadership Team

CEO: The current Chief Executive Officer of Stellantis is Antonio Filosa, whose appointment became effective on June 23, 2025. Filosa succeeded Carlos Tavares, who resigned in December 2024, reportedly due to internal friction with the board and declining financial performance. Prior to becoming CEO, Filosa served as the Chief Operating Officer of Stellantis North America, a role he took on in October 2024.

Key Leadership Changes and Team Members:

Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Joao Laranjo was appointed as the new CFO and a member of the Stellantis Leadership Team, effective September 29, 2025. He replaced Doug Ostermann, who resigned for personal reasons. Laranjo has a long history with the company, having previously served as CFO of Stellantis North America under Filosa's management earlier in 2025, and held various finance roles at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) since 2009.

Brand CEOs (Effective June 1, 2024):

Ram Brand CEO: Christine Feuell was appointed CEO of the Ram brand, in addition to her role as CEO of the Chrysler brand.

Dodge Brand CEO: Matt McAlear was appointed CEO of the Dodge brand and became a member of the Top Executive Team.

European Operations (October 2024): Jean-Philippe Imparato became Chief Operating Officer for Europe, tasked with strengthening the region's commercial performance during the energy transition.

Maserati and Alfa Romeo: Santo Ficili was appointed CEO of Maserati and Alfa Romeo, also joining the top executive team in October 2024.

Board of Directors

As of October 4, 2025, the Stellantis Board of Directors is structured with a mix of executive and non-executive members.

Chairman: John Elkann

Vice Chairman: Robert Peugeot

CEO and Executive Director: Antonio Filosa

Recent Board Changes (April 15, 2025): Alice Schroeder and Daniel Ramot were appointed as non-executive directors. These appointments were significant as they brought American business and tech expertise to a previously more European-centric board, potentially signaling a strategic pivot towards the North American market, where Stellantis aims for a turnaround. They replaced Wan Ling Martello and Jacques Saint-Exupéry.

Strategy

Stellantis's overarching strategic plan remains ""Dare Forward 2030,"" initially unveiled in 2022. However, the company has significantly revised key components of this strategy, particularly concerning electrification targets.

Revised Electrification Goals: Stellantis has ""slammed the brakes"" on its original ambition to sell only battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) in Europe by the end of the decade. This shift was confirmed by Stellantis's European chief at the Munich Motor Show, citing challenges such as inadequate charging infrastructure, slower-than-forecasted EV adoption rates, and soaring raw material costs.

Multi-Energy Approach: CEO Antonio Filosa is advocating for regulators to be more flexible and support hybrid technology, viewing the European Union's wider goal of zero-emission new cars by 2035 as ""unrealistic"" under current market conditions. Several Stellantis brands, including Alfa Romeo and Fiat, have already shifted to a ""multi-energy"" approach, and Dodge even pulled an entry-level electric Charger Daytona model due to poor demand.

Focus on Core Markets and Profitability: Under Filosa's leadership, Stellantis is reviewing its portfolio and industrial footprint. This includes considering the sale of its Free2move car-sharing unit to exit unprofitable ventures and concentrate investments on core brands and markets, especially the United States, which has shown recent quarterly sales gains. A new business plan is expected to be presented to investors in the first quarter of 2026.

Technology and Innovation: Stellantis is expanding its collaboration with Mistral AI to embed generative AI across its operations, aiming to enhance customer experience in sales and aftersales and increase efficiency in engineering and other domains.

Sustainability Goal: The company still aims to achieve carbon net-zero status by 2038.

Governance Reputation

Stellantis's governance reputation has seen recent shifts, particularly with the change in CEO.

Carlos Tavares's Departure and Impact: The departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares in December 2024 was reportedly influenced by growing disagreements with the board, declining sales, and public conflict with the Italian government over job cuts. Tavares's management style was perceived by some as detrimental to the Italian automotive industry, with criticisms of factory relocation and production reduction in Italy.

Antonio Filosa's Approach: The new CEO, Antonio Filosa, has demonstrated a different leadership style, particularly in Italy. He has initiated direct, unprecedented discussions with all Italian automotive unions regarding the group's industrial future in the country. This move aims to address long-standing tensions and seeks union input on assigning hybrid models to Italian plants, relaunching engine production, and clarifying the future of brands like Maserati. This initiative is seen as a significant departure from his predecessor's approach and could mark a positive turning point in labor relations.

Board Composition and Market Focus: The addition of American directors to the board, Alice Schroeder and Daniel Ramot, in April 2025, suggests a move to diversify the board's expertise and potentially rebalance its strategic focus towards the North American market, a crucial region for the company's profitability. This change could improve governance by ensuring broader perspectives are considered in strategic decision-making.

7. Products, Services, and Innovations

As of October 4, 2025, Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a dynamic automotive landscape by recalibrating its product offerings, electrifying its portfolio with a multi-energy strategy, investing heavily in research and development, and leveraging strategic partnerships to maintain a competitive edge. The company is demonstrating a pragmatic pivot in its electrification approach, reintroducing popular internal combustion engine (ICE) and hybrid models while continuing to advance technological innovations.

Sector-Level Trends

The automotive industry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by several key trends:

Electrification (EVs, PHEVs, MHEVs): The global push towards electric vehicles (EVs) continues, though the pace of adoption has slowed in some markets, notably Europe and the U.S., compared to earlier forecasts. This slowdown is attributed to factors such as inadequate charging infrastructure, high raw material costs, and consumer affordability concerns. In response, there's a growing emphasis on ""multi-energy"" strategies, integrating plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and mild hybrids (MHEVs) alongside battery electric vehicles (BEVs). China remains a dominant force, driving innovation in vehicle architecture and leading in EV sales, while European and American automakers face increasing competition from cost-competitive Chinese EV brands.

Autonomous Driving and Connected Cars: Level 2 automated driving systems (e.g., lane centering, adaptive cruise control) are becoming mainstream across various price ranges. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into vehicle cockpits for smarter, safer, and more personalized experiences, and also plays a role in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and predictive maintenance. The concept of ""software-defined vehicles"" is reshaping consumer expectations, requiring mastery of digital tools and rapid adaptation from manufacturers.

Sustainable Materials: The quest for sustainability is intensifying, with automakers adopting lightweight, bio-based materials and even vegan alternatives to leather to reduce vehicle weight and carbon footprints. By 2025, there's an expectation that every vehicle component will need to justify its sustainability credentials.

Price Wars: A fierce price war is ongoing in the electric vehicle sector, particularly in Europe, as Western automakers contend with low-cost Chinese competitors. This pressure forces manufacturers to significantly reduce production costs without compromising quality.

Macro Drivers

Several macroeconomic factors are shaping the automotive industry's performance:

Interest Rates and Inflation: Elevated interest rates for car financing have persisted for almost three years, impacting consumer affordability. While inflation has receded globally, rising material costs continue to exert upward pressure on vehicle prices.

Tariffs and Trade Policies: Newly imposed and upcoming tariffs, particularly a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts in the U.S., are creating significant ripples. These tariffs are expected to increase production costs and consumer prices, potentially leading to a long-term decline in sales despite a short-term rush to buy before prices surge. Geopolitical tensions and protectionist measures are forcing automakers to re-evaluate and reorganize supply chains.

Economic Growth and Consumer Demand: Global vehicle sales growth is slow for 2024 and 2025, with forecasts of modest increases (around 1.6-2.7%). Weakened consumer demand, coupled with high vehicle prices and consumer debt, is expected to constrain sales.

Government Regulations and Incentives: Stricter emissions regulations, particularly the EU's 2025 CO2 reduction targets, are pushing OEMs to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission technologies. However, the effectiveness and duration of EV subsidies in various markets, coupled with uncertain policy shifts, are influencing consumer behavior and market growth. Some politicians are seen to be pushing EV mandates that may not align with current consumer demand.

Supply Chains

Automotive supply chains continue to face significant challenges:

Component Shortages: Ongoing shortages of critical components, especially semiconductor chips and specialized metals, are still impacting vehicle production and repairs. These shortages have led to production delays and increased prices for parts.

Rising Raw Material Costs: The cost of raw materials, particularly for EV batteries (lithium, nickel, cobalt), has risen significantly since the pandemic, making EVs more expensive to produce. This is forcing automakers to raise prices, affecting affordability.

Logistics Challenges: Freight delays, a global shortage of shipping containers, and rising fuel costs have driven up transportation expenses, further increasing the cost of parts.

Diversification and Regionalization: Manufacturers are diversifying suppliers, investing in domestic production, and building more resilient supply chains to mitigate future disruptions and respond to geopolitical tensions and tariffs.

Cyclical Effects

The automotive industry is inherently cyclical, and as of late 2025, it is experiencing:

Slow Growth but Stabilizing Inventory: After a turbulent period, new vehicle production and inventories have improved substantially, helping to stabilize the market and ease some price pressures. However, overall global sales growth remains sluggish, with projections for 2025 indicating only modest increases.

Consumer Behavior: With expected higher costs for new vehicles due to tariffs and inflation, consumers are likely to hold onto their existing vehicles longer, keeping the inventory of used cars low and potentially driving up used car prices. Increased incentives from sellers are expected as inventories swell and supply chains stabilize.

Regional Disparities: Global car markets show mixed trends; for example, North America has seen modest growth, while Europe experienced a decline in registrations in the first half of 2025. China, however, continues to show strong growth in sales and production.

Impact on Stellantis (STLA)

These industry and market trends have a direct and significant impact on Stellantis:

Financial Performance and Leadership Transition: Stellantis reported a substantial 70% drop in net profit in 2024, accompanied by a 17% decrease in net revenues and a 12% decline in consolidated shipment volumes. These results were attributed to temporary product offering gaps and inventory reduction efforts. The company announced a preliminary net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of 2025, impacted by higher industrial costs, adverse geographic and product mix, foreign exchange rates, and approximately €330 million in tariffs. Carlos Tavares, the previous CEO, resigned in December 2024, and Antonio Filosa was unanimously appointed CEO effective June 23, 2025, with an expected focus on the North American market. There have also been other leadership changes, including a new CFO.

Recent U.S. Sales Rebound: A significant positive development for Stellantis is the robust 6% increase in its U.S. sales for the third quarter of 2025, breaking an eight-quarter streak of declining sales. This surge, driven by strong demand for Jeep (+11%), Ram (+26%), and Chrysler (+45%) brands, particularly models like the Jeep Wrangler, Gladiator, Wagoneer, and Ram 1500 with the HEMI V-8 engine, led to an 8% increase in Stellantis' stock price. This performance is seen as a potential turnaround and a positive indicator of the new CEO's product strategy.

Evolving Electrification Strategy: Stellantis is explicitly shifting from an ""all-electric"" strategy to a ""multi-energy"" (xEV) approach, acknowledging reduced BEV demand in certain markets and challenges like inadequate charging infrastructure and high raw material costs. The company had originally aimed for 100% BEV sales in Europe and 50% in the U.S. by 2030 but is now prioritizing flexible platforms that can support gasoline, hybrid, electric, or even hydrogen powertrains. This pragmatic approach is reflected in plans for models like the 2027 crossover (STLA Large platform) offering hybrid options, the return of the Jeep Cherokee as a hybrid, and range-extended versions of Ram trucks. Stellantis has committed over €30 billion to electrification by the end of the decade and has invested in battery technology through joint ventures like Automotive Cells Company (ACC) and a stake in Chinese EV manufacturer Leapmotor to access affordable EV production.

Supply Chain and Cost Pressures: Stellantis, like other automakers, is grappling with semiconductor shortages, rising raw material costs for EV batteries, and increased industrial and warranty costs. The company is consolidating its 20+ platforms into five STLA platforms, designed to be multi-energy capable, to reduce costs and enhance production flexibility.

Tariff Impact: Tariffs have been a significant headwind, contributing to Stellantis's H1 2025 net loss of approximately €330 million, with further impact expected in the second half of the year. These trade policies compel the company to re-evaluate its global supply chains and potentially increase domestic or regional production to mitigate costs.

In summary, Stellantis is in a critical phase, adjusting its long-term electrification goals to a more flexible, multi-energy approach while facing persistent macroeconomic headwinds like high interest rates, inflation, and significant tariff impacts. The recent positive U.S. sales, particularly in its key brands, signal a potential turning point under its new leadership, but the company must continue to navigate complex supply chain issues and intense competition, especially from Chinese manufacturers.

10. Risks and Challenges

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a complex landscape filled with significant operational, regulatory, and market risks, alongside several notable controversies and specific challenges as of October 4, 2025. The company has faced a challenging period marked by declining sales, profitability pressures, and strategic adjustments, particularly concerning its electric vehicle (EV) transition.

Operational Risks

Stellantis is grappling with a range of operational hurdles:

Production Declines and Pauses: The company experienced a 6% decline in vehicle shipments in Q2 2025, reflecting broader industry challenges and production adjustments. North American production, a historical profit center, saw a 25% drop in shipments in the first half of 2025 due to production disruptions, including extended holiday downtime in January and tariff-related pauses. In Europe, production at facilities like Italy's Mirafiori plant fell dramatically, with overall Italian production reaching its lowest level since 1956 in 2024. Stellantis also temporarily halted production at its Mulhouse plant in France in late 2025 to manage inventories amidst a difficult European market.

Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Stellantis remains susceptible to disruptions in its global supply chain, which can arise from geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or pandemics, affecting production capabilities and financial performance. The lingering semiconductor crisis from 2024 continued to impact production at key plants.

Software-Driven Recalls: The company has faced a cascade of recalls in 2025 linked to software defects, highlighting vulnerabilities in its software-centric systems. These include a recall of 1.2 million Ram 1500 trucks for electronic stability control defects and over 219,000 Ram ProMaster and Dodge Journey vehicles for rearview camera issues.

Such software-related issues are projected to cost the automotive sector billions annually.

Labor Relations and Workforce Adjustments: Stellantis has faced criticism from unions regarding workforce reductions. In early 2025, the company announced temporary layoffs affecting over 900 US hourly employees due to production pauses in Canada and Mexico, prompting concerns from the UAW. The UAW is also prepared to file grievances over Stellantis's failure to uphold investment commitments, potentially leading to strike action. In March 2025, Stellantis offered buyout packages to UAW-represented hourly employees as part of a cost-cutting strategy. The company also announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in Italy over the next four years.

Regulatory Risks

Stellantis faces considerable risks from evolving regulatory environments:

EU CO2 Emissions Targets: The European Union's stringent CO2 emissions targets for 2025, requiring a 15% reduction from current levels, pose a significant challenge. Non-compliance could lead to substantial fines, potentially up to $2.95 billion (2.5 billion euros) between 2025 and 2027. Stellantis's Europe chief, Jean-Philippe Imparato, has called these targets ""unreachable,"" suggesting the company might need to either double EV sales or slash production of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, potentially leading to factory closures. While Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares initially stated the company was prepared for these targets, the reality of market conditions suggests otherwise.

U.S. Tariffs: The implementation of U.S. tariffs, particularly a 25% levy on imports from Mexico and Canada (where a significant portion of Stellantis's U.S. vehicles are manufactured), is expected to heavily impact operating income. Stellantis warned in July 2025 that these tariffs could cost over $1.7 billion (€1.5 billion) in 2025, with €300 million already incurred in H1. This uncertainty led Stellantis to withdraw its 2025 financial guidance earlier in the year. Tariffs also apply to vehicle imports from Europe, affecting premium brands like Alfa Romeo and Maserati.

Safety and Compliance Regulations: Ongoing recalls related to software and component defects highlight continuous regulatory scrutiny regarding vehicle safety standards.

Controversies

Several controversies have clouded Stellantis's operations:

Financial Performance and Shareholder Scrutiny: The company reported a significant net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.68 billion) in the first half of 2025, a stark reversal from a €5.6 billion profit in H1 2024. This performance was exacerbated by U.S. tariffs, production delays, and recall costs, leading to a 5.31% stock price drop in February 2025 and an accompanying shareholder lawsuit alleging financial misrepresentation.

Data Breach: In September 2025, Stellantis disclosed a data breach affecting millions of North American customer service operations. The breach, originating from a third-party service provider, exposed basic contact information like names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, though no financial data was compromised. This incident compounds reputational vulnerabilities and highlights cybersecurity risks.

Declining Dealer Trust and Sales: Stellantis has faced a challenging relationship with its dealership network, with 72% of dealers expressing little to no trust in the company by early 2025. U.S. sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters, attributed to delayed launches, high prices, and limited incentives.

Management Shake-up: The abrupt resignation of former CEO Carlos Tavares in December 2024, amid concerns about the company's North American strategy and declining profits, introduced uncertainty. New CEO Antonio Filosa took over in June 2025 and is tasked with a turnaround plan, which includes tackling profitability challenges and repairing dealer relationships.

Profit-Sharing Reduction: UAW workers in the U.S. received a significantly reduced profit-sharing check for 2024, down 73% from the previous year, despite the company reporting $5.8 billion in net profits, leading to anger among employees.

Market Risks

Stellantis is exposed to substantial market-driven risks:

Intense Competition and Market Share Decline: Stellantis's market share declined in key regions in 2024, falling to 8% in North America (from 9.6% in 2023) and 17% in Europe (from 18.3% in 2023). The company faces fierce competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, which dominate affordable EV segments and have gained significant market share in Europe.

Slow EV Adoption and Demand Shifts: Stellantis has acknowledged performing ""well below potential"" in managing the EV transition in 2024. Slow EV adoption rates, high costs of EVs compared to ICE vehicles, and reductions in EV subsidies in Europe have weighed on sales and profitability. The company noted an overall decline in demand in Europe.

Economic Downturns and Cyclicality: As a cyclical company, Stellantis is highly susceptible to economic downturns that can impact vehicle sales. Profitability has been under pressure due to reduced production volumes, increased warranty and quality-related expenses, and strategic investments in EV technology.

Geopolitical Instability and Trade Policies: Beyond direct tariffs, broader trade policies between major economies can increase production costs, raise consumer prices, reduce demand, and impact profitability.

Currency Swings: Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates pose a risk to Stellantis's financial performance.

Specific Challenges Faced by the Company

EV Transition Strategy: Stellantis recently abandoned its goal of achieving 100% electric vehicle sales by 2030, recognizing the transition is more complex and uncertain than initially envisioned. The company is now emphasizing a ""flexible approach"" that prioritizes hybrid and plug-in hybrid technologies alongside Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), particularly in Europe where it still aims for 100% BEV sales by 2030. Challenges include infrastructure gaps, high battery costs, and consumer hesitancy. The CEO, Carlos Tavares, had previously called the 100% EV target ""unachievable.""

Financial Health: The company's financial performance has been mixed, with a €2.3 billion net loss in H1 2025, negative operating margins, and high debt levels. Its Altman Z-Score of 1.51 places it in the ""distress zone,"" indicating a potential risk of bankruptcy within two years, despite moderate debt levels.

Product Performance and Launches: Dodge sales were down 50% in the first half of 2025, largely due to a poor reception of the Charger Daytona EV. Overall, Stellantis sales were down 11% compared to H1 2024. While the return of the Hemi V8 in Ram trucks and the introduction of gas engines for the electric Charger Daytona aim to boost sales, the company has faced delays in launching new models, such as the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, which was pushed to 2026.

North American Profitability: Historically a profit engine, North America swung to an operating loss in H1 2025 due to reduced imported vehicle production and weaker fleet sales.

11. Opportunities and Catalysts

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a dynamic automotive landscape, demonstrating a recent turnaround in key markets while strategically adapting its long-term vision. As of October 4, 2025, the company is focused on a multi-pronged approach to growth, including a revitalized product offensive, advanced technology integration, and a re-evaluation of its market presence and electrification strategy.

Growth Levers and Strategic Initiatives

Stellantis has shown promising signs of a rebound, particularly in its crucial North American market. The company reported a robust 6% year-over-year increase in U.S. sales during the third quarter of 2025, marking its first positive sales quarter in two years after a period of decline. This surge was primarily driven by significant growth in key brands: Jeep sales climbed by 11% and Ram retail sales saw a 26% increase. Chrysler also contributed with a substantial 45% rise in sales. This sales momentum is a critical near-term catalyst.

A core strategic initiative is the aggressive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across its operations. Stellantis has expanded its partnership with French startup Mistral AI, moving from pilot programs to enterprise-wide AI deployment. This collaboration aims to embed generative AI into sales, engineering workflows, and customer service. Key to this expansion are the newly launched ""Innovation Lab"" for co-developing customized AI solutions and a ""Transformation Academy"" focused on scaling AI adoption to achieve measurable business impact.

Stellantis is also overhauling its product strategy to meet evolving customer demands. This includes a notable decision to bring back the Hemi V-8 engine to certain Ram trucks and the Dodge Charger, alongside the introduction of new electrified models. The company has expressed a renewed focus on strengthening partnerships with its dealers through consistent incentive programs, increased advertising efforts, and a pipeline of exciting new products designed to support sales.

Furthermore, Stellantis is adjusting its electrification strategy. While its original ""Dare Forward 2030"" plan aimed for 100% battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in Europe and 50% in the U.S. by the end of the decade, the company has officially signaled a shift away from this rigid target. The updated approach emphasizes offering ""customer choice,"" including hybrids and traditional internal combustion engines (ICE), in recognition of market realities and consumer preferences. Despite this adjustment, the broader ""Dare Forward 2030"" strategy still targets becoming carbon net-zero by 2038, with a 50% reduction by 2030, and a goal of 75+ BEVs globally and 5 million BEV sales by 2030. The company is also expanding its ""SUSTAINera"" aftersales range, including used parts offerings through its partner B-Parts, focusing on the UK market as a strategic opportunity for sustainable and cost-effective solutions.

New Markets

Stellantis is actively pursuing expansion in emerging markets. In South Africa, the company plans to broaden the product lineup at its greenfield manufacturing plant in Gqeberha, moving beyond the initial intention of producing only the Peugeot Landtrek pickup truck. This facility, set to begin production in the second half of 2027, is part of a larger strategy to grow its footprint and industrialize in the African market, targeting both local and wider African sales.

Additionally, Stellantis is leveraging partnerships for market entry. It plans to launch the Leapmotor C10 range-extended electric SUV from its joint venture with Chinese automaker Leapmotor in South Africa this year, with more models anticipated in 2026. In North America, the Ram Rampage, a compact pickup truck that has seen success in South American markets, is officially confirmed for release, aiming to compete in a growing segment.

M&A Potential

While Stellantis is open to strategic portfolio adjustments, recent reports of a potential merger with Renault Group have been explicitly denied by both Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares and Renault CEO Luca de Meo, who labeled them as ""pure speculation.""

However, Stellantis is currently conducting a strategic review of its portfolio assets, indicating potential divestitures. The company is considering selling its Free2move car-sharing business as part of a plan to exit unprofitable ventures and re-focus investments on core assets, particularly in the profitable U.S. market. Furthermore, Stellantis has engaged McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice regarding the performance of its Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands, although Maserati is not currently for sale. A new comprehensive business plan resulting from this broader review is expected to be presented to investors in the first quarter of 2026.

Near-Term Events (as of 10/4/2025)

Earnings: Stellantis is scheduled to announce its Q3 2025 Shipments and Revenues on October 30, 2025. The company's Q4 2025 earnings report, covering the full year 2025, is estimated to be released around March 4, 2026.

Launches: A robust pipeline of new models is expected in late 2025 and 2026:

The return of the Hemi V-8 engine in certain Ram models is anticipated.

The all-new 2026 Dodge Charger Scat Pack, available with a twin-turbo 3.0-liter Hurricane I6 engine and an all-electric Daytona Scat Pack variant, is launching.

The redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, featuring a turbocharged 1.6-liter HYBRID I4 engine, is making its debut.

The Ram Rampage compact pickup is entering the North American market.

The next-generation Dodge Durango, built on the STLA Large platform, will offer various powertrains including the Hurricane I6, a BEV version, and potentially a plug-in hybrid (PHEV).

The Jeep Comanche, a new off-road-focused compact pickup, is slated for release.

A new Chrysler SUV built on the STLA Large platform is also expected.

The Leapmotor C10 range-extended electric SUV will be launched in South Africa in 2025.

Potential Catalysts for Growth

Key catalysts for Stellantis's growth include sustaining the positive sales momentum in the U.S. for its high-margin Jeep and Ram brands. The successful integration of AI across operations is expected to enhance efficiency and customer experience. A strong market reception for its diverse lineup of new vehicle launches, spanning ICE, hybrid, and electric powertrains, will be crucial. The successful execution of its adjusted, more flexible electrification strategy could better align with market demands. Furthermore, expansion into African markets and the performance of the Leapmotor joint venture represent new revenue streams. Finally, a positive outcome from the strategic review, including shedding unprofitable assets like Free2move and presenting a compelling new business plan in early 2026, could significantly boost investor confidence and financial performance, with the company projecting low-single-digit Adjusted Operating Income profitability for the second half of 2025.

Retail Chatter

Retail investor sentiment on Stellantis (STLA) has shown recent improvement. On October 3, 2025, retail sentiment on Stocktwits was trending ""bullish,"" although message volume had fallen to ""normal"" from ""high"" levels. Just a day earlier, on October 1, 2025, retail sentiment on Stocktwits had risen from ""bearish"" to ""neutral"" territory, following news of Stellantis expanding its partnership with Mistral AI. Discussions on platforms like Moomoo and Investing.com show varied opinions, with some investors seeing the stock as ""extremely cheap"" and a ""buy"" opportunity, while others express frustration over past declines.

Overall Sentiment as of 10/4/2025

The overall sentiment around Stellantis is currently complex. While analysts generally lean towards a ""Hold"" or ""Reduce"" rating, recent developments have injected positive momentum. The company saw a significant surge in its stock price, rising 7-8% in early October, driven by a robust 6% increase in U.S. sales for Q3 2025, marking its first positive sales quarter in two years. This sales rebound, coupled with an expanded AI partnership with Mistral AI, has boosted investor confidence and contributed to an uptick in retail sentiment. However, the company still faces financial challenges, including declining margins, high debt levels, and ongoing profitability concerns, as reflected by its negative operating and net margins in the first half of 2025. Stellantis has also been involved in lobbying efforts regarding potential tariffs on its Mexico-produced Ram pickups, with Ford and GM reportedly lobbying against Stellantis's request for a waiver or reduction. Despite these challenges, the Q3 sales figures are seen as a critical turning point and a potential catalyst for a strategic recovery. The company expects to report its Q3 2025 shipments and revenues on October 30, 2025, and its 2025 financial guidance remains unchanged.

13. Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a complex and challenging landscape of regulatory, policy, and geopolitical factors as of October 2025. These factors significantly impact its operations, financial performance, and strategic direction, particularly regarding its transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and global manufacturing footprint.

Regulatory and Policy Factors:

US Tariffs and Trade Policies:

Impact: Stellantis is facing substantial financial headwinds from new US tariffs on imported vehicles and parts. The company projects a €1.2 billion (USD 1.4 billion) to €1.5 billion (USD 1.6 billion) impact in the second half of 2025, following a €300 million impact in the first half. These tariffs, which include a 25% duty on assembled vehicles and parts from Canada and Mexico, took effect on April 3, 2025. Imports from Europe also face levies, though some were deferred. These tariffs have led to a 23% drop in North American deliveries and a €2.3 billion net loss in H1 2025 for Stellantis. The tariffs are also forcing Stellantis to reassess its production footprint, with temporary layoffs at US plants and suspended production at Canadian and Mexican facilities.

Strategy: Stellantis is trying to adapt by adjusting manufacturing levels and reducing vehicle shipments. The company's reliance on integrated North American supply chains has become a liability, pushing for a shift towards domestic resilience in the automotive sector. CEO Antonio Filosa, appointed in May 2025, is tasked with revamping product ranges and regaining market share and investor confidence amidst these challenges.

EU CO2 Emission Regulations:

Impact: The EU has implemented stricter CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and vans, effective from January 1, 2025. New cars and vans registered in the EU must emit 15% less CO2 compared to 2021 targets, equating to an average target of 93.6 g CO2/km for cars. Manufacturers face financial penalties of €95 per g/km of target exceedance for every car sold. Stellantis's Europe chief, Jean-Philippe Imparato, has called these targets ""unrealistic"" and stated that the company faces potential fines of up to $2.95 billion, possibly leading to factory closures if regulatory changes are not made. While Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares initially stated the company was prepared for these targets, the reality of market conditions suggests otherwise.

Strategy: In response to industry lobbying, the European Commission proposed an amendment on April 1, 2025, to allow automakers to meet 2025-2027 CO2 targets based on a three-year average rather than annually, providing some flexibility. Stellantis aims for 100% battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales in Europe by 2030. Despite the challenges, Stellantis appears to be ""well on track"" for its 2025 EU CO2 targets, with a compliance gap of less than 5 gCO2/km based on 2023 emissions. The company, along with Renault, is also advocating for a new category of smaller, less-regulated ""e-cars"" in Europe to compete with cheaper Chinese EVs, arguing that current safety regulations make small cars unprofitable.

Government Incentives for EVs:

Impact: The federal EV tax credit of $7,500 in the US officially expired on September 30, 2025. This has led Stellantis to reduce production of electric and plug-in hybrid cars for the US market, aligning production with anticipated demand after the loss of incentives.

Strategy: To counteract the expiration of the federal tax credit, Stellantis is replicating the $7,500 incentive with its own bonus cash offers for eligible EVs and PHEVs in dealer inventory, including models like the Jeep Wagoneer S, Wrangler 4xe, Grand Cherokee 4xe, Dodge Charger Daytona EV, Dodge Hornet R/T PHEV, Chrysler Pacifica PHEV, and Alfa Romeo Tonale. This strategy aims to maintain sales momentum for its electrified offerings.

Opportunities: Stellantis received a commitment of up to $7.54 billion from the US government to build two EV battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana, through its joint venture with Samsung SDI, StarPlus Energy LLC. This aligns with the Biden administration's push to strengthen domestic EV supply chains and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. Stellantis plans to invest over $35 billion through 2025 in electrification and software development, welcoming consumer incentives, increased public charging infrastructure, and support for US R&D and manufacturing as critical steps for a robust EV ecosystem.

Geopolitical Risks and Opportunities:

US-China Trade Tensions and Competition:

Risks: US tariffs are hitting the entire auto sector, including Stellantis, with a 25% tariff on auto imports and additional duties on aluminum, steel, and parts. Stellantis has faced production cuts and layoffs in North America due to these tariffs. The company is also directly impacted by China's rare earth export policies, as these materials are crucial for EV components, creating supply chain disruptions. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has warned about the ""major trap"" of tariffs on Chinese EVs in Europe and the US, stating it could force Western automakers to restructure to compete with lower-cost Chinese manufacturers, with potential severe social consequences. There are concerns that China will produce more vehicles than Europe and the United States combined by 2025, intensifying competition.

Opportunities/Strategy: Stellantis is considering pulling out of car manufacturing in China and instead importing vehicles from the US or Europe, adopting an ""asset-light"" business model to reduce fixed costs and limit exposure to geopolitical risks. This shift is also driven by local competitors like BYD and Geely gaining market share in China's EV segment. Stellantis is supporting a US startup, Niron Magnetics, to develop and produce magnets without rare-earth elements, aiming to reduce dependence on China's supply chain for critical minerals.

Global Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:

Risks: Stellantis's reliance on a global supply chain makes it vulnerable to disruptions from geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or pandemics, which can impact production capabilities and financial performance. The US tariffs have specifically exposed the fragility of Stellantis's integrated North American supply chains, leading to plant halts and layoffs.

Strategy: The company is strategically adapting by prioritizing supply chain flexibility and demand alignment. This includes reevaluating its North American sourcing strategy and potentially reshoring operations or expanding North American supplier networks. Stellantis's Manufacturing and Supply Chain department is focused on optimizing logistics, mode, and capacity, and collaborating with suppliers for sustainable practices, including using recyclable or reusable packaging.

EU's Industrial Policy and Chinese Competition:

Risks: European rules are making cars more complex, heavier, and expensive, hindering Stellantis and Renault's ability to produce affordable vehicles and maintain market share against Chinese rivals. The EU's carbon regulation also imposes an ""unrealistic path to electrification"" for Stellantis, detached from market realities, with inadequate charging infrastructure and removed purchase incentives slowing EV transition.

Strategy: Stellantis is urging the EU to ease regulations and has actively lobbied for a new category of smaller, less-regulated electric vehicles (""e-cars"") in Europe to better compete with affordable Chinese EVs entering the market. The company is also pursuing an ""extended electrification"" (xEV) strategy, encompassing ICE, PHEVs, and BEVs, using its STLA platform to consolidate production and offer flexibility to respond to regional demand and regulatory shifts, in contrast to some rivals' pure BEV focus.

In summary, Stellantis is actively adapting its operations and strategy to a dynamic global environment. It is grappling with significant financial impacts from US tariffs, pushing it to re-evaluate its North American manufacturing and supply chain. In Europe, it faces stringent CO2 emission targets, prompting calls for regulatory flexibility and a diversified electrification strategy. Geopolitically, the rise of Chinese competition and supply chain dependencies on critical minerals are driving Stellantis to explore new manufacturing models and partnerships to secure raw materials and maintain competitiveness. The company's future success hinges on its ability to navigate these complex challenges while executing its electrification goals and maintaining profitability across its diverse brand portfolio.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

Stellantis (STLA) is navigating a complex automotive landscape as of October 4, 2025, marked by strategic pivots towards electrification and software, recent leadership changes, and mixed financial performance. While the company has shown a significant rebound in U.S. sales, it continues to face financial headwinds and external challenges.

Recent Performance (as of Q3 2025)

Stellantis concluded the third quarter of 2025 with strong sales momentum in the U.S., reporting a 6% year-over-year increase in vehicle sales, totaling 324,825 units. This performance marks a significant turning point, snapping a prolonged streak of eight consecutive quarters of declining sales for its American subsidiary, FCA US. September sales were particularly robust, climbing 16% compared to the same month last year. Commercial fleet sales also saw a notable 22% increase.

Key brand performance highlights in the U.S. for Q3 2025 include:

Jeep®: Sales surged 11%, with the Wrangler up 18%, the Gladiator jumping 43%, and the Wagoneer posting an impressive 122% gain. The Wrangler 4xe continues to be America's best-selling Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), with the Grand Cherokee 4xe holding the No. 3 spot.

Ram: Retail sales increased by 26% in Q3, largely driven by the return of the HEMI® V8 in the Ram 1500. Light-duty trucks saw a 10% climb.

Chrysler: Experienced an astounding 45% increase in total sales, with Pacifica sales up 49% and Voyager sales up 65%.

FIAT: Also contributed positively with a modest 2% sales gain.

Despite this sales rebound, Stellantis's financial performance for the first half of 2025 revealed a net loss of €2.3 billion and a 12.7% year-over-year decline in revenue to €74.26 billion. The second quarter (Q2 2025) saw a significant miss on earnings per share (EPS) expectations at -0.78, although revenue slightly exceeded forecasts at €38.4 billion. Consolidated shipments globally for Q2 2025 declined by 7% year-over-year.

Stellantis's stock has faced challenges, being down 20% since the start of 2025 and losing about two-thirds of its value since March 2024. However, the strong Q3 U.S. sales report on October 2, 2025, led to an 8% surge in its stock price, reflecting renewed investor optimism. The company maintains a sturdy cash position of approximately $36.04 billion.

Future Plans and Strategic Pivots

Under new CEO Antonio Filosa, who took the helm in June 2025, and with the recent appointment of Joao Laranjo as CFO on September 30, 2025, Stellantis is executing several strategic initiatives:

Electrification and Software (Dare Forward 2030): Stellantis plans to invest over €30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software development. The company aims for a 100% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) passenger car sales mix in Europe and a 50% BEV passenger car and light-duty truck sales mix in the U.S. by 2030. To support this, Stellantis is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity by 2030 through five ""gigafactories"" in North America and Europe.

On September 27, 2025, Stellantis unveiled its Intelligent Battery Integrated System (IBIS) prototype, developed with Saft, aiming for 10% greater efficiency than similar EV batteries and potential production by the end of the decade.

The company is launching new electrified models, including a future electrified Jeep Wagoneer by the end of 2025. The Ram 1500 REV (all-electric pickup) launched in late 2024, and the range-extended 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger will be built alongside internal combustion engine (ICE) models.

U.S. Manufacturing Investments: Stellantis is making a multi-billion dollar investment in its U.S. operations. This includes building the next-generation Dodge Durango at its Detroit Assembly Complex, reopening the idled Belvidere plant in 2027 to produce a new midsize pickup truck, and enhancing its Toledo Assembly Complex for Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator. Investments are also planned for Kokomo facilities to produce the GME-T4 EVO engine starting in 2026.

How can we keep the lights on without breaking the bank? That question was front and center this May as energy leaders from across California gathered in Irvine for the CalCCA Annual Conference.

At the heart of the conference was a powerhouse plenary panel, “Brass Tacks: CCA CEOs on the Industry’s Current State and Future Direction,” featuring five CalCCA board members. Moderated by Robert Shaw, CEO of Central Coast Community Energy, the panelists pulled no punches about the state of the energy industry and how their organizations are planning for the future.

As these executives see it, the path forward requires more than clean energy. It demands grit, foresight, and a laser focus on keeping costs in check for the Californians who need it most.

“You’re seeing real stories of folks once a month having to figure out whether they want to pay their electric bill or fill up the pantry with groceries. It’s a real issue,” said Don Eckert, CEO of Pioneer Community Energy. “People are suffering with the high energy prices that continue to go up.”

Electricity costs are a primary concern for Pioneer, despite saving its customers $108 million since 2018 and maintaining the lowest residential generation rates in California. While Pioneer achieves this by offering a 10% discount on average compared to PG&E’s electricity generation rates, Eckert noted, it is hard to make that felt when the majority of customer electricity bill charges are for transmission, distribution, and other costs that CCAs do not control. “We’ve been very aggressive in our discount to PG&E,” Eckert said, “but to be real, we’re only a third of the bill.”

Being Proactive Is Key

In strategizing how to achieve manageable bills, the CEOs repeatedly touched on the idea of being proactive in securing cost-effective clean energy resources and managing risks. Ted Bardacke, CEO of Clean Power Alliance (CPA), relayed how his agency made the decision to take a share of the risk in its recent request for offers for renewable energy contracts.

Facing uncertainties from tariffs and the status of Inflation Reduction Act credits, CPA decided to incorporate price-flexibility language into its contracts with developers. The language allows for a moderate change in contract price if tariffs are higher or lower than expected when the primary equipment to build an agreed-upon energy project arrives. This means that a project could end up being slightly more or less expensive for CPA, but it also incentivizes developers to work with CPA even during these uncertain times, helping to avoid price increases from a lack of available energy resources.

Bardacke highlighted that CPA developed this strategy proactively. CPA “didn’t just say ‘Developers, come tell us what you want.’” Instead, Bardacke said, “We’re going to take the pen, we’re going to put out a standard pro forma that talks about the risks we would like to share.”

Lori Mitchell, director of San José Clean Energy (SJCE), echoed the importance of forward-looking action to handle uncertainties, particularly around the rise of data centers and similar large loads in SJCE’s area. “You’re talking at least 100 MW,” Mitchell said of some large commercial customers. “It’s something that you have to procure in advance for; PG&E needs to build out that distribution infrastructure to serve them. So, we’ve really taken a proactive approach of partnering with PG&E to make sure that happens.”

For CCAs, preparing for significant load growth is key to preventing unexpected cost or service shifts for all customers. “Really understanding this load forecasting with the investor-owned utility is going to be so important because affordability is such a challenge right now,” Mitchell said. “And when you have these large-load customers coming on line, the last thing all of us want to do is to buy it before they’re actually there and using this load, right? Because then we potentially have invested in supply that we don’t need.”

Turning Challenges into Opportunities

With proper foresight, CCA leaders view challenges and risks as avenues of opportunity. Mitchell pointed out that the 100 MW procurements further the economies of scale that CCAs have already achieved by procuring for their smaller customers. Larger loads to procure means having to find more energy to contract, but it also means having more negotiating power and leverage when creating contracts. Additionally, Mitchell noted, some large customers can shift load from one data center to another in minutes, which means they can be a strong tool for demand response and relieving pressure on the grid.

San Diego Community Power (SDCP) is also capitalizing on challenges, as evidenced by its recent launch of the San Diego Regional Energy Network (SDREN). The new network provides programs “designed to make energy efficiency and electrification more accessible and affordable,” according to SDCP CEO Karin Burns. It also may fill future voids given San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) has signaled plans to exit energy efficiency programs.

SDREN is poised to generate $124.3 million in energy efficiency resources for the region through 2027.

Managed by SDCP and the County of San Diego, SDREN will administer 10 programs that aim to facilitate residential and business energy efficiency upgrades, workforce training in green careers, and reduction of customer energy bills. “We’re really focused on launching the REN and making it successful,” Burns said.

Indeed, while the road ahead won’t be easy, CCAs are looking forward and charting courses to find the best ways to meet the needs of their customers and provide them with affordable, clean, and reliable energy.

In concluding the panel, Shaw remarked how, in the CCA world, “There are a ton of challenges, and I think the wonderful opportunity that you’ve heard from each of these four is each of those challenges really is an opportunity to engage.”",https://cal-cca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7-22-CalCCA_Logo_400x400_Cleaned-Up-Simplified-on-Green.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 15:59:58.812171

For Stellantis, the strategy is clear—keep EVs and PHEVs attractive while the brand ramps up its electrification lineup and works to win back U.S. market share.","Stellantis (FCA US) is giving American car buyers a bit more breathing room in the electric (EV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) market. Despite the official expiration of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, the automaker has confirmed to the Detroit Free Press that it will continue to honor the incentive on eligible models—at least through the end of 2025, as long as dealer inventory lasts.

This move comes as Stellantis tries to regain ground in the U.S. market. The company posted its best quarter in years, with sales climbing 6% year-over-year in Q3 2025 to 324,825 units. Chrysler, Jeep®, and FIAT all contributed to the gain, with Jeep carrying much of the load thanks to surging demand for the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEVs.

The Jeep Wrangler 4xe has been the nation’s best-selling PHEV, helping Stellantis sell more than 128,000 Wranglers so far this year. Meanwhile, the all-electric Jeep Wagoneer S hit 4,163 deliveries in Q3 alone, bringing its 2025 total to over 10,000. The all-electric Dodge Charger Daytona and Hornet R/T PHEV, Chrysler’s Pacifica Hybrid, and Alfa Romeo’s Tonale PHEV also qualify for the temporary credit extension.

There is a catch, however. Unlike the original IRS tax credit, Stellantis’ program only applies to vehicles already sitting in dealer stock. Once those units are sold, the incentive disappears unless the company renews it. Stellantis is referring to the benefit as “bonus cash,” which is applied directly to the transaction price, making it functionally identical to the old federal rebate.

By stepping in, Stellantis joins rivals Ford, General Motors (GM), and Hyundai, which also pledged to help buyers offset the loss of federal incentives. For Stellantis, the strategy is clear—keep EVs and PHEVs attractive while the brand ramps up its electrification lineup and works to win back U.S. market share.

For now, customers eyeing a new Dodge, Jeep, Chrysler, or Alfa Romeo electrified model still have access to a deal that keeps them in the game—at least until inventories run out.

The Trump administration, citing an ongoing “energy emergency,” is saddling a community already overburdened by pollution with a dirty, obsolete power plant it doesn’t want or need. The decision has confounded residents and environmental justice advocates, who called the move an abuse of federal law and a lost opportunity to improve the area’s air quality.

The Department of Energy issued [pdf] what’s called an emergency “stay open” order for Constellation Energy’s gas-fired power plant in Eddystone, Pennsylvania, on August 27. It is the second time since May the agency has taken this step, and amounts to “an extraordinary and unprecedented” use of the Federal Power Act (FPA), said Robert Routh of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). The FPA gives the United States federal government authority to regulate interstate electricity sales, hydropower projects, and parts of the power grid to ensure reliable and fair access to electricity.

The NRDC, along with the Sierra Club, PennFuture, and several other environmental groups, is challenging the decision. Emergency stay open orders have previously been reserved for wartime conditions or natural disasters, said Routh, who is the Pennsylvania policy director for the organization. “This is an abuse of an extraordinary authority reserved for emergency situations,” he said, noting that the short-term need for increased electricity the administration cited in defending the move would not justify keeping the facility open. “They are concocting the emergency situation in order to justify keeping a dirty fossil plant online past its retirement date.”

Eddystone lies just outside Philadelphia, at the head of a 12-mile industrial corridor that stretches to the town of Marcus Hook and is generally considered one of the most toxic areas in the state. Today, it’s home to myriad hazardous industries, including the nation’s largest trash incinerator, chemical plants, and refineries. Childhood asthma rates in the region are four times the national average, and the rates of some forms of cancer are more than 1,000 percent higher.

Constellation Energy’s gas plant in Eddystone began operation in the early 1960s and currently provides about 782 megawatts to the surrounding region. It has run only sporadically in recent years, in large part because it simply was not economical to operate consistently. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it emitted 23,102 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2022, 16 tons of methane, and 31 tons of nitrous oxide. Grid operator PJM approved Constellation’s shutdown request for the plant in December of 2023 after finding that the closure would not adversely impact the grid, and the facility was scheduled to close May 31. But, one day before the closure, the Department of Energy, or DOE, ordered the plant to continue operating. The agency reissued that order when it expired last week.

Although environmental advocates argue the emergency order is a manufactured crisis, the DOE cited summer heat waves as the rationale for keeping the plant open, noting that the “Eddystone units were called on by PJM to generate electricity during heat waves that hit the region in June and July.” The grid operator did not respond when asked if closing the plant would have caused blackouts—something that would not have been considered in its decision to approve the facility’s closure, because PJM cannot deny a closure solely on those grounds. But PJM said it supported extending the emergency order. Constellation Energy pointed to the rapid expansion of the data centres powering artificial intelligence, saying that it is “continuing to work with the Department of Energy and PJM in taking emergency measures to meet the need for power at this critical time when America must win the AI race.”

In July, Trump and Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick announced the private sector had promised $90 billion in funding to turn Pennsylvania into a hub for data centres. This has drawn concern from environmental advocates, who worry that the promise of corporate investment will provide a handy excuse to prolong the life of oil and liquid natural gas in order to generate electricity for hypothetical data centres.

“We have not yet seen that demand that everyone is talking about from the data centres,” said Jessica O’Neill, managing attorney at PennFuture, an environmental advocacy nonprofit. “In Pennsylvania, we just seem to fall over ourselves, again and again, to attract new industry.” Her concern, she explained, was that the state would build speculative gas plants or extend the life of aging plants in the service of an industry that might never materialize.

When Constellation’s shutdown request was approved almost two years ago, the grid operator noted that the plant’s closure would not cause “any reliability violations,” or leave the region at risk of blackouts. Both Routh and O’Neill noted that PJM’s interconnection crisis has left many renewable energy projects in limbo as they wait to be brought onto the grid. Despite the administration’s dire warnings of an energy emergency, it has moved aggressively to shut down renewable energy projects that would provide more electricity.

“I personally think it’s interesting that they’re justifying the stay open order on the grounds that there’s an energy emergency, because that has not been shown to be the case,” said Lauren Minsky, a medical historian and professor of environmental health at Haverford College. “And what there clearly is, is a public health emergency.” As part of her work, Minsky has been tracking community cancer rates in the industrial stretch between Eddystone and Marcus Hook. Pediatric Hodgkin’s Lymphoma rates in Eddystone are 1,051 percent higher than the national average; youth uterine cancer rates are 1,813 percent higher.

The emergency stay open order will likely increase costs for ratepayers, Routh explained. Because the order came down just a day before the plant was to retire, Constellation Energy had to abruptly order an enormous amount of fuel and tackle deferred maintenance it never expected to deal with. “Those costs are going to be shifted to ratepayers,” said Routh. “Whereas this plant otherwise would not have been operating. This is an unprecedented use of this authority, and it’s done in a way that doesn’t make sense even on its own face.”

DMR Technologies will create 521 jobs over the next decade with an average salary of $85,000 to produce agricultural drones for the American market.

The move comes as U.S. drone manufacturers face pressure to prove they can compete with cheaper Chinese imports while meeting growing demand for NDAA-compliant domestic production. For drone operators watching the industry shift toward American-made aircraft, DMR’s Louisiana gamble represents a significant test case.

Lafayette Facility to Produce Field Ranger X50 Agricultural Drones

DMR Technologies, headquartered in Houston with offices in Detroit, will renovate a 10,000-square-foot facility on Dorset Avenue in Lafayette to serve as its primary domestic production hub. The facility will integrate flight control printing, rotor manufacturing, assembly, quality control, and logistics staging under one roof.

The company plans to produce 500 to 1,000 Field Ranger X50 drones by the end of 2025. The Field Ranger X50 is an agricultural spray drone with a 50-liter (13.2-gallon) tank capacity designed for precision agriculture, industrial inspection, environmental monitoring, and delivery applications.

“Louisiana has proven to be an ideal partner,” DMR Technologies Co-founder and CEO David Wang said. “Lafayette offers us the talent, infrastructure and policy environment we need to ramp up quickly and operate with efficiency.”

High-Paying Jobs and State Incentives Seal the Deal

Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will create 521 direct jobs plus 766 indirect positions, totaling 1,287 new opportunities in the Acadiana region. The $85,000 average salary represents 151% of the Lafayette Parish average wage, qualifying DMR for Louisiana’s High Impact Jobs Program.

To secure the facility, Louisiana offered a competitive package including a $1 million performance-based grant for building renovations and equipment costs, LED FastStart workforce development solutions, and potential Industrial Tax Exemption benefits. The state will provide grants covering up to 22% of employee pay through the High Impact Jobs Program.

“This is exactly the type of project that delivers lasting opportunity for our people and communities,” Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said.

Building on Local Partnership with SoLA Drones

DMR already maintains a partnership with SoLA Drones, a Lafayette-based drone retailer founded in 2023 that specializes in agricultural applications throughout South Louisiana. The company also has distribution partners in nearby Scott, Alabama, Kentucky, and Michigan.

“Being located in Louisiana gives us a strong logistics footprint to serve both U.S. and international clients,” DMR Technologies Co-founder and Head of U.S. Operations Ryan Case said. “With the launch of our Lafayette facility, we’re eliminating lead time issues and delivering next-day fulfillment for many of our U.S. customers.”

Production Timeline and Economic Impact

Renovations are currently underway at the facility, with production scheduled to begin by the end of 2025. The Lafayette operation will house engineering and compliance teams, quality testing spaces, an on-site warehouse, and logistics staging areas.

Lafayette Mayor-President Monique B. Boulet emphasized the economic diversification benefits. “By updating an existing facility, DMR Technologies is reinvesting in part of our community while keeping costs low,” she said.

DroneXL’s Take

DMR Technologies is entering the U.S. manufacturing arena at a pivotal moment. President Trump’s June 2025 executive order “Unleashing American Drone Dominance” calls for prioritizing U.S.-manufactured drones across federal agencies, creating potential opportunities for domestic manufacturers. But the order alone doesn’t guarantee success.

American drone manufacturers face a harsh reality: insufficient commercial and government procurement demand remains the biggest barrier to scaling domestic production, as industry leaders acknowledged at XPONENTIAL 2025. Companies like Skydio, AeroVironment, and BRINC have struggled to match the price-performance ratio of Chinese competitors, particularly DJI’s dominance in the agricultural drone market.

DMR’s strategy of focusing on agricultural drones makes sense. The ag sector represents a large addressable market where American farmers increasingly face pressure to avoid Chinese-made equipment for food security and data privacy reasons. By partnering with existing Louisiana agricultural networks through SoLA Drones, DMR has built-in distribution and market knowledge.

However, critical questions remain unanswered: Is the Field Ranger X50 NDAA-compliant? How will DMR’s pricing compare to DJI’s Agras T50, which dominates the agricultural spray drone market? Can 500-1,000 units per year generate sufficient revenue to sustain 521 employees long-term?

The Louisiana location offers genuine logistics advantages for serving U.S. customers, and the state’s $1 million investment plus tax incentives reduce DMR’s upfront risk. But ultimately, DMR’s success depends on whether American farmers and commercial operators will pay a premium for domestic manufacturing—or continue buying cheaper imported alternatives until regulatory restrictions force their hand.

This is a bet worth watching. If DMR can prove the economics work for agricultural drones, it could pave the way for broader domestic manufacturing across other drone segments.

Among those affected is major electric utility Portland General Electric (PGE), which says it has lost $50 million in grants across three projects aimed at improving the reliability of the region’s electrical grid. A spokesperson said the utility is evaluating all options, including filing appeals.

National and Local Impact Federal officials argue the reforms could shorten review times that have sometimes exceeded actual construction timelines.
CEQ says the changes will help major infrastructure projects move forward more quickly, from highways to pipelines to housing developments.","The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has released updated guidance and a model template for how federal agencies implement the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), marking what officials describe as the most significant permitting reform effort since the law was enacted 55 years ago.

The Sept. 29 release builds on President Donald Trump’s day-one executive order on energy development and follows Congress’s 2023 and 2025 amendments to NEPA, as well as the Supreme Court’s May decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County.

“There’s been a consensus across all three branches of government that we need permitting reform. Now, at the direction of President Trump, Federal agencies have a clear and consistent roadmap to get us there,” said CEQ Chairman Katherine Scarlett. She called the initiative “the greatest permitting reform ever to take place in the 55-year history of NEPA.”

What Changed

Old regulations rescinded: In April 2025, CEQ formally rescinded its binding NEPA regulations at 40 CFR parts 1500–1508. Agencies must now rely on their own procedures, developed in consultation with CEQ.

New guidance is non-binding: The Sept. 29 guidance provides a framework and “roadmap” but does not have the force of law. CEQ emphasized that agencies retain flexibility to tailor their procedures.

Template for agencies: The Appendix provides a model for drafting NEPA procedures, covering areas such as categorical exclusions, environmental assessments, public involvement, and interagency coordination.

Congressional amendments incorporated:

• The 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act introduced deadlines, page limits, and broader use of programmatic reviews and categorical exclusions.

• The 2025 amendments added a “Project Sponsor Opt-in Fee” provision, allowing private sponsors to pay fees in exchange for expedited review deadlines.

Supreme Court ruling applied: The Seven County decision clarified that NEPA is procedural, not substantive, and limited agencies’ obligation to analyze remote or speculative effects, directing courts to defer to reasonable agency judgments.

National and Local Impact

Federal officials argue the reforms could shorten review times that have sometimes exceeded actual construction timelines. CEQ says the changes will help major infrastructure projects move forward more quickly, from highways to pipelines to housing developments.

In Texas, where highway expansions, energy projects, and large-scale housing are frequently subject to lengthy environmental reviews, the reforms could reduce bottlenecks if agencies adopt the new framework and sponsors utilize the opt-in fee system.

Critics Respond

Environmental groups warn that compressed timelines may weaken safeguards for communities and natural resources. Legal analysts also note that, with CEQ’s regulations rescinded, agencies have wide discretion, raising the potential for inconsistent standards and more litigation.

CEQ maintains that the reforms preserve NEPA’s core protections while bringing overdue modernization and efficiency to a process that had not been comprehensively revised in decades.",https://dallasexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trump_NEPA_permitting_reform-Canva.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 14:02:06.148184

Additionally, it secured a new financing arm to deliver crucial funding for large-scale projects. A growing demand for clean and green hydrogen has been evident in the global market, and by acquiring Ambient Fuels, Electric Hydrogen has positioned itself as a potential market leader in the hydrogen sector. Hydrogen remains the most viable and sustainable energy resource on the planet.

The deal represents a match made in hydrogen heaven

Electric Hydrogen is one of the world’s leading electrolyzer manufacturers, and Ambient Fuels was a global leader in hydrogen project development, so the acquisition by Electric Hydrogen could not have been set up better. It’s a marriage of two of the biggest players in the hydrogen game. The deal will strengthen the company’s ability to partner with customers on the co-development of hydrogen projects, as well as provide crucial funding where deemed necessary.

As part of the deal, Electric Hydrogen agreed to enter into a strategic relationship with Generate Capital, a former investor in Ambient Fuels and a leading infrastructure investment platform. The former CEO of Ambient Fuels praised the acquisition by Electric Hydrogen and underscored the growing demand for American-made products in the energy sector overall.

“We’re thrilled to join the Electric Hydrogen team. With this unique project finance capability from Generate Capital, our team is well positioned to support Electric Hydrogen customers who prefer to buy renewable hydrogen as a process input rather than building and operating their own renewable hydrogen plants. We believe this is a key ‘unlock’ for the nascent renewable hydrogen and renewable fuels industries that will help customers get to scale faster, enabled by Electric Hydrogen’s leading technology.” – Jacob Susman, former CEO of Ambient Fuels now leading project development at Electric Hydrogen

The acquisition opens up new avenues for exploration for Electric Hydrogen

It’s rare for a business acquisition to make this much sense. Electric Hydrogen made a masterful move by sealing the deal to purchase Ambient Fuels, which will now enable the company to diversify its portfolio as well as invest, originate, and develop new projects across the globe. The deal offers Electric Hydrogen up to $400 million in hydrogen project finance solutions that they can choose to allocate where they deem necessary.

Not to be left behind, Generate Capital also released a statement that underscores the importance of hydrogen financing across the globe.

“Generate Capital is determined to accelerate the transition to low-carbon molecules by offering leading project finance capabilities in close collaboration with skilled developers and innovative technologies. Working with Electric Hydrogen, we can help solve current finance and bankability challenges and reduce LCOH, enabling more hydrogen projects to reach Final Investment Decision.” – Scott Gosselink, Managing Director at Generate Capital

Lastly, and most crucially, Electric Hydrogen released a statement that outlines its perception of the acquisition.

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead, supported in part by the RED-III compliance framework in the E.U. and the 45V hydrogen production tax credit in the U.S. We believe this new integration will both enable the industry to scale faster and give Electric Hydrogen even more ways to serve our diverse array of customers. We’re excited to add this new capability with Ambient Fuels and Generate Capital.” – Raffi Garabedian, CEO and Co-founder of Electric Hydrogen

Shortly after, the U.S. Arctic Research Commission​, an independent federal agency, released ​a report ​o​n Arctic priorities that emphasized military​, community, economic and energy security.
That report will inform the forthcoming national Arctic research plan, which would steer science in the region for five years beginning in 2027.
It is “specifically aimed at national security,” Cheryl Rosa, the deputy director of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, said at a September meeting.
The National Science Foundation, a federal agency, has funded the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, for nearly 40 years.","The Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet and is one of the most rapidly changing places on Earth. And the United States’ approach to Arctic research has also begun shifting.

Instead of focusing largely on climate and environmental science, the Trump administration appears to be pivoting research efforts toward military and defense interests.

“It’s a radical shift,” said Michael Walsh, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “They frame everything through the lens of national security.”

President Trump showed his interest in the Arctic region within his first months back in office. He has said the U.S. would go “as far as we have to go” to control Greenland and announced intentions to order new icebreaker ships.

He has also issued executive orders to fast track oil and gas developments in Alaska and to “ensure the security and leadership of Arctic waterways.”

In May, a government committee took the unusual step of ​editing a Biden-era planning document to “align with the current administration’s policies.” The revised version no longer included the words “climate change,” a main focus of work there for decades. It also appeared to downgrade the value placed on research contributions from nearby Indigenous communities.

Shortly after, the U.S. Arctic Research Commission​, an independent federal agency, released ​a report ​o​n Arctic priorities that emphasized military​, community, economic and energy security. “The Arctic region is critical to the defense of our homeland, the protection of U.S. national sovereignty, and the fulfillment of our nation’s defense commitments,” one section reads.

That report will inform the forthcoming national Arctic research plan, which would steer science in the region for five years beginning in 2027. It is “specifically aimed at national security,” Cheryl Rosa, the deputy director of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, said at a September meeting.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

One of eight countries with territory in the Arctic, the U.S. has been a global leader in science in the region.

The National Science Foundation, a federal agency, has funded the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States, for nearly 40 years. The consortium is a nonprofit organization that has coordinated Arctic research among an international network of scientists.

But after the Trump administration began cutting National Science Foundation grants, the consortium opted not to compete for the scarce remaining dollars and shut down on Sept. 30. Audrey Taylor, who served as director of the consortium, described that decision as “agonizing.”

The consortium had built support for places like the Toolik Field Station in Alaska, which is America’s largest research outpost in the region. It provides scientists with transportation, equipment and lodging that make studying the remote region possible.

The United States has funded other large science centers and long term monitoring projects in the region, including the Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, which is one of four U.S. facilities that measure the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. President Trump’s proposed budget would close down the observatory and cancel the lease for the longest running greenhouse gas measurement facility, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

But even as the administration steps away from climate science, it acknowledges environmental upheaval in the region.

Polar research is one of the government’s top budget priorities for 2027, according to a recently released memo by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. It said the United States was affected by “rapidly changing conditions in the Arctic,” and that agencies should invest in research and development that “assures America’s uncontested navigation and strategic utilization of the Arctic.”

Sea ice, which in the past would block ships from passing through the region most of the year, has been declining for nearly a half-century as concentrations of greenhouse gases from the burning of oil and gas has heated the planet. In March, satellites observed the smallest amount of winter sea ice ever recorded.

As a result, commercial ships have begun taking shortcuts through the Arctic. Although the Biden administration emphasized the changing climate as a concern, both the Biden and Trump administrations have described the increasing navigability of Arctic waters as a security issue and emerging economic opportunity.

Polar ice on land and sea helps deflect the sun’s heat back into space. The disappearance of ice exacerbates warming and raises sea levels around the world.

At the same time, the frozen layer of soil that covers much of the Arctic, known as permafrost, is thawing. This releases more planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as methane, and causes the terrain to sink, collapse, and in some cases, explode.

“The Arctic is the proverbial ‘canary in the coal mine,’” said Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. “Let alone the impacts on the people who live there, what happens in the Arctic affects the rest of the world.”

Bonnie Scheele, an Inupiaq reindeer herder in Nome, Alaska, worked with U.S. scientists associated with the now-ended Arctic Research Consortium to track some of the environmental changes happening in the region that are disrupting her community’s traditional lifestyle and diet.

Ms. Scheele was “sad and frustrated” by the closure of the consortium and worried about a gap in Indigenous collaboration in research. Often, she said, knowledge built up over centuries by Indigenous cultures is used by outsiders without acknowledgment or benefit to Native communities. “But this was different,” she said. “That’s what made it so special.”

“Any research that’s related to the Arctic is going to impact us and we want to be part of it from the very beginning,” said Julie Raymond-Yakoubian, the director of the Social Science Program at Kawerak, a tribal consortia that represents 20 tribes in the region and worked closely with the Arctic Research Consortium. “We are part of the research community, we’re not just looking in at it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/02/science/00cli-ARCTIC-PRIORITIES/00cli-ARCTIC-PRIORITIES-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 12:06:49.510335

And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built.
Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade.
If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.
Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.","Nearly a century ago, George Norris, a great United States senator, made the case for electrifying rural America.

“These young men and young women, America’s farmers of the future, observing all the wonders of the modern age of electricity, will not be content with the homes of earlier America,” Norris wrote in his autobiography. “Unless those homes in the countrysides are lighted electrically and equipped with the devices electricity provides — for comfort, convenience and efficiency — they will not be content. They will have been trained in the colleges and universities of this country for the most efficient agricultural methods, and electricity will be a part of their lives.”

He understood that without modern infrastructure, Nebraska couldn’t keep its young people, modernize agriculture or grow its economy. Electricity was the thread connecting it all.

Today, the challenge is similar but bigger. Nebraska’s economic future is tied to powering the next generation of industries, many of which are rooted in agriculture. Gov. Jim Pillen’s “Silicon Valley of the bioeconomy” vision calls for transforming our crops into sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, bioplastics, fertilizer, enzymes and other high-value products. These facilities will create new markets for farmers, jobs in rural communities and a larger state tax base.

But they will also demand vast amounts of electricity. Without new generation, transmission and grid capacity, we can’t fully realize that vision. And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built. This tension is as urgent as the conflicts in our communities over building sufficient housing to address our housing shortages and rising costs.

Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade. In the last few years, demand projections have been revised upward annually. That’s from bioeconomy projects, information technology, advanced manufacturing and more. Our public power providers are planning and investing for growth. But local resistance to building energy projects can slow or stop development that is vital to meeting the state’s generation needs.

Here’s where the dots connect:

• Communities want rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization.

• The bioeconomy, which creates domestic markets for domestic producers, needs abundant energy to operate, as do the advanced manufacturing facilities that anchor employment bases.

• Building renewable projects, transmission lines, natural gas turbines and the nuclear tech of tomorrow unlock demand and create the rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization described above.

If the last dot is missing, the picture breaks apart. If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.

The benefits of welcoming energy development are real and visible across Nebraska.

Nebraska’s nameplate capacity tax on renewables generates millions of dollars each year for schools, roads and other public services. Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.

Construction and operational jobs inject new spending into the local economy, and, in many cases, towns with a local option sales tax see millions in new revenue from major projects. Look at northeast Nebraska, where inviting generation has led to a flywheel of growth and revitalization in cities like Norfolk.

The Nebraska Chamber works alongside our public utilities, private developers, local leaders and the agricultural community. We believe in an “all-of-the-above” energy approach — not just because it’s good policy, but because it’s the only realistic way to connect the dots between Nebraska’s growth ambitions and the infrastructure needed to support them.

George Norris fought to bring electricity to every corner of Nebraska, because he knew it would change the trajectory of rural life. In our time, the fight is to ensure we have enough generation to keep our state competitive, our communities strong and opportunities here at home.

We grow it here. We can process it here. But only if we power it here. It won’t be easy. These emotional discussions invoke our sense of place, conservation and unfortunately in some instances, partisanship. I believe we can work together, connect the dots and make Nebraska’s next century as bright as the last.

MIAMI, FL, UNITED STATES, October 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Atlas Renewable Energy (“Atlas”), the largest solar company in Latin America and a regional leader in clean energy solutions for corporate clients, has been recognized by LatinFinance with three prestigious awards that highlight the company’s ability to deliver excellence and innovation in renewable energy across Latin America. The company was named Project Sponsor of the Year, received the award for Renewable Energy Financing of the Year (Power) for the R$1.5 billion financing of the Luiz Carlos Solar Complex in Brazil, and was honored with Energy Storage Financing of the Year for the US$510 million financing of Estepa I & II in Chile.

The Project Sponsor of the Year recognition reflects Atlas’ unique position as one of the largest Independent Power Producers (IPP) in Latin America capable of consistently delivering complex projects through trusted partnerships with large companies that require financial ingenuity and operational excellence. Over the past year, Atlas not only executed two of the most significant renewable energy financings in the region but also set new benchmarks for how solar and storage projects can be structured and financed at scale.

“We are honored to receive this award from such a prestigious institution. I believe these awards are more than just recognition, they are also an illustration of Atlas’ role in leading the energy transition in Latin America,” said Carlos Barrera, CEO of Atlas Renewable Energy. “By structuring financings of this scale and complexity, we are not only expanding clean power generation but also pioneering innovative concepts and models, from hybrid solar-plus-storage projects in Chile to sustainable debenture structures in Brazil, in order to keep offering our clients compelling solutions. I want to thank our team for their steadfast dedication and our partners for their trust in our company.”

Coordinated by Itaú BBA for the construction of the Luiz Carlos photovoltaic complex, Atlas secured a R$1.5 billion financing, of which R$750 million came from incentivized debentures under the Brazilian Law 12.431/2011 certified as “Green Debentures” by Sustainable Fitch. The remaining R$720 million was obtained through commercial notes. The project will have an installed capacity of 787 MWp and is set to enter commercial operations in 2025. Luiz Carlos has two PPAs, one with Votorantim Cimentos and another with Arcelor Mittal.

Marking Atlas’ largest financing to date, the company worked with top-tier financial institutions, including BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, DNB Bank, Scotiabank Chile, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and the Bank of Nova Scotia to secure a US$510 million financing for the Estepa project in Chile. The project will be a hybrid system composed of a photovoltaic solar plant with an installed capacity of 215 MW and an estimated generation of 600 GWh per year.

About the Iowa Biodiesel Board","ANKENY, IOWA (October 3, 2025) — Iowa Biodiesel Board Executive Director Grant Kimberley testified at the US Environmental Protection Agency’s public hearing on “small refinery exemptions” under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). He thanked the agency for proposing high volumes of biomass-based diesel in the next Renewable Volume Obligations, while urging them to fully reallocate all waived gallons.

“I will say this as plainly as I can: the future of biodiesel markets — and the integrity of the Renewable Fuel Standard — depend on EPA following through on its responsibility to reallocate 100 percent of all small refinery exemptions,” Kimberley told EPA officials. “Anything less creates uncertainty, undermines the program and hurts the very people this policy was designed to support.”

Kimberley emphasized the toll that delays have taken on producers and rural communities.

“Iowa is home to several independent biodiesel producers, and I want you to understand that they have been brought to their knees this year. Times are hard and the clock is ticking for a recovery of this American energy industry. These delays don’t just show up on paper — they translate into real losses for farmers, fuel producers, and rural economies across Iowa and the nation. It’s imperative EPA act before it’s too late.”

He outlined three priorities for the agency in his comments:

Honoring the promise: “The president pledged that no gallons waived would go unaccounted for. The draft rule falls short of that promise by even entertaining the idea of partial or zero reallocation. EPA must keep that commitment.”

Protecting program integrity: “The RFS only works if it is whole. Failing to reallocate 100 percent of waived gallons erodes confidence in the system and signals to investors and producers that federal energy policy can’t be trusted.”

Safeguarding rural economies: “Producers and farmers cannot shoulder another backdoor cut in demand — especially at a time when market certainty is desperately needed.”

“Full reallocation of all refinery exemptions is the only path forward that honors commitments, protects the integrity of the RFS, and sustains biodiesel’s role in America’s energy and agricultural economy,” Kimberley concluded.

“The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.” The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company.
There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.
The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future.
""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.

(Nasdaq: CETY) (the “Company” or “CETY”), a clean energy technology company delivering complete lifecycle solutions & technologies in power generation, storage, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power, announced today that its Clean Cycle II™ Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology has been deployed in Martin, Tennessee. The project, led by RPG Energy Group, was one of the most challenging — and rewarding — projects in its history: designing and delivering a waste heat recapture system using ORC technology for a Fortune 100 company. The project is one of the first of its kind in U.S. industrial manufacturing and sets a new benchmark for efficiency and corporate stewardship.

In today’s industrial landscape, corporations face relentless pressure to protect margins, reduce operating costs, and achieve environmental goals. One of the most overlooked threats to profitability is also one of the least visible: energy inefficiency. By bringing CETY’s technology to life in Martin, RPG proved that U.S. manufacturers can tackle these inefficiencies head-on and generate measurable returns.

Manufacturing plants release vast amounts of waste heat into the environment every day. For this Fortune 100 company , a recognized global leader in efficiency and sustainability, leaving that energy untapped was unacceptable. By working with CETY and RPG, they turned that liability into an opportunity — transforming waste heat into clean, usable electricity.

“The Martin project sets an example for industrial America. Waste heat recovery is complex, but it is achievable with the right partners, technology, and vision. RPG Energy Group is proud to have led this effort alongside CETY, paving the way for more projects that merge profitability, resilience, and sustainability,” said Jami Krynski, CEO of RPG.

“This installation demonstrates how industrial manufacturers can turn an untapped liability into a strategic advantage,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Our ORC solution not only reduces energy costs but also advances sustainability commitments — and it does so in a way that is replicable across industrial America.”

Partnership with RPG Energy Group

CETY partnered with RPG Energy Group to integrate the ORC system. RPG provided project development and integration support, guiding the process from feasibility through delivery. Together, the companies overcame the integration challenges that have historically slowed ORC adoption in the U.S.

“We value RPG’s role in bringing their expertise in development and integration,” Mahdi added. “This project reflects the strength of our combined efforts and the importance of collaboration in advancing clean energy solutions.”

Baxter plant.
If the risk at Alton Baker Park really is low, conducting some soil testing there should cost just a fraction of that.","How much would you pay for peace of mind?

It’s a question worth asking after Lookout Eugene-Springfield reported that 1,400 gallons of J.H. Baxter & Co.’s hazardous wood-preserving chemicals were buried in a long-defunct landfill beneath Alton Baker Park more than 50 years ago.

The J.H. Baxter plant in west Eugene produced railroad ties, telephone poles and other specialized wood products for eight decades. But years of investigations revealed that toxic chemicals from the plant had seeped into the soil of some nearby residents’ yards, possibly contributing to elevated cancer levels in the neighborhood.

State and federal environmental officials spent time in 2021 and 2022 collecting those soil samples from dozens of yards just north of the J.H. Baxter plant. In July, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared the plant a Superfund site.

When Lookout asked about toxic chemicals buried at the former Day Island Landfill beneath the eastern portion of Alton Baker Park, neither the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality nor Lane County showed much interest in assuring the public that efforts to seal landfill waste from seeping into soil there have held up. That’s despite the fact that thousands of park visitors and trail runners traverse the iconic grounds each year.

The state and county should reconsider their stance. DEQ previously studied the landfill and found evidence of the same toxic chemical that triggered the Superfund designation, but concluded the risk to the public was low.

That testing was conducted all the way back in 1992.

We hope state and county officials are right that the cover of soil and vegetation between the landfill waste and surface has held up over the past 50 years. And to be clear, there’s no evidence presented to date that anyone visiting the park, running along Pre’s Trail or exploring the park’s natural area has experienced negative health effects.

But unlike the homes near the J.H. Baxter plant, where residents reported concerns for years, it’s trickier to pinpoint the risk in public spaces like parks, where far more people spend far shorter amounts of time. And while landfill coverings typically include a tarp-like impermeable liner in addition to soil and vegetation, no such liner is documented in assessments of the Day Island Landfill.

The redevelopment of former landfills into city parks is hardly unique across the United States, including in Eugene. Portions of Tugman Park in south Eugene were developed in the 1990s above a former municipal burning dump, with DEQ’s oversight.

But in numerous cases across the country, like in Berkeley, California, environmental researchers have found harmful chemicals in soil or water decades after landfills were redeveloped into parks. In César Chávez Park along Berkeley’s waterfront, elevated levels of radium were discovered in 2023, 30 years after it was converted from a landfill to a city park.

The Day Island Landfill was covered during an era of far less stringent environmental regulation than today. And research methodologies have evolved in the 30 years since soil was last tested there.

We think the state bears primary responsibility for conducting additional soil testing at the park. But even if DEQ will not step up, Lane County can. Lane County Public Health reports to the Board of County Commissioners. We call on the board to make its own determination. First priority: Convince the state to test soil above the landfill. And if the state won’t play ball, the county should explore other options, including paying for the tests itself, or splitting the costs with the state.

Officials are reluctant to estimate costs for testing the former landfill. DEQ says one or two tests likely wouldn’t be adequate to get updated information on possible threats.

We know testing isn’t cheap and government budgets are tight. But DEQ has spent nearly $3 million on cleanup work related to the J.H. Baxter plant. If the risk at Alton Baker Park really is low, conducting some soil testing there should cost just a fraction of that.

And it would be a small price to pay for peace of mind.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DJI_20250820113452_0008_D-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1440&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-04 14:01:49.417395

The U.S. Energy Information Administration says American electric consumption this year and in 2026 will exceed the record for usage reached last year.

Until 2024, the electric market essentially had been flat for most of this decade and at a very low point in 2020.

The demand for electricity during the first two decades existed. But consumption levels were offset by efficiency improvements and other structural changes in the economy.

Those changes included a shift away from traditional manufacturing in the United States – and other developed countries – to service industries. And those industries tend to use less power than manufacturing.

Now, the federal government is projecting growth of 1.7 percent through next year.

This forecasted upsurge is attributed primarily to commercial and industrial sector growth.

For instance, commercial growth is projected to increase by 2.6 percent, while the industrial sector should increase 2.1 percent.

Forecasts involving the residential sector are lower. Usage there will depend on weather changes. Nevertheless, residential usage still is expected to increase 0.7 percent through next year.

Much of the recent and forecasted growth, the Energy Information Administration says, comes from the commercial sector in the form of building and expanding of data centers and in the industrial sector through the expansion of manufacturing establishments.

While this is good news, one of the big remaining questions is the supply of electricity. And certainly, central to that is reliability.

The administration in Washington is making efforts to develop or rebuild American manufacturing, and here at home we are trying to develop data centers, as well as attracting more manufacturing plants.

Vast increases for demand will spur greater efforts at developing the electric grids that carry the power to various locations.

The administration’s goal is to seek energy independence for the United States.

This is an important step forward for the nation and one that will not be achieved without some strong efforts on behalf of both government and private sector companies.

The deal, which could fetch up to 2 billion reais ($374 million) according to one of the sources, has drawn interest from other bidders, they added. One of the sources noted that the asset sale, coordinated by Bank of America, is still in its early stages and J&F has not yet made a binding offer.

The negotiations are part of a wave of dealmaking in Brazil’s power sector this year, which could soon include big deals from players including Canada’s Brookfield and France’s Engie, people familiar with the matter said.

Asked about talks to sell its Norte Fluminense plant, EDF said it is weighing IPOs of its North American and Brazilian subsidiaries as part of a 10-year global plan to boost the growth of its portfolio and long-term investment capacity.

J&F and Bank of America declined to comment.

FRENCH UTILITY REFOCUSES ON DOMESTIC NUCLEAR

As part of a strategic overhaul, EDF is weighing options for its Brazilian assets while reducing its overseas presence and divesting non-core assets to refocus on domestic nuclear projects.

The natural gas-fired plant is operating without long-term contracts from buyers, making it attractive to J&F, which often seeks underperforming assets for turnaround, a source said. J&F’s power company Ambar Energia has other plants without long-term contracts in its portfolio.

J&F, which also owns meatpacker JBS , has expanded its reach in the energy sector through its subsidiary Ambar Energia.

The holding company separately made an offer this week to buy Roraima Energia, a power distribution company in the northern Brazilian state owned by the Oliveira Energia group.

Last year, J&F signed a preliminary agreement with Oliveira Energia to take control of the power distribution company in Amazonas, but the deal has yet to be finalized.",https://brazilenergyinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/edf-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 11:00:35.132633

""Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost.
I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: Get out there now.""
Since the program began in 2023, it has helped take more than 2,700 gas-guzzling vehicles off the roads, according to Denver7.
In addition to the environmental and public-health benefits of EVs, electric vehicles can also save drivers thousands of dollars per year on fuel costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.","With federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles having expired Sept. 30, officials in Colorado have stepped in to fill the gap by increasing state rebates for EVs, according to Denver7, a local ABC affiliate.

""The market has made it clear, EVs are here to stay,"" said Jared Polis, the Colorado governor, according to Denver7. ""Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost. I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: Get out there now.""

Under the revised program, Colorado residents making up to 80% of the area's median income will be able to get a rebate of up to $9,000 for a new EV and $6,000 for a used EV when they trade in an older, gasoline-powered vehicle. These figures represent an increase from the previous rebates of $6,000 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one, Denver7 reported.

The increased rebates were aimed at continuing the forward momentum of EV sales in the state after a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs ended Sept. 30.

Even when charged off an average U.S. electrical grid, EVs are responsible for far less planet-heating pollution per mile than cars and trucks powered by internal-combustion engines.

""For light duty vehicles in the U.S., we see roughly 60 to 68% lower emissions from electric vehicles versus gas powered vehicles,"" explained Ed Piersa, an employee for the state energy office, according to Denver7.

While the existing rebate program had room in its budget to provide the higher rebates to lower-income Coloradans, there was not enough money to apply those higher figures to all Colorado residents.

""We don't have the financial ability to just replace those federal tax credits,"" said Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, according to Denver7.

Still, officials hope that increasing the rebates for at least some Coloradans will help the state continue to make progress on replacing gas-powered vehicles with cleaner EVs.

Since the program began in 2023, it has helped take more than 2,700 gas-guzzling vehicles off the roads, according to Denver7.

In addition to being responsible for significantly less heat-trapping pollution per mile than gas-powered cars, EVs also do not emit dangerous substances like particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide during operation, according to the California Air Resources Board.

""Health effects from vehicle pollution can include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as increased risk of cancer,"" warned the Air Resources Board's website.

In addition to the environmental and public-health benefits of EVs, electric vehicles can also save drivers thousands of dollars per year on fuel costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

To push the environmental, public-health, and cost-saving benefits of driving an EV even further, you can install solar panels on your home. Home solar systems can drop your electricity bill to practically zero while powering all of your electric appliances, including an EV charging station, with cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.
A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, is the chair of SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project.","Families and business owners across America deserve the opportunity to grow and thrive. Yet, I keep hearing the same concern: Rising energy costs are squeezing budgets and forcing impossible choices. In Tampa just this summer, residents saw a $50 jump in their monthly electric bill due to rising temperatures and other extreme weather. They’re not alone. According to recent data, three in four Americans are concerned about utility bills rising this year, with most saying they feel powerless to do anything about it.

The facts back up the concerns. Across the country, families are watching their electricity bills rise and wondering how they can skimp on groceries and other necessities to scrape by. Small manufacturers are struggling to stay competitive as energy costs eat into their margins. Farmers watch as economic tools that would have allowed them to keep operations in their family are ripped out of their hands.

On top of all this, new federal policies are pulling us in the wrong direction. Just look at North Carolina, where the administration has ripped away federal funds from organizations that would have lowered household bills through low-cost solar.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can build a thriving and sustainable economy that empowers working people — not high-dollar political donors. And to do so, we need only look to states and communities that are already building these solutions. While we need to think big, we also have the tools we need to build a better future right in front of us.

That’s why I’m proud that we are coming together to launch SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project, a comprehensive initiative to develop real solutions for the economic challenges facing American families and businesses due to rising energy costs, increasing global economic competition and growing climate disasters.

Right here in the Sunshine State, I see proof that clean energy is key to our next economic boom. Clean investments made possible by expiring federal tax credits have attracted more than $12 billion in investment, leading to more than 12,000 new jobs. Despite headwinds, over 90% of capacity added to our nation’s grid in the past year has been clean energy that can help families save money, create jobs and meet growing demand. This is proof that when we invest in clean, reliable energy infrastructure, we create economic opportunity.

The Thriving Economy Project will focus on four key areas where we can make real progress: helping communities and rural economies flourish, securing an affordable-energy future, developing innovative financing solutions and building government systems that deliver results. This isn’t about imposing solutions from the top down. It’s about finding what’s already working in communities across America — and finding ways to scale it.

This project will spend the next year listening to communities nationwide to see what’s working and what’s not. We’ll bring together farmers and manufacturers, small business owners and labor leaders, mayors and governors, CEOs and policy experts, researchers and community activists. We’ll look at successful models from red states and blue states, rural areas and urban centers, because good ideas don’t have a party label. The goal is to develop a practical roadmap that Congress, states and local communities can use to create more jobs, lower energy costs, foster American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, and build stronger, more resilient local economies.

This project is about building an economy where a small business owner doesn’t have to choose between paying her electric bill and giving her employees a raise, where a manufacturing worker in Michigan can be confident that his job will still exist in 10 years, where a farmer in Iowa can invest in new technology knowing it will pay off for his operations and his community.

American communities already are writing the playbook for 21st-century prosperity. With the Thriving Economy Project, our job is to make sure everyone has access to those tools and opportunities. The communities leading this charge have shown us what’s possible. Now it’s time to make it inevitable.

Washington’s push to cut greenhouse gas emissions, expand electric vehicles and grow a clean-energy economy faces new hurdles as the Trump administration rolls back federal climate policies — changes state officials warn could slow progress and jeopardize billions in planned investments.

Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said the federal government is “attacking the science” that underpins decades of climate action and weakening the state’s ability to meet ambitious targets. Those federal efforts include proposals to overturn the EPA’s 2009 greenhouse gas “endangerment finding,” a legal determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and cutting off tax credits and infrastructure funds for electric vehicles, solar and wind projects.

“The administration has decided that they’re going to attack the science,” Sixkiller told Austin Jenkins on TVW’s “Inside Olympia.”

“They’re going to undermine decades’ worth of established science and understanding about the way in which fossil fuels are altering our environment,” he said. “And what I continue to remind folks is, you know, you can erase the science, but you can’t erase what people are experiencing.”

Sixkiller said state-level initiatives such as the Climate Commitment Act, the creation of a joint carbon market with California and a plan to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars will continue. “We have no other choice but to continue to move the work forward — to decarbonize our economy and unblock the opportunity that comes with that,” he said.

The state is also responding to the end of federal EV incentives. As $7,500 rebates for electric vehicle purchases expired in September under a Trump-backed budget bill, Gov. Bob Ferguson and Ecology launched “ZEVergreen,” an initiative to explore new tools and policies to keep EV adoption on track. The program will convene utilities, automakers, community groups and industry leaders to design potential state-level incentives, especially for low-income buyers, and to accelerate EV infrastructure investments.

Critics say Washington’s climate policies raise gas prices while delivering too few environmental gains. The Seattle Times editorial board argues less than 14% of carbon auction revenue directly reduces emissions.

The Washington Policy Center, state Sen. Nikki Torres and Rep. Mary Dye sued the departments of Ecology and Commerce this month, alleging they missed a reporting deadline and failed to release 2022 and 2023 emissions data, limiting lawmakers’ and the public’s ability to assess climate progress.

Sixkiller acknowledged that regulatory costs are real but said the alternative — continued reliance on fossil fuels — is worse. “There’s also a cost to the ongoing use of petroleum, and that’s real,” he said. He added that revenue from the Climate Commitment Act is already funding heat pumps, EV access and community resilience projects.

“We can fight climate change, protect natural resources, and restore Puget Sound — and still grow the economy,” Sixkiller said. “Washington has a long history of proving those aren’t competing goals.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47634/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anacortes-refinery-1024x5071759575926.jpg?h=f7061928&itok=liQyjSkz,N,,2025-10-04 08:04:04.265384

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.
A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody … we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she’s confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

This is the 182nd in the ‘China Chronicles’ series.

Washington’s new “foreign entity of concern” rules and CATL’s designation as a “Chinese military company” highlight how US efforts to secure EV supply chains are reshaping clean energy, industrial policy, and geopolitics.

The United States (US)–China rivalry has now moved beyond tariffs and chip bans to critical raw materials (CRMs) that power electric vehicles (EVs), grid storage, and defence industries, turning supply chains into geopolitical terrain.

At the heart of this is lithium batteries, essential for decarbonisation, energy storage, and military technologies. Among battery chemistries, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) has gained prominence for its lower cost and safety, making lithium a strategic lever, rather than a mere commodity. Control over lithium refining and LFP technology will dictate how quickly and affordably the world electrifies.

Moreover, since battery-grade refining and materials determine EV costs and deployment timelines, and with the International Energy Agency (IEA) warning of potential lithium tightness as electrification accelerates, the stakes are exceptionally high. Consequently, for the US, securing these supply chains is about more than industrial growth; it is about energy independence and strategic advantage.

In this context, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world’s leading EV battery maker with roughly 38 percent market share, now stands squarely in this crossfire. The Pentagon recently labelled CATL a “Chinese military company”, underscoring how geopolitics is reshaping clean-energy supply chains as Washington walls off sensitive links while sustaining EV momentum. This brief, therefore, examines CATL’s designation and its implications for the company’s US expansion.

US Dependence on Chinese Minerals

China dominates the midstream refining and processing, where prices, quality, and timelines are set, giving it leverage over the US. In batteries, China controls roughly 70–95 percent of global lithium, cobalt, phosphate, and graphite processing capacity, directly shaping availability and costs for battery-grade materials. This includes nearly 80 percent of LFP, two-thirds of nickel-based cathodes, and over 90 percent of graphite anodes, creating single-point sensitivity that turns policy shifts into project delays.

In contrast, the US has limited domestic refining, leaving it heavily reliant on imported battery-grade lithium, graphite, and other critical inputs. To address this, new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules aim to reduce strategic exposure to Chinese supply chains.

Rare earths follow a similar pattern, with most refining concentrated in China, reinforcing systemic dependence across motors and advanced electronics. In contrast, the US has limited domestic refining, leaving it heavily reliant on imported battery-grade lithium, graphite, and other critical inputs. To address this, new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules aim to reduce strategic exposure to Chinese supply chains.

China has also begun using its dominance as leverage. Recent export licensing requirements on rare earths signalled Beijing’s willingness to weaponise minerals, turning EV supply chains from an industrial challenge into a national security concern.

The tables below outline China’s recent policy actions and the extent of US dependence on these CRMs.

CATL’s Position and US Listing

CATL has expanded rapidly across Europe and Asia, supplying major automakers and building large-scale projects in Germany, Hungary, and Indonesia to diversify its market base.

The US Department of Defense (now renamed the Department of War) added CATL to its list of “Chinese military companies,” citing concerns over China’s military-civil fusion strategy. CATL dismissed the designation as “mistaken” and politically motivated.

However, on 7 January 2025, the US Department of Defense (now renamed the Department of War) added CATL to its list of “Chinese military companies,” citing concerns over China’s military-civil fusion strategy. CATL dismissed the designation as “mistaken” and politically motivated.

While the label does not impose a flat ban, it acts as a strong deterrent. It limits defence procurement, triggers heightened scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and discourages US automakers from deepening partnerships. Political backlash is already visible, as Virginia withdrew support for a planned Ford–CATL battery plant in 2023 after national-security concerns mounted, signalling the headwinds CATL faces in the US.

Impact on US Market Entry

The designation has made direct ownership of US facilities politically untenable. CATL is now limited to arm’s-length licensing deals, such as the Ford Michigan LFP plant, where Ford owns the facility while CATL supplies the technology, equipment, and know-how. This structure avoids triggering FEOC rules and preserves tax credit eligibility by keeping governance and supply chains separated.

However, these arrangements still face high compliance checks, political pushback, and constant reputational scrutiny, which slows timelines and raises costs. Consequently, CATL is likely to prioritise Europe, Southeast Asia, or even Canada and South America for new capacity, supplying the US indirectly while sidestepping its volatile regulatory environment.

CATL is now limited to arm’s-length licensing deals, such as the Ford Michigan LFP plant, where Ford owns the facility while CATL supplies the technology, equipment, and know-how.

FEOC Rule as the Choke Point

FEOC status is triggered when a covered nation holds 25 percent or more of board seats, voting rights, equity, or effective control through licenses or contracts. These rules form the strongest barrier to Chinese involvement in US clean energy supply chains.

Starting in 2024, EV tax credits are denied for vehicles containing battery components from Chinese-controlled entities. In 2025, the restriction expands to critical minerals such as lithium and graphite.

For US automakers, this means proving that no part of their supply chain is under FEOC control to claim tax credits and pass Department of Energy and Internal Revenue Service review, a daunting task given China’s dominance in midstream processing.

Licensing models like Ford’s can technically proceed: they must be governed by strict legal and operational separation, making every CATL-linked project costly, complex, and politically sensitive.

Strategic Path Forward

CATL’s listing does not ban the company outright, but limits it to indirect engagement rather than direct ownership of US plants. Its strategy now centres on licensing technology and manufacturing intellectual property (IP), expanding in lower-risk regions like Europe and Southeast Asia, and tightening control over upstream lithium and graphite supplies to maintain pricing power.

The US strategy, in turn, hinges on scaling domestic refining to reduce dependence on Chinese inputs and building friend-shored supply chains with allies like Canada and Australia. FEOC rules remain central to enforcing clean governance separation while keeping EVs affordable.

Without rapid midstream development in North America, these policies will slow China’s influence but fall short of delivering true supply chain independence.

It is the second major round of clean energy project cancellations in the Trump administration.
At the time, the Carbon Capture Coalition called this a “major step backward” and argued that withdrawing support undermines certainty for businesses.

Hydrogen hubs, direct air capture megaprojects and grid resilience programmes are among the 223 projects affected, with several awardees already weighing appeals.

Trade groups and state leaders say the decision risks undermining investment confidence just as electricity demand surges from data centres and artificial intelligence.

“Pulling back promised funding jeopardises jobs and local investment while weakening American competitiveness,” said Ben Rubin, Executive Director of the Carbon Business Council.

Environmental advocacy group the Natural Resources Defense Council described the cancellations as a blow to innovation and consumer costs, while governors in California and Washington condemned the move as partisan.

What does the DOE say?

The administration defended the move on the grounds of fiscal discipline.

The decision was first announced on Wednesday by Russ Vought, Director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, who called the grants “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” in a post on X.

DOE Secretary Chris Wright justified the cuts by arguing that “many [were] rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation delivers on that commitment.”

Who is impacted by the cuts?

According to Politico’s E&E News, the cuts impact two major hydrogen hub projects led by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, nearly half of the direct air capture (DAC) hub grants, and other smaller projects.

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association – a coalition of public and private groups in Washington, Oregon, and Montana – will have its $1bn funding cut. Similarly, the ARCHES hydrogen hub in California will not receive $1.2bn previously earmarked for the project.

“While we are disappointed in the DOE’s decision to cut funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub there is still immense opportunity for our region to finish what we started – establishing a national benchmark for hydrogen production that brings economic opportunities to communities across the region,” the association said.

At least 10 of 21 planned DAC megaprojects are understood to be affected, while other companies including Plug Power and GE Vernova also appear on the list of cancelled awards. Neither company has yet issued a public response.

The cuts also include 26 grants under the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships programme, which is aimed at boosting the resilience of the electric grid.

Political reaction and next steps

The political response has been angry in places. Washington Governor Bob Ferguson said, “It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington.”

California Governor Gavin Newsom said, “In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” while Senator Patty Murray described the cancellations as a “blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

No award figures or project details for the cancellation have yet been made available. However, the cuts almost exclusively impact states run by Democrats.

It is the second major round of clean energy project cancellations in the Trump administration. In May, the DOE announced it would cancel 24 projects, many of them carbon capture-related. At the time, the Carbon Capture Coalition called this a “major step backward” and argued that withdrawing support undermines certainty for businesses.

Award recipients have 30 days to appeal a termination decision and some of the projects included in the announcement have already begun that process.

There could even be legal implications. According to the Colorado Energy Office, it had not yet received official notification despite being named on the cancellation list – a sign of the confusion surrounding the process.

With lawsuits likely from states and developers holding signed agreements, the fate of many projects remains uncertain. For now, the cancellations deepen questions over whether the US can provide the policy stability needed to sustain investment in hydrogen, carbon capture and other clean energy technologies over the next few years in particular.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/10/shutterstock_1418358686.jpg",N,,2025-10-04 08:03:36.342765

By contrast, solar farms and wind turbines are scattered, which makes them harder to hit, and relatively simple to fix.
“New fossil fuel infrastructure is very vulnerable now—it’s just a waste of money.
These industry groups share a history of opposing climate policy in California, including the state’s climate plan, climate disclosure laws, and transport regulations.
“For over 50 years, the U.S. government has knowingly endangered our lives by driving the fossil fuel system that is destroying our climate.","As I write this, the Orsknefteorgsintez refinery in Orsk, Russia is ablaze. It sits 1,400 kilometers from the border with Ukraine—in fact, along the border with Kazakhstan. The refinery has a capacity of 6.6 million tons of oil yearly, and among other things it’s one of two refineries capable of producing the jet fuel used by the country’s strategic bombers.

The best reason for nations to switch to power from the sun and wind is that it will reduce, by some degree, the severity of the climate crisis (and save millions of lives lost each year to pollution). The second best reason is that it’s cheaper than fossil fuel, and any nation who doesn’t shift will be stuck with an economy running on expensive energy. But it seems to me—not a military analyst, but a fairly good tea-leaves reader—that the war in Ukraine may be adding a third to the list: its comparative invulnerability to attack.

As the world has begun to figure out, something important has happened amidst the carnage of Russia’s immoral invasion: warfare has changed forever, with the small drone quickly replacing much of the military hardware we grew accustomed to in the 20th century. Drones have been ubiquitous along the front lines, where the no-man’s zone between the armies is lethally patrolled by squadrons of drones able to take out tanks, troop transports, and pretty much anything else—that explains much of the stasis of the last two years; the competing forces are largely pinned down.

The Russians, of course, have also been using drones to attack civilian assets—every night a new sortie, mixed in with missiles, seems to take out kindergartens, hospitals, and old folks homes. An early target was Ukraine’s energy sources, in an effort to freeze the fight out of the nation. (Currently the Russians seem to be playing dangerous games with the offline nuclear power plants not far from the front lines). But as we head into yet another war of winter, Ukraine hangs on—and more than hangs on.

Over the course of the war, by sheer necessity, Ukraine has developed a formidable drone industry, and increasingly it is using them against a singular set of targets: the oil refining and transport infrastructure spread out across its sprawling foe. Russia has formidable air defenses, of course—Ukraine couldn’t fly a bomber across 1,400 kilometers of the country’s airspace to bomb a refinery. But the small and comparatively slow drones have proved equal to the task. As the FT reported last week,

Sixteen of Russia’s 38 refineries have been hit since the start of August, some of them multiple times, including one of Russia’s largest fuel-processing facilities, the 340,000 barrel-a-day plant at Ryazan, close to Moscow.

The strikes have disrupted more than 1 million barrels a day of Russia’s refining capacity, according to Energy Aspects, a research group. Diesel exports, if they maintain the current rate, will fall to the lowest monthly total in September since 2020, according to both OilX and Vortexa, which track cargoes.

“It seems to be the most effective campaign that Ukraine has carried out so far,” said Benedict George, head of European petroleum products pricing at Argus, which reports commodity prices.

It’s not just export cargoes that are affected. Russia itself—one of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers—has begun to run short of gasoline for its own motorists. According to Victoria Veselova, in Crimea, for instance, drivers are

experiencing an unprecedented fuel crisis. Local gas stations have run out of gasoline. Local Russian authorities admit that the reason for this is a decline in oil refining volumes in Russia. This was caused by regular drone attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian oil refineries. Crimea.Realities explains how Crimeans are coping without fuel and what to expect.

The first fuel problems in Crimea appeared in mid-August. The popular AI-95 gasoline disappeared from local gas stations. The price of gasoline of all grades also rose sharply. Many Crimean drivers switched to cheaper AI-92 gasoline, damaging their cars.

The Russian head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, promised that the situation would improve by the end of September, when the rush associated with the holiday season had subsided. However, by that time, the problem had not only persisted but had worsened: in September, fuel completely disappeared from Crimean gas stations.

It’s also affecting the mobility of the Russian military, according to reporting in the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine’s Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Sept. 25 that Kyiv’s strikes on Russia’s oil sector have severely disrupted fuel supplies and logistics for Moscow’s armed forces.

“This is a fuel crisis in Russia, which directly affects logistics and the supply of its army,” Syrskyi said at a meeting with journalists attended by the Kyiv Independent.

The general lesson to be drawn from this, it seems to me, is that centralized and complex energy facilities are now sitting ducks for drone attack, and that that will certainly alter military calculations going forward. A refinery, for instance, is one of the most complicated machines humanity has ever constructed, often covering hundreds of acres. It’s filled with highly complex equipment and highly flammable hydrocarbons; hit one corner with a drone and the flames and the damage are likely to spread quickly. Not far behind—as Ukraine has learned to its sadness—are coal and gas-fired power plants—expensive infrastructure that can take months or years to rebuild as your citizens shiver.

By contrast, solar farms and wind turbines are scattered, which makes them harder to hit, and relatively simple to fix. Silicon doesn’t explode when it’s hit: a drone may take out some panels, but they are easy to switch out for new ones. And individual rooftop installations are too small to be systematically attacked. That’s why there’s been a huge boom in small-scale solar across Ukraine. As Michael Shank and Konstantyn Krynytskyi reported in Fast Company earlier this summer

Communities across Ukraine are becoming energy secure and energy independent: adding solar power stations to schools, hospitals, and homes; backing up that solar with battery storage capacity; and switching to more energy efficient heating and cooling with heat pumps and insulation. This is happening across Ukraine in response to the war and the years of large-scale attacks on power grids and energy infrastructure, which Russia continues to this day.

Cities and communities across Ukraine—from Kyiv and Horenka to Rivne and Zviahel to Lviv and Sheptytskyi—are scaling up this energy-secure trifecta wherever possible. And it’s paying off both in energy independence and economic savings; in many cases, these critical upgrades are cutting annual energy bills in half or more.

Hospitals have become the natural first stop for these kinds of upgrades since attacks to power grids and resulting blackouts jeopardize medical safety and medical procedures. The advanced Unbroken medical facility in Lviv, for example, which treats many of the veterans and victims of the war, is rapidly covering its many roofs with solar power and filling its basements with batteries so that its patients are protected from further energy insecurity and instability during surgery or recovery processes.

School facilities have become a second stop for upgrades since their energy footprint is both substantial and switchable—meaning there’s usually ample roof space for a quick solar retrofit. Since schools also come with a sizable building footprint, they’re often utilized as bomb shelters for the community, which makes the energy secure retrofit even more essential and life-saving.

Multifamily housing units—e.g., homeowners associations (HOAs) in bigger cities like Kyiv and dormitories in cities like Zviahel for internally displaced persons from the war—have also become easy retrofits, transforming roofs into solar stations, backyards into heat pump housing, and basements into battery storage facilities.

These HOA retrofits have been so successful at the local level, the national association of homeowners may soon become the organizing mechanism for more of these whole-system energy security retrofits, coordinating a national campaign across the country.

As it happens, I got to spend some time this week with Svitlana Romanko, a dear friend and colleague. Before the war began she was a stalwart of the global climate movement, deeply engaged with the Laudato Si movement (that’s why we were together in Rome for the meetings with the pope I described a few days ago). But when her country was attacked she became one of its fiercest defenders, mobilizing international campaigns to cut off Russia’s oil and gas exports and at home working to insure that a postwar Ukraine will be rebuilt as a green energy power. Her Razom We Stand nonprofit has been indomitable and incorruptible—they joined in the campaign to limit American LNG exports as well as Russian.

Anyway, Romanko and I sat in a noisy Italian cafeteria yesterday and talked through the possibilities. She says the Ukrainian government has been lagging behind civil society and small scale enterprises in building out renewables, but that city governments are starting to fill the gap.

“New fossil fuel infrastructure is very vulnerable now—it’s just a waste of money. By contrast, it’s very hard to destroy these small power plants and the energy they provide is cheap.” But she had another point to make: there are tens of thousands of Ukrainians who are suddenly engaged producing drones for the country’s war effort. That means they are quickly becoming skilled at working with electric motors, cooling fans, wiring—all the things necessary to deploy clean energy, heat pumps, and the like in the aftermath of the war. “The technology we’ve been able to develop will definitely be transitioned to renewable energy. If we could make one dream right now, what we would like to see happening—we need some jobs. And these are the people skills that are becoming available. And the role of women will be crucial—they’ve started learning the skills that they’ve never had before. And our veterans who will come home, hopefully with a win from the battlefield, they will have to repurpose. In Ukraine, the war eliminated 6.5 million jobs, but now we will be able to 4.5 million green jobs can be easily created—in electricity, water supply, education and skills-gaining, and construction. This is all in our hands. But first we need to defeat Putin.”

Romanko has never wavered from her pre-war convictions: “Morally it’s not acceptable for us to receive energy from the dirty forms of power,” she said. But now she and her fellow Ukrainians have added a new argument to the fight for clean energy around the world, one that may move people with a less-developed ethical code.

+A new study finds that even modest rises in sea level will endanger tens of millions of homes across the global south

Previous research has estimated that 0.7–0.9 m global mean SLR is likely to occur by 2100, and 2.2–2.5 m by 2300, if the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met24. This magnitude of LSLR across coastlines in the study area alone would inundate on the order of 5 million existing buildings at high tide by the end of this century

+In a follow up to my last dispatch, happy to report that MAGA was melting down over Pope Leo’s endorsement of Laudato Si and the climate fight

Matt Walsh - who describes himself as a “theocratic fascist” on his X profile with 3.2 million followers - said, “The leader of the Catholic Church shouldn’t be anywhere near this nonsense.”

He accused the Pope of joining “communist hippy freaks in some kind of weird pagan Earth-worshipping hippy ritual.” In this case, the communist hippy freaks included…GOP California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

+The ever-vigilant Antonia Juhasz has an excellent report on the machinations behind the plan to build a big new LNG pipeline in Alaska

Trump has set his sights on Alaska as a test case for his disastrous “National Energy Dominance” agenda. He wants to double oil production in the state, open up vast new tracts of land to exploitation, kneecap renewable energy, and push construction of what would be one of the largest and most expensive fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the nation. The project includes a massive 800-mile-long gas pipeline stretching from one end of Alaska to the other and a mammoth new export facility to ship gas out of the U.S. to Asia, with an estimated total price tag of over $70 billion.

Last month, I met people across Alaska organizing to resist Trump’s plans. They are pushing back against an agenda they see as catastrophically harmful to their pocketbooks, their way of life, and even their existence. They characterize Trump’s fossil-fueled ambitions as more of a retrograde political ploy than a genuine effort to benefit the state or the nation. Organizing against Trump’s energy agenda has strengthened ties between people often viewed as political adversaries, they explain, providing a sense of community and purpose despite the president’s best efforts to divide the nation.

“No one is throwing up their hands and saying, ‘Well, he’s won,’” Elisabeth Dabney, longtime executive director of the Northern Center in Fairbanks, tells me. “There is hope in being an Alaskan in this moment and seeing that there is solidarity, there is gumption to not give up, and there is strategy. It’s very powerful.”

+California is considering whether to adopt a “Climate Supefund” bill like the ones passed in Vermont and New York that would charge the oil giants for climate damage. The folks at Influence Map have an incisive account of who’s paying to oppose the bill

The California Chamber of Commerce (CalChamber), American Chemistry Council, American Forest & Paper Association, and Western States Petroleum Association officially registered in opposition to the California Climate Superfund bill (see testimony from CalChamber), with American Petroleum Institute (API) criticizing the bill in an April 2025 press release. These industry groups share a history of opposing climate policy in California, including the state’s climate plan, climate disclosure laws, and transport regulations. CalChamber describes itself as “the largest broad-based business advocate to government in California,” with representatives from Walt Disney Company, Ernst & Young, and others serving on its Executive Committee. The group’s highly diverse membership base and leadership circle make its fossil fuel-friendly advocacy questionable in a state where many businesses have ambitious climate goals.

InfluenceMap research shows that CalChamber is using narratives previously employed by the US Chamber of Commerce (US Chamber) and API, suggesting a strategic effort that may be spearheaded by the national associations to oppose state Climate Superfund bills nationwide. Since at least February 2024, API, the US Chamber, and other state chambers of commerce have been repeating misleading claims around the legality, emissions attribution, and economic impact of Climate Superfund programs in states such as Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York.

+Even appliance makers think the Trump administration is going overboard in trying to cut efficiency standards for things like refrigerators

David Doniger, senior strategist for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an interview that the move amounted to a favor to a handful of supermarkets resistant to the Biden administration rule.

“It is bad for the climate. And bad for the rest of the industry,” Doniger said. “It won’t change grocery prices one penny.”

+The no-longer-quite-so-young activists who sued the U.S. government for climate action in Juliana V. U.S. may have eventually lost that case in federal court—but now they’re taking their effort to an international tribunal

The nonprofit law firm, Our Children’s Trust, and 15 of the original 21 plaintiffs in the case Juliana et al. v. United States filed a petition Sept. 23 with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that accuses the United States government of violating international law through its perpetuation of a fossil fuel-based energy system and requests an investigation.

“For over 50 years, the U.S. government has knowingly endangered our lives by driving the fossil fuel system that is destroying our climate. This is not neglect — it is deliberate harm,” said petitioner Levi Draheim, now 18, in a release provided by Our Children’s Trust. “The government’s long-standing actions have violated our rights to life, health, and dignity, and young people like me are paying the price.”

The petition comes after a pair of historic advisory opinions on climate change issued in July by the Inter-American Court on Human Rights and the International Court of Justice, and a similarly groundbreaking climate opinion from the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea in 2024 that recognize climate change as an “existential” threat to humanity and ecosystems.

+The Labour government of Keir Starmer in the UK has been having its share of troubles lately—among other things, it somehow boxed itself into arresting any activist who held up a sign with the words Palestine Action, which, um, encouraged a large number of people to do just that. But one place where it’s been doing good work is in energy, under the leadership of Ed Milliband. He seems unimpressed by Trump’s call for the Brits to abandon windpower

In response, Miliband said countries were entitled to act in their own interests, and that for many outside the U.S., targeting climate goals can lead to cheaper and more secure energy.

“There’s lots of talk about countries stepping back from climate action and clean energy, but my message is, don’t believe the doomsters,” he said by videolink.

“When you look at what’s really happening, it’s actually a very, very different story.”

As well as citing a more upbeat-than-expected vibe at Climate Week events, he pointed to data showing clean energy technologies attracted over $2 trillion in investment in 2024 - twice the amount in fossil fuels.

+Also in the lead up to global climate talks next month in Belem, Brazil, the “climate-vulnerable” nations renewed a call for more financing for adaptation

In particular, CVF-V20 ministers and heads of government, meeting on the sidelines of the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 80) in New York, committed to work hard for a comprehensive Adaptation Package at COP30—anchored in prosperity, affordable long-term finance, technology access, and strengthened national institutions—to close the adaptation gap and secure a resilient future for the most climate-exposed nations.

Leaders noted that the world was above 1.5°C for all of 2024, and stressed that the climate crisis is a driver of structural and systemic macroeconomic and financial instability. Specifically, climate change shocks are compounded by inflexible debt and high servicing costs, which drain fiscal space and constrain the ambition and ability of many nations to invest in the adaptation and resilience urgently needed to protect their people and economies.

The CVF-V20 calls for urgent steps to strengthen delivery, expand access to affordable, long-term finance for adaptation, resilience and economic transformation. Leaders emphasised that multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) must scale up concessional lending to rates below countries’ medium-term GDP growth rates.

“With the world having passed 1.5 degrees and the imminent threat this poses to our countries, we must now mobilise the adaptation finance needed to tackle the hurricane of climate damages that will follow. We must reshape a global financial system that is too slow, delivers too little, and burdens the next generation with the cost of today’s delays. It is not enough to pledge more finance or declare new commitments. What matters is scale, acceleration and delivery,” H.E. Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister of Barbados and Chair of the Barbados CVF-V20 Presidency, emphasised during the meeting.

It will be interesting to see how proposals like this fare with the US removing itself from climate talks. The key question: will China step up? A first indication: China did commit itself for the first time to specific cuts in carbon emissions, but the target it laid out at the UN was fairly timid. China—unlike the US—has a long history of under-promising and over-delivering, but that coyness may not serve it or the world so well as the vacuum of U.S. leadership beings to open

+Aaron Gell in the New Republic has an epic piece describing how the American insurance industry has been wrecked by climate change, and a consultant-driven effort to avoid actually paying out to co]ustomers facing damage. It’s an ugly story, beautifully told

A decidedly unglamorous business that mostly draws attention when it fails, property and casualty insurance, or P&C, has for decades quietly powered the economy and bolstered the American picket-fence dream. “Insurers are the foundational layer for most homeownership,” Abrahm Lustgarten, author of On the Move: The Overheating Earth and the Uprooting of America, told me, “and thus for most American middle-class wealth.”

In recent years, however, the insurance industry has begun to look notably shaky, staggering from one crisis to the next on its way to what some observers say could become a meltdown. As extreme weather events—an apocalyptic laundry list including but not limited to floods, windstorms, hailstorms, wildfires, droughts, mudslides, and heat waves—grow more frequent and intense due to the heedless destabilization of the climate, premiums are rising, payouts are shrinking, and, increasingly, carriers are bailing on markets deemed too risky. Millions of policyholders received nonrenewal notices in recent years, and many are now taking their chances without any protection.

“I don’t think we’re in imminent risk of the whole system collapsing tomorrow,” said Carolyn Kousky, the acting chief economist at Environmental Defense Fund and founder of the nonprofit Insurance for Good, “but risk is growing dramatically year on year, and we have not done any of the necessary decarbonization to stabilize that increasing risk.” As Whitehouse put it in a recent interview, “There’s no Band-Aid big enough to paper this over if you don’t deal with the fundamental underlying danger.”

+China has tested the first “airship” floating wind turbine designed to capture the fast-blowing breezes at high altitudes. And…the test was successful

The system passed strict tests, including full desert assembly and repeated deployments in high winds. This marks a major milestone for airborne wind power.

The S1500 is a megawatt-scale commercial system that floats in the sky like a giant Zeppelin. Measuring approximately 197 feet long (60 meters), 131 feet wide (40 meters), and 131 feet tall (40 meters), it is by far the largest airborne wind-power generator ever built, according to Beijing SAWES Energy Technology Co., Ltd., one of the developers.

The S1500 features a main airfoil and an annular wing that together form a giant duct. Inside this duct are 12 turbine-generator sets, each rated at 100 kW. These rotors capture steady high-altitude winds and convert them into electricity. The power is transmitted to the ground via a tether cable.

In California, that could be felt in ...","Hayley Smith, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-10-04/trump-slashed-8-billion-for-energy-projects-in-blue-states-in-california-red-areas-will-feel-the-pain,"It was awarded by the Biden administration as part of a competitive nationwide effort to develop hydrogen projects.
The Trump administration said terminating the clean energy projects will save taxpayers money.
Since Trump took office in January, at least 142 clean energy projects have been canceled affecting what his group estimates is at least 80,500 jobs — not including the latest round of cuts announced this week.
About 47% of those jobs were in congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Clean Power’s energy project tracker.
“The cancellation of this award threatens the future promise of hydrogen energy, leaving us behind the rest of the world,” the senators said.","The Trump administration this week escalated its efforts against renewable energy when it announced the cancellation of $7.56 billion in funding for projects in 16 states, including California.

The U.S. Department of Energy said the 223 canceled projects — all of which are in states that favored Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election — were terminated because they “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But while the cuts took aim at blue states, they will affect Trump’s base as well: The terminated projects span districts represented by 108 Democratic members of Congress and 28 Republicans. In California, that includes large swaths of the Central Valley and Inland Empire, which largely leaned toward Trump in 2024.

Russell Vought, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget and a top Trump administration official, said in a post on X that the canceled projects were using “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

The biggest cut was $1.2 billion for California’s ambitious project to develop clean hydrogen known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES. It was awarded by the Biden administration as part of a competitive nationwide effort to develop hydrogen projects. The idea is that the hydrogen, which burns at a very high temperature, will be able to replace planet-warming fossil fuels in some industry and transportation uses.

The ARCHES project is a public-private partnership that would create at least 10 hydrogen production sites around the state, primarily in the Central Valley. It would also help transition two large gas-fired power plants — Scattergood in Los Angeles and the Lodi Energy Center in San Joaquin County — to 100% renewable hydrogen, and develop more than 60 hydrogen fueling stations in areas including Fresno, Riverside, Orange and San Joaquin counties.

In all, it would deliver an estimated 220,000 jobs, including 130,000 construction jobs and 90,000 permanent jobs, according to the state. California is pursuing hydrogen in addition to renewables such as offshore wind, solar power and geothermal energy to help diversify its supply, meet growing demand driven by artificial intelligence data centers, and reach its target of 100% carbon neutrality by 2045.

The Trump administration said terminating the clean energy projects will save taxpayers money.

One district with a project that’s been cut is the northern San Joaquin Valley, represented by Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove). McClintock said he strongly supports the Energy Department’s decision.

“$7.5 billion comes out to about $60 taken from the average earnings of every family in America,” McClintock said. “Call me old fashioned, but I think that companies should make their money by pleasing their customers and not by using government to take money that families have earned.”

The Times also reached out to Reps. Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield), Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale), Keven Kiley (R-Rocklin), Ken Calvert (R-Corona), Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills) and Jay Obernolte (R-Big Bear Lake), whose districts are touched by the ARCHES hub and other terminated projects.

A representative for Fong said his office was dealing with issues related to the U.S. government shutdown and so was unable to comment. None of the others responded.

Jesse Lee, senior advisor with the nonprofit group Climate Power, said the cancellations may not save taxpayers money, but cost them. The administration this year has canceled a $7 billion program to help low-income households install solar panels on their homes and halted the development of off-shore wind projects, among other efforts.

“Having these projects come to fruition is really the only chance we have at insulating people from skyrocketing utility bills year after year,” Lee said — particularly in the face of energy-thirsty AI. “The only way to have a prayer of meeting that demand is through these kinds of clean energy projects.”

Lee believes the actions could come back to haunt the party in the midterm elections. Since Trump took office in January, at least 142 clean energy projects have been canceled affecting what his group estimates is at least 80,500 jobs — not including the latest round of cuts announced this week. About 47% of those jobs were in congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Clean Power’s energy project tracker.

Democratic officials in California said the Energy Department’s latest cuts amount to political retaliation. They were announced on the first day of the shutdown, which the administration blames on Democrats.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof that this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla wrote in a joint letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright dated Thursday, in which they urged him to restore its funding.

“The cancellation of this award threatens the future promise of hydrogen energy, leaving us behind the rest of the world,” the senators said. “The ARCHES hub is a key strategic investment into American energy dominance, energy technology prominence, manufacturing job growth, and lowering energy costs for American families.”

The cuts come as the Trump administrations eases the path for production of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, including this week’s announcement that it will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to recommission or modernize coal-fired power plants. Coal has become increasingly uncompetitive with either natural gas or solar power.

Large-scale renewable energy and carbon capture projects in red states such as Wyoming, Ohio, Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota that received funding from the Energy Department were not subject to the cuts.

Other canceled awards in California include $630 million to the California Energy Commission for grid resilience upgrades; $500 million to the National Cement Company of California for a carbon-neutral cement production facility; $87 million to Redwood Coast Energy Authority for grid updates benefiting tribal communities; $50 million to Southern California Edison for a battery energy storage project; and $18 million to the Imperial Irrigation District to modernize its electrical grid, bolster resiliency against power outages and catalyze renewable energy usage.

“We are disappointed as we did a great deal of work to win the $18.3 million matching grant from the DOE to help modernize our electrical grid and enhance reliability for our customers,” said Robert Schettler, a spokesman for the Imperial Irrigation District located in southeastern California. “Despite this setback, we will reevaluate the scope as the project is a necessity.”

Officials with ARCHES called the administration’s decision a “short-sighted move that abandons America’s opportunity to lead the global clean energy transition.” They said they hope to keep the project moving forward even without the federal grant; ARCHES has also secured more than $10 billion in private funding agreements.

“Despite the loss of federal funding, we will press forward with our state, private, and international partners to build the infrastructure, train the workforce, and establish the supply chains that will power a modern, resilient energy economy,” ARCHES board chair Theresa Maldonado said in a statement.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/decbbf4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6650x3491+0+472/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5a%2F94%2F438b559947cb9d796c6b76f2aca9%2F931301-fi-scattergood-generating-station-tour-jlc-0317-19476.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 06:58:48.061430

These renewable energy technologies are less expensive than natural gas and far less expensive than coal and nuclear.
As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the U.S.
You might ask, why is our government attacking renewable energy subsidies and boosting subsidies for fossil fuels?
He is also co-chair of the Sanibel-Captiva Renewable Energy Working Group and vice president of the Committee of the Islands.","Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are now the most cost-effective forms of new electricity generation.

In 2024, solar, wind, and batteries accounted for 93% of all new electricity added to the grid.

Investments in renewable energy technologies create three times more jobs than investments in fossil fuels.

Solar power combined with battery storage can provide energy resilience during power outages caused by extreme weather.

This past Sunday, Sept. 21, was designated as Sun Day, a day where solar advocates around the country gathered to promote “the clean energy revolution.”

For the majority of Americans who are concerned about the impacts of climate change, solar and other forms of renewable energy hold significant promise. They can help to shift the ways we power our homes and economy to become more sustainable. That’s important for those of us who are seeing those impacts increasingly threaten our homes and property through stronger storms, flooding, sea level rise, dangerous heat days, longer fire seasons, health risks from particulate matter pollution and microplastics, etc.

But even for those who believe the science about climate change’s impacts is overstated, there are good reasons to be excited about the advances in renewable energy technologies. Over the past decade, the cost of clean energy has plummeted. Today, the cheapest forms of electricity going onto the grid are solar, wind and batteries. These renewable energy technologies are less expensive than natural gas and far less expensive than coal and nuclear.

In Lazard’s 2025 Levelized Cost of Energy report, a widely cited, annual analysis that provides insights into the cost competitiveness of various energy generation technologies, found that: “Despite headwinds and macroeconomic challenges, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of new-build generation on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the U.S. This is particularly true in the current high power demand environment, where renewables stand out as both the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy generation resource.”

In addition to being cheaper, investments in renewable energy technologies generate three times more jobs than those targeting fossil fuels. It is no surprise that those favorable economics are driving a renaissance in clean energy development.

According to an analysis of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 93% of all new electricity coming onto the grid in 2024 was from solar, wind and batteries. And, despite our government’s irrational opposition, that trend is expected to continue through 2030 based on the projects that developers have planned to complete in that time.

Solar, wind and batteries also have the advantage of not adding to the costs associated with climate change. According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, extreme weather costs in the U.S. exceeded $1.2 trillion in just the 10 years from 2015-2024 in inflation adjusted dollars. Further, an analysis from the re-insurance company, Swiss Re, shows that price tag could rise to $38 trillion dollars annually on a global basis in the next 30 years if no mitigating action is taken. That equates to 18% of the projected global GDP.

You might ask, why is our government attacking renewable energy subsidies and boosting subsidies for fossil fuels? Based on the economic data and the science behind climate change, you would think that a conservative administration that is looking to save money for the American people would be doing the opposite. As an electorate, we should be pointing that out.

For those of us living on a barrier island, solar and battery back-up also have tremendous resilience advantages. After Hurricane Ian left us without power for six weeks in 2022, we added battery back-up to our rooftop solar. During the four-day power outage following Hurricane Milton last summer and the many shorter outages since, we have enjoyed full power, including AC to protect against mold damage.

We also power our electric vehicle from our rooftop solar, saving money and emissions. With solar and batteries, we don’t have to be concerned about accessing fuel for a generator to power our home, which is a comfort considering the damage to the Sanibel causeway and to many propane tanks during Hurricane Ian.

In the race to dominate artificial intelligence, Meta Platforms Inc. is making unprecedented bets on physical infrastructure, announcing plans for what could be its largest data center yet in rural Louisiana. The facility, sprawling across an area equivalent to 70 football fields, underscores the company’s aggressive pivot toward AI, even as it grapples with environmental and community concerns. According to a report from People, Meta promises 500 new jobs and a commitment to sustainability, but residents near similar projects express fears over water quality and resource strain.

This Louisiana project fits into Meta’s broader strategy, which includes massive capital expenditures projected to reach $64 billion to $72 billion in 2025 alone. As detailed in coverage by The New York Times, much of this investment fuels data center expansions essential for powering AI models like Llama. The scale is staggering: one proposed site could rival the size of Manhattan, as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed in announcements covered by The Guardian.

Powering the AI Boom: Gigawatt-Scale Demands

The energy requirements for these centers are equally monumental, with Meta eyeing facilities that could consume up to 5 gigawatts—enough to power millions of homes. Posts on X highlight the exponential growth in AI data center power needs, with estimates suggesting U.S. demand could surge 30-fold by 2035. This aligns with Zuckerberg’s vision, as reported in TechCrunch, where he outlined building out infrastructure to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google.

Such ambitions come amid a global scramble for energy resources. Reuters noted Meta’s discussions for a $200 billion AI data center project, per Reuters, signaling potential costs that dwarf previous tech investments. Industry insiders point to innovations in custom AI chips, with Meta’s recent acquisition of startup Rivos bolstering in-house silicon development, as covered in market analyses from Financial Content.

Sustainability Challenges and Community Impact

Yet, these developments raise red flags on sustainability. A September 2025 report from PPC Land details Meta’s environmental goals clashing with gigawatt-scale energy consumption, per PPC Land. Residents in Georgia, near a comparable Meta facility, report contaminated water supplies, echoing concerns in the Louisiana build as per the People article.

Meta counters with pledges for renewable energy integration, but the sheer scale—such as the New Albany, Ohio, expansion aiming for the world’s first gigawatt data center, as reported by The Columbus Dispatch—tests these commitments. X users, including analysts like those from SemiAnalysis, discuss temporary setups like tent-based clusters housing 500,000 GPUs and over 1,000 megawatts of power, highlighting the urgency and improvisation in Meta’s rollout.

Broader Industry Implications and Future Outlook

The push reflects a wider trend where AI infrastructure becomes the new battleground, with data centers projected to consume up to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2030, as noted in X posts citing energy forecasts. BBC coverage emphasizes Zuckerberg’s plans for sites nearly Manhattan-sized, per BBC, while Technology Magazine details Meta’s aim for 1.3 million Nvidia GPUs in a $65 billion investment, according to Technology Magazine.

For industry players, this signals a shift from chip shortages to power constraints, as Nvidia’s CEO has implied in recent statements echoed on X. Meta’s third-quarter 2025 results, upcoming as per The AI Journal, may reveal more on these expenditures. Critics argue the environmental toll could hinder progress, but proponents see it as essential for advancing AI capabilities.

What happens when tax credits go away?,Caitlin Tan,,,,,https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/10/03/wyoming-solar-installation-firm-braces-for-end-of-tax-credits,"And then when we're working and it's December, clearing snow off roofs in two degrees, zero degrees,” Weatherford said.
“To connect the power that's produced from the solar panels to the building,” he said.
“We like to think of it as the epicenter of solar energy for the state of Wyoming,” Kane said.
The federal tax credit for residential rooftop solar was beefed up under the Biden administration, driving more business to Kane.
The original solar tax credit was supposed to taper down after just a couple years.","On top of a courthouse in eastern Wyoming one can see mountains in the distance, but on the roof are several rows of glistening black solar panels.

“So, they're angled a little bit so they can get the best production. It's facing due south,” said solar electrician Andrew Weatherford, who recently installed the arrays.

Weatherford loves an adventure, so climbing up on Wyoming roofs year-round is a good fit.

“We're doing this when it's 100 degrees in the summertime. And then when we're working and it's December, clearing snow off roofs in two degrees, zero degrees,” Weatherford said.

He unspooled electric cords that will run from the roof to a control box about 60 feet below.

“To connect the power that's produced from the solar panels to the building,” he said.

Weatherford works for a company called Creative Energies, one of the few rooftop solar installation companies in Wyoming. And they are bracing for what business will look like in the new year.

Since 2005, homeowners who wanted to install solar panels could get some help from the federal government: It would pay for about a third of that cost. But residential clean energy credits are going away at the end of the year. The recently passed GOP policy bill gets rid of those incentives.

It is partly because of those incentives that Creative Energies was able to expand in recent years, in a state that’s otherwise dominated by oil, gas, and coal. Co-owner Scott Kane showed off their giant shop building at their headquarters in Lander, Wyoming.

“We like to think of it as the epicenter of solar energy for the state of Wyoming,” Kane said.

Inside it feels like a full-on hardware store — tools, electrical supplies, solar panels and trucks, everything they need to service projects around the state. Kane said they built the shop a couple years ago.

“We noticed, like, ‘Woah there’s been a lot of demand for solar and we're having a hard time keeping up with the demand that's out there,’” said Kane.

The federal tax credit for residential rooftop solar was beefed up under the Biden administration, driving more business to Kane. But the incentive first came about under President George W. Bush. The original solar tax credit was supposed to taper down after just a couple years. “It's been extended because subsequent administrations saw that the program was working well,” Kane said.

But congressional Republicans voted to completely end the 30% tax credits, saying the solar industry had been subsidized long enough.

“So that went from being, you know, almost a 20-year-long program, to ending overnight,” said Kane. “So that really feels like a scramble right now.”

A scramble to install panels for the surge of homeowners who want the credit before it goes away. In fact, Kane has had to turn some customers away.

“We can't get their project built before the end of the year,” he said.

Kane is unsure whether demand will still be there when the price for solar installs goes up. His business is shifting from growth mode to maintenance.

“Rather than continuing to add people and and invest in vehicles and invest in new buildings, to more of a like, let's sustain the business mindset,” he said.

Still, Kane knows how to adapt. He helped found Creative Energies in 2001, when Wyoming’s fossil fuels were booming. The state is the top producer of coal in the country.

“Some might say that, ‘A renewable energy company — you're operating in Wyoming? Like that must feel like you're operating behind enemy lines,’” Kane said.

But he found a niche demographic, from eco-minded homeowners to survival types who do not want to rely on the grid.

“The idea really plays that like, ‘Hey, we grow our own food, we hunt for our own meat. Let's produce our own power,’” Kane said.

Federal tax credits for commercial buildings are not ending for another couple years, so Kane hopes to tap more into that market. Like the eastern Wyoming courthouse project, where electrician Andrew Weatherford feeds the cords to his work partner, Noah Rohrbacher.

“That should be it and we should be able to fire this system up and see what it’ll be able to do for the building,” Rohrbacher said.

The mine has been incredibly controversial. It received support from economic developers and some local lawmakers, while other lawmakers as well as some environmental groups voiced concerns.

In charge of the project is Highland Copper, a Canadian-based company with a U.S. subsidiary, Copperwood Resources Inc. According to the company’s website, the creation of the mine will boost the economy in the area, creating 300 construction jobs while meeting the state’s mining and environmental regulations. It is projected to generate a total capital of $425 million.

The project would be placed next to the Porcupine Mountains, Michigan’s largest state park at nearly 60,000 acres. It would be the closest facility to Lake Superior on record.

Tom Grotewohl is the founder of Protect the Porkies campaign. Grotewohl said that concerns over disruptions to outdoor recreation and negative impacts on the environment were the reasons why he does not support the implementation of the mining project.

Tribal Nation & Indigenous-led Organizations said in a letter to Governor Whitmer that the site lies within homelands ceded under the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, where their people retain rights to hunt, fish, and gather. Industrial mining on this scale threatens those rights, the letter read.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), copper mining makes up the largest percentage of processing waste in the US. The agency stated that mining of copper can concentrate and extract radioactive materials.

Grotewohl said that the project’s ore grade is 1.45%, meaning that for every ton of extract, 30 pounds would be copper and the other 1,970 pounds extracted would be waste.

A 2012 study found that over 90 percent of copper sulfide mines failed to contain seepage, spilling toxic waste materials into their surrounding areas. Grotewohl fears the mine could contaminate Lake Superior, the largest freshwater source on the North American continent.

Highland Copper said that the mine project would help revitalize communities, and has received public support from twenty-two units of government, ranging from townships to county boards. It said that the project would reduce reliance on foreign markets and help mitigate the growing copper supply deficiency.

Grotewohl is more skeptical. He said that prospective jobs would last 10.7 years at the maximum, which is the planned duration of the project.

“No amount of jobs justifies a terrible idea,” Grotewohl said. “Storing all that waste next to Lake Superior, 100 feet from Porcupine State park is a terrible idea.”

Harvard Economist James Stock’s research found that initially, mining is economically beneficial, but it erodes over time.

“I think it was very wise to cut funding for infrastructure in uninhabited areas, especially in a place where people visit to escape all of that stuff,” Grotewohl said. “There just aren't enough gains to outweigh the significant harms of this project.”

Grotewohl said their campaign will continue, because the project could still advance through private investment or other funding sources.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13b32a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1522x799+0+512/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2F00%2F75e03fee4e649af8b745c7b065a5%2Fcong-q-wu-porcupine-mountains.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 09:58:41.692370

Its domestic semiconductor industry is a significant pillar of its economy, contributing a substantial 15% to its GDP. Beyond sheer volume, Taiwan's dominance intensifies in the production of the most advanced chips. By 2023, the island was responsible for producing over 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors, specifically those smaller than 10nm.

At the forefront of Taiwan's semiconductor prowess is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM). As the world's largest contract chip manufacturer and the pioneer of the ""pure-play"" foundry model, TSMC is an unparalleled force in the industry. In Q2 2025, TSMC held approximately 70.2% of global foundry revenue. More strikingly, TSMC boasts an even larger 90% market share in advanced chip manufacturing, including 3-nanometer (nm) chips and advanced chip packaging. The company's leadership in cutting-edge process technology and high yield rates make it the go-to foundry for tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and even Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) for their most sophisticated chips.

TSMC's relentless innovation is evident in its roadmap. In 2022, TSMC was the first foundry to initiate high-volume production of 3nm FinFET (N3) technology, offering significant performance boosts or power reductions. Following N3, TSMC introduced N3 Enhanced (N3E) and N3P processes, further optimizing power, performance, and density. Looking ahead, TSMC's 2nm (N2) technology development is on track for mass production in 2025, marking a significant shift from FinFET to Gate-All-Around (GAA) nanosheet transistors, which promise improved electrostatic control and higher drive current in smaller footprints.

Bob Ferguson on Thursday condemned the Trump Administration’s decision to revoke over $1.1 billion in federal energy funding for projects across Washington state.

Most significantly, the administration has pulled $1 billion from the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub (PNWH2), a regional initiative poised to generate more than 10,000 jobs and over $5 billion in local investment.

“It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,” said Ferguson. “These projects will lower costs, create jobs, and reduce air pollution. We’re working with the Attorney General’s Office to fight this illegal action.”

The Department of Energy selected the PNWH2 in 2023 as one of seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Managed by the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association, the hub serves Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. It was designed to develop a clean hydrogen economy using the region’s hydropower and clean energy resources.

Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), who helped craft the H2Hubs program, called the cuts “unprecedented and corrupt.”

“Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work,” said Cantwell. “I will be fighting to restore these funds.”

Four Washington-based PNWH2 partner projects are directly affected:

Alare Renewables (Whatcom County): $102.8 million

Atlas Agro (Benton County): $157.3 million

Northwest Seaport Alliance (King/Pierce counties): $11.8 million

Lewis County Transit (Lewis County): $36.4 million

In total, 11 Washington energy projects were defunded, threatening progress toward the state’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050. Additional affected projects include:

Nippon Dynawave (Cowlitz County): $46.6 million

PACCAR Inc. (Skagit County): $68 million

CleanFiber Inc. (Lewis County): $10 million

Spokane Edo LLC (Spokane County): $5.3 million

SilFab Solar WA Inc. (Skagit County): $3 million

Washington State University (Whitman County): $9.8 million

In July 2024, the Department of Energy awarded PNWH2 $27.5 million in Phase 1 funding for initial planning. The full $1 billion federal investment was expected to be matched by over $5 billion in local funding and create over 10,000 jobs, mainly in rural areas.

Ferguson and Cantwell both pledged to take legal and legislative action to reverse the cuts.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/c5e55120-a0ab-4484-bb6a-b68a23810b19/20241219T144957/c5e55120-a0ab-4484-bb6a-b68a23810b19_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 08:03:43.569430

The DFA emphasized that Arkansas income tax is based on net income, and thus the Texas tax did not meet the statutory criteria for the credit.
Taxpayers’ Position The taxpayers argued that, despite its label, the Texas franchise tax is functionally a tax on net income.
The decision concluded that the Texas franchise tax qualifies as a “net income tax” within the meaning of Ark.
The TAC acknowledged that while the Texas franchise tax is calculated differently from Arkansas’s income tax, such differences exist among many states and do not disqualify the tax from being considered a net income tax.","Arkansas law provides a mechanism to alleviate the burden of double taxation for its residents who earn income in other states.

The decision rendered by the state brought some necessary clarity to a tax that appears facially different from most other state taxes.

Background

Under Ark. Code Ann. § 26-51-504, a resident individual taxpayer may claim a credit against their Arkansas income tax liability for income taxes paid to another state, provided that both jurisdictions tax the same income and the tax paid to the other state is “on or measured by net income.” This statutory framework reflects a longstanding public policy to prevent the inequity of taxing the same income twice.

A recent decision by the Arkansas Tax Appeals Commission (“TAC”) has clarified the scope of this credit in the context of the Texas franchise tax—a tax that has long occupied a gray area in multistate tax compliance due to its unique structure and nomenclature.

The Dispute

The taxpayers in this case were Arkansas residents and shareholders in an S corporation that conducted business in Texas. The S corporation paid Texas franchise tax, and the taxpayers claimed their pro rata share of that tax as a credit on their Arkansas individual income tax returns for tax years 2021 through 2023.

The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (“DFA”) denied the credit, asserting that the Texas franchise tax is not a qualifying “net income tax” under Arkansas law. According to the DFA, the Texas franchise tax is a privilege tax imposed for the right to do business in Texas and is calculated based on gross margin—defined as gross receipts minus either cost of goods sold or compensation—rather than net income. The DFA emphasized that Arkansas income tax is based on net income, and thus the Texas tax did not meet the statutory criteria for the credit. The taxpayers filed suit with the TAC.

Taxpayers’ Position

The taxpayers argued that, despite its label, the Texas franchise tax is functionally a tax on net income. They presented testimony from a certified public accountant and cited national accounting standards, including interpretations by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), which classify the Texas franchise tax as an income tax for financial reporting purposes. taxpayers further noted that the Arkansas statute does not require the tax to be labeled as an income tax, only that it be “on or measured by net income.”

Moreover, the taxpayers pointed to Ark. Code Ann. § 26-51-504(a)(2), which specifically addresses S corporations and allows resident shareholders to claim a credit for their share of income taxes paid by the S corporation to states that do not recognize S corporation status. They contended that Texas, while recognizing S corporations, does not impose a traditional income tax, and thus the franchise tax should be treated as a qualifying tax under this provision.

The Decision

In a significant ruling, the TAC reversed its prior position and granted the taxpayers’ petitions. The decision concluded that the Texas franchise tax qualifies as a “net income tax” within the meaning of Ark. Code Ann. §§ 26-51-504 and 26-51-403. The ruling emphasized that the statutory language focuses on the substance of the tax—whether it is measured by net income—rather than its label or the specific deductions allowed.

The TAC acknowledged that while the Texas franchise tax is calculated differently from Arkansas’s income tax, such differences exist among many states and do not disqualify the tax from being considered a net income tax. The decision also referenced the Multistate Tax Compact, codified at Ark. Code Ann. § 26-5-101, which supports a broader interpretation of what constitutes an income tax for purposes of interstate tax coordination.

Accordingly, the taxpayers were found to be entitled to credits against their Arkansas income tax liabilities for the taxes paid by the S corporation to Texas for the 2021, 2022, and 2023 tax years. The proposed assessments and partial refund denials were reversed, and the DFA was directed to proceed in accordance with the decision and applicable law.

Implications

This decision provides important clarity for Arkansas residents with multistate business interests, particularly those involved in pass-through entities operating in states like Texas and Tennessee that do not impose traditional income taxes. It affirms that the Arkansas credit for taxes paid to other states is not limited to taxes explicitly labeled as “income taxes,” but extends to taxes that are substantively measured by net income.

Tax professionals should take note of this decision when advising clients on multistate tax compliance and refund opportunities. The ruling also underscores the importance of examining the functional characteristics of a tax, rather than relying solely on its statutory label, when evaluating eligibility for credits under Arkansas law.

“This is a watershed moment for mercury waste management,” says John Magee, CEO of VLS Environmental Solutions.
“Our process provides the first true domestic solution for mercury disposal since the Mercury Export Ban Act took effect in 2013.
The site’s existing infrastructure and permitted capacity allow for the safe treatment and disposal of elemental mercury in compliance with U.S. hazardous waste regulations.
It’s a paradigm shift in mercury waste management,” he says.","VLS Environmental Solutions unveils a breakthrough in hazardous waste management with the launch of a patent-pending technology that enables the permanent disposal of elemental mercury. This is the first and only RCRA-compliant solution of its kind in the United States.

The company’s Texas Molecular facility in Deer Park now houses this technology, offering a long-awaited domestic solution for government and industrial entities grappling with mercury stockpiles since the Mercury Export Ban Act (MEBA) took effect in 2013. Under MEBA, U.S. exports of elemental mercury were banned, leaving industries without a permanent, regulatory-compliant disposal method.

“This is a watershed moment for mercury waste management,” says John Magee, CEO of VLS Environmental Solutions. “Our process provides the first true domestic solution for mercury disposal since the Mercury Export Ban Act took effect in 2013. Government agencies and industry stakeholders now have a viable, compliant option for final disposal.”

Addressing a regulatory gap

The Texas Molecular facility operates under full permits from both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The site’s existing infrastructure and permitted capacity allow for the safe treatment and disposal of elemental mercury in compliance with U.S. hazardous waste regulations.

Chris Lobue, executive vice president of hazardous waste, emphasizes the health and environmental risks posed by previous management methods. “Methods like indefinite long-term storage, or stabilization and landfill, just delay the problem and can pose potential serious risks,” he says. “There is a reason stabilization and landfill of mercury above the water table isn’t allowed under current EPA regulations. The elegance of the VLS solution is that it fits within existing regulations and uses a proven technology that was originally designed to protect drinking water sources.”

Implications for industry and government

The technology targets key sectors such as mining, energy, and chemicals, as well as federal agencies managing legacy mercury reserves. It offers a compliance-focused alternative to the cost and complexity of long-term storage or export-restricted options.

Robert Wheatley, chief strategy officer, adds that the launch signals more than just progress. “This is more than a technological advancement. It’s a paradigm shift in mercury waste management,” he says. “Our solution enables industries to resolve mercury challenges domestically, creating both environmental and economic value.”

Milestone in environmental safety

Operating since 1981, the Deer Park facility is now the only site in the U.S. with this level of mercury waste management capability. For safety professionals, this development highlights an important shift in risk mitigation strategy for one of the most persistent and dangerous forms of hazardous waste.

“The impact of this technology goes beyond regulatory compliance,” says Keith Cordesman, President of VLS. “It’s about protecting ecosystems, advancing sustainable development, and guiding industries toward a future built on responsible innovation.”

While the facility operates in the United States, Canadian safety managers with cross-border operations or legacy mercury holdings should note the implications of this new disposal pathway. The advancement opens the door for international partnerships and may influence similar regulatory or technological developments within Canada.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/cos/jims_638951001820940793.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 09:58:46.500871

EV Market Expansion and Strategy: Despite some near-term headwinds, GM's continued expansion in the growing EV market segment is a significant opportunity.","General Motors (GM) (NYSE: GM), an American multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, continues to be a pivotal player in the global automotive landscape as of October 3, 2025. Founded in 1908 by William C. Durant, GM has a rich history as one of the world's largest motor-vehicle manufacturers, consistently leading the U.S. automotive market in total sales.

GM's core operations revolve around its four major automobile brands: Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac. Beyond these, the company holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling through SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile. Its diverse portfolio also includes a defense vehicles division, the vehicle safety and information services provider OnStar, the auto parts company ACDelco, and a financial lending arm, GM Financial. GM operates manufacturing plants in eight countries and maintains a significant global presence across North America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, and South America. The company's current structure was established in 2009 following a Chapter 11 reorganization.

As of Q3 2025, General Motors is demonstrating strong market relevance through robust sales performance and strategic advancements in electrification and autonomous driving. GM reported an 8% increase in overall U.S. sales for Q3 2025, reaching 710,347 units, outpacing the estimated 4% growth across the auto industry in the first half of 2025. This growth was fueled by strong demand across both its traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, particularly full-size trucks and SUVs, and its expanding electric vehicle (EV) lineup. Chevrolet remains GM's top-selling brand, with the Silverado truck showing robust sales. GM has solidified its position as the second-leading EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla, surpassing Ford. EV sales more than doubled in Q2 2025, increasing 111% year-over-year, securing a 15% share of the U.S. EV market. In Q3 2025, GM set a new quarterly record with 66,501 EVs sold in the U.S., a 105% surge year-to-date from 2024 to over 144,000 units. The Chevrolet Equinox EV emerged as GM's top-selling EV in Q3 2025, becoming the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S. with over 25,000 units sold. Cadillac's luxury EVs, including the LYRIQ, OPTIQ, and VISTIQ, also performed strongly. GM's EV strategy is centered around its flexible and scalable Ultium battery platform, designed to significantly reduce production costs and achieve price parity with gasoline-powered vehicles.

General Motors remains a significant focus for investors and the broader automotive industry due to several interconnected factors: its strategic EV pivot and profitability, a balanced portfolio and financial strength, advancements in autonomous driving, innovation and capital allocation, and its navigation of global market dynamics. GM's commitment to innovation is evident in its substantial capital expenditures, projected at $10 billion to $11 billion for 2025, including investments in battery joint ventures. The company is also exploring AI applications to streamline design, manufacturing, marketing, and sales, aiming for increased efficiencies.

2. Historical Background

General Motors boasts a rich and complex history, marked by ambitious founding, rapid expansion through acquisitions, significant organizational transformations, and resilience in the face of numerous challenges, including a historic bankruptcy.

Founding Story and Early Milestones

General Motors was founded on September 16, 1908, in Flint, Michigan, by William C. Durant. Durant, a successful carriage manufacturer with his Durant-Dort Carriage Company, initially acquired the Buick Motor Company in 1904. His vision for GM was to create a holding company that would consolidate the burgeoning, yet fragmented, automobile market.

In its very early years, GM embarked on an aggressive acquisition spree. Durant's first acquisition for the new holding company was Olds Motor Works in November 1908. This was quickly followed by the acquisition of other prominent names in the automotive industry in 1909, including Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company, and the Reliance Motor Car Company (predecessor of GMC). Notably, Durant even attempted to acquire Ford Motor Company in 1909, but the deal fell through due to a lack of bank financing.

Early innovations also marked GM's path. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering's Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) (which would later join GM) and Henry M. Leland invented the first electric self-starter, which was commercially introduced in the 1912 Cadillac and quickly made the hand crank obsolete.

Durant's aggressive expansion, however, led to over-leveraging, and he was forced out of the company by bankers in 1910. Undeterred, he co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Company with race car driver Louis Chevrolet in 1911. By 1916, Chevrolet's success allowed Durant to regain a controlling interest in GM, bringing Chevrolet into the corporate fold by 1918. In 1919, GM also established the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to provide financing for automotive customers, further solidifying its financial infrastructure.

Key Transformations and Major Acquisitions

The 1920s brought a significant transformation under the leadership of Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who replaced Durant after his second removal in 1920. Sloan reorganized GM from a collection of disparate units into a cohesive enterprise with a decentralized management structure, creating five main automotive divisions: Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Chevrolet. This structure balanced divisional autonomy with central corporate oversight and became a model for large industrial companies. Sloan also pioneered the concept of annual style changes for car models and strengthened GM's sales organization.

GM's growth continued internationally with the acquisition of Vauxhall Motors of England in 1925, an 80% stake in Germany's Adam Opel in 1929 (increased to 100% by 1931), and Holden of Australia in 1931. Domestically, GM also acquired the Fisher Body Company in 1926, allowing for vertical integration of body production. By 1929, GM had surpassed Ford to become the leading American passenger-car manufacturer, and by 1931, it was the world's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.

Following World War II, GM experienced substantial growth, becoming one of the world's largest employers and introducing iconic vehicles like the Corvette in 1953. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, GM began to face increasing challenges from foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda, struggling with quality problems, vehicle defects, and a slow response to changing consumer demands due to its unwieldy bureaucracy. This led to further restructuring efforts in the early 1990s under chairman Jack Smith, involving workforce reductions, cost-cutting, and the elimination of some product lines, including Oldsmobile.

In the late 1990s, GM made high-profile international acquisitions, such as Swedish automaker Saab and a stake in Japanese automaker Isuzu, as part of a global expansion strategy. The company also diversified and later divested non-automotive assets; for instance, it sold a 51% stake in GMAC (renamed Ally Financial) in 2006. More recently, in 2016, GM acquired Cruise Automation, a self-driving technology company, for $1.0 billion, signaling a strategic shift towards future mobility. Further recent acquisitions include Tooling & Equipment International in November 2023 and ALGOLiON in June 2023.

Major Challenges

General Motors has weathered several significant storms throughout its history:

Early Financial Troubles: William C. Durant's aggressive acquisitions led to substantial debt, causing him to lose control of GM twice, first in 1910 and again in 1920.

Stagnation and Competition (1980s-2000s): Decades of dominance led to an internal bureaucracy that was slow to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and the rise of fuel-efficient and reliable vehicles from foreign competitors. This resulted in declining market share and quality issues. GM also lost its position as the world's largest automaker to Toyota in 2008.

2009 Bankruptcy and Bailout: The most profound challenge came during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. GM faced a severe cash crisis, declining sales, unsustainable legacy costs (including healthcare and pension obligations), and a bloated product portfolio. To avoid collapse, GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009, making it the largest industrial bankruptcy in U.S. history. The U.S. government provided $51 billion in financial assistance, enabling a rapid restructuring. This process involved closing unprofitable plants, discontinuing underperforming brands (such as Pontiac, Hummer, and Saturn), and renegotiating labor contracts. A ""New GM"" emerged from bankruptcy on July 10, 2009, with a leaner cost structure and a renewed focus.

Transition to Electric Vehicles (2020s): In recent years, GM has faced new challenges in its transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The company reported losses exceeding $7 billion in its EV division in 2024, attributed to high upfront costs for research, development, and manufacturing. Shifting consumer preferences, concerns about range anxiety, charging infrastructure, and competition from new players like Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturers pose significant hurdles. GM is also balancing its traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production with EV manufacturing, while navigating potential profit declines due to slower EV growth.

Global Market and Trade Pressures: GM faces ongoing challenges in international markets, including losses in China and the significant impact of tariffs on its profitability, given that nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles are assembled outside the country. The company has also contended with disruptions like cyberattacks affecting its dealership networks.

Despite these challenges, General Motors has demonstrated a consistent ability to adapt and transform, remaining a major force in the global automotive industry for over a century.

3. Business Model

GM's business model is centered on a diverse portfolio of vehicle brands catering to various market segments, supported by strong manufacturing capabilities, an extensive dealer network, and substantial investments in research and development (R&D). The company is strategically shifting towards an all-electric future, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2040, though it has adjusted some of its aggressive EV transition plans in response to market realities. Concurrently, GM is increasing its focus on software monetization and connected services as new, high-margin revenue streams.

Revenue Sources

GM's primary revenue source continues to be the sale of vehicles across its various brands (Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, Cadillac). In 2024, GM reported substantial revenue of $187.44 billion, with North America being its strongest market. While the traditional automotive sales remain core, the company is actively developing and expanding alternative revenue streams:

Electric Vehicles (EVs): GM is making significant investments in EVs, with a goal to increase EV wholesale volumes to 300,000 units in 2025, up from 189,000 in 2024. The company expects EV profitability to improve by $2 billion to $4 billion in 2025 due to scale efficiencies and cost reductions.

Software and Services: This is a growing area of focus, with GM aiming for software to become a $10+ billion revenue line by the late 2020s. The company plans to double its revenue from new software platforms and connectivity by 2030, adding 50 new in-vehicle digital services by 2026. Deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise stood at $4 billion at the end of Q2 2025.

GM Financial: This segment provides financial lending services and contributes a steady profit stream to GM.

Defense Vehicles: GM also has a division that produces military vehicles for the United States government and military.

Product Lines

GM's diverse product portfolio includes both gasoline-powered and electric vehicles across various types and price points.

Brands: GM's core brands in North America are Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac. Globally, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.

Vehicle Types (Internal Combustion Engine – ICE): The company offers a wide range of vehicles including economy cars, trucks, SUVs, and luxury vehicles. Full-size pickups (Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra) and full-size SUVs (Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban, Cadillac Escalade) remain major profit drivers, especially in the U.S. market.

Vehicle Types (Electric Vehicles – EVs): GM is rapidly expanding its EV portfolio, utilizing its Ultium battery platform. Key EV models in 2025 include:

Chevrolet: Equinox EV, Blazer EV, Silverado EV, BrightDrop commercial delivery vans.

Cadillac: Lyriq, Escalade IQ, Optiq, Vistiq.

GMC: Hummer EV Pickup, Hummer EV SUV, Sierra EV.

Buick is also developing a broad electrification strategy, particularly for the Chinese market.

The company is focusing on delivering EVs across different segments, from affordable compact models to high-end luxury SUVs.

Services

GM offers a suite of services designed to enhance vehicle ownership and provide recurring revenue.

OnStar: Starting with the 2025 model year, all new Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC vehicles come standard with select OnStar features at no additional cost for eight years. This package, now known as ""OnStar Basics"" (formerly OnStar One Essentials), includes Automatic Crash Response, remote vehicle commands (lock/unlock, start, location, diagnostics via smartphone app), and voice assistance features (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Waze). Cadillac customers receive three free years of premium OnStar services, which can include unlimited Wi-Fi data and additional in-vehicle apps.

Flexibility in manufacturing platforms is crucial for OEMs like GM to adapt to changing market dynamics, such as the EV transition and evolving consumer preferences. Partnerships, like those between Volkswagen and Rivian for software-defined vehicle technology platforms, are becoming common to share costs and accelerate advancements.

Macro Drivers

1. Economic Growth and Consumer Demand:

The U.S. economy in 2025 is described as a ""Goldilocks economy"" by some, with a positive outlook and projected GDP growth of 2.6%, consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Consumer financial health is improving, which is fueling demand for vehicles. Despite this, global vehicle sales growth is forecasted to be weak, with an expected increase of just 2.7%, reaching 98.7 million units in 2025. Some forecasts predict a drop in U.S. sales to 15.4 million units due to softening demand and tariff impacts. However, others project new vehicle sales in the U.S. to hit 16.5 million units in 2025, a 4% increase from the previous year. GM itself reported strong Q3 2025 U.S. sales, up 8% year-over-year, leading the industry in overall sales and continuing to grow in both electric and gas-powered vehicles.

2. Interest Rates and Inflation:

High interest rates continue to be a significant macroeconomic factor. Auto loan rates have been elevated for several years, with average rates for new car loans around 7.6% and used cars between 10-15% as of mid-April 2025. These higher financing costs deter potential buyers and prolong ownership cycles of existing vehicles. Inflation has been a challenge, driving up material costs and consequently vehicle prices. While inflation has cooled globally and in the U.S. in 2024, there's a threat of rebound. The expectation is for interest rates to continue a slow decline in 2025, which could boost consumer buying power and demand.

3. Tariffs and Trade Policies:

The imposition of tariffs is a major concern. Recently imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and upcoming tariffs on auto parts are expected to increase production costs and consumer prices by an estimated 10-15%. The incoming U.S. administration is predicted to introduce higher tariffs, particularly on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, which could further strain global supply chains and weaken consumer demand. This situation initially sparked a short-term sales boom as consumers rushed to buy before prices surged, but the long-term forecast indicates a sales decline.

Supply Chain Issues

1. Semiconductor Shortages:

The automotive industry continues to grapple with persistent semiconductor shortages, especially for mature nodes (40 nanometers and above), which are critical for many vehicle components. This shortage has been a bottleneck in automotive production since the pandemic, leading to delays, reduced inventory, and increased costs. While some initial oversupply from previous years might temporarily affect supplier revenues through 2025, undersupply for certain devices could resurface in the second half of the year. The demand for analog chips, which are often produced at mature process nodes, is expected to increase by 23% in cars by 2026 compared to 2022.

2. Critical Component Shortages and Raw Material Costs:

Beyond semiconductors, the industry faces ongoing shortages of specialized metals and other critical components, leading to production delays and increased prices for vehicle repairs and new car purchases. Material costs have been on the rise due to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Freight delays and rising shipping costs further exacerbate these issues, increasing expenses for suppliers and ultimately consumers. Manufacturers are responding by diversifying suppliers, investing in domestic production, and building more resilient supply chains. GM itself faced a major recall of 721,000 full-size trucks and SUVs (2021-2024 models) due to manufacturing defects in crankshafts and connecting rods, highlighting the impact of component quality issues.

3. Labor Shortages and Geopolitical Instability:

Labor shortages remain a critical challenge for automotive suppliers. Geopolitical instability and potential port strikes also pose ongoing threats to the supply chain. Regulatory scrutiny on labor compliance risks, particularly concerning forced labor in the supply chain, is also increasing.

The effectiveness of GM's efforts to sustain EV demand through leasing incentives may be temporary, and maintaining momentum without strong policy support remains uncertain.

Economic Headwinds: Broader economic uncertainty and supply chain disruptions, such as shortages of semiconductors and other critical components, continue to pose a risk to production and sales. Rising oil prices could also have an unpredictable impact, potentially boosting traditional vehicle sales or accelerating EV adoption, creating an uncertain net effect on profitability.

Valuation and Investor Sentiment: Despite recent sales growth, some analysts suggest GM's stock may be overvalued relative to its earnings, with its P/E ratio nearing a three-year high. Insider selling by the CEO is noted as a potential red flag, and concerns about the Cruise project contribute to possible undervaluation.

Financial Health Indicators: GM's financial health shows some warning signs, including an Altman Z-Score in the ""distress zone,"" which suggests a possibility of financial distress within the next two years. Its Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) being lower than its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) indicates potential inefficiencies in capital allocation. The company has already lowered its 2025 financial outlook due to tariff impacts.

Dependence on GM Financial: Risks associated with GM Financial's access to capital and its ability to provide leasing and financing services to customers and dealers could negatively affect GM's vehicle sales.

This adaptability has encouraged Wall Street and likely influences retail sentiment positively in the short term.

13. Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

General Motors (GM) is navigating a complex and evolving landscape of regulatory, policy, and geopolitical factors as of October 3, 2025. The company faces significant challenges and opportunities stemming from shifts in government incentives, trade policies, environmental regulations, and the geopolitical competition in critical automotive technologies like electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving.

Regulatory Factors

1. Emissions and Environmental Regulations:

Stricter Standards & Pushback: While GM aims for an all-electric, zero-emissions world and carbon neutrality by 2040 (with tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles eliminated by 2035), the company, alongside other automakers, is actively urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to relax stringent Biden-era emissions limits for 2027 and beyond. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing GM, argues these targets are not feasible due to current market conditions, charging infrastructure limitations, supply chain issues, and vehicle affordability challenges, further exacerbated by the expiration of federal EV tax credits.

Renewable Energy Goals: GM has secured all necessary energy sourcing agreements to power its U.S. facilities with 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2025, accelerating its global goal to 2035.

2. Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Regulations:

Industry Call for Consistency: The automotive industry, including GM, is advocating for consistent federal autonomous vehicle regulations in the U.S. to prevent a ""harmful patchwork of state laws"" and maintain a competitive edge against China.

Loosened Federal Rules: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has introduced the Automated Vehicle (AV) Framework, which aims to streamline crash reporting, override local laws with national preemption, and facilitate the commercial deployment of AVs. This framework allows manufacturers to sell up to 2,500 vehicles annually without fully complying with traditional federal regulations, including those for vehicles without steering wheels or pedals.

GM's Strategic Pivot: Following the shutdown of its Cruise robotaxi subsidiary in late 2024 due to high-profile accidents and regulatory scrutiny, GM is refocusing its autonomous driving efforts on developing driverless technology for personal vehicles. The company is rehiring former Cruise employees and expanding its AV development teams.

3. Safety Regulations:

ADAS Compliance: Stricter requirements for the calibration and inspection of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and updates to NHTSA safety ratings necessitate enhanced quality controls throughout GM's manufacturing and servicing processes. States like California are implementing Vehicle Safety Systems Inspection (VSSI) programs, mandating inspections for ADAS features.

Cybersecurity: Given the increasing software integration in vehicles, compliance with cybersecurity regulations like ISO/SAE 21434 (road vehicle cybersecurity) and UNECE WP.29 (software update and cybersecurity management systems) is critical. This involves secure coding, penetration testing, maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and real-time threat monitoring.

4. Manufacturing and Quality Standards:

GM updated its Customer Specific Requirements for IATF 16949, effective March 1, 2025, with clarifications on Quality Management System (QMS) Gap Assessments for manufacturing facilities.

Policy Factors

1. Government Incentives for Electric Vehicles (EVs):

Expiration of Federal Tax Credit: The federal $7,500 EV tax credit officially expired on September 30, 2025, under new policies.

GM's Workaround: To mitigate the impact, GM and Ford have implemented programs where their financing arms make down payments on EVs in dealer inventory before the expiration, allowing them to claim the credit. These savings are then passed on to consumers through competitive lease terms, maintaining some level of incentive, at least through the end of the year for Ford. GM Financial placed down payments on approximately 30,000 EVs before October 1st.

Uncertainty for Long-Term Demand: While these measures cushion short-term demand, the long-term sustainability of EV sales without direct government subsidies remains a significant concern for GM. There are also concerns within the industry about losing other battery production tax credits.

2. Trade Policies (Tariffs):

U.S. Tariffs: The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles and parts, effective April 3, 2025 (vehicles) and May 3, 2025 (parts), with exemptions for USMCA-compliant vehicles (75% North American content).

Financial Impact on GM: GM projects these tariffs will cost the company between $4 billion and $5 billion in 2025, leading to a reduction in its profit forecasts. The automaker aims to offset around 30% of these costs through supply chain adjustments, cost reduction initiatives, and increasing the U.S. content in its vehicles. Tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and South Korea, coupled with retaliatory tariffs, are expected to raise GM's costs, potentially increasing new vehicle prices by up to 1%.

Supply Chain Restructuring: These tariffs are driving a restructuring of supply chains, with an increased focus on nearshoring or reshoring production within USMCA countries to reduce tariff exposure. GM is working to strengthen its domestic supply chain.

3. Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE):

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (OBBBA) in 2025 has effectively loosened U.S. EPA and miles-per-gallon (MPG) requirements by reducing penalties for non-compliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to zero. This change provides automakers with more flexibility in vehicle production. Despite this, the 2025 CAFE standards still mandate higher fuel efficiency and greater EV integration.

Geopolitical Factors

1. U.S.-China Relations:

Trade Tensions: Intensified trade tensions between the U.S. and China throughout 2025, including tariffs, have disrupted global supply chains.

GM's China Strategy: GM has suspended exports to China, indicating an end to low-cost trans-Pacific auto trade. However, its manufacturing operations within China are exempt from cross-border tariffs, which could lead to improved margins from local production. GM's Ultium platform and partnerships with Chinese suppliers are seen as opportunities to capture a significant share of China's EV market by 2026.

Competition and National Security: China's dominance in EV manufacturing and critical minerals processing (like lithium) raises national security concerns for the U.S. The push for consistent federal AV regulations is partly driven by a desire to avoid ceding technological leadership to China.

2. Supply Chain Resilience and Critical Minerals:

Domestic Sourcing: The U.S. government has taken a strategic stake in a Lithium Americas-GM joint venture to secure a domestic supply of lithium. This initiative aims to reduce vulnerability to international trade disruptions and geopolitical tensions, providing more predictable and stable input pricing for GM's Ultium battery platform and creating a competitive advantage for U.S. manufacturers. This vertical integration helps address China's significant control over global lithium processing.

Global Restructuring: Geopolitical risks are driving a broader trend of ""reshoring"" or ""friendshoring"" in global supply chains, moving away from hyper-globalization. GM's efforts to increase U.S. content and adapt its supply chain are aligned with this trend.

3. Broader Geopolitical Risks:

Geopolitical risks are a core concern, influencing financial stability, supply chains, and regulatory environments globally. While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets for GM, ongoing conflicts or instability in key regions could impact energy prices, raw material availability, and consumer sentiment.

Compliance Requirements (General)

To navigate this landscape, GM's compliance requirements include:

Maintaining a robust compliance governance framework that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability across the organization.

Conducting thorough and regular regulatory audits and risk assessments.

Providing ongoing, tailored training and clear communication to employees at all levels regarding their compliance responsibilities.

Implementing continuous improvement processes and incident preparedness, including regularly updating compliance policies and conducting recall simulations.

Geopolitical Opportunities

""Made in America"" Appeal: The domestic production of EVs and battery components, supported by government initiatives like the Lithium Americas-GM venture, offers marketing advantages by appealing to consumers concerned about domestic manufacturing and jobs.

Reduced Carbon Footprint: Shorter transportation distances from domestic supply chains align with environmental motivations, enhancing the appeal of GM's EVs to eco-conscious consumers.

Innovation in AVs: Loosened federal AV regulations could provide a clearer path for GM to accelerate its development and commercial deployment of personal autonomous vehicle technologies.

In summary, GM is actively adapting to a dynamic environment where government policies, especially concerning trade tariffs and EV incentives, significantly impact its financial outlook and strategic decisions. The company is strategically adjusting its production, supply chain, and product development (particularly for EVs and AVs) to comply with evolving regulations, capitalize on domestic opportunities, and mitigate geopolitical risks.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

General Motors (GM) is navigating a complex automotive landscape as of October 3, 2025, marked by strategic shifts, evolving market dynamics, and a mix of optimistic and cautious projections. The company is balancing its ambitious electric vehicle (EV) goals with sustained investment in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, while also grappling with macroeconomic factors and trade policies.

GM's Future Outlook (as of October 3, 2025)

Short-Term Projections (2025-2027):

Sales and Revenue: GM's total U.S. vehicle sales were up 8% in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024, with growth in both gasoline and electric vehicles. EV sales in the U.S. more than doubled year-over-year in Q3 2025, reaching a record 66,501 units, making GM the second-leading EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla. This surge was partly driven by consumers buying EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30, 2025. GM is expected to see its top line contract by 4% in fiscal year 2025 and another 2% in FY26, reaching approximately $175.47 billion. However, other analyst projections suggest revenue of $178.9 billion in 2025, growing to $190.075 billion in 2026 and $193.1 billion in 2027.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Analysts project GM's EPS to be around $9.85 for 2025, rising to $11.45 in 2026 and $12.25 in 2027. Another projection estimates EPS to descend from multi-year highs of $10.60 in FY24 to $9.44 per share in FY25, before rebounding 2% to $9.66 in FY26.

Production: Global output for GM's wholly-owned brands is anticipated to decrease by about 2.5% in 2025, with a further decline projected for 2026, primarily due to an expected reduction in overall North American demand. Growth is then expected to return in 2027.

Stock Price: Short-term stock price forecasts for GM vary significantly. Some predict an average price of $33.15 in 2025, with a high of $45.08, while others suggest a year-end 2025 price of $68.44 or $67.12. For 2026, predictions range from an average of $56.39 to $76.08 or $80.74.

Long-Term Projections (Beyond 2027):

Revenue and Earnings: GM's outlook for 2028 anticipates $185.3 billion in revenue and $8.0 billion in earnings.

Stock Price: Long-term stock price forecasts show a wide range. For 2028, average predictions span from $44.92 to $120.53. By 2030, forecasts range from an average of $51.39 to $138.32. Further out, some analyses suggest GM's stock could reach an average of $59.71 by 2040 and $81.70 by 2050, while other predictions are more optimistic, reaching $150 by 2034 and $135.72 by 2035.

Decarbonization Targets: GM has set short-term (up to 2027), medium-term (2028-2035), and long-term (2036-2050) greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, covering at least 95% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and relevant Scope 3 emissions. The company aims for net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner.

Bull Case Scenarios

The bull case for General Motors is predicated on several key factors:

Favorable Trade Agreements: Progress in trade agreements, such as the one with South Korea, could significantly reduce tariff burdens. Further agreements with Canada and Mexico could provide additional relief, potentially improving GM's cost structure beyond pre-tariff levels.

Strong Free Cash Flow and Capital Returns: GM boasts a substantial 26% free cash flow yield. Analysts anticipate that as macroeconomic uncertainties subside and its financial position stabilizes, GM will resume aggressive capital return strategies, including robust share buyback programs and potentially increased dividend payments.

North American Market Strength: UBS projects GM's North American margins could return to the 8-10% target range in the coming years, surpassing the consensus view.

EV Market Expansion and Strategy: Despite some near-term headwinds, GM's continued expansion in the growing EV market segment is a significant opportunity. The company's record Q3 2025 U.S. EV sales, led by models like the Equinox EV (the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S.), demonstrate strong demand for its electric offerings. GM's Ultium battery platform, designed for modularity and flexibility, is central to its EV strategy, aiming to reduce battery costs and make EVs more competitive.

Strategic Production Shifts: GM is making strategic production shifts to mitigate tariff risks, including a $4 billion investment in 2025 to upgrade U.S. assembly plants to boost high-margin production and reduce exposure to tariffs.

Bear Case Scenarios

The bear case for General Motors highlights several significant challenges:

Ongoing Tariff Pressures: Tariffs continue to pose a significant threat to GM's profitability. With nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles assembled outside the country, GM is vulnerable to import tariffs, which could result in an annual impact of approximately $5 billion on its bottom line without mitigation. Reciprocal tariffs could further increase costs, potentially raising total tariffs on some imports to 40% or 50%, leading to higher vehicle prices and reduced sales volumes.

EV Market Headwinds: GM's electrification ambitions have encountered a ""harsh reality check"" due to slowing consumer adoption, the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, and inadequate charging infrastructure. GM's EV penetration stood at only 6% of unit sales year-to-date in Q2 2025.

Macroeconomic Uncertainties: General macroeconomic uncertainties could impact GM's financial position and its ability to resume aggressive capital return strategies.

Weak Gross Profit Margin: A relatively weak gross profit margin of 10.97% suggests room for operational improvement, indicating potential vulnerability to cost pressures.

Intense Competition: The EV sector is expected to be fiercely competitive, which may constrain opportunities for margin improvements.

Legal and Political Risks: Some analysts cite potential risks from illegal data harvesting and transmission class action lawsuits, as well as a potentially anti-EV stance from a Trump administration, which could thwart growth efforts.

Potential Strategic Pivots

GM is undertaking several strategic pivots to adapt to the evolving automotive industry:

Reassessment of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Strategy: GM is scaling back its investment in the Cruise robotaxi project, moving away from capital-intensive ride-hailing ambitions. Instead, the company is refocusing on personal autonomous vehicles (PAVs) by leveraging its existing Super Cruise system, which is available on numerous models and accumulates millions of miles monthly.

Balancing EV and ICE Investments: While committed to EVs, GM has slowed its EV rollout and is reinvesting in internal combustion engine (ICE) platforms, particularly focusing on high-margin V8 trucks and SUVs. This pragmatic approach acknowledges slowing EV consumer adoption and aims to capitalize on profitable traditional vehicle segments.

2. Historical Background

General Motors boasts a rich and complex history, marked by ambitious founding, rapid expansion through acquisitions, significant organizational transformations, and resilience in the face of numerous challenges, including a historic bankruptcy.

Founding Story and Early Milestones

General Motors was founded on September 16, 1908, in Flint, Michigan, by William C. Durant. Durant, a successful carriage manufacturer with his Durant-Dort Carriage Company, initially acquired the Buick Motor Company in 1904. His vision for GM was to create a holding company that would consolidate the burgeoning, yet fragmented, automobile market.

In its very early years, GM embarked on an aggressive acquisition spree. Durant's first acquisition for the new holding company was Olds Motor Works in November 1908. This was quickly followed by the acquisition of other prominent names in the automotive industry in 1909, including Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company, and the Reliance Motor Car Company (predecessor of GMC). Notably, Durant even attempted to acquire Ford Motor Company in 1909, but the deal fell through due to a lack of bank financing.

Early innovations also marked GM's path. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering's Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) (which would later join GM) and Henry M. Leland invented the first electric self-starter, which was commercially introduced in the 1912 Cadillac and quickly made the hand crank obsolete.

Durant's aggressive expansion, however, led to over-leveraging, and he was forced out of the company by bankers in 1910. Undeterred, he co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Company with race car driver Louis Chevrolet in 1911. By 1916, Chevrolet's success allowed Durant to regain a controlling interest in GM, bringing Chevrolet into the corporate fold by 1918. In 1919, GM also established the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) to provide financing for automotive customers, further solidifying its financial infrastructure.

Key Transformations and Major Acquisitions

The 1920s brought a significant transformation under the leadership of Alfred P. Sloan Jr., who replaced Durant after his second removal in 1920. Sloan reorganized GM from a collection of disparate units into a cohesive enterprise with a decentralized management structure, creating five main automotive divisions: Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Chevrolet. This structure balanced divisional autonomy with central corporate oversight and became a model for large industrial companies. Sloan also pioneered the concept of annual style changes for car models and strengthened GM's sales organization.

GM's growth continued internationally with the acquisition of Vauxhall Motors of England in 1925, an 80% stake in Germany's Adam Opel in 1929 (increased to 100% by 1931), and Holden of Australia in 1931. Domestically, GM also acquired the Fisher Body Company in 1926, allowing for vertical integration of body production. By 1929, GM had surpassed Ford to become the leading American passenger-car manufacturer, and by 1931, it was the world's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.

Following World War II, GM experienced substantial growth, becoming one of the world's largest employers and introducing iconic vehicles like the Corvette in 1953. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, GM began to face increasing challenges from foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda, struggling with quality problems, vehicle defects, and a slow response to changing consumer demands due to its unwieldy bureaucracy. This led to further restructuring efforts in the early 1990s under chairman Jack Smith, involving workforce reductions, cost-cutting, and the elimination of some product lines, including Oldsmobile.

In the late 1990s, GM made high-profile international acquisitions, such as Swedish automaker Saab and a stake in Japanese automaker Isuzu, as part of a global expansion strategy. The company also diversified and later divested non-automotive assets; for instance, it sold a 51% stake in GMAC (renamed Ally Financial) in 2006. More recently, in 2016, GM acquired Cruise Automation, a self-driving technology company, for $1.0 billion, signaling a strategic shift towards future mobility. Further recent acquisitions include Tooling & Equipment International in November 2023 and ALGOLiON in June 2023.

Major Challenges

General Motors has weathered several significant storms throughout its history:

Early Financial Troubles: William C. Durant's aggressive acquisitions led to substantial debt, causing him to lose control of GM twice, first in 1910 and again in 1920.

Stagnation and Competition (1980s-2000s): Decades of dominance led to an internal bureaucracy that was slow to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and the rise of fuel-efficient and reliable vehicles from foreign competitors. This resulted in declining market share and quality issues. GM also lost its position as the world's largest automaker to Toyota in 2008.

2009 Bankruptcy and Bailout: The most profound challenge came during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. GM faced a severe cash crisis, declining sales, unsustainable legacy costs (including healthcare and pension obligations), and a bloated product portfolio. To avoid collapse, GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 1, 2009, making it the largest industrial bankruptcy in U.S. history. The U.S. government provided $51 billion in financial assistance, enabling a rapid restructuring. This process involved closing unprofitable plants, discontinuing underperforming brands (such as Pontiac, Hummer, and Saturn), and renegotiating labor contracts. A ""New GM"" emerged from bankruptcy on July 10, 2009, with a leaner cost structure and a renewed focus.

Transition to Electric Vehicles (2020s): In recent years, GM has faced new challenges in its transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The company reported losses exceeding $7 billion in its EV division in 2024, attributed to high upfront costs for research, development, and manufacturing. Shifting consumer preferences, concerns about range anxiety, charging infrastructure, and competition from new players like Tesla and Chinese EV manufacturers pose significant hurdles. GM is also balancing its traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production with EV manufacturing, while navigating potential profit declines due to slower EV growth.

Global Market and Trade Pressures: GM faces ongoing challenges in international markets, including losses in China and the significant impact of tariffs on its profitability, given that nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles are assembled outside the country. The company has also contended with disruptions like cyberattacks affecting its dealership networks.

Despite these challenges, General Motors has demonstrated a consistent ability to adapt and transform, remaining a major force in the global automotive industry for over a century.

Key Industry and Market Trends

1. Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption and Strategy:

GM is a prominent player in the accelerating shift towards electric vehicles. As of Q3 2025, GM set a new EV sales record with 66,501 deliveries, more than doubling its EV sales from the prior year and bringing its year-to-date total to over 144,000 units, a 105% increase from 2024. The Chevrolet Equinox EV has emerged as the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S., and Cadillac has three models among the top ten luxury EVs. GM aims for its North American EV portfolio to be solidly profitable by 2025 and plans to scale EV capacity in the region to over 1 million units annually.

However, the overall EV market is experiencing shifts. While EV sales continue to gain market share in the U.S., their growth rate slowed to 10% in 2024, compared to 40% in 2023. The expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, is expected to lead to a temporary decline in EV sales in the next quarter, with executives anticipating a significant drop in EV market share through the end of 2025. This has led some OEMs to revise production plans and focus more on hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles due to their affordability and flexibility. GM is actively expanding its EV charging network in collaboration with partners like EVGo and IONNA.

2. Autonomous Driving (AV) Development:

After experiencing setbacks with its Cruise autonomous-vehicle business, including shuttering Cruise in 2024 and laying off employees earlier in 2025, GM is renewing its push into autonomous driving. The company is refocusing its efforts on developing autonomous cars for personal use, rather than a robotaxi service, with the ultimate goal of achieving hands-free, eyes-free driving and eventually fully driverless cars (SAE Level 5 autonomy). GM is seeking to rehire former Cruise employees and has integrated Cruise's technical teams into a single effort to advance autonomous and assisted driving, building on the progress of its Super Cruise system. This strategic realignment is expected to lower spending by over $1 billion annually after the proposed plan is completed in the first half of 2025.

3. Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) and Connected Car Technology:

The automotive industry is rapidly moving towards software-defined vehicles, where features and functionality are increasingly determined by software, allowing for continuous upgrades and new features throughout a vehicle's lifecycle. This trend, coupled with the integration of AI and emerging technologies, is a key factor in addressing industry challenges and evolving consumer expectations. Voice assistants are becoming more prominent in vehicles due to customization and seamless AI integration.

4. Competition and Manufacturing Flexibility:

Rising competition from cost-advantaged Chinese manufacturers, who hold a significant competitive edge, is a major pressure point for OEMs. This is driving traditional automakers to cut costs, streamline operations, and invest in advanced technologies. Flexibility in manufacturing platforms is crucial for OEMs like GM to adapt to changing market dynamics, such as the EV transition and evolving consumer preferences. Partnerships, like those between Volkswagen and Rivian for software-defined vehicle technology platforms, are becoming common to share costs and accelerate advancements.

Macro Drivers

1. Economic Growth and Consumer Demand:

The U.S. economy in 2025 is described as a ""Goldilocks economy"" by some, with a positive outlook and projected GDP growth of 2.6%, consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Consumer financial health is improving, which is fueling demand for vehicles. Despite this, global vehicle sales growth is forecasted to be weak, with an expected increase of just 2.7%, reaching 98.7 million units in 2025. Some forecasts predict a drop in U.S. sales to 15.4 million units due to softening demand and tariff impacts. However, others project new vehicle sales in the U.S. to hit 16.5 million units in 2025, a 4% increase from the previous year. GM itself reported strong Q3 2025 U.S. sales, up 8% year-over-year, leading the industry in overall sales and continuing to grow in both electric and gas-powered vehicles.

2. Interest Rates and Inflation:

High interest rates continue to be a significant macroeconomic factor. Auto loan rates have been elevated for several years, with average rates for new car loans around 7.6% and used cars between 10-15% as of mid-April 2025. These higher financing costs deter potential buyers and prolong ownership cycles of existing vehicles. Inflation has been a challenge, driving up material costs and consequently vehicle prices. While inflation has cooled globally and in the U.S. in 2024, there's a threat of rebound. The expectation is for interest rates to continue a slow decline in 2025, which could boost consumer buying power and demand.

3. Tariffs and Trade Policies:

The imposition of tariffs is a major concern. Recently imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and upcoming tariffs on auto parts are expected to increase production costs and consumer prices by an estimated 10-15%. The incoming U.S. administration is predicted to introduce higher tariffs, particularly on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, which could further strain global supply chains and weaken consumer demand. This situation initially sparked a short-term sales boom as consumers rushed to buy before prices surged, but the long-term forecast indicates a sales decline.

Supply Chain Issues

1. Semiconductor Shortages:

The automotive industry continues to grapple with persistent semiconductor shortages, especially for mature nodes (40 nanometers and above), which are critical for many vehicle components. This shortage has been a bottleneck in automotive production since the pandemic, leading to delays, reduced inventory, and increased costs. While some initial oversupply from previous years might temporarily affect supplier revenues through 2025, undersupply for certain devices could resurface in the second half of the year. The demand for analog chips, which are often produced at mature process nodes, is expected to increase by 23% in cars by 2026 compared to 2022.

2. Critical Component Shortages and Raw Material Costs:

Beyond semiconductors, the industry faces ongoing shortages of specialized metals and other critical components, leading to production delays and increased prices for vehicle repairs and new car purchases. Material costs have been on the rise due to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Freight delays and rising shipping costs further exacerbate these issues, increasing expenses for suppliers and ultimately consumers. Manufacturers are responding by diversifying suppliers, investing in domestic production, and building more resilient supply chains. GM itself faced a major recall of 721,000 full-size trucks and SUVs (2021-2024 models) due to manufacturing defects in crankshafts and connecting rods, highlighting the impact of component quality issues.

3. Labor Shortages and Geopolitical Instability:

Labor shortages remain a critical challenge for automotive suppliers. Geopolitical instability and potential port strikes also pose ongoing threats to the supply chain. Regulatory scrutiny on labor compliance risks, particularly concerning forced labor in the supply chain, is also increasing.

ADAS Compliance: Stricter requirements for the calibration and inspection of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and updates to NHTSA safety ratings necessitate enhanced quality controls throughout GM's manufacturing and servicing processes. States like California are implementing Vehicle Safety Systems Inspection (VSSI) programs, mandating inspections for ADAS features.

Cybersecurity: Given the increasing software integration in vehicles, compliance with cybersecurity regulations like ISO/SAE 21434 (road vehicle cybersecurity) and UNECE WP.29 (software update and cybersecurity management systems) is critical. This involves secure coding, penetration testing, maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and real-time threat monitoring.

4. Manufacturing and Quality Standards:

GM updated its Customer Specific Requirements for IATF 16949, effective March 1, 2025, with clarifications on Quality Management System (QMS) Gap Assessments for manufacturing facilities.

Policy Factors

1. Government Incentives for Electric Vehicles (EVs):

Expiration of Federal Tax Credit: The federal $7,500 EV tax credit officially expired on September 30, 2025, under new policies.

GM's Workaround: To mitigate the impact, GM and Ford have implemented programs where their financing arms make down payments on EVs in dealer inventory before the expiration, allowing them to claim the credit. These savings are then passed on to consumers through competitive lease terms, maintaining some level of incentive, at least through the end of the year for Ford. GM Financial placed down payments on approximately 30,000 EVs before October 1st.

Uncertainty for Long-Term Demand: While these measures cushion short-term demand, the long-term sustainability of EV sales without direct government subsidies remains a significant concern for GM. There are also concerns within the industry about losing other battery production tax credits.

2. Trade Policies (Tariffs):

U.S. Tariffs: The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles and parts, effective April 3, 2025 (vehicles) and May 3, 2025 (parts), with exemptions for USMCA-compliant vehicles (75% North American content).

Financial Impact on GM: GM projects these tariffs will cost the company between $4 billion and $5 billion in 2025, leading to a reduction in its profit forecasts. The automaker aims to offset around 30% of these costs through supply chain adjustments, cost reduction initiatives, and increasing the U.S. content in its vehicles. Tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and South Korea, coupled with retaliatory tariffs, are expected to raise GM's costs, potentially increasing new vehicle prices by up to 1%.

Supply Chain Restructuring: These tariffs are driving a restructuring of supply chains, with an increased focus on nearshoring or reshoring production within USMCA countries to reduce tariff exposure. GM is working to strengthen its domestic supply chain.

3. Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE):

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (OBBBA) in 2025 has effectively loosened U.S. EPA and miles-per-gallon (MPG) requirements by reducing penalties for non-compliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to zero. This change provides automakers with more flexibility in vehicle production. Despite this, the 2025 CAFE standards still mandate higher fuel efficiency and greater EV integration.

Geopolitical Factors

1. U.S.-China Relations:

Trade Tensions: Intensified trade tensions between the U.S. and China throughout 2025, including tariffs, have disrupted global supply chains.

GM's China Strategy: GM has suspended exports to China, indicating an end to low-cost trans-Pacific auto trade. However, its manufacturing operations within China are exempt from cross-border tariffs, which could lead to improved margins from local production. GM's Ultium platform and partnerships with Chinese suppliers are seen as opportunities to capture a significant share of China's EV market by 2026.

Competition and National Security: China's dominance in EV manufacturing and critical minerals processing (like lithium) raises national security concerns for the U.S. The push for consistent federal AV regulations is partly driven by a desire to avoid ceding technological leadership to China.

2. Supply Chain Resilience and Critical Minerals:

Domestic Sourcing: The U.S. government has taken a strategic stake in a Lithium Americas-GM joint venture to secure a domestic supply of lithium. This initiative aims to reduce vulnerability to international trade disruptions and geopolitical tensions, providing more predictable and stable input pricing for GM's Ultium battery platform and creating a competitive advantage for U.S. manufacturers. This vertical integration helps address China's significant control over global lithium processing.

Global Restructuring: Geopolitical risks are driving a broader trend of ""reshoring"" or ""friendshoring"" in global supply chains, moving away from hyper-globalization. GM's efforts to increase U.S. content and adapt its supply chain are aligned with this trend.

3. Broader Geopolitical Risks:

Geopolitical risks are a core concern, influencing financial stability, supply chains, and regulatory environments globally. While not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets for GM, ongoing conflicts or instability in key regions could impact energy prices, raw material availability, and consumer sentiment.

Compliance Requirements (General)

To navigate this landscape, GM's compliance requirements include:

Maintaining a robust compliance governance framework that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability across the organization.

Conducting thorough and regular regulatory audits and risk assessments.

Providing ongoing, tailored training and clear communication to employees at all levels regarding their compliance responsibilities.

Implementing continuous improvement processes and incident preparedness, including regularly updating compliance policies and conducting recall simulations.

Geopolitical Opportunities

""Made in America"" Appeal: The domestic production of EVs and battery components, supported by government initiatives like the Lithium Americas-GM venture, offers marketing advantages by appealing to consumers concerned about domestic manufacturing and jobs.

Reduced Carbon Footprint: Shorter transportation distances from domestic supply chains align with environmental motivations, enhancing the appeal of GM's EVs to eco-conscious consumers.

Innovation in AVs: Loosened federal AV regulations could provide a clearer path for GM to accelerate its development and commercial deployment of personal autonomous vehicle technologies.

In summary, GM is actively adapting to a dynamic environment where government policies, especially concerning trade tariffs and EV incentives, significantly impact its financial outlook and strategic decisions. The company is strategically adjusting its production, supply chain, and product development (particularly for EVs and AVs) to comply with evolving regulations, capitalize on domestic opportunities, and mitigate geopolitical risks.

14. Outlook and Scenarios

General Motors (GM) is navigating a complex automotive landscape as of October 3, 2025, marked by strategic shifts, evolving market dynamics, and a mix of optimistic and cautious projections. The company is balancing its ambitious electric vehicle (EV) goals with sustained investment in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, while also grappling with macroeconomic factors and trade policies.

GM's Future Outlook (as of October 3, 2025)

Short-Term Projections (2025-2027):

Sales and Revenue: GM's total U.S. vehicle sales were up 8% in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024, with growth in both gasoline and electric vehicles. EV sales in the U.S. more than doubled year-over-year in Q3 2025, reaching a record 66,501 units, making GM the second-leading EV seller in the U.S. behind Tesla. This surge was partly driven by consumers buying EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30, 2025. GM is expected to see its top line contract by 4% in fiscal year 2025 and another 2% in FY26, reaching approximately $175.47 billion. However, other analyst projections suggest revenue of $178.9 billion in 2025, growing to $190.075 billion in 2026 and $193.1 billion in 2027.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Analysts project GM's EPS to be around $9.85 for 2025, rising to $11.45 in 2026 and $12.25 in 2027. Another projection estimates EPS to descend from multi-year highs of $10.60 in FY24 to $9.44 per share in FY25, before rebounding 2% to $9.66 in FY26.

Production: Global output for GM's wholly-owned brands is anticipated to decrease by about 2.5% in 2025, with a further decline projected for 2026, primarily due to an expected reduction in overall North American demand. Growth is then expected to return in 2027.

Stock Price: Short-term stock price forecasts for GM vary significantly. Some predict an average price of $33.15 in 2025, with a high of $45.08, while others suggest a year-end 2025 price of $68.44 or $67.12. For 2026, predictions range from an average of $56.39 to $76.08 or $80.74.

Long-Term Projections (Beyond 2027):

Revenue and Earnings: GM's outlook for 2028 anticipates $185.3 billion in revenue and $8.0 billion in earnings.

Stock Price: Long-term stock price forecasts show a wide range. For 2028, average predictions span from $44.92 to $120.53. By 2030, forecasts range from an average of $51.39 to $138.32. Further out, some analyses suggest GM's stock could reach an average of $59.71 by 2040 and $81.70 by 2050, while other predictions are more optimistic, reaching $150 by 2034 and $135.72 by 2035.

Decarbonization Targets: GM has set short-term (up to 2027), medium-term (2028-2035), and long-term (2036-2050) greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, covering at least 95% of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and relevant Scope 3 emissions. The company aims for net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner.

Bull Case Scenarios

The bull case for General Motors is predicated on several key factors:

Favorable Trade Agreements: Progress in trade agreements, such as the one with South Korea, could significantly reduce tariff burdens. Further agreements with Canada and Mexico could provide additional relief, potentially improving GM's cost structure beyond pre-tariff levels.

Strong Free Cash Flow and Capital Returns: GM boasts a substantial 26% free cash flow yield. Analysts anticipate that as macroeconomic uncertainties subside and its financial position stabilizes, GM will resume aggressive capital return strategies, including robust share buyback programs and potentially increased dividend payments.

North American Market Strength: UBS projects GM's North American margins could return to the 8-10% target range in the coming years, surpassing the consensus view.

EV Market Expansion and Strategy: Despite some near-term headwinds, GM's continued expansion in the growing EV market segment is a significant opportunity. The company's record Q3 2025 U.S. EV sales, led by models like the Equinox EV (the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S.), demonstrate strong demand for its electric offerings. GM's Ultium battery platform, designed for modularity and flexibility, is central to its EV strategy, aiming to reduce battery costs and make EVs more competitive.

Strategic Production Shifts: GM is making strategic production shifts to mitigate tariff risks, including a $4 billion investment in 2025 to upgrade U.S. assembly plants to boost high-margin production and reduce exposure to tariffs.

Bear Case Scenarios

The bear case for General Motors highlights several significant challenges:

Ongoing Tariff Pressures: Tariffs continue to pose a significant threat to GM's profitability. With nearly half of its U.S.-sold vehicles assembled outside the country, GM is vulnerable to import tariffs, which could result in an annual impact of approximately $5 billion on its bottom line without mitigation. Reciprocal tariffs could further increase costs, potentially raising total tariffs on some imports to 40% or 50%, leading to higher vehicle prices and reduced sales volumes.

EV Market Headwinds: GM's electrification ambitions have encountered a ""harsh reality check"" due to slowing consumer adoption, the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, and inadequate charging infrastructure. GM's EV penetration stood at only 6% of unit sales year-to-date in Q2 2025.

Macroeconomic Uncertainties: General macroeconomic uncertainties could impact GM's financial position and its ability to resume aggressive capital return strategies.

Weak Gross Profit Margin: A relatively weak gross profit margin of 10.97% suggests room for operational improvement, indicating potential vulnerability to cost pressures.

Intense Competition: The EV sector is expected to be fiercely competitive, which may constrain opportunities for margin improvements.

Legal and Political Risks: Some analysts cite potential risks from illegal data harvesting and transmission class action lawsuits, as well as a potentially anti-EV stance from a Trump administration, which could thwart growth efforts.

Potential Strategic Pivots

GM is undertaking several strategic pivots to adapt to the evolving automotive industry:

Reassessment of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Strategy: GM is scaling back its investment in the Cruise robotaxi project, moving away from capital-intensive ride-hailing ambitions. Instead, the company is refocusing on personal autonomous vehicles (PAVs) by leveraging its existing Super Cruise system, which is available on numerous models and accumulates millions of miles monthly.

Balancing EV and ICE Investments: While committed to EVs, GM has slowed its EV rollout and is reinvesting in internal combustion engine (ICE) platforms, particularly focusing on high-margin V8 trucks and SUVs. This pragmatic approach acknowledges slowing EV consumer adoption and aims to capitalize on profitable traditional vehicle segments.

This unexpectedly has been the case for lithium-ion batteries—a power source for electric vehicles and various portable electronics—where scientists knew what the mechanism was but weren’t sure exactly how it worked.

Fortunately, MIT scientists have found the answer. For a Science paper published October 2, researchers describe a model that illustrates how coupled ion-electron transfer (CIET), a process in which an electron travels to the electrode with an ion, in this case a lithium ion, may explain the life source of a lithium-ion battery. The insight could “guide the design of more powerful and faster charging lithium-ion batteries,” according to the researchers.

A cascade of molecules

A typical lithium-ion battery works via a chemical mechanism called intercalation. Essentially, during battery discharge, lithium ions dissolved in an electrolyte solution insert themselves inside of a solid electrode. When the ions “de-intercalate” and return to the electrolyte, the battery charges.

The rate of intercalation governs everything from a battery’s net power to its charging speed—the reason the researchers found it imperative to better understand the underlying mechanisms, the paper explained.

Previously, scientists believed that lithium intercalation in a battery electrode was driven by a model describing how quickly lithium ions could diffuse between the electrolyte and the electrode. However, actual experiments hadn’t quite matched what that model predicted, suggesting to researchers that there may be another option.

A traveling pair

For the new study, the researchers prepared more than 50 combinations of electrolytes and electrodes to straighten things out once and for all. Like previous experiments, they found sizable inconsistencies between actual data and the model. So instead, the team came up with several alternatives that could explain what they were seeing.

Finally, they decided on a model based on the assumption that a lithium ion could only enter an electrode if it travels with an electron from an electrolyte solution—coupled ion-electron transfer. This electrochemical pairing makes it easier for intercalation to occur, the researchers explained, and the mathematics behind CIET fits the data well.

“The electrochemical step is not lithium insertion, which you might think is the main thing, but it’s actually electron transfer to reduce the solid material that is hosting the lithium,” Martin Bazant, study co-author and a mathematician at MIT, told MIT News. “Lithium is intercalated at the same time that the electron is transferred, and they facilitate one another.”

Not only that, but the researchers also accidentally discovered that switching up the composition of electrolytes influenced intercalation rates. Follow-up investigations could uncover more efficient ways for creating stronger, faster batteries, they explained.

“What we hope is enabled by this work is to get the reactions to be faster and more controlled, which can speed up charging and discharging,” Bazant said.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/10/lithium-ion-intercalation-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 01:59:34.504190

Now we are in the midst of a government shutdown and are concerned about how this will hurt our economy even more. Combined with the smart energy programs the White House has either cut or threatened to cut, programs that help low-income families pay their gas and electricity bills or move us to less expensive clean energy – like LIHEAP and Solar for All – we have already been hit hard, and we simply can’t afford this. We firmly believe that under any administration, every family deserves access to clean air, clean energy, and a healthy environment.”

MLCV TAKE: Michigan LCV intern and Western Michigan University graduate student Olivia Gries said, “Trump and Congressional Republicans have made it clear that lowering costs is not in the cards for this budget and they are going to let the government shut down because of that. The Trump administration is forcing outdated and expensive coal plants to remain open while allowing the federal government to shut down. It’s clear where Trump’s priorities are focused. It’s time for Trump and the Republican led Congress to do the job they were elected to do and come to a bipartisan solution to protect their constituents and our environment.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

TRUMP ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND DIRTY, EXPENSIVE COAL: In another move that will raise people’s energy costs and threaten our health, the Trump administration announced its plans to further subsidize the coal industry with $625 million and open up millions of additional acres of public lands for coal leasing at a discounted rate. This move prioritizes Big Polluters by advancing dirty, expensive energy that will drive up costs and further harm our environment.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy and former EPA scientist Matthew Davis said, “Even as energy prices are skyrocketing because of Trump administration policies, today they are again prioritizing Big Polluters over hardworking families. Clean energy is simply the cheapest and fastest energy to bring online so we can all have lower costs and cleaner air and water. Meanwhile, energy analysts have found that ‘99 percent of existing U.S. coal plants are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.’ Yet the Trump administration is determined to help the coal barons who have seen their fortunes wane as wind, solar and batteries deliver cheaper, cleaner electricity for families across the country.

“The Trump administration is also using extreme measures to force coal-fired power plants to stay open, as they are doing with the Campbell plant in Michigan–these actions are already raising electric bills for families and making our air and water dirtier. If the Trump administration actually cared about mine workers, they would be taking steps to protect their health like finalizing life-saving silica dust standards–not delaying them. By proposing to sell off 13 million acres of our public lands to Dirty Coal, the Trump administration is more than tripling what was passed as part of the Big Ugly Bill’s giveaway to fossil fuel, while lowering their royalty rate so coal companies pay less for the resources that belong to all of us. The Trump administration’s attempts to ban clean energy and prop up dirty and costly coal will not only cause costs to keep going up, but will also risk the health of our communities and threaten public lands that belong to all of us.”

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CANCELS $8 BILLION FOR ENERGY PROJECTS IN BLUE STATES: Energy Secretary Chris Wright and OMB Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of $7.56 billion in clean energy investments in 16 blue states. These politically targeted cuts will raise costs, eliminate jobs, and slash clean, affordable energy generation.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Government Affairs Sara Chieffo said, “President Trump and Russell Vought’s latest massive cuts to hundreds of energy projects in politically targeted states is a blatant example of corruption that will raise costs for households and businesses. At a time when energy demand is increasing, costs are already rising, and job losses are mounting, Trump and Republicans in Congress should be focused on funding and deploying the cheapest and fastest energy sources–clean energy– not gutting or banning them.

“Since he took office, Trump has unleashed an all-out attack on clean energy as part of a deliberate plan to benefit his friends in the oil, gas, and coal industries– at our expense. Republicans in Congress are trying to say that they can’t control what the White House does during the government shutdown, but that only further proves the point that the Trump administration is lawless and out of control and it’s the people of this country who are going to suffer. Congressional Republicans must get serious about working with Democrats on bipartisan bills to fund the government, lower costs, get people back to work, and protect communities, families, and our environment.”

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

REPUBLICANS SHUT DOWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: After refusing to work with Democrats to produce a bipartisan bill to keep families’ costs down and fund the government, Congressional Republicans and President Trump have shut down the federal government. As Trump continues to gut critical federal programs, it is essential for Republicans to work with Democrats to negotiate a spending bill that protects our communities and environment and lowers costs.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “Trump and Republicans need to stop gutting essential services that make life safer, healthier, and cheaper, and instead work together on bipartisan solutions to address the affordability crisis they’ve created. People are facing skyrocketing costs across the board, from health care, to groceries, to energy bills with Trump and Republicans in complete control over the federal government. Yet instead of working with Democrats to make our lives better, they’ve spent this year unlawfully taking back billions of dollars from communities while giving handouts to billionaires.

“As energy demand soars, they’re trying to take away our affordable clean energy choices and good-paying jobs and instead spend taxpayer dollars on more expensive, slow, and dirty fossil fuels. It’s time for Trump and Republicans to get serious about working with Democrats on bipartisan bills to fund the government, get people back to work, and protect communities, families, and our environment.”

LCVAF ANNOUNCES SLATE OF ENDORSEMENTS FOR U.S. SENATE: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund, which works to elect candidates who will fight to build a clean energy economy and strengthen our democracy for all, announced new endorsements of seven climate champion U.S. senators for re-election next year. The endorsements include Senators Cory Booker (NJ), Chris Coons (DE), John Hickenlooper (CO), Ed Markey (MA), Jeff Merkley (OR), Ben Ray Luján (NM), and Jack Reed (RI).

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “As Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress continuously and outrageously deny science, spread lies about climate change and clean energy, and disregard democratic norms, people across our country are suffering in the face of rising energy costs, more extreme weather disasters, and increasing attacks on our fundamental rights every day. That is why we need to re-elect these strong champions to the U.S. Senate who are fighting tirelessly for our planet and our democracy, and why we need to restore a pro-climate majority in the Senate. It’s never been more important to elect representatives who will protect people while Trump and extreme Republicans in Congress shut down the government unless they gut critical funding to line the pockets of their Big Polluter and corporate donors. We’re all-in to support these Senators to take back Congress next year and fight for our communities and our future generations.”

In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.","The Trump administration on Wednesday nixed funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and several hundred other federally-subsidized clean energy projects in Democratic-led states.

Democratic politicians from Oregon and Washington state immediately cried foul and vowed to challenge what they called an “illegal” clawback of Congressionally-directed spending.

The tri-state Northwest hydrogen hub launched last year to funnel up to $1 billion in federal taxpayer funding to the region to kickstart production and use of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel. Private industry, truckmakers, transit and seaport partners were to bring large sums to the table in matching funds over the next eight to ten years.

But Trump administration officials voiced deep skepticism about climate and green energy initiatives championed by the previous Biden administration.

In a social media post Wednesday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought celebrated the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in what he called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

A follow-up news release that went out under Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s name said that his agency determined the cancelled projects did “not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub attracted bipartisan support locally as a means to create new jobs and meet climate goals, particularly in sectors that are proving difficult to convert directly to clean electric power. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray blasted the Trump administration in a statement for playing “some sort of sick political game” on the first day of the partial government shutdown.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” Murray said.

In total, the Trump administration pulled funding for 223 clean energy projects in 16 states. Political observers quickly noted that nearly all of the cancelled projects were in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election.

“This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition, but this won’t just hurt Democrats – it’ll hurt regular people just trying to get by, in red districts and blue districts alike,” Murray said. “I will be standing firm against this corrupt abuse of power – and every Republican should think carefully about what precedent they want to set by allowing this weaponization of taxpayer dollars.”

Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a prepared statement Thursday that his office was working with state Attorney General Nick Brown to “fight this illegal action.”

Ironically, the majority of the hydrogen production infrastructure for the Northwest hub project was to be built in counties that voted for Trump, such as Benton and Lewis counties in Washington, Baker and Morrow counties in Oregon, and the St. Regis, Montana area.

The Trump administration Wednesday also cancelled the California clean hydrogen hub known as ARCHES, but left in place the funding for five other nascent hubs selected in a highly competitive national contest overseen by Biden’s Energy Department in 2023.

Most of the surviving hubs align more closely with the current administration’s energy priorities by producing hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture or by using nuclear power.

Smaller, but not really small, clean energy grants pulled too

A $250 million project to upgrade power transmission lines on the Warm Springs Reservation in central Oregon was also reportedly on the list of federal grant terminations. The project was meant to increase capacity to transmit renewable electricity generated in central Oregon to customers in the Willamette Valley. A spokesperson for Portland General Electric, the transmission line’s owner, was unsure Thursday whether the utility had received a formal grant termination notice.

Aggrieved Democratic Congresswoman Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, shared a list of other project cancellations, which included four Department of Energy grants to Washington State University for solar energy and vehicle technology development, totalling nearly $10 million.

The termination list also noted a bigger – nearly $68 million – hit to Bellevue, Washington-based truck maker PACCAR, which was to receive assistance for developing and manufacturing cleaner semi trucks.

Further down the casualty list was a $10 million award to CleanFiber to help that company build a new factory in Chehalis, Washington, to turn recycled cardboard into home insulation.

The Department of Energy said the sponsors of terminated projects have 30 days to appeal their canceled funding. Some recipients have already started the appeal process, according to the department.

Big investments near Bellingham and Richland now in doubt

The biggest single component within the Northwest hydrogen hub was a planned $1.5 billion green fertilizer factory near Richland, Washington, which was to produce hydrogen on site as a key ingredient. Switzerland-based Atlas Agro has already started permit applications for the big plant and lined up customers.

Close behind in terms of investment and scale, Calgary-based AltaGas had a plan to redevelop the closed Intalco aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to produce climate-friendly hydrogen for refinery use, transportation fuel and possibly power generation.

It’s unclear what happens now. Both corporate boards had postponed making final investment decisions because of the uncertainty about federal subsidies and tax credits.

“Our investment in the Intalco lands remains a priority. We will continue to explore development opportunities that align with our values and deliver lasting benefits to the region,” said Andrea McNamara Doyle, Washington state external affairs manager for AltaGas, in an emailed statement.

Other smaller participants in the PNWH2 Hub had plans to build green hydrogen fueling and distribution infrastructure. Those outfits joined the hub to receive subsidies for design, construction and startup costs.

Plans included hydrogen refueling stations for big trucks along Interstate 84 in Eastern Oregon and on I-90 in far western Montana as well as hydrogen fuel cell transit bus expansion in southwest Washington.

There were signs of trouble for the hub prior to this week – consequences of the slower-than-expected emergence of demand for hydrogen fuel and the high cost of production. A half dozen energy developers exited from various projects that were originally included in the Northwest hydrogen hub’s federal funding proposal. Notable names to get cold feet over the past year included Fortescue, Portland General Electric, Mitsubishi Power, First Mode and Puget Sound Energy.

Prospective large-scale clean hydrogen producers Fortescue, Atlas Agro and AltaGas were also having a hard time locating affordable sources of renewable electricity in the quantities needed to split water molecules to make pure hydrogen.

In a late Wednesday email to project partners, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub President Chris Green lamented the short-notice termination and uncertainty it created, but tried to close on a positive note.

“Whether or not this grant funding remains, I’m encouraged that the trail is now blazed for more development and projects to be delivered in this market and that there will be a bright future for H2 as a highly successful and lucrative energy product in the future in our region,” Green wrote.

New Mexico lawmakers concluded a two-day special legislative session on Thursday, where they shored up state food assistance and health care programs amid looming cuts in federal funding and spiking health insurance premiums.

The New Mexico Senate adjourned Sine die shortly after noon, and the New Mexico House of Representatives at 5:15 p.m. following passage of a $162 million spending package and four other bills. Lujan Grisham’s office

By Friday night, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham had signed four of those bills. She was still reviewing an additional bill expanding state authority to set vaccine policy independent of federal guidelines.

“This special session was about protecting New Mexico families from real and immediate harms that endanger their ability to access healthcare and put food on their tables. Here in New Mexico, we step up to take care of one another, and I’m proud to say that’s what we did for families across our state in this special session,” House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) said in a press release issued after the session concluded.

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also applauded the action taken by the Legislature and, in a press release, vowed to sign the bills. The rapid speed at which the proposals moved through the legislative process stood in contrast to last year’s special session called by the governor to address public safety, which ended after a few hours and saw no movement on priorities set by the governor.

Democrats said repeatedly that the special session was crucial to insulate New Mexico from a barrage of federal funding reductions and sweeping policy changes, especially to the state’s Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Health Care Authority estimates that 16,200 New Mexicans could lose SNAP benefits because of their immigration status, and that another 20,070 would become ineligible to continue receiving benefits because of new work requirements. They also estimate that at least 88,500 New Mexicans will permanently lose their benefits.

Senate Majority Floor Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) argued that, given years of surpluses and with $3 billion in reserves, New Mexico is in a strong position to counter some of those effects.

“Well, there is no way we can fully offset the loss of federal funds. Thankfully, our state is in a position to help New Mexicans mitigate the impact of these federal cuts, and that is what we’re doing here in this special session,” Wirth said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.

Republicans disagreed, arguing that many of the changes in the Reconciliation Bill will not take effect for months if not years, and that matters on the agenda could easily be addressed in the 30-day regular session in January.

“This special session just isn’t that special, and certainly I believe it’s wildly premature. We’re going to address some issues here based on the possibility that something might happen that’s not happening,” Senate Minority Floor Leader William Sharer (R-Farmington) said.

Spending

House Bill 1, a $161 million package in one-time spending for Medicaid, food assistance, public broadcasting, rural hospitals, and tax credits for individuals who buy insurance on state exchanges. Some $120 million in unspent money was transferred from the Healthcare Authority to cover the price tag. It also contains $100,000 for the New Mexico Department of Licensing and Regulation for interstate medical licensure compacts.

The package also contained $5.6 million in funding for public radio and education television, as well as $430,000 for educational television and public radio associated with Indian tribes and pueblos. The money comes after Congress approved and Trump signed a rescission package that canceled federal funding for public media.

Rural Healthcare Delivery Fund

Legislation, known as Senate Bill 1, which would make tweaks to the Rural Healthcare Delivery Fund, cleared the House and Senate.

Senate Bill 1 will allow practitioners and facilities eligible to receive grants from the fund to spend that money for operational costs. Previously, the money could only be used for health care start-ups or expansions of existing facilities. The measure also revised the criteria for eligibility from counties with populations or less to counties designated as high-needs geographic health professional shortage areas by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. House Bill 1 also directed $50 million to the Fund.

Backers of the bill said the adjustments were needed to address the dearth of healthcare in rural areas and allow hospitals that are projected to see revenue losses due to decreases in Medicaid and provider taxes.

Tax credits

Discussion over Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, which have been a sticking point in the government shutdown in Washington, D.C, were also on the minds of lawmakers in the Roundhouse.

The subsidies that were enacted in 2021 during the pandemic and renewed with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act are expected to sunset at the end of the year. The subsidies expanded existing tax credits for those who buy health insurance on exchanges to individuals and households making 400% or more of the Federal Poverty Level. According to the Health Care Authority, failure to extend the federal credits would cause between 15,300 and 27,100 New Mexicans to lose coverage.

Lawmakers during the session approved House Bill 2, legislation which allows people making above 400% of the federal poverty level and rely on the Exchange for health insurance coverage, to maintain eligibility for assistance from the state’s Healthcare Affordability Fund thereby allowing New Mexicans with incomes above that threshold to qualify for that aid to keep New Mexicans who depend on the lapsing federal credits from losing coverage. Senate Bill 1 also appropriated $17.3 million for the bill.

Criminal competency

Lawmakers also passed a fix to the state’s criminal competency code that will enable the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court to maintain jurisdiction in cases where defendants accused of misdemeanor offenses can be tried if they are found competent to stand trial.

Vaccines

Members of the Legislature also approved a bill that allows the state more flexibility in determining its own vaccine standards. House Democratic Majority Leader Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) previously told NM Poltical Report that changes to federal vaccine policy were causing alarms with state officials’ concerns about public health.

Al Jazeera is reporting that at least seven people were killed in southern Gaza’s al-Mawasi area that Israel designated as a safe zone.

Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunted the Global Sumud Flotilla activists taken into custody by Israel on Thursday, pointing at them and calling them “terrorists.” Reporters Without Borders said that there were more than 20 foreign reporters on board the flotilla.

Italian students occupied universities, and Italian unions called a general strike for Friday with more than 100 marches expected across the country. Protesters also took to the streets of Athens, Greece.

Nearly 60 people were arrested as they nonviolently blocked traffic to the Brooklyn Bridge. This is New York City comptroller — and ally of mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — Brad Lander.

Brad Lander: “We must today take collective responsibility for what the Israeli government has been doing, is doing today, on Yom Kippur, says, makes clear it is going to keep doing to Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank also, the bombs funded by our taxpayer dollars in the name of the Jewish state, but a desecration of Judaism.”

President Trump has embraced the government shutdown as an “unprecedented opportunity” to punish his political opponents while slashing the federal workforce and cutting off funding to whole government agencies. On Thursday, Trump said budget chief Russell Vought will have the power to decide if cuts should be “temporary or permanent.” And he said he would continue to target projects and agencies favored by Democrats.

President Donald Trump: “Well, there could be firings, and that’s their fault. And it could also be other things. I mean, we could cut projects that they wanted, favorite projects, and they’d be permanently cut.”

Democrats are demanding the reversal of cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act that will result in some 15 million people losing their health insurance coverage over the next decade. This is House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries: “This is day two of Donald Trump’s shutdown, but it is day 256 of the chaos that the Trump presidency has unleashed on the American people. Republicans have shut the government down because they don’t want to provide healthcare to working-class Americans.”

Meanwhile, the Labor Department will delay publication of its monthly jobs report that was scheduled for release today. It was expected to show a slowdown in hiring in September. Economist Erica Groshen, who formerly led the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told The Washington Post, “It’s a bad time to be missing data. We are flying blind right as the economy could be turning.”

In California, a massive explosion tore through a Chevron oil refinery in the Los Angeles suburb of El Segundo Thursday evening, sparking a fire that burned through the night and could be seen from miles away. The explosion occurred around 9:30 p.m. and prompted shelter-in-place orders until 2 a.m. No injuries have been reported. This comes as the Trump administration has moved to shut down the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent federal agency tasked with uncovering the causes of industrial disasters.

The Trump administration is asking nine public and private universities to sign a deal to help promote conservative ideas on campus in exchange for federal funding. The administration is calling it a 10-point “compact” and promised “substantial and meaningful federal grants” if universities take action against academic departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”

The Trump administration is also demanding that the universities ban the use of race or sex in hiring or admissions and cap foreign students to 15% of undergraduates. Walt Heinecke, a faculty member at the University of Virginia, one of the universities targeted by the Trump administration, warned that the memo threatens academic freedom.

Walt Heinecke: “It’s a threat. And it’s a threat that should be taken seriously and should be reacted to in a way in which I think all colleges and universities who this is — this is meant to actually be applied later to all universities and colleges, not just to the nine or 10 that have received the letter. So, that means that we should all be thinking about how to resist this particular form of intrusion.”

On Thursday California Gov. Gavin Newsom warned administrators against signing trump’s 10-point “compact.” Newsom wrote on social media, “If any California university signs this radical agreement, they’ll lose billions in state funding—including Cal Grants—instantly. California will not bankroll schools that sell out their students, professors, researchers, and surrender academic freedom.”

In Baltimore, a federal immigration judge has denied a bid for asylum by Maryland father Kilmar Abrego Garcia — though Abrego Garcia has 30 days to appeal the ruling. The judge dismissed Abrego Garcia’s argument that he faced “imminent removal to Uganda,” even though the Trump administration has repeatedly, publicly threatened to send him to Uganda or Eswatini, countries he has no ties to. Abrego Garcia first made international headlines when he was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where he was held in the notorious CECOT mega-prison.

An ICE official later admitted his deportation was an “administrative error.” He’s since faced relentless attacks on his character by President Trump and top administration officials, who’ve accused him of being a human smuggler and a member of the MS-13 gang, even though he’s not been convicted of any crimes.

A federal court in Georgia has denied an emergency request by the award-winning Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara to remain in the United States, paving the way for his deportation to El Salvador today. According to the ACLU, Guevara was not allowed to say goodbye to his wife and three children. Guevara has lived in the United States for some 20 years and has built a large following for his reporting on anti-ICE protests. He was jailed by ICE for more than 100 days, even though an immigration judge granted him bond. He was arrested in June while live-streaming a “No Kings” demonstration, even though he clearly identified himself as a journalist. We’ll have more on his case after headlines.

President Trump is declaring that the U.S. is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, following recent strikes on boats in the Caribbean — that’s according to a memo obtained by the Associated Press. The memo also states, “The United States has now reached a critical point where we must use force in self-defense and defense of others against the ongoing attacks by these designated terrorist organizations.” It comes after the U.S. attacked three boats in the Caribbean last month, reportedly killing 17 people. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino blasted the U.S. Thursday after detecting five F-35 fighter jets close to the Venezuelan coast.

Vladimir Padrino López: “The presence of these aircraft flying near our area of influence, nearby the Caribbean Sea and off the Venezuelan coast, is a vulgarity and a threat to national security. It is a serious threat. So I denounce before the world the military harassment and the military threat from the United States government against the people of Venezuela, who only want peace, work and happiness.”

The United Nations is calling for urgent action to prevent large-scale, ethnically driven atrocities in El Fasher, the besieged capital of Sudan’s North Darfur state. On Thursday, the U.N.’s top human rights official warned at least 91 civilians were killed in El Fasher last month, as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, carried out artillery shelling, drone strikes and ground incursions. The U.N. also warned the RSF against starving civilians in El Fasher as a method of warfare, amid credible reports of civilians being tortured and killed by RSF fighters for bringing food and essential supplies into the city.

British police have identified the suspect who drove a car at members of the public outside a Manchester synagogue on Thursday before attacking people with a knife. Thirty-five-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie was a British citizen of Syrian descent. He was shot dead by firearms officers just minutes after the rampage began. Manchester police report one of the two victims killed in the attack was hit by police gunfire, and one of the three people hospitalized was struck by a bullet fired by police.

Situated on private land in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, New Mexico, the Milagro solar-plus-storage project is designed to store electricity generated during peak hours in a series of batteries.

The latter project, meanwhile, is teamed with a 290MW/940MWh storage facility and the agreements were closed through Enlight’s US subsidiary Clēnera Holdings.

The initial agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank concerns the project’s 290MW solar component. It features a tax equity contribution at the commercial operation date (COD) and additional pay-go payments during the first ten years of operation.

The second agreement with M&T Bank and First Citizens Bank offers tax equity financing for the 940 MWh storage component at COD.

Together, the two partnerships account for about US$340 million in tax equity commitments at COD, with expectations to rise to nearly US$390 million when pay-go contributions are included.
