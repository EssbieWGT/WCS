The thresholds are notably lower than the previous pay package approved in 2021, which required share prices to hit $110–$295 per share.
Scaringe already owns around 2% of the company, while Musk controls about 13% of Tesla, a stake that could rise to 25% under his newly approved plan.
Analysts note that Rivian’s plan, though much smaller, draws clear inspiration from Tesla’s structure, linking extraordinary rewards to equally ambitious performance.
The new plan marks Rivian’s bid to reward long-term execution rather than short-term market performance.","Rivian’s board has approved a new compensation package for CEO RJ Scaringe worth as much as $4.6 billion over the next decade — a move that mirrors Tesla’s headline-grabbing $1 trillion pay plan for Elon Musk.

The decision underscores how Musk’s compensation structure has become a model for high-growth companies seeking to tie executive rewards to ambitious performance targets and shareholder value creation.

Rivian said the plan aims to retain its founder while keeping him focused on profitability and expansion as the company prepares to roll out its smaller, more affordable R2 SUV next year. The R2 is expected to compete directly with Tesla’s Model Y, one of the world’s best-selling electric crossovers.

The company’s decision comes amid broader financial pressure on electric vehicle makers. Rivian has struggled with slowing sales following the removal of key U.S. EV tax credits and has recently laid off about 600 workers — roughly 4.5% of its workforce — to reduce costs.

According to Reuters, the new incentive plan replaces a previous one that Rivian’s board said was unlikely to be met under current market conditions.

Under the revised plan, Scaringe will receive options to purchase up to 36.5 million shares of Rivian’s Class A stock at an exercise price of $15.22 each — the same as Thursday’s closing price. The award will vest if the company meets stock price milestones ranging from $40 to $140 per share over 10 years, alongside new operating income and cash flow goals over seven years. The thresholds are notably lower than the previous pay package approved in 2021, which required share prices to hit $110–$295 per share. Rivian canceled that deal after concluding the targets were unrealistic.

At full vesting, the new package represents about 3% of Rivian’s shares. Scaringe already owns around 2% of the company, while Musk controls about 13% of Tesla, a stake that could rise to 25% under his newly approved plan.

“RJ’s starting position makes this package much more reasonable than Musk’s,” said Vitaly Golomb, managing partner at Mavka Capital and a Rivian investor.

Tesla’s board has argued that Musk’s massive $1 trillion package, approved last week after months of controversy, was essential to keep him focused on driving the company’s value toward an $8 trillion valuation. Analysts note that Rivian’s plan, though much smaller, draws clear inspiration from Tesla’s structure, linking extraordinary rewards to equally ambitious performance.

“While Rivian may not be a direct copycat, there are definitely Elon Musk characteristics that are similar,” said Yonat Assayag, a partner at ClearBridge Compensation Group. “It’s not to keep up with Musk, but inspired by Musk’s award.”

Rivian said shareholders will gain $153 billion in value if the company hits all the milestones as part of the package, while Reuters’ calculation showed that Scaringe will get up to $4.6 billion, including the costs of exercising options.

However, not everyone is convinced that such ambitious pay designs will pay off. Amit Batish, director at research firm Equilar, noted that “while these packages sound attractive, they don’t always work out. Many CEOs struggle to hit the targets due to changing policies and economic headwinds.”

In addition to the stock-based incentives, Rivian’s board has doubled Scaringe’s base salary to $2 million, aligning his compensation more closely with shareholder returns. The automaker said the revised structure was crafted with input from an independent consultant.

Rivian also announced that Scaringe will chair the board of Mind Robotics, a new spinoff backed by external investors to develop industrial AI systems. The CEO has been granted 1 million common units in the venture, representing up to a 10% stake once profitability thresholds are met.

The new plan marks Rivian’s bid to reward long-term execution rather than short-term market performance. But as the EV industry faces intensifying competition, high borrowing costs, and uncertain demand, analysts say it will test whether tying billion-dollar compensation to future milestones can truly motivate sustainable growth — or simply replicate the high-risk model that made Tesla’s rise so polarizing.",https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Amazon-Rivian.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:19:14.079022

For the first time in 30 years, the United States was not in the room. The U.S. is expected to be absent again in two days, when the rest of the world resumes those discussions at COP30.

It will not participate because America is no longer a party to the Paris Climate Agreement, thanks to President Donald Trump.

That’s not to say the United States is not involved. Although government science programs have been shuttered and Trump has banned the use of the word “climate,” American scientists are still working on solutions. However, America remains the world’s second-largest source of carbon pollution, and it is led by a president determined to make the U.S. an outlier, an outlaw, and a free rider in the global climate movement.

The question is whether other countries will let President Trump get away with it.

America’s official position – Trump’s policies to increase fossil-fuel production, suppress clean energy technologies, and abandon carbon-cutting goals – is at least as harmful domestically as it is internationally. President Trump is actively shutting down clean energy investments, including a wind-energy project that had already broken ground.

The Trump administration’s opposition to a wind energy project off the coast of Maryland has put its sponsor, US Wind, at risk of bankruptcy. Sponsors of a wind farm off the Massachusetts coast say they will not proceed because Trump’s policies have left them with “no viable path.”

In September alone, clean energy manufacturers cancelled construction of four new plants totaling $1.6 billion in investments. General Motors has stopped production of an electric van because Trump prevailed on the U.S. Congress to eliminate EV tax credits.

Although solar and wind power are cheaper than electricity generated by fossil fuels, Trump’s policies leave the U.S. electric system dangerously dependent on the economic volatility and pollution of natural gas and coal. Natural gas is widely touted as a “transition fuel,” but its price in the United States has gone up to the point that electric utilities are turning back to coal.

Last year, before Trump took office, clean energy jobs grew three times faster than the rest of America’s workforce, providing economic momentum. Now, companies have canceled more than $22 billion in clean energy manufacturing capacity, leading to significant job losses and missed opportunities for U.S. economic growth. One estimate is that a federal budget Trump pushed through Congress in July could cost the United States more than 830,000 jobs in the next five years, signifying a major economic setback.

Trump’s carbon-intensive energy policies may put U.S. businesses at a disadvantage in international markets. The EU plans to tax carbon-intensive imports starting next year; the UK plans the same in 2027. Other nations could follow. Companies that continue exporting carbon-intensive products will lose market share, and their American employees will lose jobs.

Nevertheless, Trump continues branding climate change as a hoax and a scam.

Why do his policies make America an international outlaw? A new study by the University of Washington estimates that Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris pact will raise the planet’s temperature by an additional 0.1 percent, assuming all other countries meet their goals. That doesn’t sound like much, but it means the chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees, the upper limit set in Paris, will decrease from 34 percent to 27 percent. The study’s lead author, Prof. Adrian Raftery, says this is the most optimistic calculation of Trump’s impact.

Trump has used the threat of trade tariffs to extort the European Union and other nations into buying U.S. oil and gas, despite their own commitments under the Paris Agreement. The administration, joined by Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, just blocked a proposed global tax on carbon pollution from shipping, a policy developed over 10 years.

In short, Trump has turned America from a global leader on mitigating climate change to a “go-it-alone pariah.”

However, the United States remains a signatory to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In July, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that signatory nations are obligated to cooperate in combating climate change. Even if the United States tried to withdraw from the UNFCCC, the ICJ cited other international treaties that require countries to “fulfill their duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence,” especially in situations such as global warming, where the climate system is a “resource shared by all states.”

In the ICJ’s opinion, countries failing to meet their environmental obligations are liable for paying damages and reparations. Although no country has sued the United States yet, Trump’s reckless and renegade energy policies may make it only a matter of time.

Yet, while the United States complicates the world’s ability to stabilize the climate, it is not the only problem. Efforts to hold global warming to well below 2°C are lacking in many other nations, as is progress on most of the world’s other 3,000 multilateral environmental agreements, including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

In addition, scientists convened by the Stockholm Resilience Institute, who defined nine critical planetary boundaries in 2009, say we have now crossed into dangerous territory for seven. Analysts say the barriers to international collaboration on environmental agreements include a lack of political will, limited resources, weak enforcement mechanisms, fragmented governance, and disagreements over who is responsible for ecological damages and threats. However, these problems are not unsolvable.

Trump’s international bullying raises the question of what else he may be doing to subvert the world’s timely transition to clean energy. It is worrying that three other countries joined the U.S. to stall the tax on carbon pollution from shipping. All countries must hold fast to the Paris Agreement. The United States will be back.

As for COP30, the best outcome would be for the remaining 195 countries in the Paris pact to demonstrate how nations can navigate the barriers to fulfill the visions of two of our great departed naturalists.

Theologian Thomas Berry, who died in 2009, declared that “Reconnecting the human species with the rest of the world is the great work of the 21st century.”

If executed effectively, Ghana’s approach to green industrial zones could serve as a model for other African nations seeking to balance economic development with environmental sustainability.","Ghana’s Free Zones are quietly transforming into the country’s new investment frontier, positioning themselves as engines for sustainable manufacturing and clean energy integration. With over 290 licensed enterprises already operating, these zones now face a defining moment as global supply chains demand greener industrial credentials before committing capital.

Two major solar projects signal this shift: the 200 megawatt peak (MWp) solar development at the Dawa Industrial Zone by Solar For Industries Limited, and the 16.82MWp rooftop solar installation within the Tema Export Processing Zone by Helios Solar Energy. President John Dramani Mahama broke ground for the Dawa solar park on November 6, naming it the Norbert Anku Solar Park. The facility will eventually expand to 1,000MWp by 2032.

The Tema project, commissioned in July 2024, became Africa’s largest single rooftop solar installation, covering 95,754 square metres atop the International Warehousing Company Mega Warehouse. The International Finance Corporation provided $30 million in financing for clean power and water infrastructure, expecting the solar plant to cut Ghana’s emissions by approximately 13,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year.

Renewable energy has moved beyond being an optional feature for industrial parks. It’s now a prerequisite for competitiveness, particularly as manufacturing firms face mounting pressure to reduce carbon footprints and comply with international trade standards. Power reliability challenges in sub-Saharan Africa force businesses to shoulder significant costs, with energy expenses eating into operating margins and deterring foreign investment.

The next generation of Special Economic Zones will need sustainability and innovation baked into their core design. This matches the global pattern where investors increasingly require proof of environmental performance before committing funds. The commercial logic proves compelling: companies operating in renewable-powered zones can slash operating costs, meet international carbon standards, and tap into climate finance instruments that weren’t available to conventional industrial parks.

Ghana’s Free Zones and future SEZs could become testing grounds for green bond backed industrial finance, offering companies reduced borrowing costs when they adopt clean energy and resource efficiency upgrades. This creates opportunities not just for large foreign firms but also for local suppliers who can integrate into these greener value chains.

The government’s role centers on bridging the financing gap through targeted tax incentives, blended finance partnerships, and transparent sustainability metrics. Investors commit capital when they see that green SEZs deliver profits, not just compliance. High capital costs for renewable infrastructure and limited concessional financing remain obstacles that require coordinated policy responses.

The Dawa solar project will supply power to the Enclave Power Company network serving industrial clients rather than Ghana’s national grid. Industries within the Dawa Industrial Enclave will receive a 10 percent discount on power sourced from the solar park, according to Kojo Aduhene, Chief Executive Officer of Quarm Investments.

President Mahama emphasized that solar powered industrial parks help protect Ghanaian jobs, maintain market access, and position the country’s industries to compete under the African Continental Free Trade Area and other trade agreements. He noted that Ghana’s industries must stay competitive under new global regulations, including the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which will penalize exports from countries with high carbon footprints.

For local businesses, the opportunity lies in becoming suppliers to global firms operating within these zones. This represents a critical pathway toward inclusive growth, allowing Ghanaian enterprises to participate in international value chains while meeting stringent environmental standards.

The global race for sustainable manufacturing has begun. Countries that successfully integrate clean energy into their industrial zones will attract investment flows that bypass traditional fossil fuel dependent locations. Ghana possesses the natural resources, policy frameworks, and geographic advantages to capture a meaningful share of these green value chains.

Under Ghana’s National Renewable Energy Master Plan, the government has set a target to achieve at least 15 percent renewable energy share by 2030. Solar projects like those at Dawa and Tema advance this goal while aligning Ghana with the global clean energy transition.

The potential remains significant, but realizing it demands bold and coordinated policy action. Ghana’s Free Zones and SEZs could deliver more than export revenues. They could fundamentally redefine the country’s growth model, making it cleaner, more competitive, and more sustainable. Success requires moving beyond incremental changes toward integrated strategies that treat renewable energy, water management, and industrial development as interconnected priorities rather than separate initiatives.

If executed effectively, Ghana’s approach to green industrial zones could serve as a model for other African nations seeking to balance economic development with environmental sustainability. The window for action is narrowing as global investors increasingly allocate capital based on climate performance and long term sustainability rather than short term cost advantages alone.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-11-08 15:19:26.531596

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front—especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules—cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again—leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation Whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect. That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations—but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s Policies Are Costing Drivers More

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse-gas emission regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.","https://media.wired.com/photos/690c98a327a9fa6b4e201c19/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/e32fe4e60967b2faa0cc8d32427b3271af63fc94.jpeg",N,,2025-11-08 15:04:00.945807

They believe that Brazil will continue to use coal despite having over 80% of its electricity from renewable sources. As Brazil prepares to host the UN climate summit COP30, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed concern that the war in Ukraine has revived coal mining.

Coal plants, including Candiota, still supply 3% of Brazil’s electricity, highlighting the influence of special interest groups and the absence of a proper transition plan away from coal. Experts like Christine Shearer from Global Energy Monitor argue that Brazil has the resources to phase out coal, but the strong coal lobby in mining regions keeps these plants running.

The Candiota plant lost its government contract last year, leading to local economic downturns and outmigration. It now sells energy on the spot market during peak hours when solar and wind energy are less available. Nevertheless, Brazil’s Congress recently passed a bill allowing coal plants to operate until 2040, which Lula could potentially veto. The government also made coal eligible for a capacity auction aimed at improving energy security by using thermal plants during low renewable output.

Critics note that including coal in these plans contradicts the goal of energy flexibility, as coal plants cannot start quickly. They argue that poor long-term planning allows coal to persist, despite a surplus of clean energy that goes underutilized due to inadequate demand and transmission infrastructure. This situation makes the government susceptible to coal and natural gas lobbying, leading to higher financial and environmental costs.

Ambar asserts that coal from the Candiota plant is reliable and necessary for power supply, denying claims of relying on political influence. They also argue that critics prioritize the interests of large energy consumers over those of smaller entities and the broader public. Keeping coal operational aligns Brazil with countries like India and South Africa, where strong lobby groups impede efforts to transition away from coal, which is crucial to local economies.

Shutting down Candiota could result in around 10,000 job losses in the region. Local coal miner Jose Adolfo de Carvalho asserts that eliminating the plant won’t significantly impact global carbon issues. The future of the plant causes anxiety among residents, with former employee Graca dos Santos emphasizing the need for a just energy transition to avoid leaving the community jobless.

Lula’s administration lacks a transition plan for Candiota, and little progress has been made in strategizing for other coal facilities. Some suggest diversifying into sectors like beef, wine, and olive oil, which could provide new jobs for former coal workers. Local union leader Hermelindo Ferreira highlights the potential job losses from shutting down Candiota while recognizing that faith in the coal industry is wavering.

The EU is contemplating its industrial decarbonization options as it aims to reach its 2030 clean energy goals. For far too long, the nuclear sector has largely been overlooked and at times completely ignored as a safe method to efficiently produce energy while not harming the environment, no more, says the EU.

The European Union is rolling out its first auction for industrial heat decarbonization

The heads of the EU Commission recently launched the very first pilot auction to decarbonize industrial heat. However, the new pilot auction does not include the nuclear sector, which has not stopped operators from commissioning atomic projects across the continent.

Europe has set itself some lofty and ambitious goals to decarbonize its energy sector by the end of the decade; however, the exclusion of the nuclear sector in its new auction round has raised fears over the continent’s ability to meet its self-imposed targets for decarbonization.

Process heat remains a major hindrance in the world’s decarbonization dreams

Processed heat from the industrial sector is among the speed bumps on the path towards a full-scale decarbonization of the energy sector, and several industry insiders have lamented the EU’s failure to prioritize the process heat issue as a main driver of the emissions problems that the world has been subjected to.

In October of this year, the EU launched the new and controversial initiative that aims to accelerate the decarbonization of the process heat created by energy operators on the continent. It should be noted that the nuclear sector has been excluded from the decarbonization initiative enacted by the EU Commission.

Despite the proclivity that Europe has for the unconventional, nuclear power on the continent is gaining momentum

Several industry experts have stated that process heat is the last piece of the puzzle that Europe and the world need to deal with in order to meet their decarbonization goals. The International Energy Agency, among the myriad of other energy sector watchdogs, has repeatedly flagged process heat as a major hindrance for the world in decarbonizing the energy sector.

Process heat accounts for a substantial amount of the energy sector’s emissions, and has been overlooked as the last hurdle that the world needs to jump over to meet its emission goals set out during the Paris Agreement in 2016.

Some European nations have not forgotten about the oldest of the renewable energy sources

Crucially, nuclear can alleviate the pressure to decarbonize, which is something that the EU seems to have forgotten. The cornerstone of the renewable energy sector has seen a substantial increase in commissioning as the world contemplates the best way to decarbonize process heat in the industrial sector.

Slovakia recently announced that it is evaluating US nuclear technology for a planned project that could transform the nation’s energy landscape.

Continuing to rely on fossil fuels no longer brings prosperity — it brings destruction.
Clean energy industries are creating millions of new jobs, stimulating innovation and strengthening energy independence.
They must commit to a clear, coordinated plan to phase out fossil fuels within the next 20 years, with measurable milestones and accountability.
The path away from fossil fuels is not one of sacrifice, but of renewal — of cleaner air, healthier people, more secure societies, and flourishing economies.","As the world prepares to gather in Belém, Brazil, for COP30, we appeal to all heads of state and government representatives attending: let this be the moment when the world finally unites around a plan to transition away from fossil fuels within the next two decades. The responsible approach, the only moral and economic choice, is to start that transition immediately. COP30 must be the place where the world’s nations agree on concrete, collective steps to phase out the burning of coal, oil, and gas and build the clean energy future that is already within reach.

The science is unambiguous, and the consequences are visible everywhere: devastating floods, heatwaves, fires and droughts are erasing decades of progress in development and social justice. The planetary emergency is not a distant threat — it is a direct attack on the world’s hard-won goals of eradicating poverty, ending hunger, protecting the environment and ensuring peace and stability. Every tonne of carbon emitted deepens inequality and undermines the foundations of human progress. No nation, no matter how wealthy or isolated, is immune.

Development and fossil fuels were once intertwined, but today that link is broken. Continuing to rely on fossil fuels no longer brings prosperity — it brings destruction. It erodes food security, drives migration, increases health costs and inflames conflicts. Around the world, communities that have contributed least to the problem are suffering the most from its effects. That is neither just nor sustainable. The only way to secure a stable and peaceful century is to phase out the burning of fossil fuels and replace them with clean, renewable and equitable sources of energy.

We also recognise the real challenges of getting there, particularly in developing nations where energy demand continues to rise and fossil fuels still underpin many economies. Leaders of nations across Latin America, Asia and Africa face intense pressures over oil expansion. This makes global solidarity and strong support essential for a just and achievable transition.

This transition is not a burden — it is an opportunity of historic proportions. The cost of renewable energy has plummeted over the past decade. Solar and wind power are now the cheapest sources of new electricity in most countries. Clean technologies like electric mobility, energy storage, green hydrogen and smart grids are advancing faster than anyone predicted. Across Africa, Asia, Latin America and beyond, distributed solar systems and mini-grids are bringing electricity to people who never had it before — quickly, affordably and without pollution. In cities and rural areas alike, these technologies are creating jobs, improving health, and giving communities control over their own energy futures.

Business leaders already understand this. Investments in renewable energy, green infrastructure and sustainable industries are not just ethical choices; they are the most rational economic ones. Clean energy industries are creating millions of new jobs, stimulating innovation and strengthening energy independence. Renewables are also inherently more secure for nations that currently rely on imported fossil fuels, reducing vulnerability to price shocks and geopolitical disruption. By contrast, fossil fuels expose countries to volatile prices, geopolitical instability, and stranded assets. The clean transition is, in every sense, the pathway to economic resilience and prosperity.

Addressing these challenges demands a major lift in climate and transition finance. Without it, the world’s most vulnerable nations cannot move at the speed required. We also recognize that this transition must be fair and inclusive. Workers, communities and developing nations that currently depend on fossil fuel economies deserve support and partnership to diversify and thrive. This requires international cooperation, not competition — coordination, not isolation. The task before us is vast, but the cost of inaction is immeasurably greater.

This is why COP30 is so crucial. Three decades after the Rio Earth Summit first placed sustainable development at the center of global diplomacy, and 10 years after the Paris Agreement on climate change, the world returns to Brazil facing an existential challenge. Belém offers a symbolic and practical opportunity to realign global ambition with planetary reality. Leaders must arrive ready to go beyond words and targets. They must commit to a clear, coordinated plan to phase out fossil fuels within the next 20 years, with measurable milestones and accountability.

The tools are in our hands. The economics are on our side. The moral case is undeniable. What is needed now is courage and unity. The world has shown before that when faced with a global challenge, we can act together — to end wars, cure diseases, and rebuild after crises. This is one of those moments.

As you and representatives from your governments gather in Brazil, you have a chance to show future generations that you rose to meet the defining test of our time.

However, as the European market moves inexorably towards EVs, despite US reticence, a more fundamental weakness is evident: the lack of local battery production.
But in the long term the biggest task for the European Union is to really think about how to allocate European battery production in Europe.
I'm talking about really building up European battery manufacturing.","European car manufacturing is facing a pincer maneuver of threats. From the East, China’s automotive industry is stretching its wings across the global market. To the West, the lucrative American economy has become both unpredictable and less easily accessible. But BMW is confident it has the right strategy to combat the challenges. I talked to BMW Board Member Ilka Horstmeier about how the company plans to cope with current automotive uncertainties.

BMW’s Bet On Electrification Is More Of A Hedge

BMW’s launch of the first Neue Klasse cars would imply that it’s focusing on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) just as US ambivalence towards electrification is growing. Indeed, the company ceased making internal combustion engines (ICE) at its oldest, flagship plant in Munich in November 2023, moving production to Steyr in Austria and Hams Hall in the UK. Instead, Munich will exclusively make BEVs, and BMW has simultaneously been retooling the plant for the Neue Klasse sedan while continuing to manufacture up to 1,000 cars a day.

However, the official BMW strategy, as explained to me recently by Chairman Oliver Zipse, is to keep its options open. As the US market for EVs softens while Europe and China press ahead, BMW’s global production footprint provides some resilience, and the ability to vary its plans by region. “We didn't need to adjust our strategy overall,” says Horstmeier. “Even three years ago, we were saying that we don't put all our eggs in one basket, because times are volatile. Even in Europe, the prerequisites for 100% electric are not there and will not be there until the 2030s. Either it's charging infrastructure or affordable green energy.”

BMW’s philosophy has long been that there is more to sustainable automaking than just switching to battery electric vehicles. “We remain technology open, while at the same time reducing the CO2 footprint of the whole value chain,” says Horstmeier. “This is what counts for climate change and not what the drivetrain of a car is. We don’t need to fundamentally change our strategy. We're adjusting volumes and what type of car we produce in which plant.” This strategy not only addresses the uneven transition to electro mobility, but also the tariff fluctuations that have buffeted the year so far. “You never know what's happening the next day. But the genetic code of our production network and system is flexibility. That's the reason why we can react better to changes than others. Most of our plants can produce all the drivetrains in their production system.”

BMW Facing Chip Challenges, But Batteries Remain Problematic

One change that BMW has been having to react to recently has been the chip supply issues caused by the Dutch government’s takeover of Nexperia and China’s reaction of limiting exports. “We have shown in the chip environment we had in 2021-22 that we are very adaptive with regard to these types of volatility,” argues Horstmeier, referring to a previous chip shortage that shocked the automotive market. “We are watching what is happening. We are in close contact with our suppliers regarding what they can supply daily. And we make decisions as late as possible, because that was the differentiator in 21-22 with that chip shortage. We always use our own flexibility instruments.” At the time of writing, the Nexperia chip challenge was showing signs of receding.

However, as the European market moves inexorably towards EVs, despite US reticence, a more fundamental weakness is evident: the lack of local battery production. “An electric car needs a battery, that's for sure,” says Horstmeier. This threat is accentuated by hard targets of ending internal combustion engine sales by 2035 in the EU and UK, which makes the lack of local battery supply a strategic threat to European automakers. “Every car manufacturer in that situation must look for resilience in their supply chain. But there are not that many options that we have. We use all suppliers. In the short term, the game has been played. But in the long term the biggest task for the European Union is to really think about how to allocate European battery production in Europe. I'm not talking about Chinese suppliers coming to Europe. I'm talking about really building up European battery manufacturing. This generation of batteries is done. We must look for the next generation and the whole supply chain, because it's not only battery and cell production, but also about all the raw materials you need. A strategic plan now in Europe to look for the next generation of batteries, and what we can do there, would be helpful. That's what we are talking about with the European Commission.”

Horstmeier isn’t implying that Europe has been caught doing nothing but argues that greater unity of purpose is required. She compares the situation to charging infrastructure, where manufacturers joined forces to create the necessary high-speed charging network for long-distance EV driving. BMW is part of the consortium behind IONITY, alongside Ford, Hyundai Motor Group, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group. “We have a lot of discussions in Europe about how to allocate battery production here,” she explains. But the first point is that we don’t only need battery production. If we look at resilient supply chains, we need raw materials. We need all the prerequisites for battery cell production. Then we must look for the production sites. It's a joint effort. In the next years, we must see whether we are all together and really move the needle in a different direction.”

From BMW Circularity To Solid State

Obtaining the necessary minerals for local European battery production is one reason why BMW sees its push towards recycling and a circular material economy as so crucial. With a circular recycling ecosystem, the minerals in existing batteries can be extracted to create new ones. That way, even if the batteries were originally imported, their minerals stay in Europe when built into new European vehicles.

That still leaves the issue of manufacturing. Europe has had obvious problems building up strong local battery cell production. Northvolt filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, and the UK’s Britishvolt failed before even constructing a factory. “You need a couple of prerequisites,” says Horstmeier. “You need the raw materials. You need to understand where to get them from and how to secure them. You need the competency to build up cells efficiently.” Horstemeier argues that BMW is in a good position here because it has invested in a battery competence center, based in Munich, which opened in 2019. The company also has local high-voltage assembly plants in Woodruff, South Carolina (USA), Irlbach-Straßkirchen, Lower Bavaria (Germany), Debrecen (Hungary), Shenyang (China) and San Luis Potosí (Mexico). “We know what a battery looks like, but the industrialization and scaling are tricky tasks, even for experienced cell manufacturers. Whenever battery technology changes, it’s quite a while until production runs stable.”","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/690e2faf5242d8c03002f6c0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1553,873,x242,y459,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",N,,2025-11-08 14:03:36.642233

St. Louis Community Credit Union used its certification as a Community Development Financial Institution to invest more than $40 million in loans.
The Community Development Financial Institution Fund is a nonpartisan program that meets these standards.","Revitalizing American communities and industries has been a core priority for the Trump administration. Congress and federal agencies are pursuing policies aimed at increasing financial resilience and spurring economic growth with this priority in mind, while also providing relief to millions of Americans and Main Streets across the country.

In my former role as president of America’s Credit Unions, I saw a program with a proven track record of success accomplish this goal. It is the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides federal grants for projects that drive business development, job creation, affordable housing and financial literacy.

Across the country, 1,400-plus institutions in this program provide more than $300 billion in financial services each year, serving communities that struggle with these issues, from rural and Native American communities to low-income neighborhoods across the country.

Unfortunately, as part of the ongoing government shutdown and resulting reduction-in-force plans, the entire staff of the fund received notice their positions are being eliminated. This raises huge questions about the future of the fund and the future of nearly 500 participating credit unions.

Every Community Development Financial Institution Fund dollar granted to a credit union generates $12 in private investment. This has helped credit unions invest $85 billion in community mortgage lending, $91 billion in local consumer financing, $30 billion in lending to local businesses and $18 billion in affordable small dollar loans and alternatives to payday loans.

For example, Lake Trust Credit Union has issued $5 million in microloans in Michigan by treating small business funding as personal loans, which results in approvals in days rather than weeks. This investment allows local entrepreneurs to launch and scale businesses while supporting their community.

In Missouri, Alltru Credit Union embedded its no-cost Employee Wellness Benefits Program with two 30-employee firms: a STEAM-focused child care center and an in-home health-care agency. The program offers on-site credit-builder loans, fee-free Health Savings Accounts and small emergency lines, helping owners retain talent while giving workers the tools to steady household budgets.

St. Louis Community Credit Union used its certification as a Community Development Financial Institution to invest more than $40 million in loans. The credit union serves more than 52,000 members and has been able to bridge the gap between mission-driven institutions and local entrepreneurs, channeling resources in ways that improve household stability, generate jobs, and fuel economic development.

Support for the fund is bipartisan and bicameral. Last month, the Senate included a package of improvements to the fund in its passage of the National Defense Authorization Act.

This provision would increase congressional oversight of the fund, expanding a congressional and regulatory foundation to offer safe credit, small business finance, affordable housing and wealth building.

A recent bicameral effort led by Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) highlighted the impact of these financial institutions to the Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget.

Government programs must be effective and cost efficient to protect taxpayers. The Community Development Financial Institution Fund is a nonpartisan program that meets these standards. With positive impact on communities, return on investment and strong bipartisan support, the fund’s dissolution is not the answer.

The fund works — it turns small amounts of federal dollars into truly impactful investments in communities. By preserving the fund, Congress will ensure it can meet its statutory mission once the shutdown ends.

We urge the administration to examine how the fund can support its priorities in financial resilience and economic growth, and, through this program, allow credit unions to continue unleashing domestic economic opportunity in communities across America.

Once certified, the state will send Shell’s permit to the EPA as part of Pennsylvania’s official Clean Air Act compliance plan.
Hilary Starcher-O’Toole is the executive director of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC).","The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection recently announced a plan to certify the Shell plastics plant’s air permit in Beaver County as meeting the federal “reasonably available control technology” (RACT) requirements for ozone pollution.

This certification, published in the Oct. 4 Pennsylvania Bulletin, claims that Shell’s permit already contains the necessary controls to meet the Clean Air Act’s 2015 ozone standards. I believe Shell’s dozens of notices of violation – including rolling 12-month exceedances of nitrogen oxides (NOx) – show otherwise.

As a lifelong Beaver County resident and executive director of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community (BCMAC), I find this determination deeply concerning. Residents living near Shell have endured repeated flaring events, strong chemical odors and air quality violations since the plant began operations. To suggest that Shell’s permit meets “best available” standards without transparent public review or meaningful on-site inspections by the DEP ispremature and disregards what Beaver County residents have witnessed firsthand.

Let’s be clear: NOx is a critical precursor to ozone formation. When a major facility like Shell repeatedly exceeds permitted NOx limits, the risks to local and downwind ozone levels don’t vanish. For context, Beaver County remains designated as a nonattainment area for ozone under the 2015 federal standard, meaning our air still fails to meet the health-based limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency. This designation reflects ongoing violations of national air quality standards meant to protect the public from smog-related respiratory and cardiovascular harm.

The DEP’s notice triggers a 30-day public comment period, which has been extended to Nov. 21. This is the public’s opportunity to demand accountability and insist that regulators fully examine the facility’s record of violations, equipment malfunctions and community impacts before granting federal certification.

Beaver County families deserve a permitting process based on evidence and accountability, not expedience.

Residents can submit comments to RA-EPAIRCOMMENTS@pa.gov through Nov. 21. They might also question why the public hearing was held in Allegheny County during work hours when Beaver County residents are the ones living with the consequences of ongoing malfunctions.

Please don’t underestimate this process. Once certified, the state will send Shell’s permit to the EPA as part of Pennsylvania’s official Clean Air Act compliance plan. This decision will shape how Shell is regulated for years to come. Our public comments become part of the official record – a reflection of whether we stood by silently or spoke out to defend the health of our families, neighbors and friends, and the future of our region when we had the chance.

The U.S. Government Shutdown: What Does it Mean for Your Flights?

The U.S. government shutdown is wreaking havoc across the nation, and airports are bearing the brunt of this financial disaster. Detroit, Honolulu, Orlando, Portland, Chicago, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Newark, and Anchorage are facing major flight reductions due to the shutdown.

Thousands of passengers are already feeling the consequences, and the worst is yet to come. In this article, we will expose the cold truth about how this government shutdown is directly impacting these key U.S. airports. If you’re flying soon, especially from these hubs, keep reading to uncover the devastating effects and how they will affect your plans.

Flight Cancellations Surge: What’s Behind the Chaos at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport?

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), a major hub in Michigan, is one of the first to face drastic cuts as a result of the U.S. government shutdown. Over 4% of flights at DTW have already been cancelled, with more disruptions expected. Experts are warning that if the shutdown continues, flight cancellations could surge by as much as 10%.

DTW is struggling under the weight of unpaid air traffic controllers, and the FAA has ordered reductions at 40 of the busiest airports nationwide. For Detroit, this means heightened stress, delays, and frustration for travelers. Already, dozens of people are stranded or forced to reschedule their flights as the airport struggles to keep up with demand.

The impact of the shutdown on DTW should not be underestimated. The airport is experiencing a sharp decline in flight reliability, and travellers can expect much longer waiting times. If you’re flying from Detroit, it’s essential to check your flight status frequently. This shutdown is not only disrupting your travel plans but also creating an unpredictable environment where flight operations could change without warning. The financial implications are enormous.

Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport Faces Flight Reductions Amid FAA Cuts

As of November 7, 2025, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) is among the airports affected by the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) flight reduction measures. This decision comes as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown continues to impact air traffic operations, leading to cancellations and delays at major airports across the country.

The FAA’s flight reduction initiative aims to alleviate strain on the air traffic control system, which is operating under reduced staffing due to the shutdown. As a result, travelers flying through DTW may experience disruptions, including flight cancellations, longer wait times, and delays in processing.

Stay Informed and Prepared

If you’re planning to travel through DTW in the coming days, it’s crucial to stay updated on your flight’s status. We recommend that passengers regularly check with their airline for real-time information on cancellations or changes to their flight schedule. With the FAA’s flight reductions in place, certain flights may be canceled, and the schedule could change unexpectedly.

To help you stay ahead of potential disruptions, here are some key tips for navigating these challenging conditions:

Download Your Airline’s App and Enable Notifications:

Most airlines offer apps that provide live updates and notifications. By enabling push notifications, you’ll receive the most accurate and immediate alerts about any changes to your flight, including cancellations, gate changes, and delays.

Check Your Flight Status Before Heading to the Airport:

Always verify your flight’s status with your airline before leaving for DTW. This simple step can save you time and ensure that you’re not caught off guard by last-minute cancellations or delays. Airline websites and mobile apps provide the most up-to-date information regarding your flight.

Ensure Your Contact Information is Current:

Make sure your airline has your correct and up-to-date contact information. Airlines often rely on this data to send crucial updates, such as schedule changes or flight cancellations. If you’ve changed your phone number or email address since booking, take a moment to update your details with the airline to ensure you don’t miss any important notifications.

Pack Your Patience:

Given the current situation, delays and cancellations are more likely, so it’s important to approach your travel with a sense of patience. With air traffic control and staffing issues at play, things may take longer than usual. Arriving early at the airport and allowing plenty of time for check-in and security is essential, especially if your flight is affected by the reduction measures.

The Impact on DTW and What It Means for Travelers

While DTW is a major hub for domestic and international flights, it is now facing the same challenges that other high-traffic airports are dealing with under the FAA’s flight reduction order. These cuts are necessary due to the reduced availability of air traffic controllers, many of whom are working without pay due to the ongoing government shutdown.

In light of these circumstances, the airport is urging travelers to be proactive and flexible with their plans. The Airport Authority, airlines, and federal partners are working diligently to manage the evolving situation, but the travel experience will inevitably be affected.

By staying informed and prepared, you can minimize the stress of these travel disruptions and ensure a smoother experience when flying through Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. We thank you for your patience and understanding as we all adapt to the challenges posed by the ongoing government shutdown.

Honolulu’s Travel Nightmare: Government Shutdown Forces Severe Flight Cuts

Honolulu International Airport (HNL), also known as Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, is another key player in the ongoing shutdown saga. The FAA has ordered drastic reductions here as well, even though Hawaii’s airports typically experience fewer disruptions.

HNL is a vital link between the U.S. mainland and the Pacific. For tourists and business travellers alike, this disruption is catastrophic. The government shutdown means less air traffic control staff, creating delays and increased risk of cancellations. Flights are being reduced by around 4%, and in the coming weeks, it’s likely this number will rise as more airports face strain.

Honolulu’s tourism industry, which is heavily reliant on smooth air travel, is feeling the pinch. The impact extends beyond just travellers — the entire Hawaiian economy will suffer unless swift action is taken. The government shutdown, at least for now, is casting a dark shadow over Hawaii’s bustling airport and further exacerbating the challenges for a destination already struggling with rising costs and visitor numbers.

Orlando International Airport: A Perfect Storm for Flight Disruptions

Orlando International Airport (MCO) is facing a perfect storm as the government shutdown escalates. With 4% of flights already being slashed, the pressure is mounting on the city’s busiest gateway. And that’s not the worst of it — experts are warning that the airport could experience up to a 10% reduction in flights, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded during the busy holiday season.

For those travelling to Orlando for family vacations or business, the situation is becoming more precarious. The city’s theme parks, conventions, and events depend heavily on uninterrupted flight schedules, but now that dream is shattering. Airports like MCO are the first to feel the impact, with delays and cancellations worsening by the day. Airlines are scrambling to accommodate passengers, but the reality is, there is only so much they can do when the very systems they rely on are compromised by the shutdown.

Expect your Orlando trip to be fraught with unexpected delays and longer-than-usual wait times. The longer the shutdown drags on, the worse it gets, and the 10% reduction forecast is just the beginning. If you have a flight booked from Orlando, the situation is only going to get worse.

Portland International Airport Faces Growing Strain from US Shutdown

Portland International Airport (PDX) is not immune to the ongoing chaos. With the FAA slashing air traffic at 40 airports, Portland has found itself caught in the crossfire. The growing strain on resources is evident as more cancellations are reported each day.

PDX is a smaller airport compared to some of the others on this list, but it’s still a crucial hub for those travelling across the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately, the government shutdown means fewer staff, longer wait times, and a higher likelihood of flight delays.

Local reports indicate that delays could worsen in the coming weeks, with travellers facing an uncertain future. As air traffic control issues compound the challenges at PDX, passengers are urged to remain vigilant, prepared for longer waits, and ready to adjust their travel plans.

Chicago Midway International Airport Faces Major Flight Cancellations

Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW) is another major airport grappling with the fallout of the shutdown. Known for its high volume of Southwest Airlines flights, MDW is already experiencing delays, and with over 4% of flights cancelled, things aren’t looking good for passengers flying in and out of this key hub.

Midway’s status as a secondary airport in the Windy City doesn’t shield it from the chaos wreaking havoc on major airports. Flight cancellations and delays are inevitable as the FAA struggles to cope with the ongoing staffing shortages. For travellers, the message is clear: If you’re flying out of Chicago Midway, expect to encounter problems that could cause major disruptions to your schedule.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport: A Disaster in the Making

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is one of the busiest airports in the world and certainly one of the most important for air travel in the U.S. With the government shutdown affecting air traffic control operations nationwide, ATL is struggling to keep up.

Already, passengers are seeing flight cancellations, delays, and unpredictable flight schedules. The 10% reduction forecast for high-traffic airports like ATL will cause significant issues. The airport’s size and volume mean the number of disruptions is far greater here than at many other airports.

For those planning to travel through ATL, expect long lines, increased stress, and potentially even flight rerouting. The FAA’s mandated reductions are taking a toll on all U.S. airports, and ATL is no exception. With the shutdown likely to continue, the pressure on air travel is set to mount even further.

Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport: More Trouble Amid Shutdown

The impact of the government shutdown is not just confined to the major hubs. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) is also feeling the pinch. Although it doesn’t boast the same volume of traffic as some of the larger airports, CVG is still a critical airport for regional flights.

Passengers here are facing reduced services and higher chances of cancellations as the shutdown reduces FAA oversight. While the airport may not face the same sheer volume of disruption as larger airports, those flying from CVG should still prepare for significant delays and service reductions.

Newark Liberty International Airport Faces Worsening Travel Disruptions

Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is on the frontline of the ongoing shutdown. As one of the largest international airports in the country, Newark is bracing for an influx of cancellations. The 4% flight reduction initially forecast could escalate quickly, leading to delays, cancellations, and more passenger frustration.

For passengers trying to catch international flights or connecting through Newark, this means potential chaos. Already, major airlines are warning of potential disruptions as the shutdown continues, and Newark is at the centre of these changes.

Anchorage International Airport Struggles to Cope with Shutdown Chaos

Anchorage International Airport (ANC) may be remote, but that hasn’t shielded it from the fallout of the government shutdown. As the FAA reduces flight capacity across the country, even this less-busy airport is seeing the effects. Anchorage’s role as a key hub for Alaskan and international flights has made it vulnerable to disruptions.

For those travelling through ANC, the shutdown will likely create delays, especially on flights that rely on specific air traffic control staffing. While the shutdown might not have the same magnitude of impact here as in other cities, travellers should remain cautious and monitor their flight status closely.

FAA Announces Flight Reductions Amid U.S. Government Shutdown to Ensure Air Travel Safety

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Bryan Bedford outlined proactive measures to ensure the highest safety standards in the national airspace system during the ongoing government shutdown. These measures include a temporary 10 percent reduction in flights at 40 high-traffic airports across the country.

Since the shutdown began, air traffic controllers have been working without pay, leading to mounting staffing issues at air traffic facilities nationwide. This strain on the system has resulted in increased delays and concerns about safety, with 2,740 delays reported just this past weekend.

“This isn’t about politics – it’s about assessing the data and alleviating the risks as controllers continue to work without pay,” said Secretary Duffy. “It’s safe to fly today, and it will continue to be safe next week because of the proactive actions we are taking.”

FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford added, “We are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely.”

Flight Reductions Timeline and Key Actions

A 4 percent reduction in operations will take effect Friday, November 7, with gradual increases:

6 percent by November 11

8 percent by November 13

10 percent by November 14

Additionally, the FAA will impose restrictions on certain operations:

Prohibit some visual flight rule approaches (VFR) at affected facilities.

Commercial space launches and reentries will be restricted to 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time.

Parachute operations and photo missions near impacted facilities will be prohibited.

These actions are based on the FAA’s review of aviation safety data, including voluntary, confidential safety reports filed by pilots and air traffic controllers. The data points to increased stress, which heightens safety risks.

Refunds and International Flights

Airlines are required to issue full refunds for affected flights, though secondary costs, such as accommodations, will not be covered. Importantly, the FAA’s flight reduction measures do not extend to international flights. Carriers will have the discretion to decide which domestic flights to cancel to meet the required reductions.

Solar power is now the fastest, most economical way to introduce more kilowatts into the US grid, and things are about to get a lot more interesting. Traditional silicon solar cells are relatively expensive and difficult to manufacture compared to the up-and-coming crop of photovoltaic technologies to emerge from the lab. In particular, new perovskite solar cells are finally beginning to hit the marketplace.

The Perovskite Solar Cell Story

The first practical silicon solar cell was introduced by Bell Labs in New Jersey back in 1954. However, widespread adoption is a 21st century phenomenon, spurred by accelerating cycles of falling costs and rising demand, leading to economies of scale that force prices down even farther with every cycle.

Those cycles will continue to pick up steam in the coming years. Although solar is already competitive with fossil fuels in many markets globally, solar innovators have not stopped trying to push the cost of solar cells down even farther, and perovskites are part of the effort.

Perovskites are lab-grown crystals that follow the structure of calcium titanate, also found in the mineral perovskite. By way of illustrating the rapid pace of innovation today, perovskite was first identified in nature back in 1839. However, its application to solar cells did not surface for another 170 years. A team of researchers in Japan reported the first perovskite solar cell in 2009, with a solar conversion efficiency of 3.8%. Today, just 16 years later, researchers around the world are routinely hitting double digits for perovskite solar conversion efficiency (see more perovskite background here).

Solving The Perovskite Solar Cell Puzzle

The road to a marketable perovskite solar cell has been a relatively short one, but a difficult one. Perovskites are extremely fragile, defying practical applications until researchers could figure out how to engineer durability and longevity without sacrificing solar conversion efficiency.

One promising workaround is a tandem approach that deploys layers of perovskites and silicon. Silicon is the longtime semiconductor of choice for mass-marketed solar cells. It is relatively expensive compared to perovskites, so combining the two yields a high-efficiency solar cell that is less expensive than silicon alone. The tandem approach also delivers a lighter, more flexible solar cell than silicon alone.

Among the innovators focusing on tandem perovskite solar cells is the US startup Swift Solar. The company is new to the pages of CleanTechnica, so a bit of catchup is in order.

The Acid Test For Perovskite Durability

Swift Solar co-founder and MIT engineer Joel Jean introduced his company’s perovskite solar cells in 2019. The company has focused on stacking different types of perovskites in a solar cell, boosting efficiency by absorbing different parts of the solar spectrum. As of 2019, Jean anticipated a solar conversion efficiency potential of more than 30% for its all-perovskite tandem solar cells.

The company has since adopted tandem perovskite-silicon technology while ramping into manufacturing mode. “Swift Solar’s proprietary next-generation perovskite tandem technology outperforms legacy silicon solar technologies, generating up to 30% more power than today’s solar panels,” the company asserts.

In August of this year, Swift’s US-made perovskite tandem solar cells were featured in the Defense Department’s annual Cyber Fortress exercise in Virginia, hosted by the 91st Cyber Brigade at Fort Belvoir and the Information Operations Support Center of the Virginia National Guard.

This year’s exercise focused in preparedness for a cyberattack on an electric cooperative (electric cooperatives are member-supported utilities that form the backbone of the US power grid), featuring multiple US agencies as well as students, electric co-ops, and representatives from other countries, including Finland, Sweden, Latvia.

As part of the exercise, Swift’s technology was integrated with a hybrid microgrid engineered by the firm Resilient Energy & Infrastructure. “Swift Solar’s perovskite tandem solar panels provided clean energy alongside two other power sources during a critical infrastructure cyber defense exercise,” Swift explains.

“DoD leadership, Army operational energy specialists, and private sector partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS) were on hand to learn about and observe the DoD’s latest operational energy capabilities,” Swift adds.

A Next-Level, Solar-Enabled Microgrid For The DoD

“The exercise demonstrated the potential for Swift Solar’s technology to support energy resilience for national defense operations,” Swift concludes.

Don’t just take their word for it. In a press release dated October 24, Swift cited the Cyber Fortress Lead for the US Army, Dr. Andre Slonopas, who reported that “US-made perovskite solar technology can directly address the growing power demands of the modern battlefield and enhance overall military readiness.”

As for solar technology in general, don’t just take Slonopas’s word for it, either. The US Army has been pushing the market for solar-enabled microgrids and lightweight, transportable solar technology since the early 2000s, to help secure a more nimble, flexible, scavenge-able power supply for the geared-up Soldier of today.

Resilient CEO Paul Maloney also chipped his two cents into Swift’s press release, taking note of the potential for perovskite solar cells to take his company’s “Rapid Deployment Hybrid MicroGrid” technology to the next level.

“For our mobile RDHMs, where space, weight, and agility are mission-critical factors for operational energy, we envision Swift Solar’s perovskite as vastly increasing the energy density we can deploy, while enhancing energy resilience for military operations,” Maloney explained.

Resilient is laser-focused on integrating solar and energy storage into transportable microgrids. Its portfolio includes the proprietary “SolFlex” solar array, designed to unfold and fold back up, accordion-style, enabling the entire system to be recovered and transported elsewhere. “Key facet: No stranded asset risk,” the company emphasizes.

“REI’s objective is to address a significant disequilibrium between legacy, inefficient, and antiquated centralized systems and more modern, resilient, and efficiency-optimized distributed systems-of-systems,” Resilient emphasizes again for good measure.

Next Steps For The US Solar Industry

Beyond the potential for use in microgrids, Swift indicates that DoD is also interested in electromagnetic applications and space-based missions, among other fields. With plans to scale up its manufacturing systems over the next two years, Swift takes note of private sector interest among leading industries, including power generation, satellite operations, and telecommunications.

No kidding. It’s difficult to make an economical case for any other power generation resource in the US under the current state of energy technology today, with the ability to address mobile and transportable energy needs on up to utility-scale power plants. If you can think of one, drop a note in the comment thread.

Even though it would seem that the United States, Mexico, and Canada are in an era of increasing political tension and division, the common strategic priorities of the North American bloc far overshadow the divergences and competing interests. Strengthening energy trade and mutual support to ramp up energy production and localized energy and manufacturing supply chains would be a win-win-win for all three parties, but will require a particularly heavy lift on the part of Mexico.

“Within this trilateral relationship,” reports the Atlantic Council, “Mexico’s role in particular could lean into its domestic priorities to expand energy infrastructure, strengthen its electric vehicle and semiconductor sectors, and develop its mineral wealth.”

The Atlantic Council, a longstanding bipartisan think tank dedicated to issues of international coordination and security, recently released a 14-page policy brief arguing for enhanced cooperation between North American nations in order to be able to compete with China in global energy value chains. As Mexico, Canada, and the United States have prioritized protectionist policies and fractured nationalism over the last decade, China has increasingly consolidated global supply chains and currently exerts a great deal of control over international energy markets, especially in emerging economies. The Atlantic Council argues that counteracting this precarious consolidation will require a course correction and a return to convergence, coordination, and cooperation on the part of North American nations, who will stand stronger together than divided in a rapidly changing global market.

While the governments of the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have had loud and contentious tiffs against the backdrop of the Trump administrations (see: 51st state, wall) the three economies remain highly dependent on each other, and politically entangled in inextricable and bilateral ways. Smoothing over trade tensions in light of those dependencies is therefore strongly in the nations’ favor.

Although China is unmatched in terms of energy spending and its rapid expansion of energy influence, supply chains, and investment into energy assets in emerging economies, the Atlantic Council argues that North America is well-positioned to challenge China’s runaway dominance if it can play to its historic strengths.

“North America’s energy abundance has positioned the region as the world’s dominant energy exporter,” states the October policy brief. “The United States leads global LNG exports, Canada supplies critical oil and gas resources, and Mexico’s emerging Pacific Coast LNG projects will provide direct access to Asian markets. This collective export capacity creates shared prosperity through export revenues while offering democratic allies alternatives to authoritarian energy suppliers, transforming energy integration from an economic opportunity into a geopolitical asset.”

This plan hinges on Mexico’s ambitious energy planning – including the Plan Mexico policy – as laid out by its new president Claudia Sheinbaum. Mexico is critical to the nearshoring ambitions of the United States and Canada, who seek to shorten and strengthen localized supply chains in the interest of energy security, independence, and sovereignty, not to mention increased control within global markets. Mexico also has enormous and largely untapped potential for green energy production.

“Through Plan Mexico, the current administration has outlined an ambitious economic transformation strategy that prioritizes manufacturing growth, critical mineral development, and energy security—priorities that align with US and Canadian interests in building more resilient regional supply chains,” writes the Atlantic Council.

Increased North American energy cooperation is also critical to keeping Mexico’s alliances pointed north rather than East. China has been rapidly expanding its presence in energy sectors across Latin America, and Mexico would be a highly strategic trade partner for Beijing. Isolating and alienating Mexico from North American cooperation would push the country toward Beijing, with likely disastrous consequences for policy and economic goals for the entire continent.

Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50% over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office.
This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging and wildcat mining.
This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.
“Cop30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation.","Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rainforest and its people.

But with a divided administration, a hostile Congress and 20th-century developmentalist instincts, this global figurehead of the centre left has a balancing act to perform in advocating protection of nature and a reduction of emissions.

At the opening of the summit on Thursday, he said his priority was social development, but humanity had to make an energy transition and halt the loss of forests.

He said: “I am convinced that despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need roadmaps to – in a fair and planned way – reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels and mobilise the resources necessary for these objectives.”

Those difficulties and contradictions have been starkly apparent in recent months, in which the government has announced impressive progress in reducing deforestation, while also pushing forward a number of projects that would open up the Amazon to extractivism.

First, the good news. Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50% over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office. The latest annual government figures show the smallest area of clearance in 11 years. This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging and wildcat mining.

As a result, the Climate Observatory estimates Brazil’s emissions – which are mainly determined by the health of its forests – have fallen by 16.7%, likely to be the steepest fall of any of the G20 economies.

These gains were front and centre as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at Cop30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125bn (£95bn) for the protection of standing forests. So far, the initiative has raised about $5.5bn, with investments of $3bn from Norway, $1bn each from Brazil and Indonesia, and smaller sums from Portugal, the Netherlands and other countries.

The money is desperately needed to stave off the rapidly growing danger that the world’s biggest tropical forest will decline beyond a point of no return, after which it will be condemned to desiccate into a savannah and lose much of its globally important functions of climate stabilisation, water transport and habitat provision.

Senior scientists have warned that this is already happening in wide areas of the Amazon, particularly in the states of Matto Grosso, where there has been a rapid expansion of soy plantations, and Pará, where the primary cause of destruction is the beef industry. The weakening of the forest has also been accelerated by fire (widely used for land clearance) and the contamination of rivers with mercury (which is used in gold mining).

Antonio Donato Nobre, an Earth system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown. He said droughts are increasingly severe, temperatures in some cleared areas have increased by up to 7C and degradation is accelerating even as deforestation slows. This poses a global threat, he said, not only because of a reduced carbon sequestration capacity, but because a weaker rainforest means less cloud cover to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, which is potentially a greater warming threat than greenhouse gases.

Nobre said the first climate summit in the Amazon was an opportunity to put nature at the heart of climate solutions but could also be a disaster if leaders paid only lip service to the importance of the forest, while pushing ahead with destructive projects. “My main message is get serious,” he said. “The most successful enterprise on the planet is called life. We have in our hands a technology that is 4bn years old and has gone through multiple cycles of destruction and rebirth and refixing.”

Lula, however, relies on support from the agribusiness and mining sectors to maintain power. “Ruralista” politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation. This lobby is now the driving force in Brazilian politics.

While Lula has vetoed some of its most radical plans to eradicate swathes of environmental licensing requirements, he has also appeared more than willing to support other elements of its agenda to carve up the Amazon and other biomes for the production of fossil fuels and monoculture crops.

Three weeks ago, his government approved drilling licences for oil and gas exploration at the Foz do Amazonas off the coast of the rainforest, a move that adds to the contamination risks facing the forest, increases the likelihood of vegetation destruction by related industries and runs contrary to advice from the International Energy Agency that it will be impossible to achieve the Paris agreement goals of limiting global heating unless countries completely halt new fossil fuel development.

Then there are the government’s plans to upgrade the BR-319 highway between Manaus and Porto Velho, which will put unprecedented pressure on the western regions of the Brazilian Amazon, which have – until now – been one of the last healthy regions of the forest.

Another large intact area is close to the north-west border with Venezuela, but this too is menaced by plans to permit industrial mining in the Yanomami Indigenous territory.

“We’re very worried,” said one of those in the region, Ehuana Yaira Yanomami, who has come to Belém to relay the fears of the women of her community. “We don’t want our people to suffer, we are very worried and that’s why we are speaking out, because illegal mining only brings suffering to our communities. We want to see our children healthy, without mud and without the fish being contaminated.”

Farther south, the government announced in late August it would “de-statise” the federal waterways of three major rivers – the Tapajós, Madeira and Tocantins – which is seen as a first step towards their privatisation and transformation into a “hydrovia” water transport route for soy shipped from Mato Grosso.

Lula, who cut his political teeth as a union negotiator, has tended to focus more on the social benefits that can come from increased investment in the Amazon, while skirting the far greater risks that the climate crisis poses to its human and non-human residents.

That was evident last week at a pre-Cop30 publicity tour of forest communities along the Tapajós river. At the Vista Alegre do Capixauã village of the Kumaruara people, the president said he was ready to stand up for those who protect the forests, and promised to improve local healthcare, education and housing. This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.

But during the parts of his visit open to the press, Lula did not make a single mention of the climate, even though this is a growing concern for local people – and a huge majority of the world’s population.

The head of a neighbouring village, Luis Antonio Bentes de Sousa, told the Guardian that much of the river dried up during last year’s record drought, leaving the communities here stranded and struggling to feed themselves. He said his vegetable garden shrivelled up, most of his fruit trees died and for the first time in his 70-year-life he was unable to grow manioc, the primary staple of the Amazon diet.

“It is getting hotter and drier,” he said. “I worry for my children and grandchildren.”

Others spoke of mass fish deaths due to the heat, contamination and low water levels, and expressed fears that this will become worse when the river they depend on is privatised and turned into a canal for soy barges.

These uncomfortable topics – and their politically difficult solutions – were not raised during the speeches until the very end of Lula’s visit when the environment minister, Marina Silva, asked for the microphone and reminded the president why they were in the Amazon this month. “Cop30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation. And the world needs to do its part, reducing emissions of coal, oil and gas. That is why I like it when, sir, you say it’s necessary to stop depending on fossil fuels.”

This was a reminder that in Belém, Lula – like many world leaders – will have a good forest angel on one shoulder and a fossil fuel demon on the other. The question is which will hold sway.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff3fb126efe16c4fcbe1d627a34b454942162e3/261_0_2629_2104/master/2629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93a95f75d05e06959e34d9ac841e6d34",N,,2025-11-08 11:05:12.359826

This month, the global spotlight turns to the environment and our collective efforts to combat climate change as COP30 convenes in Brazil. A decade on from the landmark Paris Agreement, world leaders are gathering to assess progress and chart a path forward to limit and prepare for climate change.

Europe is now warming twice as fast as the global average and the consequences of extreme weather are already being felt, from prolonged periods of water scarcity to increasingly frequent storms and flooding.

Yet, as the latest IPPR poll highlights, the environment doesn’t exist in isolation. While over half of Scots still view climate action as vital to the nation’s future, pressing concerns such as the NHS, cost of living and inequality currently top the public agenda.

Now, more than ever before, it’s important to recognise that the environment is not only at the heart of our identity as a nation but also integral to our success and development. We’re committed to taking action and one of the ways we’re doing this is through the nationally recognised Carbon Literacy Project, a training initiative where we’re equipping colleagues with the knowledge and tools to embed climate-conscious decision-making into everything they do, both at work and at home.

To mark Climate Literacy Action Day, this year taking place to coincide with COP30, we’re hosting staff sessions and expanding accreditation so our people can integrate climate decision-making into all aspects of their roles.

Preparing for a winter of extremes

As we head into another unpredictable winter, the swing between drought and downpour is becoming a familiar pattern. Last winter, some areas were drenched with above-average rainfall, while others saw less than half their usual precipitation.

The message is clear, winter preparedness now means being ready for both water shortages and flooding. With climate change reshaping seasonal norms, resilience depends on acting early, making informed choices, and working together across communities.

And yes, it’s possible to face both flooding and water scarcity at the same time. When heavy rain hits dry ground, it runs off like water on concrete, flooding streets but barely touching river levels. It’s all about timing; scarcity builds slowly, while flooding hits fast.

Prepare and be aware of flooding this winter

As winter approaches, communities across Scotland face an increased risk of flooding brought on by heavy rainfall, saturated ground and extreme weather events.

Flooding can affect you. It might be where you live, or your regular travel routes. Being prepared is key to staying safe and minimising disruption. We’re urging you to take action now to be prepared this winter by taking these easy steps:

Check the Scottish Flood Forecast - This provides a three-day outlook that shows when and where flooding is expected.

Sign up to Floodline - Receive real-time Alerts and Warnings direct by text, phone call or email, allowing you to take action when flooding is expected.

Follow our social media channels - We provide information on predicted flooding in advance through Facebook and X.

Why we need to prepare for water scarcity this winter

Winter is traditionally seen as a time of water abundance, but recent trends tell a different story. In 2024, Scotland experienced a notably dry winter, with many regions recording below-average rainfall. The situation continued into 2025 with record-breaking dry conditions. These repeated dry spells placed sustained pressure on our rivers, keeping them under strain throughout the year.

While rivers are naturally resilient to seasonal fluctuations, prolonged low flows disrupt ecological balance and slow recovery. Consecutive years of reduced flow increase the risk of long-term or even irreversible changes to river ecosystems.

As we enter the winter months, all of Scotland’s rivers have recovered, with all areas at Alert level or below, and all abstraction restrictions lifted across the country.

However, the situation is delicate. That’s why we’re encouraging businesses, especially in agriculture, food production and manufacturing to be ready by integrating climate resilience into their planning.

If you rely on large amounts of water for your business:

Assess your water use - You should review how much water you use and identify areas where consumption can be reduced or recycled.

Engage with SEPA tools and guidance - You can access our water scarcity seasonal reports during the winter months, along with guidance to make informed decisions.

Collaborate locally - Work with suppliers, local authorities and environmental groups to help share resources and strategies.

Latest Scottish household waste statistics highlight progress

Scotland’s latest household waste statistics have revealed a modest rise in recycling rates for 2024. While 44.3% of household waste was successfully recycled, we know that more than half of what ends up in general waste bins, such as food scraps, paper, cardboard and plastics, could have been recycled.

The carbon impact of household waste in 2024 was 5.31 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, marking a 21.5% decrease since 2011. This reduction underscores the environmental benefits of recycling and waste minimisation, especially as Scotland moves toward its goal of a circular economy.

With research showing that over half of general bin contents could be recycled, small changes in household habits, like better sorting and reducing food waste, could significantly boost recycling rates and cut emissions. Every effort counts in supporting Scotland’s transition to a more sustainable future.

Celebration or contamination? What bonfire night means for air quality

Across the country this week, skies have been lit with fireworks and bonfires as communities gathered for a night of sparkle and celebration. But while we enjoyed the show, it’s worth remembering that these fiery festivities come with a few hidden extras, especially for the air we breathe.

As the bonfires blaze and fireworks bang, they release tiny particles into the air, such as soot (black carbon) and colourful metal compounds like lead, copper and barium. These are what give fireworks their dazzling colours and crackling sounds, but they also contribute to fine particulate pollution (PM2.5), which can hang around in the air and irritate our lungs.

In previous years, our air quality monitors have picked up noticeable spikes in PM2.5 across Scotland between 5p.m. and 9p.m, right when the celebrations are in full swing. The levels didn’t last long, but they’re usually some of the highest of the week, showing just how much one night of fun can impact the air around us.

Explore the impact our daily lives can have on local air quality by having a look at some data collected during a citizen science project in Stirlingshire. This includes data from Aberfoyle’s bonfire night celebrations.

Extending the life of our assets to support net zero

As part of our ongoing efforts to modernise and reshape our workspaces, we’ll soon be co-locating with Zero Waste Scotland and the Water Industry Commission for Scotland in Stirling city centre. This move supports our net zero ambitions by promoting more sustainable travel, collaborative working and efficient use of shared resources.

Clearing our existing Stirling workspace became a practical demonstration of sustainability in action. Faced with vacating the space, we collaborated to repurpose surplus furniture and IT equipment. Extending the life of our assets has reduced waste and redistributed resources to support colleagues and communities. This approach helped cut emissions, avoid unnecessary procurement, and showed how smarter use of public sector assets delivers real environmental and social value.

A new era of environmental regulation

Water, waste management and industrial activities have now joined radioactive substances in being regulated under the Environmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (EASR).

The changes introduce a streamlined environmental regulatory framework and marks a major change in how we authorise and regulate activities. This integrated approach is designed to ensure efficient, effective and consistent regulation while reducing and simplifying the regulatory burden for organisations and businesses.

Growing through change - new climate resilience guidance for Scotland’s horticulture sector

The horticulture sector is increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. From shifting rainfall patterns and rising temperatures, to more frequent extreme weather events, these changes pose significant risks to plant health, supply chains and day-to-day operations.

Through our regulatory expertise, environmental data and collaborative partnerships, we support growers, landscapers and suppliers in understanding and adapting to these evolving climate challenges.

To further strengthen the sector’s resilience, Adaptation Scotland and the Horticultural Trades Association have developed new guidance tailored to Scotland’s horticultural industry. This resource identifies the key climate risks and provides practical, actionable steps to help businesses prepare and adapt.

Whether you're a grower, landscaper or supplier, the guide offers strategies already being adopted across Scotland, such as diversifying crops, enhancing drainage systems and rethinking business models, to build long-term resilience and sustainability in the face of a changing climate.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFkkpdUJJ2QdA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B4EZpYvq5KHcAM-/0/1762425485366?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2hGzOn-22oY9SVEk0htE4xf5UYpbH_nuXRMoTqjCy8k,N,,2025-11-08 17:02:53.125565

""It's essentially a hoax. It's not an honest organization looking to better human lives,"" Wright told The Associated Press at the close of a two-day business conference in Athens. He added that he might attend next year's summit ""just to try to deliver some common sense.""

Wright's comments came as world leaders gathering over 5,000 miles away, on the edge of the Amazon in Brazil, blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for his absence from the United Nations-sponsored discussions on climate change running through Nov. 21. His remarks echoed the U.S. administration's rejection of global climate agreements and Trump's prioritization of fossil fuels.

The U.S. will send no high-level officials to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, the White House said Friday.

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.

Wright led a senior U.S. delegation to Athens for talks centered on boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe and Ukraine. Among them were Interior secretary Doug Burgum, deputy secretaries and the new U.S. ambassador to Greece and close Trump ally, Kimberly Guilfoyle.

At the forum, top U.S. officials criticized European Union carbon reduction policies, arguing they undermine economic growth, democratic alliances, and global leadership in AI and energy innovation.

It was a stark contrast with the Brazilian city of Belem, where world leaders at COP30 issued urgent warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming, driven in large part by emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said a ""moral failure"" to act would trigger rising hunger, displacement and environmental damage.

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.

Latin American leaders attending COP30 in Belem took swipes at Trump for his stance on climate discussions.

""Today Mr. Trump is against humanity. His absence is proof of that,"" Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said in his speech on Thursday. ""What should we do then? Leave him alone. Oblivion is the biggest punishment.""

Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva struck a more moderate tone regarding Trump's absence, expressing hope that his U.S. counterpart would eventually change his mind.

""President Trump told me he doesn't believe in green energy,"" Lula told reporters earlier this week. ""He will believe in it, because he'll realize that we don't have much of an alternative.""

Trump wasn't the only one staying away; the summit was also notably absent of leaders from China and India. Together, these three nations are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Wright, a former fossil fuel executive who has been a leading voice against efforts to fight climate change, defended Washington's stance, arguing that global gatherings should prioritize energy access, growth and technological advancement over what he described as fear-driven environmentalism.

""Gatherings of global leaders and businesses should be about humans ... not on the desire to scare children and grow government power,"" he told the AP in Athens. ""They've lost the plot.""

The Belem talks opened as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, the World Meteorological Organization reported Thursday.

Trump has reversed Biden's focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. ""energy dominance"" in the global market. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he called climate change ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

At the start of his second term, Trump again withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, while the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations.

Transitioning to a fossil fuel-free economy isn’t just about fighting climate change, it’s about creating a healthier, more affordable, sustainable and stable future.","It’s true that manufacturing EVs and solar panels currently generates carbon emissions. However, when we look at the full lifecycle — “cradle to grave” — EVs produce significantly less CO2 than gasoline-powered cars. The emissions from a gasoline car are not limited to what comes out of the tailpipe. We must consider the entire “well to wheels” process: drilling for oil, transporting crude, refining it, shipping gasoline to stations, and finally burning it in engines that are only about 30% efficient (70% turned into heat and wasted). Each step adds pollution and greenhouse gases to our environment. This goes on for the entire life of the gasoline-powered car. There is no practical pathway to “carbon-free” with a gasoline car.

For solar panels, emissions are concentrated during manufacturing (mining, refining, panel production). Average carbon payback period is one to four years, meaning they offset their production emissions within that time. After payback, they generate electricity with near-zero emissions for 25-30 years. Another great advantage of rooftop solar is a locked-in price for each and every kilowatt-hour. No worries about inflation, AI and crypto raising the cost of electricity. You can go solar with either a zero-cost power purchase agreement from a company like Atlasta Solar or by purchasing solar panels outright at a reduced cost through a co-op like Solar United Neighbors.

Back to EVs; even though tailpipe emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles are often invisible, they contain a potent mix of harmful pollutants that can make us sick. These include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, fine particulates, and unburned hydrocarbons like benzene and formaldehyde — both known carcinogens. Despite their invisibility, these compounds contribute to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and long-term environmental damage, silently affecting the air we breathe and the health of our communities. You also subject yourself to a cocktail of chemicals every time you pump gas. Some benign, some not so much. Let’s not forget that medicine itself is a major consumer of single-use plastics, so anything that lowers our need for health care also helps reduce waste, pollution and energy consumption.

Financially, EVs are much cheaper to operate. The lifetime cost of driving on electricity is far lower than buying gasoline, especially as global instability affects oil prices. Routine maintenance is also less expensive, since EVs have fewer moving parts and don’t require oil changes. Consider the cost of driving 10,000 miles. A gasoline car getting 20 mpg will consume 500 gallons of gasoline to go that far. Assuming a low price of $5 per gallon this would take $2,500 out of your pocket. An EV consuming 30 kWhs to drive 100 miles would consume 3,000 kWhs. At offpeak Xcel rates of 8.5 cents per kWh, this would take $255 out of your pocket. Less if you have rooftop solar. Driving a gas car could easily have fuel costs more than 10 times as much as an EV charged at home. More than 80% of EV charging is done at home. We charge 100% at home. But what the heck! You don’t mind working part time for the oil oligarchs, do you.

Envision an electrified future where all manufacturing and transportation does not create carbon dioxide and all people are freed from the tyranny of oil. If a war breaks out in the Middle East, gasoline could easily hit $10 per gallon or higher and there’s nothing you can do about it. Meanwhile, the cost of driving electric will be virtually unchanged, especially if you make your own ‘fuel’ on your roof. Your choice.

Transitioning to a fossil fuel-free economy isn’t just about fighting climate change, it’s about creating a healthier, more affordable, sustainable and stable future. Investing in clean energy isn’t just affordable — it’s the key to securing America’s prosperity and leadership for generations to come.

Navigating the Future of Rare Earth Markets China's rare earth export controls have fundamentally transformed global supply chain assumptions and strategic planning requirements across critical technology sectors.","Understanding Beijing's Strategic Mineral Restrictions

China's rare earth export controls represent a sophisticated regulatory framework that transforms critical minerals from market commodities into strategic diplomatic leverage. The licensing mechanism, administered through China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), establishes government oversight over materials essential to modern technology manufacturing.

The Foundation of Modern Export Control Policy

The current licensing system emerged from decades of policy evolution, moving from open market competition toward strategic resource management. MOFCOM's authority stems from China's foreign trade law framework, enabling rapid implementation of export restrictions across defined material categories. As of November 2025, the ministry had issued 62 regulatory announcements pertaining to export controls, with specific announcements suspended until November 2026 according to official statements.

Furthermore, the distinction between temporary suspensions and permanent policy changes proves critical for understanding Beijing's approach. The November 7, 2025 announcement suspended Announcements 55, 56, 57, 58, 61, and 62 until November 10, 2026, creating a precise one-year pause with automatic reinstatement provisions. This structure maintains regulatory pressure while providing diplomatic flexibility.

Critical Materials Under Regulatory Oversight

China's export control framework targets both raw materials and processing equipment across the rare earth supply chain. Heavy rare earth elements including dysprosium and terbium face licensing requirements due to their irreplaceable role in high-temperature magnetic applications. These materials enable electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators to maintain performance under thermal stress conditions.

Light rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium also require export licenses, affecting the foundation of permanent magnet production globally. Consequently, the regulatory scope extends beyond raw materials to include processing equipment, creating vertical control across multiple supply chain stages. This comprehensive approach prevents circumvention through alternative processing routes.

Downstream products affected by the controls include finished magnets, catalysts, and technology components incorporating rare earth materials. The licensing requirements create compounding restrictions as materials progress through manufacturing stages, amplifying supply chain complexity for international manufacturers.

How China's 2025 Export Controls Actually Unfolded

Timeline of Regulatory Tightening and Market Response

The implementation of China's rare earth export controls during 2025 followed a calculated escalation pattern, creating maximum market disruption while maintaining policy flexibility. Each phase introduced new restrictions while building upon existing regulatory infrastructure alongside emerging critical minerals strategy initiatives.

April 2025: The Initial Shock Wave

Seven rare earth elements were placed under licensing requirements in April 2025, triggering immediate supply chain disruptions across critical technology sectors. Chinese magnet exports experienced a 50% decline within the first month as exporters struggled to navigate new permit requirements according to Reuters reporting.

The automotive sector faced particularly acute pressure, with portions of the global auto industry approaching shutdown conditions by May 2025 due to magnet shortages. This three-to-four week lag between regulatory implementation and critical supply failure demonstrated the fragility of just-in-time manufacturing systems dependent on Chinese rare earth materials.

Additionally, export license application backlogs developed rapidly, with over 2,000 applications from European Union companies alone by November 2025. The approval process proved complex and time-consuming, requiring multi-hundred page documentation packages and end-use justifications submitted to multiple Chinese government agencies simultaneously.

Market reactions were swift and substantial. Praseodymium-neodymium oxide prices surged approximately 40% year-to-date through November 2025, with an additional 14% weekly spike occurring during peak supply uncertainty. These price movements demonstrated the direct correlation between regulatory announcements and rare earth commodity valuations.

October 2025: Extraterritorial Expansion

China expanded its export control scope in October 2025, adding five additional rare earth elements to the controlled substances list. More significantly, Beijing introduced a foreign direct product rule for rare earth materials, establishing a 50% ownership threshold for export license determinations.

This extraterritorial provision extended compliance requirements beyond Chinese borders to international companies with partial Chinese ownership or significant supply chain involvement. However, the 50% threshold created immediate complications for joint ventures and companies with Chinese investment partners, forcing restructuring of ownership arrangements to maintain material access.

The October measures also targeted rare earth processing equipment separately from raw materials, suggesting a deliberate strategy to control both primary production inputs and intermediate processing capabilities. This vertical approach created multiple control points across the supply chain rather than focusing solely on finished goods.

November 2025: The Misunderstood ""Rollback""

The November 7, 2025 MOFCOM announcement created significant confusion in Western media and markets, with many characterising the move as a policy rollback rather than a temporary suspension. The official statement suspended specific announcements until November 10, 2026, creating a precise one-year window with automatic reinstatement provisions.

Crucially, the core licensing infrastructure remained fully operational despite the suspension of select October announcements. Export license applications continued requiring extensive documentation and multi-agency approval processes, maintaining bureaucratic friction regardless of suspended announcement numbers.

Western media mischaracterisation of the announcement as effectively ending rare earth controls glossed over the technical distinction between suspending specific measures and eliminating the licensing requirement framework entirely. The White House description of the moves proved overly optimistic compared to the actual policy language and implementation reality according to analysis by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

Bureaucratic delays persisted despite suspension headlines, with approval rates varying significantly based on end-use applications. Defense-related applications continued experiencing rejection rates approaching 80%, while commercial applications achieved approximately 50% approval rates through November 2025.

China's Strategic Dominance in Rare Earth Markets

Market Control Statistics and Geopolitical Leverage

China's position in global rare earth markets extends far beyond simple production statistics, creating a comprehensive dominance structure that spans extraction, processing, and manufacturing capabilities. This vertical integration provides Beijing with multiple leverage points across critical technology supply chains.

Production and Processing Monopoly

China controls approximately 60% of global rare earth extraction operations, but this figure understates the true extent of strategic dominance. More critically, China processes 85-90% of refined rare earth oxides globally, creating an essential chokepoint regardless of where initial mining occurs.

The processing monopoly proves particularly significant because rare earth ores require complex chemical separation and purification procedures before use in technology applications. Alternative mining operations outside China often depend on Chinese processing facilities to create usable materials, maintaining Beijing's leverage even over non-Chinese mineral sources.

Magnet manufacturing represents China's most concentrated advantage, with approximately 90% of high-performance permanent magnets produced within Chinese facilities. This downstream integration ensures that even if alternative rare earth sources develop, the critical manufacturing capacity remains under Chinese control.

Economic Impact Across Critical Industries

The scope of China's rare earth influence extends across multiple technology sectors with varying dependency levels and supply risk profiles:

Sector Dependency Level Key Applications Supply Risk Electric Vehicles Critical Motor magnets, batteries High Wind Energy Essential Generator magnets High Defense Systems Strategic Guidance systems, electronics Critical Consumer Electronics Moderate Speakers, hard drives Medium

Electric vehicle manufacturers face critical dependency on Chinese rare earth supplies for motor magnet production, with no viable short-term alternatives for high-performance applications. Wind energy sector dependency proves essential for generator efficiency, while defence systems require strategic materials for guidance and electronic systems.

Chokepoint Analysis for Global Supply Chains

Single points of failure characterise the rare earth supply chain, with Chinese processing capacity representing the most significant vulnerability. Lead times have extended from typical weeks to months as licensing requirements create additional delays and uncertainty.

Price volatility demonstrates direct correlation with Chinese regulatory announcements, as evidenced by the 40% year-to-date increase in praseodymium-neodymium oxide prices through November 2025. This price sensitivity reflects the lack of alternative suppliers capable of meeting global demand at scale.

Alternative supplier capacity gaps remain substantial, with non-Chinese sources unable to replace Chinese production volumes within reasonable timeframes. Timeline projections for meaningful supply chain diversification extend 5-10 years minimum for most critical applications, maintaining Chinese leverage throughout the transition period.

Heavy Rare Earth Elements: Maximum Vulnerability

Strategic Importance of Dysprosium and Terbium

Heavy rare earth elements occupy a unique position in the critical materials landscape due to their irreplaceable performance characteristics and extreme geographic concentration. Unlike light rare earth elements where some substitution pathways exist, dysprosium and terbium provide essential properties for high-temperature applications with no current alternatives.

High-Temperature Performance Requirements

Motor efficiency in electric vehicles depends on dysprosium addition to prevent thermal demagnetisation above specific temperature thresholds. High-performance and military vehicle applications require mission-critical reliability across wide temperature ranges, making dysprosium essential for maintaining magnetic properties under extreme thermal stress.

Wind turbine generator reliability in harsh environments demands terbium addition to maintain magnetic stability during thermal cycling conditions created by intermittent power generation and mechanical stress. Modern permanent magnet generators cannot achieve required efficiency and durability specifications without heavy rare earth enhancement.

Military applications requiring temperature stability in guidance systems and electronics represent strategic end-uses where performance degradation poses mission-critical risks. These defence applications experience rejection rates approaching 80% for Chinese export license applications, demonstrating Beijing's strategic prioritisation of supply restrictions to military sectors.

Geographic Concentration Risks

Southern China clay deposits serve as the primary global source for heavy rare earth elements, creating extreme geographic concentration risk. These deposits, located primarily in ionic clay formations, contain the highest concentrations of dysprosium and terbium accessible through current extraction technologies.

Myanmar border region instability affects supply routes and alternative sourcing options, compounding the geographic concentration problem. Political tensions and infrastructure limitations in border areas create additional supply chain vulnerabilities beyond Chinese regulatory controls.

Furthermore, limited viable alternative deposits outside Chinese territorial control constrain diversification efforts. While heavy rare earth elements exist in other global locations, the concentrations and extraction economics prove significantly less favourable than Chinese sources, limiting practical substitution potential.

Processing technology barriers prevent non-Chinese producers from achieving equivalent separation and purification capabilities. The complex chemistry required for heavy rare earth processing remains concentrated within Chinese facilities, creating additional dependency beyond raw material extraction.

Industry Adaptation Strategies and Engineering Solutions

HREE-Free Magnet Innovations

Engineering teams across multiple industries have accelerated development of heavy rare earth-free solutions in response to supply chain uncertainties. These innovations focus on achieving equivalent performance through design modifications and alternative material compositions rather than depending on scarce dysprosium and terbium supplies.

Engineering Solutions and Supply Chain Diversification

N45SH and N48SH magnet grades have achieved high performance benchmarks entirely without dysprosium addition, representing significant technological progress in HREE-free manufacturing. The N48SH grade reportedly under development promises even higher performance specifications while maintaining independence from heavy rare earth supplies.

Laminated magnet designs reduce heat-related demagnetisation through improved thermal management, lessening dependency on dysprosium's high-temperature properties. These segmented architectures distribute thermal stress more effectively, enabling HREE-free magnets to achieve performance levels previously requiring heavy rare earth enhancement.

Grain boundary diffusion techniques enhance coercivity in light rare earth magnets, providing alternative pathways to high-temperature performance. Advanced processing methods enable optimisation of magnetic properties without requiring scarce heavy rare earth additions.

In addition, cerium-based alloy research explores lighter rare earth substitutes for traditional heavy rare earth applications. These investigations focus on abundant light rare earth elements that could replace dysprosium and terbium in specific applications while maintaining required performance characteristics.

Design Engineering Workarounds

Innovation Spotlight: Automotive engineers are implementing segmented magnet architectures and advanced cooling systems to maintain motor performance while reducing dependency on temperature-resistant heavy rare earths.

Motor design modifications include larger magnet volumes and improved cooling systems to achieve equivalent performance without heavy rare earth enhancement. These engineering approaches trade material scarcity for design complexity, enabling continued production despite supply constraints.

Laminated stacks and advanced motor controls provide additional pathways for maintaining efficiency while reducing rare earth dependency. These system-level solutions optimise overall performance through intelligent design rather than relying solely on material properties.

Alternative Supply Chain Development

Government investment in domestic rare earth capacity has accelerated significantly during 2025, with the US Department of Defense allocating $400 million toward domestic production capabilities. This represents substantial federal commitment to supply chain resilience alongside the executive order on minerals initiatives, though capacity development timelines extend multiple years.

Australian rare earth projects are ramping production capacity to provide alternatives to Chinese sources, though processing capabilities remain limited. Projects including Lynas Corporation and emerging producers aim to establish integrated supply chains independent of Chinese processing infrastructure.

Canadian processing facilities target 2026-2027 operational dates, representing potential diversification opportunities for North American manufacturers. These developments focus on establishing domestic processing capabilities rather than depending on Chinese separation and purification facilities.

European Union critical materials stockpiling initiatives aim to create strategic reserves for supply disruption scenarios. These government-led programmes prioritise building buffer inventories of essential materials while longer-term diversification efforts develop capacity.

Export License Requirements: Practical Business Impact

Compliance Challenges and Market Friction

The licensing requirement framework creates substantial operational complexity for global manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earth supplies. Application processes involve extensive documentation, multi-agency coordination, and unpredictable approval timelines that fundamentally alter supply chain planning approaches.

Application Process Complexity

Multi-hundred page documentation requirements characterise export license applications, demanding detailed technical specifications, end-use justifications, and supply chain transparency. Companies must provide comprehensive product descriptions, importing entity verification, and strategic use attestations across multiple Chinese government agencies simultaneously.

Processing timeframes extend 3-6 months minimum for standard applications, with defence-related applications experiencing significantly longer delays or outright rejections. The approval process involves coordination between MOFCOM, customs authorities, and security agencies, creating multiple points where applications may encounter delays or denials.

End-use justification requirements force companies to provide detailed explanations of intended applications, creating transparency demands that may compromise competitive information. Manufacturers must balance regulatory compliance with protection of proprietary product development information.

Rejection rates for defence-related applications approach 80%, creating effective embargoes on Chinese rare earth supplies for military applications. This selective approval process enables China to maintain commercial relationships while restricting strategic end-uses.

Operational Impact on Global Manufacturers

Just-in-time inventory models have become obsolete for manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earth supplies, forcing fundamental changes to working capital and storage requirements. Companies have shifted toward maintaining substantial buffer inventories to accommodate licensing delays and approval uncertainties.

Safety stock requirements have increased 300-500% compared to pre-control inventory levels, representing substantial working capital impacts for affected manufacturers. This inventory expansion reflects the need to maintain production continuity despite unpredictable supply chain disruptions.

Supplier qualification processes now extend beyond technical specifications to include regulatory compliance capabilities and licensing track records. Manufacturers must evaluate suppliers based on their ability to navigate Chinese export control requirements successfully rather than focusing solely on cost and quality metrics.

Contract terms increasingly incorporate regulatory change clauses to address the possibility of sudden policy modifications. These provisions attempt to allocate risk between parties for scenarios involving unexpected export control modifications or licensing delays.

Financial Implications for Supply Chain Planning

Price premiums for non-Chinese rare earth sources range 15-25% above Chinese rates, reflecting scarcity value and alternative supplier capacity constraints. These premiums represent structural cost increases that affect manufacturing economics across rare earth-dependent industries.

Working capital increases result from extended lead times and higher inventory requirements, creating financing pressures for manufacturers adapting to new supply chain realities. Companies must secure additional financing to accommodate longer cash conversion cycles and higher safety stock levels.

However, currency hedging complexity increases with multi-jurisdiction sourcing strategies designed to reduce Chinese dependency. Manufacturers must manage foreign exchange exposure across multiple currencies and longer time horizons than traditional supply arrangements required.

Insurance costs for supply chain disruption coverage have risen substantially as insurers recognise the systemic risks created by rare earth export controls. Premium increases reflect the concentrated nature of rare earth supply chains and the potential for sudden regulatory changes.

Diversification Progress and Remaining Vulnerabilities

Production Capacity Development Outside China

Global efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earth supplies have accelerated significantly, though capacity development timelines extend multiple years and involve substantial capital requirements. Current progress demonstrates both promise and limitations in achieving supply chain independence, particularly given the broader defense materials strategy considerations.

Progress Assessment and Remaining Vulnerabilities

Region Current Capacity 2027 Projections Key Projects Australia 15% of global 25% of global Lynas, Iluka Resources North America 5% of global 12% of global MP Materials, Ucore Europe 2% of global 8% of global REE processing partnerships

Australian production capacity represents the most advanced alternative to Chinese sources, with Lynas Corporation operating integrated mining and processing facilities. However, downstream processing for speciality applications remains limited compared to Chinese capabilities, constraining substitution potential for high-performance applications.

North American capacity development focuses on domestic supply chain security, with MP Materials expanding production at Mountain Pass and other companies developing processing capabilities. Government support through defence department contracts provides revenue certainty for capacity investment decisions.

European initiatives emphasise processing partnerships and strategic material stockpiling rather than domestic mining operations. The European Union's critical materials strategy prioritises reducing processing dependence through technology partnerships and supply chain diversification agreements.

Technology Transfer and Processing Capabilities

Separation technology licensing agreements with Chinese firms create potential vulnerabilities in diversification strategies, as technology access depends on maintaining positive relationships with Chinese partners. These arrangements may face restrictions during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.

Independent processing development timelines require 5-7 years minimum to achieve commercial-scale operations, reflecting the technical complexity of rare earth separation and purification processes. Environmental permitting challenges in Western jurisdictions add additional time and uncertainty to project development schedules.

Capital requirements exceeding $1 billion characterise integrated rare earth processing facilities capable of competing with Chinese operations. These substantial investment thresholds limit the number of viable projects and extend development timelines as companies secure financing.

Environmental compliance costs in developed countries create structural disadvantages compared to Chinese operations, affecting long-term competitiveness of alternative suppliers. Regulatory requirements for waste management and environmental protection add operational costs that must be recovered through higher prices.

Market Reality Check on Supply Security

Non-Chinese capacity remains insufficient for complete substitution through 2030, maintaining structural dependence on Chinese supplies for most applications. Even aggressive capacity development scenarios leave significant supply gaps that require continued Chinese sourcing for global demand fulfilment.

Quality specifications for premium applications often require Chinese processing capabilities, limiting substitution potential even when alternative raw materials become available. The precision and consistency achieved by Chinese processing facilities proves difficult to replicate in new operations.

Cost competitiveness gaps persist despite geopolitical risk premiums, as Chinese operations benefit from scale economies and integrated supply chains. Alternative suppliers must achieve substantial scale before achieving cost parity with Chinese producers, extending the timeline for meaningful competition.

Strategic stockpile adequacy provides only 3-6 months maximum buffer for most countries, insufficient to weather extended supply disruptions or allow time for alternative capacity development. Government reserves focus on emergency preparedness rather than long-term supply independence.

Strategic Planning for Regulatory Uncertainty

Investment Implications and Long-term Outlook

The rare earth export control environment has fundamentally altered investment and strategic planning assumptions across technology sectors. Regulatory volatility represents the new baseline condition rather than temporary disruption, requiring adaptive strategies that accommodate ongoing uncertainty, particularly given recent developments in US minerals deal negotiations.

Policy Volatility as the New Normal

Export control frameworks enable rapid implementation of new restrictions without extended notification periods, creating permanent uncertainty for supply chain planning. The November 2025 suspension demonstrates how quickly policy conditions can change while maintaining underlying control infrastructure.

Suspension agreements remain subject to geopolitical relationship changes, with automatic reinstatement provisions ensuring that controls can resume without new regulatory processes. This structure maintains compliance pressure even during periods of apparent policy relaxation.

License approval rates correlate directly with diplomatic tensions between China and importing countries, creating additional unpredictability beyond technical application requirements. Companies must monitor geopolitical relationships as carefully as supply chain logistics when planning rare earth sourcing strategies.

Regulatory arbitrage opportunities continue diminishing over time as China expands control scope and international coordination increases. The extraterritorial provisions introduced in October 2025 demonstrate Beijing's willingness to extend controls beyond direct bilateral relationships.

Investment Implications for Critical Materials Sector

Rare earth mining equities have experienced 40-60% volatility ranges during 2025, reflecting investor uncertainty regarding supply chain developments and regulatory changes. Price movements correlate strongly with policy announcements rather than fundamental supply and demand factors.

Processing technology companies command premium valuations as investors recognise the strategic value of separation and purification capabilities. Companies with proven rare earth processing expertise benefit from scarcity value as alternatives to Chinese facilities gain importance.

Recycling and urban mining ventures attract strategic investment as manufacturers seek to reduce dependence on primary rare earth sources. These circular economy approaches offer potential supply chain independence while addressing environmental sustainability concerns.

Defence contractors prioritise supply chain resilience over cost optimisation, creating premium markets for non-Chinese rare earth sources. Government procurement preferences for domestic or allied suppliers support higher pricing for secure supply arrangements.

Long-term Strategic Considerations

Market Reality: While engineering innovations and alternative suppliers are developing rapidly, complete independence from Chinese rare earth supply chains remains 5-10 years away for most critical applications, making adaptive strategies more valuable than absolute solutions.

Technology evolution may reduce rare earth dependency over the long term through materials science advances and design optimisation. However, current applications in electric vehicles, wind energy, and defence systems continue requiring rare earth materials with no immediate substitutes available.

Geopolitical relationships will significantly influence the pace and direction of supply chain diversification efforts. Improved diplomatic relationships could reduce incentives for alternative supplier development, while continued tensions would accelerate diversification investments.

Economic competitiveness of alternative sources depends on achieving sufficient scale to compete with Chinese cost structures. Success requires sustained investment and market support during extended development periods when alternative suppliers operate at cost disadvantages.

Strategic stockpiling provides short-term supply security but cannot replace the need for sustainable long-term supply chain development. Government reserves serve emergency preparedness functions while industry develops alternative capacity and supply arrangements.

Navigating the Future of Rare Earth Markets

China's rare earth export controls have fundamentally transformed global supply chain assumptions and strategic planning requirements across critical technology sectors. The November 2025 suspension of select export control announcements demonstrates regulatory flexibility while maintaining structural control over essential materials according to analysis by the International Energy Agency.

The distinction between temporary policy adjustments and permanent strategic reversals proves critical for business planning and investment decisions. Beijing's approach maintains comprehensive leverage through processing capacity dominance and vertical supply chain integration regardless of specific regulatory announcements.

Industry adaptation through engineering innovation and alternative supplier development represents the most promising pathway toward supply chain resilience. HREE-free magnet technologies and diversified processing capacity reduce dependency on Chinese supplies while maintaining performance requirements.

However, complete independence from Chinese rare earth supply chains remains 5-10 years away for most critical applications, requiring adaptive strategies that accommodate ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Success depends on balancing immediate supply needs with long-term diversification investments while managing the financial and operational impacts of extended transition timelines.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and 710 will be temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announced layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

While Tesla sales crater, BYD’s European registrations surged 272% year-over-year in recent months.
The targets tied to the compensation package include delivering 1 million Optimus robots and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation.
“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” Dan Ives, a managing director at financial firm Wedbush, told The Guardian.
EVXL’s Take This compensation vote represents one of the most striking examples of investor psychology trumping business fundamentals in recent corporate history.","Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented $1 trillion compensation package, potentially making him the world’s first trillionaire—despite collapsing European sales, mounting brand damage from political controversies, and serious questions about whether the world’s largest executive pay package will solve any of Tesla’s actual business problems.

The vote passed with more than 75% approval at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, according to NBC News. The timing couldn’t be more striking: shareholders approved the package on the same day Tesla’s October European sales data revealed catastrophic declines across nearly every major market, with registrations plummeting by double digits in key countries including Germany, Sweden, and Denmark.

Largest Corporate Compensation Package In History

The approved package would grant Musk up to 423.7 million additional Tesla shares over the next decade if he achieves extraordinarily ambitious targets, according to CNBC. Those milestones include growing Tesla’s market capitalization from approximately $1.4 trillion today to $8.5 trillion, expanding annual adjusted profit from current levels to $400 billion, delivering 20 million vehicles cumulatively, deploying 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and producing 1 million Optimus humanoid robots and 1 million robotaxis.

Musk currently owns roughly 12.5% of Tesla worth approximately $461 billion, making him the world’s wealthiest person with a net worth of about $473 billion according to Bloomberg. If he unlocks the full compensation package, his stake would increase to approximately 27% of the company.

“I super appreciate it. Thank you, everyone,” Musk said after the vote was announced, according to NBC News. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter on the future of Tesla but a whole new book.”

After the announcement, Musk celebrated on stage at the shareholder meeting, dancing and laughing alongside a pair of Optimus robots.

The Vote Nobody Expected To Be Close

The compensation package was expected to pass, with betting markets giving it 93% odds of approval on Wednesday, according to NBC News. Tesla introduced the pay plan in September 2025, with Board Chair Robyn Denholm warning shareholders in late October that rejecting it could trigger Musk’s departure and send the company’s value into freefall.

Major proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both recommended shareholders vote against the package, citing concerns about the total size of the award, shareholder dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Tesla’s sixth-largest external investor, also voted against the plan.

“While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk—consistent with our views on executive compensation,” Norges Bank Investment Management said in a statement reported by Fox Business.

Glass Lewis estimated that the entire S&P 500 combined paid all its CEOs about $9 billion last year, according to NPR. Using even conservative valuations, Musk’s package works out to roughly $88 billion over ten years, or $8.8 billion annually—nearly as much as every other major corporate CEO combined, before factoring in potential stock growth.

The Timing: European Sales Collapse On Vote Day

The shareholder vote occurred on the same day EVXL reported that Tesla’s October 2025 sales had collapsed across Europe. New vehicle registrations plummeted by double-digit margins in nearly every major market, with Sweden down 89%, Denmark down 86%, and Germany down 54% compared to the previous year.

The European sales crisis stems from three interconnected problems: stale product lineup, brand damage from Musk’s political activities, and fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD. While Tesla sales crater, BYD’s European registrations surged 272% year-over-year in recent months.

In the United States, Tesla faces a different but equally serious challenge. The September 30, 2025 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit—eliminated through President Trump’s legislative package—has sent the broader EV market into freefall. U.S. motor vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units in October, with electric vehicle sales dropping 24% in just one month.

Tesla managed to avoid the immediate impact by reporting record third-quarter deliveries of 497,099 vehicles—crushing Wall Street estimates of 447,000—as buyers rushed to purchase before the tax credit expired, according to Yahoo Finance. But that artificial spike pulled demand forward from future quarters, setting up what analysts warn will be a challenging fourth quarter and beyond.

The Robot Army And Control Concerns

Musk has repeatedly stated that the compensation package is less about money and more about maintaining control over Tesla and its future products, particularly the Optimus humanoid robot program.

“If I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? That’s my biggest concern,” Musk said in an October webcast with Wall Street analysts reported by NBC News. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm echoed this sentiment in recent interviews. “It’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence,” she told CNBC.

The targets tied to the compensation package include delivering 1 million Optimus robots and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. Neither product is anywhere near commercial reality—Tesla’s robotaxi service launched in Austin with just 10-20 vehicles that still require safety drivers, and the Optimus robot remains in prototype stage with basic functionality challenges.

Why Investors Stuck With Musk Despite Everything

The shareholder vote represents a remarkable show of confidence in Musk despite significant brand damage throughout 2025. Tesla’s association with political controversies—including Musk’s work in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency and his support for far-right political groups in Europe—has alienated left-leaning consumers who historically formed the core EV buyer demographic.

French Tesla owners filed a lawsuit in June 2025 citing Musk’s political stances as damaging their peaceful use of their vehicles, with some owners reporting vandalism including swastikas painted on their cars. France saw Tesla sales drop 67% year-over-year in May 2024 following Musk’s political activities.

Yet Tesla’s stock has surged approximately two-thirds since May 2025, when Musk announced he was leaving the Trump administration, according to The Guardian. The stock rally reflects investor optimism about Tesla’s artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions, with analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities estimating Tesla’s AI-driven self-driving portfolio could be worth nearly $1 trillion alone.

“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” Dan Ives, a managing director at financial firm Wedbush, told The Guardian. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”

Another factor is the culture among U.S. investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged, and Jeff Bezos enjoyed a long reign at Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Most Tesla shareholders seemed more concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company rather than wanting him to leave altogether.

“Money talks in the US more,” Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets, told The Guardian. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”

The Disconnect Between Compensation And Business Reality

Critics argue the compensation vote reveals a fundamental disconnect between shareholder sentiment and Tesla’s actual business performance. The company faces declining deliveries, shrinking market share, and profit pressures largely attributed to Musk’s behavior driving customers away.

“He has hundreds of billions of dollars already in the company, and to say that he won’t stay without a trillion is ridiculous,” Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at research firm Telemetry who has covered Tesla for nearly two decades, told Euronews. “It’s absurd that shareholders think he is worth this much.”

Shareholder advocate James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, opposed the plan due to concerns about demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits.

“Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,” McRitchie told CNBC. “There’s a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.”

The compensation package requires Tesla to increase its market cap nearly sixfold to $8.5 trillion—larger than Apple and Microsoft combined—while delivering more than double the number of vehicles it has sold since the company’s founding. Achieving those targets while Chinese manufacturers like BYD aggressively expand globally and traditional automakers scale back EV investments presents extraordinary challenges.

EVXL’s Take

This compensation vote represents one of the most striking examples of investor psychology trumping business fundamentals in recent corporate history. Shareholders just approved paying Musk nearly a trillion dollars based on hitting science-fiction targets—1 million robots, 1 million robotaxis, an $8.5 trillion valuation—while the core automotive business that generates virtually all of Tesla’s revenue is hemorrhaging customers in Europe and facing a post-tax-credit demand cliff in America.

We’ve been tracking this story closely. Back in late October, Board Chair Robyn Denholm issued an urgent warning that Tesla could collapse into “just another car company” without this compensation package. But here’s the fundamental problem with that framing: if only Musk can save Tesla, why is Tesla dying under his leadership?

European sales data published the very day of the shareholder vote showed catastrophic declines—Sweden down 89%, Denmark down 86%, Germany down 54%. These aren’t just bad numbers; they represent a structural collapse driven by three factors that paying Musk more won’t fix: stale products, brand damage from his political activities, and brutal competition from Chinese manufacturers offering better technology at lower prices.

The compensation targets assume Tesla can grow from $1.4 trillion to $8.5 trillion in market cap—larger than Apple and Microsoft combined—while simultaneously delivering 20 million vehicles. For context, Tesla has delivered roughly 8 million vehicles total since its founding. The plan requires more than doubling that in just ten years while losing market share in Europe and navigating a U.S. market where federal EV tax credits expired September 30.

We predicted this would happen. When federal EV tax credits ended, we warned of demand collapse. It arrived right on schedule—U.S. vehicle sales cratered in October with EV sales plunging 24% in a single month. Tesla’s Q3 record deliveries were artificially inflated by customers rushing to beat the September 30 deadline, pulling forward demand that would have occurred in Q4 and beyond.

The robotaxi and Optimus robot targets sound ambitious, but they’re nowhere near commercial reality. Tesla’s Austin robotaxi pilot operates with 10-20 vehicles that still require safety drivers. The Optimus robot remains a prototype with basic functionality challenges. These aren’t realistic near-term business lines—they’re speculative moonshots that shareholders just agreed to pay for in advance with the largest compensation package in corporate history.

What Tesla actually needs isn’t a bigger carrot for Musk—it’s a fundamental strategic refocus on the automotive business. That means accelerating affordable model launches, meaningfully refreshing the Model 3 and Model Y with competitive technology, pricing aggressively to compete with Chinese manufacturers, and rebuilding brand reputation in Europe through both product excellence and, frankly, keeping the CEO out of divisive political controversies that alienate core customers.

The vote passed with 75% approval, but remember the context: Norway’s $1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund voted against it. Glass Lewis and ISS—the two largest proxy advisory firms—recommended rejection. The opposition came from sophisticated institutional investors focused on fundamentals, while approval came largely from retail shareholders betting on Musk’s vision regardless of current business reality.

This story connects directly to our extensive coverage of Musk’s political distractions, Tesla’s retreat from Delaware to Texas to avoid shareholder accountability, and the broader industry collapse following tax credit expiration that’s now claiming thousands of jobs at GM, Rivian, and across the supply chain.

The compensation package essentially asks: should we reward spectacular failure and brand damage with nearly a trillion dollars based on achieving targets that require Tesla to become larger than Apple and Microsoft combined? Shareholders answered yes. Whether that bet pays off or becomes the most expensive corporate mistake in history remains to be seen.

We commissioned India’s first graphite anode qualification & commercial plant in Bellary, Karnataka, in early 2024. The scale-up facility will produce 30,000 tons by 2027 with 100,000 tons by 2030. We have also received all pre-construction permits for our North Carolina, USA facility with 60,000 tons of graphite anode by 2030.

Our Cathode Technology Centre in Germany is an advanced R&D facility with a 250-ton commercial demonstration plant, the largest LFP cathode facility outside China. This centre holds over 120 patents, and we are developing next-generation cathode materials with advanced cell testing work. In India, we plan to commission the country’s first LFP Cathode Active Material (CAM) manufacturing plant by 2028 with an initial capacity of 30,000 tons, scaling up to 100,000 tons by 2031.

All these plans are to support our mission for the global battery supply chain and contribute to sustainable energy solutions. Both of our anode & cathode material is qualified with cell makers & auto OEMs in India, the US and the EU and we should close on an offtake soon to enable a secure & reliable supply chain outside China.

Many reports say that China controls 99% of the graphite anode market and over 80% of cathode material manufacturing at present. Is that a correct assessment of China’s current control on the battery value chain?

Yes, that’s correct. China has done commendable work in the last 20~25 years in mining, battery material processing & battery manufacturing, hence their dominant position is obvious. We need to learn a lot from China on how the government incentivised everyone to integrate both upstream & downstream so as to create a resilient ecosystem that allowed everyone to thrive not only in the domestic market but has also been enjoying a highly skewed global leadership position.

Their recent export restrictions on battery materials, machinery and its technology is an indicator and explains why business and government needs to build ex-China capacity and supply chain through focused policies. Because a policy, incentive, or subsidy made for cell makers might not work for battery material producers like us. Many companies are now building their capabilities; however, we need binding offtakes & agreements from downstream industry which can make these innovations & investments feasible and practical.

How do you see China’s latest export control announcement involving advanced batteries, production equipment, cathode materials, and artificial graphite anode materials, along with related production equipment and technology?

After the rare earth metal ban, this kind of ban was seen coming. China’s export sanctions safeguard their interest to not let their innovation & technology be sold outside and dilute their market dominance. They have done huge investment in the whole battery supply chain over decades and giving know-how to other countries like India can shift the market dynamics soon.

The restrictions raise concerns for cross-border transfers of high-end battery cells, key upstream inputs, and machines. Operationally, it will compel buyers and OEMs to reassess sourcing risk, accelerate localisation plans, and fast-track qualification of alternative suppliers outside China. In short, it’s a wake-up call that supply-chain resilience is now a front-line commercial priority.

Given that these are not export prohibitions but license mandates, why should the move be a cause of concern for the global battery companies?

License requirements may sound less severe than outright bans, but they materially increase commercial friction and execution risk. Licenses create additional lead times, uncertainty about approvals and the possibility of case-by-case denials or restrictive conditions. For high-volume manufacturing, even short lead-time disruptions can derail project timelines, qualification schedules and finance assumptions. I believe license regimes has unpredictable gating points into a supply chain that until now relied on relatively frictionless cross-border trade and that unpredictability can translate into higher costs, slower ramp-ups and high execution risk for Indian & global battery makers.

Export control also extends to production equipment for CAM and graphite anodes. How do these restrictions impact ex-China CAM and anode manufacturing companies like Epsilon?

For ex-China manufacturers, controls on equipment can raise two operational challenges. Certain downstream lines and high-precision machines sourced from China may now face licensing hurdles or supply delays, which may complicate procurement and commissioning schedules. Also, the transfer of associated technology and know-how may become slower or subject to approvals, which can lengthen qualification cycles.

That said, this also creates an opportunity to invest in non-Chinese equipment suppliers, incentivise partnerships with global OEMs of critical machinery, and increase the commercial value of products from companies like Epsilon that can deliver qualified, locally sourced CAM and anode materials. Practically, companies must diversify equipment suppliers, build strategic inventory buffers for long-lead items, and accelerate local engineering and process development to reduce dependence on any single geography.

What steps does Epsilon plan to take to secure equipment procurement for its facilities, as well as speed up the race to deliver production-ready battery materials on a mass scale?

Our steps are multi-pronged and pragmatic. We are qualifying alternate equipment vendors across India and Japan, so single-source risks are minimised. We are strengthening engineering and machine-integration capabilities locally and forming strategic JV/technology partnerships to internalize critical process steps. Parallel qualification tracks with cell manufacturers (pilot → pre-commercial → commercial) have now shortened via feedback loops, sample exchanges and testing. We are working closely with industry bodies and the government to ensure predictable trade and investment frameworks that support the rapid commercialisation of ex-China supply.

Any other information you would like to share on the subject?

Two closing points from my end. First, the lessons learnt from China’s restrictions must accelerate our energy security and supply-chain resilience for the whole battery value chain and not just procurement checkboxes. Governments, investors and industry must accelerate coordinated action to build local processing, incentivize equipment manufacturing, and expand recycling and secondary-materials ecosystems.

Second, the challenge is surmountable with focused capital, policy support and cross-border partnerships. We must create a diversified, reliable supply chain outside China within the next 3~5 years so that companies like us, who are committed to being part of that solution, can survive & thrive.",https://evreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Evreporter_china-export-curb.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 11:05:59.380143
,Congress,2025-11-08 14:02:00+00:00,The Nation,"At COP30, Will Lula Be a Rain Forest Champion? - The Nation","Jonathan Watts, Leah Abrams, Jeet Heer, Steve Brodner, Chris Lehmann, The Nation, Mychal Denzel Smith, www.thenation.com",,,,,https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/lula-brazil-amazon-cop30-climate/,"Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rain forest and its people.
Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50 percent over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office.
These gains were front and center as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at COP30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125 billion for the protection of standing forests.
Antonio Donato Nobre, an earth-system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown.
Ruralista politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation.","Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has welcomed world leaders to Belém for the first climate summit in the Amazon, where conservationists hope he can be a champion for the rain forest and its people.

But with a divided administration, a hostile Congress, and 20th-century developmentalist instincts, this global figurehead of the center left has a balancing act to perform in advocating protection of nature and a reduction of emissions.

At the opening of the summit on Thursday, he made clear that his priority was social development, but he was clear that humanity had to make an energy transition and halt the lost of forests: “I am convinced that, despite our difficulties and contradictions, we need road maps to—in a fair and planned way—reverse deforestation, overcome dependence on fossil fuels, and mobilize the resources necessary for these objectives.”

Those difficulties and contradictions have been starkly apparent in recent months, in which the government has announced impressive progress in reducing deforestation, while also pushing forward a number of projects that would open up the Amazon to extractivism.

First, the good news. Forest clearance in the Brazilian Amazon has fallen by 50 percent over the full three years of Lula’s third term in office. The latest annual government figures show the smallest area of clearance in 11 years. This is largely thanks to Lula’s environment minister, Marina Silva, who has applied robust measures to counter land invasions, illegal logging, and wildcat mining.

As a result, the Climate Observatory estimates that Brazil’s emissions—which are mainly determined by the health of its forests—have fallen by 16.7 percent, likely to be the steepest fall of any of the G20 group of the world’s 20 biggest economies.

These gains were front and center as Lula pitched for more nations to sign up to Brazil’s flagship initiative at COP30: the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which aims to raise $125 billion for the protection of standing forests. So far, the initiative has raised about $5.5 billion, with investments of $3 billion from Norway, $1 billion each from Brazil and Indonesia, and smaller sums from Portugal, the Netherlands, and other countries.

The money is desperately needed to stave off the rapidly growing danger that the world’s biggest tropical forest will decline beyond a point of no return, after which it will be condemned to desiccate into a savannah and lose much of its globally important functions of climate stabilization, water transport, and habitat provision.

Senior scientists have warned that this is already happening in wide areas of the Amazon, particularly in the states of Matto Grosso, which has seen a rapid expansion of soy plantations, and Pará, where the primary cause of destruction in the beef industry. The weakening of the forest has also been accelerated by fire (widely used for land clearance) and the contamination of rivers with mercury (which is used in gold mining).

Antonio Donato Nobre, an earth-system scientist who worked in the Amazon for 20 years, said the forest is already showing signs of breakdown. He said droughts are increasingly severe, temperatures in some cleared areas have increased by up to 7 C and degradation is accelerating even as deforestation slows. This poses a global threat, he said, not only because of a reduced carbon sequestration capacity, but because a weaker rain forest means less cloud cover to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, which is potentially a greater warming threat than greenhouse gases.

Ad Policy

Nobre said the first climate summit in the Amazon was an opportunity to put nature at the heart of climate solutions but could also be a disaster if leaders paid only lip service to the importance of the forest, while pushing ahead with destructive projects. “My main message is, get serious,” he said. “The most successful enterprise on the planet is called life. We have in our hands a technology that is 4 billion years old and has gone through multiple cycles of destruction and rebirth and refixing.”

But Lula relies on support from the agribusiness and mining sectors to maintain power. Ruralista politicians dominate Congress, control several ministries, and are pushing an aggressive extractivist agenda that runs counter to forest conservation. This lobby is now the driving force in Brazilian politics.

While Lula has vetoed some of its most radical plans to eradicate swaths of environmental licensing requirements, he has also appeared more than willing to support other elements of its agenda to carve up the Amazon and other biomes for the production of fossil fuels and monoculture crops.

Three weeks ago, his government approved drilling licenses for oil and gas exploration at the Foz do Amazonas, off the coast of the rain forest, a move that adds to the contamination risks facing the forest, increases the likelihood of vegetation destruction by related industries and runs contrary to advice from the International Energy Agency that it will be impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement goals of limiting global heating unless countries completely halt new fossil fuel development.

Then there are the government’s plans to upgrade the BR-319 highway between Manaus and Porto Velho, which will put unprecedented pressure on the western regions of the Brazilian Amazon, which have—until now—been one of the last healthy regions of the forest.

Another large intact area is close to the northwest border with Venezuela, but this too is menaced by plans to permit industrial mining in the Yanomami Indigenous territory.

“We’re very worried,” said one of those in the region, Ehuana Yaira Yanomami, who has come to Belém to relay the fears of the women of her community. “We don’t want our people to suffer, we are very worried and that’s why we are speaking out, because illegal mining only brings suffering to our communities. We want to see our children healthy, without mud and without the fish being contaminated.”

Farther south, the government announced in late August that it would “de-statize” the federal waterways of three major rivers; the Tapajós, Madeira, and Tocantins, which is seen as a first step toward their privatization and transformation into a hydrovia water transport route for soy shipped from Mato Grosso.

Lula, who cut his political teeth as a union negotiator, has tended to focus more on the social benefits that can come from increased investment in the Amazon, while skirting the far greater risks that the climate crisis poses to its human and nonhuman residents.

That was evident last week at a pre-COP30 publicity tour of forest communities along the Tapajos river. At the Vista Alegre do Capixauã village of the Kumaruara people, the president said he was ready to stand up for those who protect the forests, and promised to improve local healthcare, education and housing. This was very much in keeping with one of Brazil’s declared objectives in the summit: to make social protection a foundation of resilience.

But during the parts of his visit open to the press, Lula did not make a single mention of the climate, even though this is a growing concern for local people—and a huge majority of the world’s population.

The head of a neighboring village, Luis Antonio Bentes de Sousa, said that much of the river dried up during last year’s record drought, leaving the communities here stranded and struggling to feed themselves. He said his vegetable garden had shriveled up, most of his fruit trees died and for the first time in his 70-year-life he was unable to grow manioc, the primary staple of the Amazon diet.

“It is getting hotter and drier,” he said.” I worry for my children and grandchildren.”

Others spoke of mass fish deaths due to the heat, contamination, and low water levels, and expressed fears that this will become worse when the river they depend on is privatized and turned into a canal for soy barges.

These uncomfortable topics—and their politically difficult solutions—were not raised during the speeches and glad-handing of Lula’s visit until the very end, when Environment Minister Marina Silva asked for the microphone and reminded the president why they are in the Amazon this month: “COP30 is a place for us to say that Brazil will do its part, eliminating deforestation. And the world needs to do its part, reducing emissions of coal, oil, and gas. That is why I like it when, sir, you say it’s necessary to stop depending on fossil fuels.”

This was a reminder that in Belém, Lula—like many world leaders—will have a good forest angel on one shoulder and a fossil fuel demon on the other. The question is which will hold sway.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/lula-belem-cop30-getty.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 11:05:16.656945

As a renewable energy source, it is self-replenishing and produces no operational emissions, though the lifecycle of wind turbines presents its own environmental considerations.

The sector is experiencing substantial growth, yet it operates within a complex global energy landscape still wrestling with rising demand and emissions.

A record 117 GW of new wind capacity was added globally in 2023, bringing total cumulative capacity beyond 1,136 GW, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.

Despite this growth, overall energy-related CO₂ emissions rose by 0.8% in 2023 to a new high of 37.8Gt CO₂.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) points to increased coal consumption in China, India and Southeast Asia as a primary cause.

While advanced economies reduced their energy demand, the growth in clean energy could not fully offset the world’s escalating needs.

The IEA confirms that accelerating clean energy growth is essential to limit power-sector emissions this decade.

A major hurdle for wind energy is its integration into grids that have historically been built to accommodate fossil fuels. Establishing connections for wind farms is complex, especially for offshore projects that can often be located more than 100km from land.

These distances require long transition lines and development can be slowed by permitting bottlenecks and limited grid capacity.

Furthermore, the variable nature of wind means the energy supply is intermittent. This unpredictability requires other, more constant, energy sources to meet power demand.

To mitigate this, wind power is often combined with other renewables like solar to smooth out the overall energy production curve.

Innovative solutions and project developments

To address intermittency, companies are piloting integrated energy systems.

The Hollandse Kust Noord project in the Netherlands combines offshore wind with floating solar panels, battery storage and offshore hydrogen electrolysis.

The project began operations in December 2023.

Its floating solar array will be situated alongside the turbines to provide a more consistent energy output.

The inclusion of batteries and an on-site hydrogen plant allows for the storage of excess energy generated during periods of high wind and low demand.

Tackling the turbine lifecycle footprint

While wind turbines are clean during operation, their manufacturing, transport and decommissioning have an environmental footprint.

Turbine blades, made from composite materials like fibreglass and resin, are particularly difficult to recycle at their end-of-life.

The industry is actively seeking solutions to this challenge.

The Kaskasi offshore wind farm in Germany is the first commercial project to use Siemens Gamesa’s RecyclableBlade technology.

This innovation allows for the recovery of blade materials once a turbine is decommissioned.

Marc Becker, CEO of the Siemens Gamesa Offshore Business Unit, says: ""We are proving that as leaders of the offshore revolution, we are committed to making disruptive technology innovation commercially viable with the pace that the climate emergency demands.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/9f9cd6f9117943d66825bb9c951aebc6:9e13bdeead3751ade56d7cfa46d67657/jesse-de-meulenaere-iatiyqrtl8-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 09:18:47.651919

Welcome back to the Pfluger Fly-By, a roundup of events and updates to keep you informed about everything I’m doing week by week to represent you in Congress.

It is incredibly disappointing that we are on day thirty-eight of the Democrats’ reckless government shutdown, making it the longest in American history. Senate Democrats have officially voted fifteen times to keep the government closed. I voted weeks ago to fund the government, and have since advocated for reopening it and returning to normal order. This week, I continued delivering that message in Texas-11 and back up in Washington.

Below, you’ll find photos and highlights from the week, plus information on how my office can assist you with any federal concerns. As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Best,

REMINDER: Financial Resources for Impacted Individuals

If you or someone you know has been impacted by the government shutdown, financial resources are available. Last month, I held a roundtable in San Angelo with local financial institutions and community organizations, where banks announced 0% interest loans and United Way announced they are providing gift cards, gas cards, energy assistance programs, clothing assistance programs, food assistance programs, and more for those in need. Additionally, the City of San Angelo announced plans to extend bill payments to anyone experiencing financial uncertainty due to the shutdown.

ICYMI: SNAP Resources for Texas-11

3.5 million vulnerable Texans are having their SNAP benefits threatened because Democrats refuse to reopen the government. Today, the Trump administration told states they are working to pay full November food stamp benefits during the government shutdown. While this will alleviate the immediate pain for many families across America, this is only a short-term fix.

Weeks ago, I voted to fund the government, including SNAP, to avoid this very situation. I am infuriated that Democrats continue to put their political agenda before the well-being of Americans in need. I urge Senate Democrats to do the right thing and stop holding the government hostage. In the meantime, please reach out to my office if you are negatively affected by this shutdown and need assistance.

Should you need additional support, our local food banks are here to help:

Concho Valley Regional Food Bank (Coke, Irion, Sterling, Tom Green, Concho, McCulloch, Menard, Mason, and Kimble Counties)

San Angelo Food Bank (Concho, Coke, Irion, Sterling, & Tom Green Counties)

West Texas Food Bank (Ector, Midland, and Glasscock Counties)

West Central Texas Food Bank (Brown, Coleman, & Runnels Counties)

Central Texas Food Bank (Bell, Llano, Lampasas, Mills, and San Saba Counties)

Holding the Line on a Continuing Resolution

As Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest Congressional caucus with 189 Republican members, I joined my fellow RSC leaders to release a statement this week calling for an end to the Democrats’ shutdown through a continuing resolution that funds the government at least into January 2026.

The statement, first covered in Fox News, also urges Congress to reject extending Biden-era COVID subsidies while delivering a health care system for Americans that is truly accessible, affordable, and spurs innovation. Lower health care costs start with fostering competition in the market, and that is exactly what I am advocating for in Congress. Read the full statement and more on our plan to reopen the government and lower healthcare costs for Americans in Fox News by clicking here or the image below.

Mason Town Hall

I had a terrific community town hall in Mason this week. While the Democrats continue with their political theatrics and hold the government hostage, my top priority remains fighting for Texans and providing top-notch constituent services to the incredible men and women I am blessed to represent.

I’m extremely grateful to everyone who came out, and I was honored to recognize the outstanding work of the Mason Junior High Kind Club–a group of exceptional eighth-grade girls who serve as leaders for younger students by modeling acts of kindness and participating in community service projects–for their recent creative pumpkin painting project. This project raised funds for the Mason Cancer Benefit, demonstrating how they put their mission into action.

It’s clubs and students like this who are making real impacts in their communities, and it gives me hope to see young people giving up their time to serve and volunteer for the betterment of those around them.

Standing Up Against Christian Persecution in Nigeria

We must stand against the unjust persecution of Christians in Nigeria who are being brutally murdered simply for their faith. As a Christian myself, this is personal, and I will not stay silent while men, women, and children are targeted for what they believe. This senseless violence must end peacefully.

I joined my colleagues on the Values Action Team (VAT) to commend President Trump’s leadership on this issue and call for the end of Christian persecution in Nigeria. Read more here or by clicking on the image below.

Maria Bartiromo in the Permian Basin

Few places tell the story of American strength quite like the Permian Basin. I was proud to welcome Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business to the heart of West Texas to showcase the region that fuels our country every single day.

From a Diamondback Energy frac site to a Chevron oil rig, Maria saw firsthand the innovation and grit that makes the Permian Basin the largest, safest, and most secure source of oil and gas in the United States. Local energy leaders also delivered a clear message: President Biden’s four-year war on American energy hurt American workers, drove up energy costs, and put a target on the back of the Permian Basin.

During our exclusive interview, I highlighted how the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have fought tirelessly to rebuild a pro-energy framework in government by cutting red tape and putting American producers back in the driver’s seat. But the work is far from over. Permitting reform remains a top priority, and as the representative of America’s energy capital, I plan to lead that charge in Congress once the Democrats quit their political theatrics and open the government.

Like a fish out of water trying to flop its way back to safety, US President Donald Trump has been floundering from one self-made disaster to another. Perhaps a return to his native environment of glitz and ballrooms will soothe his troubled mind. In the meantime, he is faced with the disturbing reality of failure, with the nation’s EV charging station network as Exhibit A.

More EV Charging Stations For The US

To be clear, Trump has achieved some notable, if temporary, successes. For example, thousands of working households lost their jobs after the president almost snuffed out the entire domestic offshore wind industry. And, EV sales fell off a cliff in October after Trump’s Republican allies in Congress passed a new tax bill that eliminated the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as of September 30.

Still, the wind will continue blowing long after Trump leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes. The case for vehicle electrification is also not going anywhere anytime soon. While US automakers are retrenching their EV manufacturing plans for the time being, signs of recovery are also evident in the rapid uptick of EV charging station activity this year.

One newly emerging factor consists of new financial models that make installing new EV charging stations a hassle-free experience for tenant-occupied commercial and residential properties. The overwhelming majority of EV owners prefer the convenience of charging where they live, and now that option is being opened up to millions more prospective EV buyers.

Another factor is the rising competition among quick-serve restaurants, travel centers, and convenience stores seeking to attract EV drivers. The space of EV charging is tailor-made for drivers to stop in for a bite to eat or buy a pack of beef jerky, a keychain with their name on it, or any number of other items.

US States Step Up As US Government Steps Down

State-based EV charging incentives are also continuing to lay the groundwork for an EV sales revival, with Illinois being the most recent one to join the fray. On November 6, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency launched a new $20 million program to install Level 3 and Level 2 public charging stations throughout the state.

The funds are available on a rolling basis starting on November 17 through the “Rebuild Illinois” capital plan for EV projects, authorized under the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

“Governor Pritzker has prioritized electrification of the transportation sector to improve air quality and benefit the health of our residents,” explained Illinois Acting Director James Jennings. “To support that priority, we are committed to expanding the charging infrastructure necessary to power current and future electric vehicles throughout Illinois.”

In addition to meeting pre-qualification standards, applicants must demonstrate that their location fills a gap in public charging station availability. Sites that serve public transportation networks or Park-and-Ride facilities also score extra points.

“Additional funding will also be awarded to projects at a charging station location in an area identified as an Equity Investment Eligible Community through the EIEC mapping tool,” the Illinois EPA also notes.

Plenty More Where That Came From

The new program in Illinois is just the tip of the EV charging station iceberg. The Electric Vehicle Council branch of the organization Transportation Energy Institute has just published a new white paper that identifies funding opportunities across the US. The EV Council also provides lessons-learned guidance for sorting through the application process.

“For those developing funding programs, the EV Council provides strategic recommendations for streamlining incentive programs and grant application processes, based upon the real-world experiences of those who have participated in such programs,” TEI explains.

NEVI Lives To Charge Another Day

One of the resources TEI identifies is the $5 billion in federal funds earmarked for new public EV fast-charging stations during the Biden administration under the NEVI (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) program.

And that’s where things get interesting. Launched in 2022 and funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the NEVI program assigned awards to all 50 states and tasked them with selecting locations that meet the funding criteria. However, some states were reluctant or unprepared to take advantage of the their awards before Biden left office in January.

The issue almost became moot after Trump took office and summarily ordered a halt to the program, but the courts eventually stepped in and ordered the funds to be restored. The EV charging software startup EV Connect is among the stakeholders following the NEVI saga. Their latest report shows that the program has a long way to go but it’s still alive and kicking.

“Progress has been steady but initially slow. As of mid-2025, only 148 chargers are operational across 12 states, with 84% of funds unobligated due to cumbersome regulations,” EV Connect reported on November 6.

Keep an eye out for activity to ramp up in the Southeast, which stakeholders have identified as a hotspot for EV charging stations and EV uptake, too.

EV Drivers Just Can’t Quit EVs

As for that EV uptake, some consumer surveys indicate that sales will eventually recover from the October debacle. “While the end of the EV tax credit will significantly affect EV sales volumes over the next several months, the bottom will not fall out of the EV market,” the firm JD Power reported on November 7.

“The percentage of active new-vehicle shoppers who say they are ‘very likely’ to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months increased to 24.2% in October, up from 21.6% in September,” the firm added.

JD Power also re-affirmed the well known fact that the TCO (total cost of ownership) for EVs can meet or beat conventional cars. “The number one reason EV owners select an EV over a gasoline-powered vehicle is expected lower running costs,” the firm noted, adding that in 86% of cases, EVs are “delivering on that expectation.”

Most surveys also show that a high percentage of EV drivers will choose another EV the next time they go car shopping. The new JD Power report is consistent with that, too.

“The data suggests that a significant number of current EV owners will be back in the market for a new car within the next year, and the majority of them plan to get another EV,” JD Power notes, citing the 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Ownership Study. The EVX Study found that that 79% of current owners will definitely consider an EV for their next purchase, and another 15% will probably consider an EV.

“Furthermore, 243,000 franchise EV leases will come to an end in 2026, putting those customers back into the market for a new vehicle,” JD Power adds.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NEVI.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 13:18:57.804803

Summary

Late last month, Energy Transfer upped its quarterly distribution per unit once more.

The partnership recently announced agreements with Oracle, Fermi America, and Entergy Louisiana.

ET maintains BBB or BBB-equivalent credit ratings with S&P, Moody's, and Fitch.

Units are priced 17% below my fair value estimate.

Energy Transfer has a path to solid double-digit annual total returns over the next few years.

At 28 years old, I'm admittedly not a seasoned or veteran investor. However, I do believe that I have learned a few things in my eight-plus years of real-money investing.

Associated Press

Voter anger over the cost of living is hurtling forward into next year's midterm elections, when pivotal contests will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who's footing the bill to power Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

Electricity costs were a key issue in this week’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission.

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

Already, President Donald Trump is signaling that he’ll focus on affordability next year as he and Republicans try to maintain their slim congressional majorities, while Democrats are blaming Trump for rising household costs.

Front and center may be electricity bills, which in many places are increasing at a rate faster than U.S. inflation on average - although not everywhere.

“There’s a lot of pressure on politicians to talk about affordability, and electricity prices are right now the most clear example of problems of affordability,” said Dan Cassino, a professor of politics and government and pollster at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.

Rising electric costs aren’t expected to ease and many Americans could see an increase on their monthly bills in the middle of next year's campaigns.

Gas and electric utilities are seeking or already secured rate increases of more that $34 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, consumer advocacy organization PowerLines reported. That was more than double the same period last year.

With some 80 million Americans struggling to pay their utility bills, “it’s a life or death and ‘eat or heat’ type decision that people have to make,” said Charles Hua, PowerLines' founder.

In Georgia, proposals to build data centers have roiled communities, while a victorious Democrat, Peter Hubbard, accused Republicans on the commission of “rubber-stamping” rate increases by Georgia Power, a subsidiary of power giant Southern Co.

Monthly Georgia Power bills have risen six times over the past two years, now averaging $175 a month for a typical residential customer.

Hubbard's message seemed to resonate with voters. Rebecca Mekonnen, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain, said she voted for the Democratic challengers, and wants to see “more affordable pricing. That’s the main thing. It’s running my pocket right now.”

Now, Georgia Power is proposing to spend $15 billion to expand its power generating capacity, primarily to meet demand from data centers, and Hubbard is questioning whether data centers will pay their fair share - or share it with regular ratepayers.

Midterm elections will see congressional battlegrounds in states where fast-rising electric bills or data center hotspots - or both - are fomenting community uprisings.

That includes California, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Analysts attribute rising electric bills to a combination of forces.

That includes expensive projects to modernize the grid and harden poles, wires and substations against extreme weather and wildfires.

Also playing a role is explosive demand from data centers, bitcoin miners and a drive to revive domestic manufacturing, as well as rising natural gas prices, analysts say.

“The cost of utility service is the new ‘cost of eggs’ concern for a lot of consumers,” said Jennifer Bosco of the National Consumer Law Center.

In some places, data centers are driving a big increase in demand, since a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 homes, according to the International Energy Agency. Some could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans.

While many states have sought to attract data centers as an economic boon, legislatures and utility commissions were also flooded with proposals to try to protect regular ratepayers from paying to connect data centers to the grid.

Meanwhile, communities that don't want to live next to one are pushing back.

An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October found that electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults.

Now, as falls turns to winter, some states are warning that funding for low-income heating aid is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown.

Still, the impact is still more uneven than other financial stressors like grocery costs, which just over half of U.S. adults said are a “major” source of stress.

And electric rates vary widely by state or utility.

For instance, federal data shows that for-profit utilities have been raising rates far faster than municipally owned utilities or cooperatives.

In the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid from Illinois to New Jersey, analysts say ratepayers are paying billions of dollars for the cost to power data centers - including data centers not even built yet.

Next June, electric bills across that region will absorb billions more dollars in higher wholesale electricity costs designed to lure new power plants to power data centers.

That’s spurred governors from the region - including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Illinois’ JB Pritzker and Maryland’s Wes Moore, all Democrats who are running for reelection - to pressure the grid operator PJM Interconnection to contain increases.

Drew Maloney, the CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, singled out Democratic-leaning states as the drivers of higher electric bills.

“The red states’ electricity rates are not going up at the rate the blue states are,” Maloney said. “But the data centers are largely going to the red states and the rates are still stable.”

Pull out some of those fast-rising rates - like in California, where wildfires are driving grid upgrades, and New England, where natural gas is expensive - and the rest of the country largely follows inflation on electricity rates, Maloney said.

Still, blue states are attracting data centers, too, and some red states are seeing higher electric bills.

In Indiana, a growing data center hotspot, the consumer advocacy group, Citizens Action Coalition, reported this year that residential customers of the state's for-profit electric utilities were absorbing the most severe rate increases in at least two decades.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun decried the hikes, saying “we can’t take it anymore.”

SBOE and other news. - by Thomas Mills - PoliticsNC,Thomas Mills,,,,,https://www.politicsnc.com/p/anderson-clayton-v-sboe-and-other,"After Wednesday’s post, I got a bit of pushback because I didn’t mention North Carolina races.

Again, Brian Anderson of Anderson Alerts got the whole story.
So the lessons of this story are listen to the people who know what they are doing and don’t mess with Anderson Clayton.","After Wednesday’s post, I got a bit of pushback because I didn’t mention North Carolina races. When I wrote my post early that morning, I didn’t have the information. Our state didn’t have any statewide or high-profile races, so the information wasn’t in one place. Most were relatively obscure municipal races in small towns across North Carolina. The information trickled in throughout the day.

I made up for it on Thursday. North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton, former political reporter Travis Fain, and I recorded an election roundup. I hope you’ll watch it.

Democratic wins in North Carolina were both broad and deep. According to Anderson, the party flipped more than 150 seats and the wins came in small towns, big cities, and suburban areas. The Assembly called it a “blue wave” even though many races were ostensibly nonpartisan.

In Charlotte, Democrats swept contested city council races, leaving just one Republican on the council. In Wake County, Democratic candidates defeated Republican mayors in Wake Forest, Holly Springs, and Fuquay Varina. Only one of the 22 GOP endorsed candidates in Wake County won. Democrats won in places like Alamance County where they took mayoral seats in both Burlington and Graham. They also won big in Guilford and New Hanover Counties.

Anderson makes a great point on the podcast. Republicans have now become a nationalized party. Everything is about Donald Trump. They’ve lost sight of the local issues that so often drive the electorate. That might work in presidential years, but Republicans are failing when Trump’s not on the ballot.

Nationally, Republicans are publicly in denial, downplaying their losses. That might make their base feel better, but it doesn’t do anything to fix the problems that led to their defeat. In order to avoid a wave election in 2026, they need to change the political environment and hoping it’s going to change on its own is probably a bad bet.

The most powerful determinant in any election cycle is the political environment. The corollary to that rule is that voters are more motivated to vote against something than for it. Anger and fear are the greatest motivators, not hope and change. People who went to the polls this year sent a message to the Republicans. Whether they receive it or not probably determines what happens next November.

In North Carolina, a similar political environment in 2026 could hand Republicans stinging losses in their remaining suburban legislative seats and cost them ones in exurban counties like Alamance. As long as prices are rising, jobs are flat, our cities are under attack, and constantly changing tariff policies ensure economic uncertainty, former Governor Roy Cooper starts the election season with a favorable wind at his back. If Trump switches gears, the winds could shift, too.

On another note, Anderson Clayton managed to throw the whole state auditor’s office into turmoil with a single tweet. It’s a great story and one with lessons for anyone in politics or public service. Again, Brian Anderson of Anderson Alerts got the whole story. Read it here.

Apparently, the voter search tool on the State Board of Election’s website failed on the last day of early voting. The tool lets people see if they are currently registered and where they are supposed to vote. After the GOP legislature stripped control of the SBOE from the governor and gave it to Republican auditor Dave Boliek, that failure is a bit embarrassing. Democrats, of course, pounced because that’s what parties do.

The North Carolina Democratic Party twitter account blasted the SBOE for incompetence. They claimed the failure was “impacting poll workers’ ability to quickly identify and register voters.” That wasn’t quite right since the poll workers still had access to the voter rolls, but, hey, it’s Twitter and have you seen the stuff Republicans post?

Anderson reposted the tweets and wrote, “AND WHERE IN THE HELL IS STATE AUDITOR DAVE BOLIEK?” Instead of ignoring the political shots like a more seasoned political operation would have done, the SBOE decided they needed to elevate the back-and-forth. They sent out a press release blasting Clayton, who is not an elected or government official. She should take that press release as a badge of honor. Anytime you can make your opponents amplify your criticism of them, you’re winning the battle. Score one for Clayton.

(On a personal note, I’ve never been more proud than when Republicans filed complaints against me with the State Board of Elections because I was mean to them.)

Then, it comes out that the SBOE had an internal debate as to how to respond to the tweet in the first place. Patrick Gannon, the long-time spokesperson for the SBOE, is on paid leave for urging caution instead of reaction. Now, the story is not about the tweets but about turmoil within the SBOE. In addition, we all know that the newly formed State Board of Elections had problems in their first election cycle with the voter file tool. Score another for Clayton.

In the era of Trump, no slight goes unnoticed by Republicans. Thin-skin is the armor of the GOP. The SBOE should have listened to their communications professional. Patrick Gannon knew what to do, even if he’s paying the price for the incompetence of his bosses.

So the lessons of this story are listen to the people who know what they are doing and don’t mess with Anderson Clayton.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6Uzs!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68d68f6d-f253-4b9c-8663-ae935f9efcfd_1360x770.avif",N,,2025-11-08 11:05:31.132572

Lawrence offered the customer ""$1,000 off any car I have"" for ""being such a good dude and doing the right thing.""","A Utah-based EV dealer has exposed how some dealerships allegedly manipulate federal tax credit rules, drawing outrage from viewers, and revealing questionable practices in the used electric vehicle market.

The two minute, 54 second video, which has garnered 979,000 views since June 11, features Alex Lawrence (@evautoalex) sharing a phone conversation with a follower who encountered what appears to be an illegal scheme to circumvent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations.

Lawrence, who runs EV Auto Alex and has built a following of over 163,000 subscribers by providing insider advice on EV financing and buying, recorded the conversation at his standup desk inside his Utah dealership. The video captures a live phone call with a TikTok follower who had attempted to purchase a used Tesla Model 3 the previous day from what he described as ""a big dealer group in Utah.""

The Alleged Scheme Unfolds

The caller's account entails a blatant attempt to work around federal tax credit requirements. According to the transcript, the customer visited the dealership specifically looking for a used Model 3 that would qualify for the federal tax credit—meaning it had to be priced at $25,000 or less.

""Hey, man, I'm looking for a used Model 3. Something that qualifies for a tax credit, $25,000 or less,"" the caller told the salesperson. The dealer showed him a vehicle with what appeared to be a $28,500 price tag.

When the customer questioned the price discrepancy, the salesperson allegedly revealed their workaround strategy. ""So what we do to get around that is we charge you 24.5 [thousand] on paper for the Tesla. And then we charge you like four grand for a charger,"" the caller recounted.

Until it expired on Sept. 30, the federal tax credit for used EVs provided up to $4,000 for qualifying vehicles, if the total purchase price excluding taxes and registration fees was under $25,000.

By artificially separating charges and listing mandatory add-ons as separate items, the dealership was allegedly attempting to make an ineligible vehicle appear compliant with IRS requirements.

According to IRS guidance on the expired credit, the sale price includes all dealer-imposed costs or fees not required by law, specifically including ""the retail price for each accessory or item of optional equipment physically attached to the vehicle at the time of sale."" The IRS explicitly states that dealers cannot reduce the sales price of a used clean vehicle based on mandatory add-ons, as ""the amount of the reduction would be considered part of the sale price for purposes of the credit.""

Customer Pushes Back With Evidence

The customer wasn't convinced by the salesperson's assurances. Armed with knowledge from Lawrence's previous educational videos, he challenged the dealership.

""I just saw a video referring to your video saying that was used to be a gray area, but it was just cleared up where the total purchase price, excluding taxes and registration, has to be below $25,000,"" the customer told dealership staff.

The finance manager was brought in to handle the situation, but continued to insist their method was legitimate. When the customer showed them Lawrence's TikTok explaining the regulations, the finance manager allegedly ""tried to brush it off,"" saying ""no, man, that's totally fine. We've done this a bunch of times. It's all good.""

Lawrence was tickled by this turn of events. ""Are you serious? You showed the finance manager a video of me?"" he asked, adding ""That's awesome.""

Pressure Tactics Escalate

When the customer requested written guarantees that the dealership would cover the $4,000 if the tax credit was denied, the finance manager refused. According to the caller, the dealership then attempted an even more questionable approach.

""Ultimately, he says, 'listen, man, we're going to sell you this right now. Tax, title, out the door, 24.5 [thousand]. And then tomorrow you have to come in and pay us $2,000 for TIPS,'"" the customer recounted.

Lawrence immediately recognized the legal implications. ""He wanted to do a separate transaction. Two grand. Dude, that is so illegal,"" he responded.

Had the customer gone through with this, it would likely have constituted tax fraud. The IRS has clear authority to pursue such arrangements as abusive tax avoidance transactions, which include ""sham arrangements having no economic significance or business purpose other than the avoidance or evasion of tax.""

Understanding the Tax Credit Requirements

The federal used EV tax credit, which was officially known as the previously owned clean vehicle credit, had specific eligibility requirements designed to help lower-income buyers access electric vehicles. To qualify, the vehicle needed to:

Be purchased from a licensed dealer

Cost no more than $25,000

Be at least two years old

Meet income requirements for the buyer

The IRS had been clear that the $25,000 limit applied to the total purchase price excluding only taxes, title, and registration fees. IRS documentation specified that the sale price ""includes all dealer-imposed costs or fees not required by law"" and explicitly included ""dealer documentation fees, which are part of the cost of purchasing a vehicle and are not required by federal or state law.""

Mandatory dealer add-ons, accessories, and extended warranties also needed to be included in the purchase price calculation.

The EV incentive was ended after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed on July 4, eliminated it.

Community Response and Industry Recognition

The video sparked hundreds of comments from viewers, with many sharing similar experiences at dealerships across the country. Several commenters specifically mentioned dealership groups by name, suggesting the practice may be more widespread than initially apparent.

User Dylan Ericksen commented that a local dealership group was ""doing what they do best 10/10 don't recommend.”

Another commenter, asell87, shared their own experience with what appeared to be the same dealership group: ""I left a 1 star review after my experience. They called and sent me a check for $100 to remove the review. They are sleezy.""

When Lawrence asked for more information, asell87 elaborated, ""They called me after I left the review and said how about we send you $100 for the problems with the tire and have you remove that review. I received the $100 for the tire, but kept the review up because they definitely deserve it and want to warn others.""

Motor1 reached out to the alleged dealership via email for comment. We'll update this if it responds.

Customer Buys Their EV Elsewhere

Despite the frustrating experience, the story had a happy conclusion. Lawrence offered the customer ""$1,000 off any car I have"" for ""being such a good dude and doing the right thing."" The customer took him up on the offer, with Lawrence confirming in the comments that he ""came right in and bought"" a vehicle from EV Auto Alex.

The video also served an educational purpose, with several industry professionals commenting that they had learned from Lawrence's content. User brianatbutler wrote, ""I just got my dealership on board with this because of your videos! My managers had no idea about this. So thank you!!""

Dealership Workers Weigh In

The video attracted attention from dealership employees who wanted to ensure their own stores weren't engaging in similar practices. Halye commented, ""I work for a big dealership in Northern Utah and listen to these videos to get clues to make sure it's not any of ours. I have not come across any [dealerships] doing this so far!""

Lawrence responded that he wasn't ""aware of anyone in Davis county and north doing this,"" suggesting the practice might be concentrated in specific areas or dealer groups.

The Broader Implications

Lawrence's video highlights the importance of consumer education in navigating complex federal incentive programs. His approach—combining entertainment with practical advice—has clearly resonated with EV buyers who need reliable information in a rapidly evolving market.

The incident also demonstrates how social media can serve as a check on questionable business practices. The customer's decision to show Lawrence's educational content to the dealership staff shows how informed consumers can push back against potentially fraudulent schemes.

Lawrence indicated in the comments that he was aware of ""three"" dealerships engaging in similar practices and was ""trying to reach their owners direct man to man first"" before taking further action, suggesting he's taking a measured approach to addressing the issue.

About First Public Hydrogen The First Public Hydrogen Authority (FPH2) is the United States’ 1st public hydrogen utility, designed to connect hydrogen producers with end users through a transparent, cost-effective model.","Following yesterday’s announcement that the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) is pausing operations, the First Public Hydrogen Authority (FPH2) reassures stakeholders that hydrogen markets remain strong. The partnerships, infrastructure, and market activity built through ARCHES are key elements to hydrogen deployment, and we look forward to building on their success.

FPH2’s recent hydrogen supply solicitation drew a broad range of hydrogen suppliers, many new to the California market and ready to invest in our state, a clear indicator of an expanding renewable hydrogen market. Just last week, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) approved repowering Scattergood Generating Station, to a hydrogen-ready power plant. This will be the first large-scale green hydrogen power plant in California and the second hydrogen power plant for LADWP.

Additionally, the terminal operators and Port officials at nearly every port in California are unwaveringly pursuing new hydrogen solutions to help meet their clean air goals. Despite some changes with federal energy policy, we see strong and consistent public and private sector investment in the hydrogen economy in California, and growing interest in investing in equipment to integrate hydrogen as a renewable fuel in their operations. Looking across the hydrogen market in California, we need all renewable hydrogen projects to move forward to meet the new demand on the horizon; it is a very exciting time for California’s green economy and for hydrogen.

“Hydrogen is a key driver for new jobs and a critical element to achieve energy diversity and energy independence,” said FPH2 Chairman R. Rex Parris. “The global hydrogen economy is estimated to be just above $200 billion and growing. The US hosts more than 20% of the global economy, with California leading as one of the nation’s largest hydrogen economies and growing.”

“I have complete trust and confidence that First Public Hydrogen Authority will continue to do the heavy lifting required to get a robust supply of cost-effective hydrogen in time to meet our climate and energy goals and supply our hydrogen needs at the port complex,” said Matt Dickenson, Sustainability Director, Energy, & Decarbonization Manager for Fenix Marine.

Cities and transit agencies across the region, including Lancaster, Industry, Montebello, and others, are transitioning to hydrogen-powered buses, vehicles, backup uses such as traffic signals, and stationary power solutions. Despite the cancellation of federal funding, private-sector hydrogen suppliers and end users continue to pursue their projects. We will need all the new planned hydrogen production projects in the state to meet this growing demand we see on the horizon.

“Local work continues. Our customers are moving forward, suppliers are scaling, and the momentum remains strong. California’s hydrogen progress has always been built from the ground up, by cities, transit agencies, municipal utilities, ports, skilled labor, and industry working together,” said Ernesto Medrano, Executive Secretary of the Los Angeles/Orange Counties Building and Construction Trades Council.

FPH2, the nation’s first public hydrogen utility, was created by cities to ensure that hydrogen deployment could continue reliably regardless of changes at the federal level. The Authority will continue to collaborate closely with partners and will sustain progress toward statewide clean-energy goals, local job creation, and long-term energy reliability.

Hydrogen activity in California has not paused. The projects are active, the partnerships are strong, and the work continues across communities statewide.

The list is based on an array of tests, in-depth reviews, and State Of Charge’s ChargerRater scores.

We believe that this is an invaluable resource for all in the market for residential EV charging equipment. The competition between the top models is fierce. Each model offers its own advantages and disadvantages. The common characteristics they all share are high-quality, reliability, Wi-Fi connectivity, and have received Tom’s seal of approval.

This year, the best products come from five manufacturers: ChargePoint, Emporia, EVIQO, Tesla, and United Chargers.

* Charging stations are often called simply “chargers”, although technically speaking, they are AC charging stations that only supply power to the car’s onboard charger.

In the article, we have attached links to some of the products in our shop, or to Amazon/manufacturer websites with referral codes, which we hope you might consider using to support State Of Charge and the EVChargingStations website.

The Best Home EV Charging Stations Of 2025 (Up to 12 kW)

ChargePoint Home Flex

The top five list opens up with the ChargePoint Home Flex, a 12-kW (50 amps at 240 volts) hardwired charging station with a SAE J1772 or NACS charging connector. The product is also available in a plug-in configuration (NEMA 14-50 or even NEMA 6-50), but the power is then limited to 9.6 kW (up to 40 amps at 240 volts).

The ChargePoint Home Flex has one of the best connectors (rubberized), an outstanding charging cable especially for cold-weather use, and a convenient integrated connector holster.

The smart app is advanced. However, Tom noted that one can’t connect two charging units in the same app, which may be an inconvenience in households with multiple stations. The charger also does not offer dynamic load management or power sharing features.

The hardwired version’s price is as low as $539 as of the posting of this article, while the NEMA 14-50 plug-in version is a bit more expensive at $599 (manufacturer’s regular price).

A unique feature of ChargePoint’s product is the option ($199) to switch the charging cable/connector from SAE J1772 to NACS (or vice versa). This might be helpful when switching from SAE J1772 to NACS in the future.

The ChargePoint Home Flex (hardwired version) received a total score of 86 points or 4.3/5 stars on the new, redesigned version of State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. That’s a really good result.

Emporia Pro

The Emporia Pro debuts in State Of Charge’s top picks, in some way replacing the previous “Emporia” model, which remains on the market under a new name as the “Emporia Classic”.

The Emporia Pro is a high-end charger with numerous smart charging features (see the recent review from June 2025). The hardwired version can deliver up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts), while the plug-in version with a NEMA 14-50 plug is rated at up to 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts).

Buyers can select a SAE J1772 connector or the new NACS connector option (Q4 2025) at purchase. The charging cable is thin, flexible (even in cold weather), and light, which makes things easier. The one thing that Tom dislikes is the connector holster — a bit thin and flimsy, but it can be replaced with a third-party product.

The Emporia Pro really shines when it comes to its software and smart features. It’s quickly becoming the go-to product for EV owners with a maxed-out utility service rating because its features enable them to avoid a costly electric panel upgrade.

Its Dynamic Load Balancing monitors the total draw of the home — including the charger — and temporarily limits the charger’s power as needed. This is a game-changing feature, which State Of Charge already had an opportunity to highlight in some of its recent videos: Installing a high-powered Emporia Pro EV charger in an apartment with a 100-amp electric service and Emporia Pro installation in a garage to solve the limited power issue.

The Emporia Pro’s regular price is $599, but considering its capabilities, it represents very high value.

The hardwired version of the Emporia Pro received a total score of 87 points or 4.35/5 stars on State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Honorable Mention: Emporia Classic

Before we move on, it’s worth making a slight pause for an honorable mention: the Emporia Classic. It is a less advanced version (no features like dynamic load balancing), but the cost is a quarter lower (check our shop here). It was one of the top models in 2024.

Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A from United Chargers is another new charging station on the list (in previous years, Tom listed the 40-amp Classic version). It’s a hardwired charging station with a power output of up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts), and two charging connector options (SAE J1772 or NACS).

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A is a heavyweight contender. It has an extremely durable case for outdoor use, a nice, thin charging cable, an “ok” connector, and a remote connector holster. Tom describes the Grizzl-E Ultimate as a very good unit, available at an excellent price ($479.99 as of the posting of this article).

As with any charging station, the Grizzl-E Ultimate has some weaker points. Tom mentioned that it lacks advanced smart charging features, such as dynamic load management or power sharing. The app functionality is limited, although one can pair the charger to a different app, which is quite unique for United Chargers.

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 48A received a total score of 88 points or 4.4/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Honorable Mention: Grizzl-E Classic

Because not everyone needs a 48-amp charger, Tom made an honorable mention of the Grizzl-E Classic plug-in version for a NEMA 14-50 outlet. It has a slightly lower power of up to 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts), but has an even more attractive price of $349.99. Currently, the Classic version is available only with the SAE J1772 connector (no NACS option yet).

EVIQO Evipower Gen2

In 2025, EVIQO introduced its second-generation smart residential charging station: the Evipower Gen2. The first-generation was among our most recommended models in 2024, and the new Gen 2 is even better, according to State Of Charge’s recent review.

The revised and improved EVIQO Evipower Gen2 comes in two versions: a hardwired version with a maximum power output of 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts) and a plug-in version (NEMA 14-50) with a maximum power output of 9.6 kW (40 amps at 240 volts). Both can be ordered with either a SAE J1772 or a NACS charging connector.

The hardwired EVIQO Evipower Gen2 is a very high-quality product at an attractive price of just over $400 (down from the regular $599). The plug-in version costs $371.15 as of the posting of this article. For the best EVIQO Evipower prices, also check our affiliate link on Amazon; just make sure you select the Gen 2 version.

The second generation has an excellent charging cable with outstanding cold-weather performance (on par with ChargePoint). The charging connector is fantastic — solid, heavy, with a metal locking tab and rubberized grip. The connector holster is nice, too.

On the negative side, the app could benefit from additional features. There is no dynamic load management or power sharing between multiple units.

The EVIQO Evipower Gen2 received a total score of 88 points or 4.4/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater.

Tesla Wall Connector & Tesla Universal Wall Connector

Tesla, the brand that needs no introduction in the EV industry, entered the charging business very early. Its third-generation charging stations are one of the best on the market.

Currently, Tesla offers two main hardwired charging stations: the Wall Connector (NACS charging connector) and the Universal Wall Connector (NACS charging connector with an integrated SAE J1772 adapter). They are both rated at up to 11.5 kW (48 amps at 240 volts). There is no plug-in version for NEMA 14-50.

The two units are basically the same. The Universal Wall Connector can be used to charge EVs with a SAE J1772 charging port, which is important during the transition period from CCS1 to NACS in North America. Additionally, it has Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) capability when paired with the Tesla Cybertruck. However, the Universal Wall Connector costs $600, compared to $450 for the basic Wall Connector.

Strong points of the Tesla Wall Connectors are their thin and flexible charging cables and integration with Tesla’s software ecosystem. Multiple charging stations can share power between them (as far as we know, they must be the same generation). There is even a dynamic load management feature, but it’s not easy to set up, which Tom describes in detail in the video.

Before purchasing, one should make sure that the side-mounted connector holster fits their garage layout.

The Tesla Universal Wall Connector received a total score of 89 points or 4.45/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. This unit is especially recommended for EV users with SAE J1772-compatible vehicles who want to stay future-proof with the NACS charging standard.

The Tesla Wall Connector does not offer SAE J1772 charging option, but with a noticeably lower price it’s a very competitive charging station for all those who already stick with the NACS-compatible EVs.

Thanks to its competitive price, the Tesla Wall Connector received a total score of 91 points or 4.55/5 stars in State Of Charge’s ChargerRater. That’s the highest score ever on the newly revised ChargerRater.

Full Power: 19.2 kW

Most EVs on the market in North America have onboard chargers rated at 7-12 kW, so 9.6-12 kW charging stations (40-50 amps at 240 volts) are the mainstream standard. However, some EVs have larger batteries and higher power chargers (up to 19.2 kW). To maximize charging, an 80-amp charger is the way to go. As a bonus recommendation, Tom selected one 80-amp charging station for this list.

Grizzl-E Ultimate 80A

The Grizzl-E Ultimate 80A offers up to 19.2 kW of power (80 amps at 240 volts), provided one has an available 100-amp circuit (see a related review here). This model features the same capabilities as the lower-power Ultimate 48A version, which is among the top picks.

The price is higher at $899.99, but it’s very competitive compared to other 80-amp chargers.

Final Thoughts

At the end of his video for the best home EV charging stations of 2025, Tom Moloughney recommends hardwired installations as a more reliable option. If one prefers a plug-in configuration, it would be good to seek a model with a temperature sensor in the NEMA 14-50 plug.

Another thing is to prioritize quality, reliability, and safety over price. The installation should be inspected to minimize the risk of any issues arising over the years, or even a fire. EV charging stations draw high power over multiple hours, day after day, which is an entirely different duty cycle than other electric appliances in a household.

I was as skeptical as the next person: would making the transition to an EV result in driving a in a car I hate? Would driving an EV be a compromise?

Back in the day, EVs were small, often odd-looking and didn’t fit my need for kids, car seats and winter driving. They were fair-weather rides that sounded good but in practice, could be lacking.

Then came the EV revolution, with cars like the Kia EV9, the Mustang Mach-E and the Volvo EX90 as options for drivers and families who want to bypass the gas station and go electric. Those cars changed everything.

And now, I find myself among EV drivers, too. As a car reviewer, I drive a lot of every type of c ar, but my go-to every day, and the subject of a lot of my experience and stories, is the Hyundai Ioniq 5.

This story is 100% human-researched and written based on actual first-person knowledge, extensive experience, and expertise on the subject of cars and trucks. Additionally, we partnered with Electric For All on this story and associated social media posts, but all opinions are my own.

Why I Love My EV: It’s Just So Good

After driving many of the EVs on the road I began to appreciate the finesse of the EV experience: one-pedal driving which basically allows you to use only the accelerator to speed up or slow down, using the brake rarely if at all. The feel and experience of this is simply superior to driving a gas-powered car.

Add to that brake hold, which allows you to take your foot off the brake when you’ve stopped, is just incredible. It’s one of those things that once you get used to it, going back to regular driving just feels wrong.

Watch: Why I love my EV: It’s so easy to charge

Driving an EV Couldn’t Be Easier

I also love the quiet start of the car, the easy drive and the instant torque: taking off when the traffic light turns green is so quick, and merging onto the highway is a new delight.

But plugging in your car in your own garage and never having to think about stopping to fuel up is simply the best. I can think about charging the car when it’s convenient for me, not when it’s necessary or I happen to drive by a gas station.

And, charging at home is cheaper, even when you consider the cost of adding a charger to your garage or exterior of the house.

Charging an EV at home Saves Time and Money

For years, getting gas was the biggest pain of the week. The gas station was out of the way, the opposite direction of school, dance class, my work spot and the grocery store. And, there was always a line; it was cold/hot/rainy/sweaty. And expensive. Sometimes it would cost me $50 to fill the car, other times that same fill-up was $75. Never predictable.

Charging a car at home is the opposite. I can plug the car in at night, let it charge to my preferred 80% and it turns off when it’s done. I get into the car in the morning with a full charge (or, really, 80%) and I’m on my way.

EVs can charge using a standard household outlet, or they can charge faster with a level 2 charger. The difference is about 3-5 miles per hour added to the range with a 110V household outlet vs about 25 miles charged per hour at a 240V outlet.

How I Updated My Garage to Charge At Home

To facilitate a level 2 charger at home, I added a home charge outlet to my garage. Because I’m, uh, thrifty, I looked at how to do this safely but at the lowest cost: add a 240V outlet and a smart charge cord. Here’s what it cost:

$150 for the electrician to install the outlet

$230 for the smart charger

$20 for the cord hook to hold the charge cord

I didn’t need to do any work on my electrical panel or update any of the electrical systems in my house. Essentially, if you have an electric clothes dryer, you can add an EV charger. The smart cord, which is wifi-enabled, lets me turn on and off charging from my app and set the amperage level. The most powerful circuit breaker in my electrical panel is a 30 amp breaker, so I set the charge level to 24 and voila, no additional work needed to charge my EV. Even at 24 amps, it fully charges overnight.

Watch: We took the Hyundai Ioniq 5 Off Road!

Incentives Are Still a Thing—You Can Find Them Here

We all heard the sad news a couple of months ago when the federal government phased out EV incentives for new and used car purchases. But that does’t mean that incentives are gone; in fact, the local power company covered half the cost of my EV charger installation. It’s in their best interest, after all, to power my car, right?

And many states, utilities and others provide incentives, and some of them are quite generous. Electric For All provides an incentive locator by zip code so you can see what is available and how to qualify.

Ready to Take the Plunge? Where to Test Drive an EV

One of my favorite events each year is Electrify Expo, the all-electric auto show that tours the US each year; you can find the rest of this year’s schedule here. If you missed your local EE event don’t fret; almost all auto shows, from the LA Auto Show taking place later this month to the New York Auto Show in April, 2026 and many in between will have EV test drives. You can check the web site of your local auto show and find out if EV drives are available.

Or, head to the dealership of the model you’d like to test out. They keep a test model on hand just for that purpose—and even if you really love it, they won’t let you buy it, but they’ll help you place an order.

It’s the only nuclear power plant in Maryland and provides energy to 1.3 million homes.
Constellation advocates that expanding the services and abilities of the Calvert Cliffs facility will help fill the gaps in Maryland’s energy demands and meet the state’s ambitious climate goals.
Nuclear energy is considered clean energy, and more nuclear energy programs are supported by a variety of groups.
“What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power.","LUSBY, Md. — Constellation announced a long-range proposal on Nov. 4 to invest in up to 5,800 megawatts of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland. According to the company’s release, the goal is to “meet rising demand for electricity, lower utility bills and usher in the next generation of clean and lower-carbon energy resources to power the state’s economic growth.”

The company proposed several projects as part of the state’s effort to fast-track innovative energy investments. Short-term projects include 1,500 megawatts of fast-track initiatives that could help address near-term needs, including battery storage and natural gas-powered solutions. Calvert Cliffs is part of the long-term proposal, as per the release:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center: Relicensing the state’s only nuclear plant to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 megawatts of clean generation that serves more than 1.3 million homes. Absent the license extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036, respectively.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10 percent, or 190 megawatts, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 megawatts of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.

Calvert Cliffs recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. It’s the only nuclear power plant in Maryland and provides energy to 1.3 million homes. Constellation advocates that expanding the services and abilities of the Calvert Cliffs facility will help fill the gaps in Maryland’s energy demands and meet the state’s ambitious climate goals. Nuclear energy is considered clean energy, and more nuclear energy programs are supported by a variety of groups.

The proposal also includes ways to make the energy market more competitive, which will, in theory, lower the cost for consumers.

“What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation,” said Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez.

Can V2G and bidirectional charging be a game-changer for renewable energy?

V2G is the missing link for fully unlocking India’s renewable potential. Solar and wind energy are intermittent. EVs, acting as mobile storage units, are a solution to solve this instability problem. Bi-directional charging allows these assets to dynamically stabilise the grid during peak demand or when renewable generation dips. This capability transforms an EV fleet into a distributed energy reservoir, significantly accelerating the reliable integration of clean energy sources. We believe this is fundamental to India’s energy future, providing the required flexibility to the grid.

What’s the potential Impact of V2G on renewable energy and decarbonisation – any short/long-term targets we could aim for?

The impact is often monumental in such cases. Short-term, V2G pilots, especially for fleet operators, can demonstrate 5-10 MW of flexible localised capacity within 18-24 months. In the long term, our goal should be to leverage the entire EV population to displace gas peaker plants and store gigawatts of renewable energy. In the near future, V2G could contribute to some reduction in national peak power demand by 2035, playing a crucial role in meeting India’s decarbonisation commitments by ensuring our clean power is accessible 24/7.

What steps are needed for the integration of V2G-enabled EVs into the grid? – How long until we can see commercial assets/models being rolled out?

Well, there are three steps to this. First, establishing robust communication standards (like ISO 15118) for seamless grid interaction, after which, second is securing regulatory clarity from utilities and finally, launching large-scale pilot projects. Servotech is actively developing the necessary bi-directional hardware and we anticipate that focused commercial models, likely starting with captive fleets like corporate or transit buses, could see initial rollouts within 3 to 5 years, with mass market visibility following regulatory approval.

What type of govt policies/incentives do we require for V2G to work?

Firstly, we require clear and consistent policy direction, then the most vital incentives are Time-of-Use tariffs that financially reward EV owners for discharging energy during grid stress and perhaps federal grants for V2G-enabled charger installations. Furthermore, mandating smart meter penetration and standardising communication protocols are essential. In my professional opinion, a guaranteed rate of return for V2G participation is necessary to make the financial case compelling for the average consumer, driving initial adoption.

How can the auto industry overcome the complexities of infrastructure and interoperability – what factors can affect the economic case?

The auto industry must embrace standardisation as a primary undertaking, specifically adhering to global interoperability protocols like ISO 15118 for charging and communication. This would minimise the complexity and risk, as the economic case is fragile and is affected by high battery costs and uncertain lifetime revenues. Success depends on showcasing the total cost of ownership benefit to fleet owners. The car is not just a means of transport, but a revenue-generating asset used to offset purchase price and operational expenses.

Milestones and infrastructure developments are needed to move towards mass adoption.

There are certain milestones that we need to achieve to meet nationwide charger-to-EV ratio targets, driven by public-private partnerships. Infrastructure must evolve beyond basic AC charging to a pervasive DC bidirectional charging capability across urban centres. We also need smart grid readiness, meaning every V2G asset is connected through a unified, secure cloud platform for dynamic power management. These foundational steps, supported by robust cybersecurity frameworks, are critical to ensuring mass adoption is not only widespread but also safely managed by the grid operators.

What are the concerns about battery degradation?

Battery degradation is a legitimate concern, as excessive V2G cycling can impact battery lifespan. However, this is largely a technical challenge that can be overcome. We are focused on developing intelligent Battery Management Systems that use sophisticated algorithms to optimise charging/discharging cycles. This ensures grid service only occurs within ideal state-of-charge ranges, thus minimising stress. Furthermore, V2G services will be prioritised for commercial fleets where asset utilisation and managed charging cycles are already highly optimised.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/11/08/Untitled-design-3-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 13:01:35.882430

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Tuesday was a great day at the ballot box for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide.

In races from New York to Georgia to Washington, voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit—and the people promising to deliver those policies. On the whole, the results suggest Americans are pushing back against President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back climate action.

“This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump Administration’s ban on clean energy, multimillion-dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher,” Sara Schreiber of the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

One of the day’s biggest wins came in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race in a landslide victory called just 35 minutes after polls closed. More than two million New Yorkers voted, the most in a mayoral race since 1969. Although Mamdani, who at 34 will be the city’s youngest mayor in more than a century, made affordability the predominant focus of his campaign, he garnered an endorsement from the youth-led climate organization Sunrise Movement. Many saw his campaign promises, which included calls for free mass transit and the greening of public schools, as the seeds of a populist climate movement.

“Zohran was talking about climate action in a way people could understand, and people were able to see the impacts of this climate action in their everyday lives,” Denae Ávila-Dickson, Sunrise’s communications and political manager, told New York Focus.

Dan Jasper, of the nonprofit group Project Drawdown, said Mamdani’s transit proposal “is not as sexy as something like solar. But these are the exact type of policies we’re going to need to actually address climate change, because it addresses people’s standards of living.”

Mamdani’s challenge will be assembling the coalition needed to make those policies happen. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has also promoted a municipal green new deal agenda, may not have similar difficulty. Yesterday, Wu’s City Council allies retained their seats, giving her a fighting chance at success.

As far as statewide elections go, Georgia was a point of contention: There, electricity prices were on the ballot. Democrats won two of the five seats on the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees utilities and has approved six rate increases in three years.

Democrats have not held a seat on the board since 2007, but clean energy consultant Peter Hubbard and anti-poverty advocate Alicia Johnson tapped voter outrage over climbing prices and notched upset victories over Republican incumbents, who had embraced fossil fuels and backed away from clean energy at a time when demand for power is rising.

“I think for a lot of folks who have felt powerless over rising utility bills, especially in a state like Georgia where they’ve gone up for the average household by more than $500 in just the last couple of years, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that potential change is coming,” said Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy nonprofit PowerLines.

Rising energy bills emerged as a top issue in other races, too, including the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. For political scientist Leah Stokes, who studies public opinion around climate change, Tuesday’s results weren’t unexpected.

“I think yesterday was a repudiation of the idea that Americans don’t care about energy or climate and these are losing issues, which is what all of these pundits have been going on and on about for about 9 months now. That’s really wrong,” Stokes said on Wednesday. “Everyday people understand that clean energy is cheap energy—they can easily make those connections.”

In New Jersey, governor-elect Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs” on her first day in office. She plans to roll out expanded generation capacity, including rooftop solar and battery storage, and “immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity.”

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s seat on a platform that included data center operators paying for their own electricity costs in a region that currently hosts over 13 percent of the world’s data center capacity. Her “Affordable Virginia” plan included calls to expand wind and solar power, promote home weatherization to ease power consumption, and streamline permitting and other requirements for expanding generation.

To the west, California voters approved Proposition 50, which will allow the state’s Democratic majority to sidestep the statewide redistricting commission and redraw congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The move was designed to give Democrats as many as five more seats in Congress in an effort to, among other things, combat further dismantling of climate and environmental policy. Governor Gavin Newsom and a slate of prominent Democrats nationwide championed the proposal as a counterbalance to Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas, where a similar effort earlier this year carved out 5 new seats for the GOP.

In a speech Tuesday night, Newsom said California voters approved the measure “to send a message to Donald Trump. No crowns, no thrones, no kings. That’s what this victory represents. [It] is a victory for the people of the state of California and the United States of America.”

Climate-friendly policies—those centering on transit, in particular—won on a local scale, too. Voters in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which includes the city of Charlotte, handily approved a 1 percent increase in the sales tax to finance nearly $20 billion in transportation improvements. Although 40 percent of the additional revenue will be allocated to roads, some of that funding will support new bike lanes and sidewalks. Another 40 percent will go toward rail, and the remainder will be dedicated to buses and microtransit. In Ellensburg, Washington, 65 percent of voters approved a permanent 0.2 percent sales tax to fund the municipal bus system.

Across the country, one thing was clear: Wallet-friendly climate policies—and candidates presenting themselves as helping people pay their bills—won. “Climate change isn’t at the forefront of every election, but at this point, every election is a climate election,” Jasper of Project Drawdown said. “‘Climate action equals affordability’ seems to be the winning message of the day.”

But the most notable portent wasn’t the governor’s races won by Abigail Spanberger in Virginia or Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. Nor was it Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor of New York City.

The most significant win for Democrats was in two little-watched races for Georgia’s utility board. Little-watched outside of Georgia, that is.

These races are important for several reasons. No Democrat has been elected to the five-member Georgia Public Service Commission since 2007. Georgia has become a bellwether in the conservative South, and it has 14 House seats.

What the above outcomes indicate is that much of the electorate has had it with Donald Trump: Tariff chaos. The fake wars waged on our cities’ streets. Bankrupt farms. Blatant corruption. The destruction of democratic institutions. It’s obviously getting harder for Trump to bully election officials in Georgia or elsewhere to “find” more votes than a candidate won.

Sherrill’s opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, might have done a lot better if he didn’t have Trump hanging around his neck. He was known as a moderate, the sort of Republican who can get elected in New Jersey. But he blew it playing cultural warrior, MAGA style.

As an aside, the media should stop making a big deal about Spanberger becoming “Virginia’s First Female Governor.” America currently has 12 women serving as governors. Several oversee conservative states: Kay Ivey in Alabama, Kim Reynolds in Iowa, Laura Kelly in Kansas and Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Arkansas.

Spanberger came with an impressive background as a representative who had worked for the CIA. Sherrill, by the way, is preceded in the New Jersey governor’s mansion by Christine Todd Whitman (1994-2001).

The outcome in the races for Georgia’s utility board also reflected frustration with climbing electricity bills. Spiking electric costs are plaguing Americans all over the country, and they will get worse as large data centers rush in to scoop up available energy supplies.

Nationally, electricity prices have jumped 10% since January. Trump is making matters worse by ditching the Biden-era subsidies for clean energy. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill chops $500 billion from those projects.

So hot are Republicans to kill off these new energy sources that they’re stranding capital already invested in them. In August, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order on a major wind project off New England that’s already 80% built. The bureau cited “concerns related to the protection of national security interests” without saying what they were. It took a federal court to lift that order.

Starting with Obama, America had pursued an all-of-the-above energy policy. That meant using traditional fossil fuels, the clean renewables and emerging sources, such as nuclear power, hydrogen and biofuels. (Texas is very good at this.) Now the policy is to stop the green-energy part, including infrastructure that even some oil companies supported.

The political battle that got the most attention was the race for New York mayor. The reasons were the colorful personalities, Mamdani’s controversial past and a Republican spoiler who wouldn’t leave the race. Add to that the New York-based media’s obsession with New York.

Mamdani has taken some of the edge off his more radical ideas by making nice with the “power brokers” he campaigned against. The hope is that he focuses on governing pragmatically — for which he will need some adult supervision. Unlike fellow Democratic Socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York mayor is an executive position overseeing a very complex organization. And no, Mamdani can’t single-handedly raise taxes on the rich.

But again, let’s not dwell on New York. For the most significant omen of Democrats’ prospects in the midterms, look to Georgia.

Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece.","Michigan regulators on Thursday adopted landmark standards for the booming data center industry with a plan they say tries to protect residents from subsidizing the industry’s hefty energy use.

In a 3-0 vote, the Michigan Public Service Commission adopted a rate structure that requires data centers and other energy-intensive industries in Consumers Energy’s territory to sign long-term power contracts with steep penalties for exiting early.

The order also requires Consumers to show that data centers will shoulder all costs to build transmission lines, substations and other infrastructure before adding them to the grid.

Commission Chair Dan Scripps called it a “balanced approach” that shows Michigan is “open for business from data centers and other large load customers, while also leveraging those potential benefits of the growth … in a way that’s good for all customers.”

The deal disappointed some environmentalists, who had pushed for explicit requirements that data center power come from renewable sources. Michigan utilities are legally required to achieve 100% clean energy by 2040. They must detail how they plan to meet that requirement in filings next year.

“While the order includes important consumer protection terms, the commission missed an opportunity to emphasize the importance of the state’s climate goals,” said Daniel Abrams, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

The rate structure applies to customers whose energy use exceeds 100 megawatts. Data centers are among very few industries that demand that much power. Often, they demand an order of magnitude more.

Consumers serves 1.9 million customers across much of the Lower Peninsula. Company spokesperson Matt Johnson said officials are still reviewing Thursday’s order and “its impact on all stakeholders.

“Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state’s economic development,” he added.

The deal comes amid an uncertain time for the data industry, which is growing fast because of artificial intelligence. Much more energy is needed to power the transformation, but many industry analysts fear rising AI stocks are a bubble and demand for the technology won’t materialize, leaving utilities and ratepayers to pick up the infrastructure tab for failed projects.

Hoping to avoid such an outcome, Consumers in February proposed special regulations that would lock data centers into 15-year contracts that guarantee consistent electricity use and require payments even if a facility ceases or downsizes operations mid-contract.

The commission’s decision Thursday approves much of that request, with some significant modifications.

DTE takes a different approach

The other big utility in Michigan, DTE Energy, is taking a different approach.

Rather than establishing a blanket rate structure like Consumers, DTE wants to negotiate its first data center contract individually while aiming to avoid public vetting of the deal.

After announcing last week that it had inked an agreement to supply power for a proposed Stargate data center in Saline Township, DTE filed a draft 19-year contract with state energy regulators and requested swift approval without a public hearing.

Michigan law allows such expedited reviews in cases that would bring no added costs to utility consumers.

DTE officials argue adding the Stargate data center to its system will help keep rates down for everyone by spreading fixed costs among more paying customers.

“Given the sizable affordability benefits for our customers, as well as the economic impact the project will have, we think moving forward in this fashion makes the most sense,” spokesperson Jill Wilmot said.

But DTE officials also stated in its filing that the company expects to spend some $500 million upgrading its transmission system and building a substation to serve the data center. Critics argue the utility is so intentionally vague it is impossible to vet DTE’s claims about affordability.

“It’s just highly concerning that they are trying to keep this somewhat private, because there’s so much at stake,” said Bryan Smigielski, a Michigan organizer with the Sierra Club.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also opposes DTE’s quest for expedited review, and has requested a thorough vetting of the proposed contract.

Members of the Public Service Commission have not decided whether to grant DTE’s request for quick approval, Scripps said.

Michigan’s data center electricity rate deliberations come amid a surge of interest from developers looking to take advantage of new tax breaks that could save the industry tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers last year voted to exempt large data centers from Michigan’s 6% sales and use tax in an effort to lure the industry to Michigan.

Beyond the Stargate campus, DTE is in late-stage negotiations for another 3 gigawatts’ worth of data center capacity, while Consumers Energy is nearing deals for three large data centers amounting to a collective 2 gigawatts of power.

Developers are also scoping out rural land throughout the southern Lower Peninsula, from the Grand Rapids area to the outskirts of Monroe.

The wave of interest could have big implications for water and land use in Michigan. Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece. Those that use water vapor to cool the servers inside the facilities — the industry’s most common cooling technique — also use large amounts of water.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.thealpenanews.com/images/2025/11/07151127/AP25293782583792-1-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:06:32.617877

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs.

The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago. A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

• West Virginia: Up 27.71 percent

• Ohio: Up 30.11 percent

• Pennsylvania: Up 30.85 percent

• Virginia: Up 19.78 percent

• Kentucky: Up 17.66 percent

• North Carolina: up 24.17 percent

• Texas: Up 27.58 percent

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69 percent capacity all the time or forgo the ability to recoup future costs.

The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and solar farms.

The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market.

The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid — coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total generation: 87,551 megawatts

• Natural gas – 33,469 MW (38.22 percent)

• Nuclear: 28,371 MW (32.41 percent)

• Coal; 13,197 MW (15.07 percent)

• Renewable energy: 10,043 MW (11.47 percent)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: Natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per megawatt hour, while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh — nearly 50 percent more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69 percent when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed.

Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need — or want — to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity — ultimately increasing your power bill.

Should America invest more in EV battery tech?","A pair of companies is partnering to lead the way in increasing production of EV batteries in the United States.

Epsilon Advanced Materials (EAM) and Phillips 66 have teamed up to support the domestic electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage system (ESS) battery supply chain, according to Batteries News. EAM is a manufacturer of sustainable battery materials, and Phillips 66 is a leading producer of synthetic graphite anodes, a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which are the go-to choice for EV batteries.

The way the partnership will work is that Phillips 66 will provide Green and Calcined Needle Coke (which goes into the synthetic graphite anodes) from its refinery in Louisiana to support EAM's graphite active anode material facility in North Carolina, currently under development.

EAM's facility is on track to begin operations in 2027 and is expected to provide enough graphite active anode to power approximately one million EVs a year.

""This collaboration is a major step in building a secure and sustainable battery materials supply chain for the US,"" Vikram Handa, Managing Director of EAM, said.

Graphite is a key component in EV batteries, but it often comes from foreign sources, some of which have weaker labor and environmental protections. It also helps alleviate concerns over tariffs disrupting supply chains, like China banning the export of the mineral to the U.S.

This partnership is excellent news for avoiding those issues, as well as keeping pace with the ever-expanding U.S. EV market. The demand for EVs is increasing, with the International Energy Agency reporting that more than 20% of new cars being sold are EVs.

EVs are becoming popular for a variety of reasons, one of the primary being financial. You can save up to $2,200 a year driving a fully electric vehicle, per the U.S. Department of Energy, because you're cutting down on fuel and maintenance costs.

The other benefit of EVs is their low environmental impact. EVs release no tailpipe emissions, meaning they aren't contributing to the planet-warming gases that pollute our atmosphere. And as the EPA notes, while charging your battery may increase pollution at the power plant level, it's still less of an impact than a traditional gas-powered vehicle. That impact can be lowered even further if you install solar panels at your home to charge your EV. You can check out EnergySage for vetted sources that provide accurate and fair prices on solar installations tailored to your needs.

Should America invest more in EV battery tech?

Absolutely 👍

No way 👎

Only if it brings down prices 💰

Only if it helps us compete with China 💪

A follow-up study in 2021 estimated that the city’s greenhouse gas emissions had increased by about 13% since the first study.
The inventory was updated again by Lotus as part of the Rooted in Resilience plan.","A bike share program, incentives for carpooling, and increased public transit access are among recommendations made by the City of McCall’s first climate action plan.

The plan, called Rooted in Resilience, outlines strategies for the city to “reduce the community’s impact on the environment, build McCall’s ability to bounce back from disasters, and adapt to shifts in long-term weather patterns.” The plan was adopted by the McCall City Council on Oct. 24

“I’m excited about the whole thing,” McCall Mayor Bob Giles said.

Strategies in the plan are broken down into three categories, including transportation, which an analysis indicated accounts for 52% of McCall’s greenhouse gas emissions.

Greenhouse gas emissions refer to gases that make the Earth warmer by trapping heat in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane.

The most common source of greenhouse gas emissions is burning fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and heat, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Reducing transportation emissions

Short-term transportation strategies in the plan include prioritizing where and when to add bicycles lanes, pathways, and sidewalks. The city will also create parking incentives for people to use bicycles and other non-motorized transportation instead of vehicles.

The plan also recommends making sustainability projects eligible for funding from the city’s local option taxes, which currently raises more than $3 million per year.

Piloting a bicycle or e-bike share program and making electric vehicle charging more accessible to neighborhoods are two medium-term strategies identified in the plan, which does not define a specific timeline for “medium-term.”

The plan urges the city to help expand Mountain Community Transit, a public bus service that operates in McCall and includes routes to Donnelly, Cascade, and New Meadows.

A long-term goal for the city is for 50% of the local workforce to live within five miles of the city to reduce commuter miles, which in 2021 were estimated at nearly 350,000 miles per year for 64 city employees.

“Actually getting people out of vehicles entirely is a very big goal of this plan at this point,” City and Sustainability Planner Meredith Todd said.

Community health and resilience

The plan also includes 10 strategies for community health and resilience — the second of three focus areas the plan is divided into. Health and resilience strategies aim to reduce emissions from residential and commercial buildings, which combine to account for another 43% of the city’s emissions, according to the plan.

Strategies include establishing a Green Business Program, incentivizing energy efficient housing, creating a drought resilience plan, and expanded use of energy from wind, water, and solar.

A Green Business Program could include efficiency trainings for contractors, assistance programs for energy efficiency upgrades in buildings, and promotion of green business practices in McCall.

Wildfire resistant landscaping and design standards should also be created around McCall through wildfire risk overlay zones, according to the plan.

Destination management

The final focus area in the plan is destination management, which involves adopting a “holistic approach” to managing the city’s tourism economy.

The first strategy recommended by the plan is to create a destination management plan, a process the city council was briefed on earlier this year, as Valley Lookout reported.

Other strategies include adopting land management strategies that increase the ability of soil and plants to absorb and store carbon dioxide, a process known as carbon sequestration. Strategies for reducing pollutant-laden run-off could also be developed.

The city should also explore partnerships for public education to encourage eco-tourism and promote other strategies, the plan said.

The Rooted in Resilience plan was developed by Lotus Engineering and Sustainability, a Denver engineering firm hired by the city in 2024 to write the plan for about $94,000l

Strategies in the plan are informed by more than 2,000 survey respondents, four focus group sessions, and five community events held over the last two years.

The climate plan is a continuation of recent environmental efforts by the city over the last seven years.

In 2018, the city conducted a greenhouse gas inventory to determine local sources of greenhouse gases and estimated amounts contributed to the atmosphere per year.

A follow-up study in 2021 estimated that the city’s greenhouse gas emissions had increased by about 13% since the first study.

U.S. airlines began canceling hundreds of flights Thursday due to the Federal Aviation Administration’s order to reduce traffic at the country’s busiest airports starting Friday because of the government shutdown.

More than 790 planned Friday flights were cut from airline schedules, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions. That number, already four times higher than Thursday's daily total, was likely to keep climbing.

The 40 airports selected by the FAA span more than two dozen states and include hubs such as Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the agency's order, which was published Thursday evening. In some metropolitan areas, including New York, Houston, Chicago and Washington, multiple airports will be impacted.

The FAA said in the order that the reductions will start Friday at 4% and ramp up to 10% by Nov. 14. They are to be in effect between 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time and impact all commercial airlines.

The decision to reduce service at “high-volume” markets is meant to maintain travel safety as air traffic controllers exhibit signs of strain during the shutdown. It also comes as the Trump administration is ramping up pressure on Democrats in Congress to end the shutdown.

Federal judge orders Trump administration to fully fund SNAP benefits in November

A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Thursday to find the money to fully fund SNAP benefits for November, a decision that the administration promptly appealed.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump's administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it's unlikely the 42 million Americans — about 1 in 8, most of them in poverty — will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries nearly that quickly.

The order was in response to a challenge from cities and nonprofits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit, a decision that would have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.

“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said in a ruling from the bench after a brief hearing. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”

McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.

Supreme Court lets Trump block transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and nonbinary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.

The decision is Trump’s latest win on the court's emergency docket, and allows the administration to enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to correspond with their gender identity on new or renewed passports. The court’s three liberal justices dissented.

The high court has sided with the government in nearly two dozen short-term orders on a range of policies since the start of Trump's second term, including another case barring transgender people from serving in the military.

In a brief, unsigned order, the conservative-majority court said the policy isn't discriminatory. “Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth,” it said. “In both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment.""

The court’s three liberal justices disagreed, saying in a dissent that those passports make transgender people vulnerable to “increased violence, harassment, and discrimination.”

Musk could become history's first trillionaire as Tesla shareholders approve giant pay package

NEW YORK (AP) — The world’s richest man was just handed a chance to become history’s first trillionaire.

Elon Musk won a shareholder vote on Thursday that would give the Tesla CEO stock worth $1 trillion if he hits certain performance targets over the next decade. The vote followed weeks of debate over his management record at the electric car maker and whether anyone deserved such unprecedented pay, drawing heated commentary from small investors to giant pension funds and even the pope.

In the end, more than 75% of voters approved the plan as shareholders gathered in Austin, Texas, for their annual meeting.

“Fantastic group of shareholders,"" Musk said after the final vote was tallied, adding “Hang on to your Tesla stock.”

The vote is a resounding victory for Musk showing investors still have faith in him as Tesla struggles with plunging sales, market share and profits in no small part due to Musk himself. Car buyers fled the company this year as he has ventured into politics both in the U.S. and Europe, and trafficked in conspiracy theories.

Nancy Pelosi won't seek reelection, ending her storied career in the US House

WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi will not seek reelection to the U.S. House, bringing to a close her storied career as not only the first woman in the speaker's office but arguably the most powerful in American politics.

Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco for nearly 40 years, announced her decision Thursday.

“I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said in a video address to voters.

Pelosi, appearing upbeat and forward-looking as images of her decades of accomplishments filled the frames, said she would finish out her final year in office. And she left those who sent her to Congress with a call to action to carry on the legacy of agenda-setting both in the U.S. and around the world.

“My message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,” she said. “We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way.”

Kazakhstan will join the Abraham Accords with Israel in symbolic move to boost the Trump initiative

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kazakhstan is set to join the Abraham Accords between Israel and Arab and Muslim majority countries in a symbolic move aimed at boosting the initiative that was a hallmark of President Donald Trump’s first administration.

The action, announced Thursday, is largely symbolic as Kazakhstan has had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1992 and is much farther geographically from Israel than the other Abraham Accord nations — Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.

Those countries agreed to normalize relations with Israel as a result of joining the accords, something Kazakhstan did shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The move was first confirmed to The Associated Press by three U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity to detail plans that hadn't yet been made public. Hours later, Trump posted on his social media site that he’d had “a great call between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of Israel, and President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, of Kazakhstan” and that Kazakhstan is the “first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many.”

Trump called Kazakhstan joining “a major step forward in building bridges across the World” and said “more Nations are lining up to embrace Peace and Prosperity through my Abraham Accords.”

Trump unveils deal to expand coverage and lower costs on obesity drugs

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump unveiled a deal Thursday with drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand coverage and reduce prices for the popular obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

Known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, the drugs have soared in popularity in recent years, but patient access has been a consistent problem because of their cost — around $500 a month for higher doses — and insurance coverage has been spotty. More than 100 million American adults are obese, according to federal estimates.

Coverage of the drugs for obesity will expand to Medicare patients starting next year, according to the administration, which said some lower prices also will be phased in for patients without coverage. Starting doses of new, pill versions of the treatments also will cost $149 a month if they are approved.

“(It) will save lives, improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” said Trump, in an Oval Office announcement in which he referred to GLP-1s as a “fat drug.”

Thursday's announcement is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to rein in soaring drug prices in its efforts to address cost-of-living concerns among voters. Pfizer and AstraZeneca recently agreed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicaid after an executive order in May set a deadline for drugmakers to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay.

A former teacher shot by student, 6, wins $10M jury verdict against ex-assistant principal

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — A jury in Virginia awarded $10 million Thursday to a former teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student, siding with her claims in a lawsuit that an ex-administrator ignored repeated warnings that the child had a gun.

The jury returned its decision against Ebony Parker, a former assistant principal at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.

Abby Zwerner was shot in January 2023 as she sat at a reading table in her first-grade classroom. She had sought $40 million against Parker in the lawsuit.

Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand. A bullet narrowly missed her heart and remains in her chest.

Zwerner did not address reporters outside the courthouse after the decision was announced. One of her attorneys, Diane Toscano, said the verdict sends a message that what happened at the school ""was wrong and is not going to be tolerated, that safety has to be the first concern at school. I think it’s a great message.”

There are more than 100 autoimmune diseases, and they mostly strike women. Here's what to know

Our immune system has a dark side: It’s supposed to fight off invaders to keep us healthy. But sometimes it turns traitor and attacks our own cells and tissues.

What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body – and tens of millions of people. While most common in women, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they’re on the rise.

New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.

“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.

Here are some things to know.

Cowboys' Marshawn Kneeland found dead of apparent suicide at 24 after evading officers, police say

Police in a Dallas suburb say 24-year-old Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland was found dead of an apparent suicide after evading authorities in his vehicle and fleeing the scene of an accident on foot.

Frisco police said Thursday they are investigating the suicide. They said Kneeland didn't stop for Texas Department of Public Safety troopers over a traffic violation in a chase that was joined by Frisco police on Wednesday night.

Authorities lost sight of the vehicle before locating it crashed minutes later. During the search after Kneeland fled the crash site on foot, officers said they received word that Kneeland might be suicidal.

As authorities were looking for Kneeland, a dispatcher told officers that people who knew him had received a group text from Kneeland “saying goodbye. They’re concerned for his welfare,” according to recordings from Broadcastify, which archives public safety radio feeds.

“We’re talking to the girlfriend. She’s trying to call his agent. But we’re trying to get her to call him first. But she’s saying he is armed and has a history of mental illness. And her quote was, ‘He will end it all,’” another dispatcher told officers.",,N,,2025-11-08 09:58:30.174187

Hydron Energy Inc. is lining up customers for its proprietary INTRUPTor, a machine that takes raw byproduct gases emitted from places like landfills, sewage plants and farms and upgrades them into renewable natural gas (RNG).

The process, developed by Hydron CEO Soheil Khiavi, uses “biomimicry,” making the machine work like a pair of lungs. Unlike existing technology to refine RNG, the INTRUPTor works at atmospheric conditions and without the need for high pressures or temperatures. It means the renewable natural gas can be upgraded at about half the capital and operating costs, delivering gas with 80 per cent lower emissions.

Earlier this year, the company concluded its first field test at a farm in Ontario.

“The results came back basically excellent. It was no problem. All the key performance metrics were met, some of them exceeded and we had a really good, happy customer. That turned into a purchase order for full-size plant,” Khiavi said.

Hydron has since signed agreements for other projects with FortisBC, Northwest Natural Gas in Oregon and the City of Chilliwack.

When it became clear that Hydron was going to go from a research and development firm to a manufacturer, the company began taking over 20,000 square feet space within their Lynn Creek area light industrial complex. Rooms that used to be ballet studios with mirrors still on the walls are now being used to assemble their patented tech. That has also meant staffing up.

“Currently we are about 20 people,"" Khiavi said. ""Our goal is to double up, so 40 people here by end of next year, and mostly on the manufacturing of our novel biomimicry, metalorganic framework, which is the secret sauce of the technology.”

Despite tariffs and setbacks in U.S. interest in decarbonization projects, Washington State and California’s governments are still going ahead with clean energy plans, Khiavi said. And Hydron is seeking out more markets in Europe and Asia.

Singapore and Thailand buy massive amounts of LNG at a premium from the Middle East to fuel their growing economies, but Khiavi said all of the gasses coming from their own biomass are being incinerated and emitted into the atmosphere with no benefit to anyone.

“If they actually use this technology, they can produce a big portion – up to 10 per cent of the gas that they need – just using their waste, at a price that is almost half of the import price of the LNG. It’s going to save them a lot of money,” he said.

Khiavi said the greatest potential for the technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally is in the “hard-to-abate” sector, and places in the world where other green sources of energy are not practical or available.

“We can actually cover a big portion of that,” he said. “10 to 12 per cent of the carbon emissions could be replaced…. The impact is huge.”

What’s more, Khiavi said, they are exploring other novel applications for the INTRUPTor’s biomimicry. In the lab, they are capturing small amounts of rare gases like xenon and krypton out of thin air. Aerospace customers need those gases for satellite propulsion, but there is a shortage in the market because the primary source for them in the world was a plant in Ukraine that was bombed by Russia early in the war.

And the same process captures planet-warming carbon dioxide and sequesters it while refining the rare gases.

Since nonpoint pollution “cannot be easily measured,” Ecology-approved BMPs will ensure compliance with water-quality standards, according to the pollution-control plan.
The document also recommends riparian buffers at least 215-feet wide in Western Washington and 150-feet wide in Eastern Washington.
The pollution-control plan could be a way for Ecology to impose them, Washington Cattle Feeders Executive Director Jack Field said.
In comments sent to Ecology, the cattlemen’s association said the pollution-control plan bypasses the Legislature to set environmental and agricultural policy.","Washington farm groups are concerned the Department of Ecology will punish farmers and ranchers who decline to adopt large riparian buffers and other “best management practices.”

Ecology labels the practices, or “BMPs,” as “voluntary guidance.” But Ecology has drafted a pollution-control plan claiming the power to “require the implementation of best management practices.”

Farm groups are lobbying Ecology to clarify that the BMPs will be truly voluntary. They also want Ecology to pledge not to punish farmers who decline to adopt the department’s BMPs.

“Our concern is the BMPs will be voluntary, until they become mandatory,” Washington State Water Resources executive director John Stuhmiller said.

Ecology plans to submit the pollution-control plan to the Environmental Protection Agency by the end of the year. The plan will describe how Ecology will keep dirt and chemicals from running into waterways. Ecology periodically updates the plan to stay eligible for federal money.

Simultaneously, Ecology is taking public comments on BMPs for agriculture. Ecology developed the BMPs over several years. They purportedly are the best ways to prevent runoff, or “nonpoint,” pollution.

Since nonpoint pollution “cannot be easily measured,” Ecology-approved BMPs will ensure compliance with water-quality standards, according to the pollution-control plan.

Although called “voluntary,” the BMP document sometimes uses the word “must,” such as fences “must” keep livestock 25 feet from ditches.

The document also recommends riparian buffers at least 215-feet wide in Western Washington and 150-feet wide in Eastern Washington.

The Legislature rejected a bill requiring large buffers. The pollution-control plan could be a way for Ecology to impose them, Washington Cattle Feeders Executive Director Jack Field said.

“That could eliminate a lot of ground,” he said. “This plan is going to have an impact on anyone who has water on or adjacent to their property.”

Ecology’s plan holds out the possibility of penalizing “recalcitrant landowners” who don’t implement BMPs. The plan’s tone won’t encourage landowners to seek guidance from Ecology, Field said. “I don’t think the plan gives people that feeling.”

Ecology intends for the BMPs to help landowners comply with water-quality standards, department spokeswoman Colleen Keltz said in an email.

“Decisions about how to achieve compliance, about whether to implement recommended BMPs, and about which practices to choose remain in the hands of the producer,” she said.

“We recognize every property is unique and will continue to work on site-specific solutions as needed that reduce pollution and protect water quality,” Keltz said.

Ecology posts on its website a 2019 memo from the attorney general’s office stating it has the power to manage farmers who are polluting or have a “substantial potential” to pollute,

“Ecology’s authority includes the authority to require a nonpoint-source polluter to implement specific management measures,” the memo states.

Ranchers who do not adopt Ecology’s preferred practices could face penalties, the Washington Cattlemen’s Association warns.

In comments sent to Ecology, the cattlemen’s association said the pollution-control plan bypasses the Legislature to set environmental and agricultural policy.

“It imposes unproven, costly and often-impractical measures under the guise of ‘voluntary’ participation,’ ” the cattlemen said.

This is exactly where Android Auto and Apple CarPlay shine brightly, as they work indefinitely for as long as the car still exists.","After GM announced abandoning Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the decision started a heated debate about the phone projection support. The carmaker argued that phone projection only provides limited functionalities, and a native solution is far superior. To be fair, GM is not the only carmaker that doesn't want Apple and Google trespassing on its turf. Others have refused to accommodate them from the get-go, even if this irked their customers.

Tesla has never considered Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and it has been just fine regardless. Firstly, because it sold most of its vehicles to a strong base of die-hard fans, who were perfectly fine with anything Elon Musk chose for them. Secondly, Tesla's software is so good that nobody really misses phone projection apps. Rivian has followed a similar path, although for different reasons.

While Rivian's software is considered second-best after Tesla's, the EV startup is nowhere near Tesla's software experience. Its customers have long begged and threatened the company to bring Apple CarPlay support, without success. Rivian thinks that it will be able to match and even better phone projection apps with its in-dash infotainment solution.

Why are some carmakers refusing to offer Apple CarPlay and Android Auto?

The bet is not only on retaining customer data in-house, but also on selling lucrative subscriptions for functions that Apple and Google offer free of charge. This is also the reason why GM decided against offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its electric vehicles. More recently, the Detroit carmaker announced that it would also remove phone projection support from its combustion vehicles, enraging more owners. While carmakers want us to believe that their native infotainment systems are way better than using our phones, this also locks owners onto the maker of their vehicles. Strangely, GM was the one proving how bad this is for its customers, especially when the carmakers decide to pull the plug on certain features.

Case in point, GM just shut down its NGI app store, which allows installing apps in older (but not very old) Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC vehicles. The decision, which took effect September 30, turned the infotainment systems of millions of cars into dumb radios. Owners can still use the installed apps, but they are not supported anymore. If they decide to delete the app or reset the infotainment systems, they are gone for good, and attempts to reinstall them will fail.

Which GM vehicles are affected by the NGI app store shutdown?

Among the Chevrolet-branded affected models are the 2017-2018 Camaro and Silverado 1500, 2017-2019 Corvette, Cruze, Malibu, Silverado HD, Suburban, Tahoe, Volt, 2017-2020 Colorado and Impala, 2018-2019 Traverse and Trax, and 2019-2020 Equinox.

Buick adds 2017-2018 Verano, 2017-2020 Regal, 2017-2021 Encore, 2018-2019 Enclave, and 2019-2020 Envision to the list, while Cadillac has 2017-2019 ATS, CTS, XT5, XTS, as well as 2017-2020 CT6 and Escalade. GMC completes the list with the 2017-2018 Sierra 1500, 2017-2019 Acadia, Sierra HD, and Yukon, as well as the 2017-2020 Canyon.

As you can see, a lot of vehicle owners as new as MY2021 are left without software support and the possibility to reinstall or install new apps. This is not the first time it has happened, and likely won't be the last. We've seen it recently when the 3G networks across the globe shut down, leaving many vehicles without internet connectivity.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support is an underrated feature

This shows that relying on a carmaker to provide the right infotainment features is futile. GM is eager to sell you a new car with Android Automotive rather than supporting its old models. Not only because it makes money from selling cars (partly), but also because supporting old software is cumbersome. GM is focusing on current software platforms, leaving older hardware behind. It also shows that even modern infotainment systems have a much shorter lifespan than a typical vehicle. People tend to keep their cars for at least five years, and even after that, they are not scrapped but start a new life as used vehicles. It's not unusual to see people riding in 15-year-old cars or older, especially when they are well-maintained.

In this case, we're talking about much newer vehicles that are still far from their projected end of life. Can you imagine paying $100k on a 2020 Escalade and not being able to use apps on it after only five years?

This is exactly where Android Auto and Apple CarPlay shine brightly, as they work indefinitely for as long as the car still exists. You might upgrade your phone every two years, but your vehicle would still allow you to use the same familiar interface. It's a different story with locked-down infotainment systems, which a carmaker can deprecate at any time to force you to buy a new one.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gm-kills-infotainment-apps-in-millions-of-vehicles-proving-carplay-support-is-crucial-260524_1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 07:17:31.903064

Unchecked climate change will set back human development and already is in some places suffering from drought, extreme heat, intensified storms, and threats to water and food security.","I’m here in Belém, Brazil for the annual UN Climate talks (COP 30) set to get underway on November 10 in the shadow of a sobering United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report confirming the world will breach the 1.5ºC mark. Before we plunge into hectic agenda fights and intense negotiations over bracketed text in draft agreements, it’s worth remembering what these talks are ultimately about. They’re about decisions made by world leaders that are deeply consequential for everyone’s health and prosperity, and that will determine the kind of world we leave for future generations.

Many of the issues are perennial, and they will surface in specific ways at this COP—billed as an ‘implementation’ COP meant to focus on climate actions that need to be taken now not just vague promises of future commitments.

In a previous blogpost, I highlighted some things to watch at this COP, including how countries plan to step up ambition on their emissions reduction commitments, aka nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and the need to simultaneously advance adaptation measures. I also called attention to whether trust can be rebuilt over richer nations’ grossly insufficient climate finance for lower income countries. Of course, the influence of fossil fuel interests that swarm COP is a major threat to ambitious outcomes here.

At the heart of global climate agreements is the recognition that we cannot solve this problem solely as individual countries, regardless of how big or small, but we can succeed if we tackle it together by each doing our fair part.

Synergies between global and domestic climate action

COP can feel remote and arcane, but what’s agreed to here can boost clean energy and climate efforts at home—and what countries do through domestic policies and investments significantly affects the level of ambition at COP. At COP and at home, those actions must include efforts to expand access to cheap, clean, renewable electricity while phasing out polluting fossil fuels; opportunities to protect communities from climate impacts already baked in; and signals to decision makers across the global economy about aligning innovation and investments with climate and human development goals.

Acting together by boosting renewable energy and transitioning away from fossil fuels, we can bend the global emissions curve meaningfully and limit the rise in global average temperatures. At the same time, the emissions building up in the atmosphere come primarily from richer nations—although other major emitters like China are playing a growing role—and are unleashing costly and deadly impacts around the world already. Therefore, every country must also invest in protecting its people, economy and critical ecosystems from these worsening impacts, and richer nations have a responsibility to pay toward those efforts in lower-income nations.

The synergies between domestic policies and global climate ambition are crucial. When they work well, we get a multiplication of collective efforts. The Paris Agreement, secured 10 years ago, led to a crucial acceleration in clean energy deployment around the world and cuts in heat-trapping emissions.

Clean energy was already on the rise, and nations and businesses took the Paris Agreement as a guide to accelerate that momentum through domestic policies and investments. Collectively, that has helped bend the global emissions trajectory and reduce how much global average temperatures will rise over this century (albeit not by nearly enough as we are still on track to overshoot 1.5°C and even 2°C).

But when those synergies fray or break down, the impact can also be felt both at home and on the global stage. Right now, we are at one of those critical junctures, as the Trump administration tears up US clean energy policies and investments, disgracefully steps away from the Paris Agreement, and tries to undermine global climate action. At Belém, it will be crucial for the other 190+ nations to isolate the Trump administration in its deeply harmful actions and anti-science rhetoric and forge ahead to find an ambitious global consensus.

It’s in every nation’s self-interest to limit dangerous climate change and embrace the economic and public health benefits of a clean energy transition—and it’s in the global collective interest. The time for zero sum thinking and hiding behind other countries’ inaction is over as the planet teeters on the brink of overshooting 1.5°C of warming.

Why COP 30 Matters

COP is an opportunity to see the challenges in our daily lives mirrored in struggles around the world, and to seek common ground in addressing them in ways that prioritize regular people, not powerful political interests and the billionaire class. The massive global income inequities, that amplify the harms in the lowest income countries and communities, also come into focus here.

As I prepare for COP, I’ve been reflecting on how extreme climate-fueled disasters are now a harsh reality for so many people across the United States and the world. The people still reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton have something life-altering in common with people in Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba recently hit by Hurricane Melissa.

Also, the people in the Philippines who have just endured Typhoon Kalmeigi and other cyclones this year, on the heels of a record-breaking 2024 cyclone season. Small island nations face looming existential threats from sea level rise that will be familiar to people in coastal Louisiana.

No one chooses to be on the frontlines of these disasters they did not cause, and everyone deserves support in getting back on their feet and being better protected from the next storm, or wildfire, or flood. Meanwhile, the UNEP Adaptation Gap report points out the huge shortfall in current funding for adaptation in lower income nations. This is an issue that will be front and center at this COP.

I’ve also been thinking about how people at home in the United States are struggling to afford their electricity bills, even as the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress are decimating clean energy policies that would have helped drive down costs, and even as the costs of proliferating data centers are being passed on to all of us consumers.

Meanwhile, around the world millions of people don’t even have access to modern forms of energy and all too many depend on polluting fossil fuels that are taking a steep toll on their health. Massively ramping up renewable energy and energy efficiency (and the infrastructure to enable that)—solutions that are at our fingertips already and that are cheaper than fossil fuels in most cases—is unquestionably the commonsense path forward to tackling many of these challenges.

Being at COP is a fresh reminder that alleviating global poverty and improving people’s lives is directly and intrinsically connected to addressing climate change. Solutions to all these grave and pressing challenges can and should be aligned.

Misguided calls to pit these priorities against each other are puzzling, wrong and deeply harmful. Unchecked climate change will set back human development and already is in some places suffering from drought, extreme heat, intensified storms, and threats to water and food security. Investing in expanding access to renewable energy, drought-resistant crops, heat health protections for workers, universal healthcare, safe affordable housing, and a human rights-centered framework for people displaced by disasters are crucial both for people’s health and economic well-being, and for addressing worsening climate impacts.

Solving for problems simultaneously is the call of the hour, and it’s a no-brainer. What’s often standing in the way are entrenched interests who are making a lot of money off the current fossil fuel-based economy and are craven enough to weaponize the plight of people who live in poverty to keep the world chained to polluting fossil fuels.

Acting together is the antidote to delay, distractions and lies

Back in 1992, the world adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), here in Brazil, recognizing the science on climate change and the imperative to act together based on that science. It’s an almost miraculous global agreement that truly stands the test of time. Here is Article 2 from the UNFCCC, for example:

The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.

Despite the clarity and urgency of scientific reports from the IPCC and others in the decades since then, governments have not adopted strong enough policies and the fossil fuel industry still holds far too much sway over the world’s energy choices.

That we are at this sobering moment in the climate fight can be cause for gloom. I am here alongside many smart, committed people—including leaders from US states, cities and businesses, and climate justice advocates from around the world—because the fight still matters. It matters more than ever. We know the causes of climate change, we know the solutions to address it—now let’s get our political leaders to adopt them, using every beneficial tool at our disposal.

COP is by no means the only venue for this fight—although it is an important one, as it’s the only place where every country, no matter how big or small, has a voice. Everyone has a role and place where they can engage in this fight for our future.

Here in the US that could be in your public utility commission proceedings, in state legislatures, through efforts to push back against EPA’s rollback of the Endangerment Finding, or through investments your business makes. It could be through art that provokes and engages more people. It could be through campaigns to save precious forest and coastal ecosystems. And it’s tremendously uplifting to know that like-minded people around the world are also fighting where they can for these same goals and aspirations.

As ever, this is a fight we can only win by acting together, from our backyards to the world.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Antonio-Guterres-COP30.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:06:36.439419

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has launched an all-out assault against two of the most prominent sources of clean energy—wind and solar.

Trump has lambasted the technologies as the “scam of the century” while providing what critics describe as giveaways to the fossil fuel industry, increasing lease sales for drilling and mandating that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

His signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act significantly accelerated the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects, pulling back on commitments made under the Inflation Reduction Act several years prior.

Even renewable projects already in progress have suffered. Empire Wind 1 and Revolution Wind, two offshore wind projects in the Northeast that were under construction, received stop work orders from the Trump administration before ultimately being allowed to proceed.

Despite those headwinds, one pro-renewable group is offering something that’s been hard to come by lately: optimism.

“I really don’t think that this is a time for despair and withdrawal,” said Dan Stein, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Giving Green.

In a new report released on Wednesday, the research and grant-making organization highlighted what it sees as two opportunities to advance clean energy in a bipartisan fashion, even in an intensely polarized environment: commercializing what it describes as “clean firm power” technologies such as nuclear and geothermal, and addressing barriers to clean energy deployment such as federal permitting delays.

The report challenges concerns that clean energy is a lost cause under the Trump administration. Instead, the group’s strategy sees room to work directly with the administration on clean energy policy—rejecting the idea that advocates should shift their focus away from federal action in favor of an exclusive focus on state and local policies.

According to Giving Green, clean firm power refers to technologies that can produce emissions-free electricity on demand and over long periods of time. This differs from technologies like wind and solar, which don’t provide consistent energy throughout the day or across seasons.

Stein acknowledges that wind and solar play an important role in decarbonizing the energy grid since they are the cheapest and most technologically ready clean energy sources. However, he argues that the limitations of those technologies’ ability to provide consistent energy mean that they likely aren’t suitable to provide 100 percent of future electricity needs.

“You need to kind of bend over backwards the more and more you put solar and wind on the grid,” Stein said. “You need to make sure that you have big transmission lines to move energy around from the places where the wind is blowing, you need some batteries that will move power from day to night and even maybe from summer to winter.”

According to Armond Cohen, executive director and founder of Clean Air Task Force—which was awarded a two-year, $4 million grant by Giving Green on Wednesday—that means clean energy advocates need to start pressing for additional energy solutions.

“We can quibble over whether 80 percent of the problem can be solved with wind and solar or 50 percent, but I think there’s pretty much an emerging consensus that that is not 100 percent,” Cohen said.

To fill those gaps, Giving Green’s strategy aims to boost alternative technologies it believes could most benefit from philanthropic intervention.

The report highlights two technologies in particular—“next-gen” geothermal and nuclear fission—as top priorities due to their feasibility, scale and funding needs.

Those two technologies have been left largely unscathed by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy—and in some cases have even received its explicit support.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright included advanced nuclear and geothermal power in his first secretarial order as part of the department’s vision to “unleash American energy innovation.” And in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax credits for nuclear and commercial-scale geothermal projects were largely preserved even as those for wind and solar were drawn back.

For years, geothermal energy has largely been restricted to areas with significant volcanic or tectonic activity, with easily accessible heat, steam or hot water close to the Earth’s surface. Because of those limitations, large-scale geothermal projects have been geographically limited—found mainly in regions such as Iceland, New Zealand and the western United States.

However, technological advances in the oil and gas industry have opened up new opportunities for geothermal exploration.

According to Jamie Beard, founder and executive director of the geothermal nonprofit Project InnerSpace, hydraulic fracturing—which helped touch off the boom in U.S. natural gas along with horizontal drilling—can now be used to tap into the energy source in locations and at a scale that wasn’t previously possible.

Project InnerSpace, which has previously received funding from Giving Green and was just announced as a recipient of its next round of grants, is developing additional tools and technologies to tap into that new potential.

According to Beard, one of the largest barriers to geothermal development she heard from the private sector, governments and funders was an inability to know where they should drill. In response, Project InnerSpace developed GeoMap—which Beard describes as “Google Earth for geothermal.”

Unlike similar paid services that Beard says can sometimes cost millions of dollars, GeoMap is free. It allows stakeholders to utilize hundreds of layers of subsurface and surface data to analyze the expected cost of geothermal projects anywhere in the world.

“Funding entities are using it for diligence. Governments are using it to build policy. Every geothermal startup in the world uses it,” Beard says.

She thinks those advances—along with model projects the group has helped develop through its “GeoFund”—will help make geothermal energy an attractive investment even for companies that traditionally rely on fossil fuel extraction.

“How do you build a business model for geothermal that will actually attract the oil and gas industry? A business model where they will want to drill for geothermal, because it makes business sense for them to drill for geothermal?” Beard said.

“If we crack that code, you crack geothermal at scale globally.”

Some oil and gas companies have shown interest in the technology in recent years. Devon Energy invested $100 million into a Houston geothermal startup in early 2024, while BP and Chevron took part in a $40 million investment round for startup Eavor Technologies in 2021.

Still, there is likely some way to go before Beard’s vision comes to fruition. According to a 2024 report from the International Energy Agency, only about 15 percent of geothermal capacity is currently operated by oil and gas companies. And the industry has been slower to embrace geothermal compared to other clean energy investments, says the Journal of Petroleum Technology.

Next-generation nuclear fission, too, was highlighted by Green Giving’s report as a key opportunity to promote clean firm power.

Nuclear accounts for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. power supply, but building out additional capacity has been constrained by cost, Stein said.

Safety regulations put in place after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 have led to a much more complex and lengthy approval process for new nuclear projects, according to Stein. In addition, because these projects are significant undertakings, they face the same considerable regulatory hurdles that any major infrastructure project is required to undergo.

“The same reason it takes billions of dollars to build a subway in Manhattan is like the same reason it takes billions of dollars for [nuclear development],” Stein said.

But similar to geothermal energy, Giving Green sees recent technological advances in nuclear power as an opportunity to build new projects at greater speed and reduced costs than previously possible.

“The promise of these next-generation nuclear designs is that they can be more modular,” Stein said. “Learn how to build it, get it permitted, get it approved, learn how to build it really well, and then build it over and over and over.”

Giving Green’s report acknowledges the hurdles that will have to be cleared to achieve those goals. Advanced nuclear—like next-gen geothermal—is not yet a mature technology and will require sustained research, development and demonstration before it can move toward widespread and competitive deployment, the report says.

It also highlights risks about the viability of advanced nuclear, saying that the technological progress and political conditions that its future depends on are uncertain.

Beyond highlighting philanthropic opportunities to advance clean firm power, the report also says clean energy deployment of all forms, including wind and solar, need better regulatory processes—from accelerating federal permitting to modernizing the interconnection process.

Federal permitting reform, in particular, has received significant bipartisan attention in recent months—and support from industries across the energy sector.

One such legislative attempt, the SPEED Act, was introduced by Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and committee member Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine).

The bill would make significant changes to how the federal government conducts environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), considered the bedrock of environmental law.

Those changes would include limits on what projects would be subject to NEPA review and the scope of those reviews; raise the bar for courts to overturn the decisions of federal agencies overseeing those reviews; and establish a 150-day deadline to sue federal agencies over their permitting decisions—a drastic reduction from the current six-year statute of limitations for energy projects.

However, some Democrats and environmental groups have cast doubt on whether the benefits of any permitting reform bill, even a technology-neutral one, would be felt equally across the energy sector.

“I am personally deeply skeptical that we can negotiate in good faith right now to try to accelerate permitting of any kind, while there is an ongoing bad faith attack against solar and wind,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) said during a September hearing for the bill.

That sentiment was echoed by critics such as Marlyn Twitchell, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center.

“Given the administration’s war on renewable energy projects, this bill would do little but SPEED the climate crisis and the fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and oppressive heat that have already killed so many Americans and so severely damaged our homes, public lands, and economy,” Twitchell said in a September press release.

Stein acknowledged those fears but sees a way forward.

“I do share those concerns that the devil is really going to be in the details,” Stein said. “I think I’ve seen some senators say, ‘If there’s going to be permitting reform, we need some legal guarantee that the administration will not just cancel renewables projects.’ And I do think that that’s something that could be built into any legislation.”

To Stein, the promise of technological advances and bipartisan support for clean firm power, plus the potential to find compromise on deploying clean power more efficiently, leaves significant room for hope despite the political climate.

“I think that despite headwinds, there’s a lot that civil society can do at all levels,” Stein said. “It is a responsibility we have to try to bridge the gap and solve problems, rather than withdrawing to our specific camps or specific places where people agree with us.

“So I kind of want to be the voice for optimism here and say, ‘Look, it’s tough times, but we can still get things done—and this is a long-term fight.’”

Cohen, the head of Clean Air Task Force, agreed.

“Climate is a marathon, not a sprint,” he said. “So this too shall pass.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2205280577-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 05:57:30.939024

The Trump administration's return to power has unleashed an ambitious offshore energy program that dwarfs previous federal leasing initiatives. Through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the administration has mandated 36 total lease sales spanning from 2025 through 2040, representing a dramatic expansion of U.S. offshore lease sales under Trump's administration compared to the Biden era's more restrictive approach.

This comprehensive leasing framework encompasses 30 separate auctions in the newly designated Gulf of America and 6 additional sales in Alaska's Cook Inlet region. The sheer volume of acreage being offered approximately 81 million acres across both regions establishes this as the largest offshore leasing initiative in modern American history.

The economic implications are substantial, with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) implementing the 12.5% minimum statutory royalty rate to encourage robust industry participation. This rate, representing the lowest permissible under federal law, signals the administration's commitment to attracting maximum investment while still generating significant federal revenues from these offshore resources.

Historical data reveals that previous administrations typically conducted between 1-3 offshore lease sales annually, making Trump's program of multiple sales per year through 2040 an unprecedented commitment to domestic energy production. The timeline begins aggressively, with the first major sale, Big Beautiful Gulf 1, scheduled for December 10, 2025, just weeks after the program's announcement.

Strategic Geographic Focus Areas

Gulf of Mexico: America's Premier Offshore Energy Hub

The Gulf of America, spanning approximately 160 million acres of outer continental shelf, represents the cornerstone of Trump's offshore strategy. The inaugural Big Beautiful Gulf 1 (BBG1) sale will offer 80 million acres for development, making it one of the largest single lease offerings in federal history.

Resource assessments indicate the Gulf contains extraordinary potential:

29.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil reserves

54.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas resources

Existing infrastructure supporting rapid development

Proven geological formations with high success rates

The Gulf's strategic advantages extend beyond raw resource potential. Decades of development have created a mature ecosystem of pipelines, refineries, and support infrastructure that can rapidly accommodate new production. Water depths range from shallow nearshore areas to ultra-deepwater regions exceeding 10,000 feet, offering opportunities for operators with varying technical capabilities and risk tolerances.

Environmental considerations have been carefully incorporated, with specific exclusions for the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary and previously withdrawn environmentally sensitive areas. The Eastern Gap region, extending beyond U.S. territorial waters, remains excluded to maintain clear jurisdictional boundaries.

Alaska's Cook Inlet: Northern Energy Frontier Development

Alaska's Cook Inlet represents a complementary northern component of the administration's strategy, with 1 million acres designated for the inaugural Big Beautiful Cook Inlet 1 (BBC1) sale scheduled for March 2026. This marks the beginning of a six-auction series extending through 2032.

Cook Inlet's operational environment presents unique considerations:

Seasonal ice conditions requiring specialised equipment

Limited existing infrastructure compared to the Gulf

Proximity to Anchorage providing logistical advantages

Harsh weather patterns affecting operational windows

The region's resource potential, while smaller in absolute terms than the Gulf, offers strategic advantages including reduced transportation costs to West Coast markets and potential integration with trans-Alaska pipeline infrastructure. Historical production from Cook Inlet has demonstrated the area's commercial viability, though previous leasing activity had been limited under recent administrations.

Economic Incentive Structure and Industry Participation

Royalty Framework Designed for Maximum Participation

The administration's decision to implement the 12.5% minimum statutory royalty rate across all lease sales represents a calculated strategy to maximise industry participation while ensuring federal revenue generation. This rate structure provides several key advantages:

Competitive Global Positioning: The 12.5% rate compares favourably with international offshore leasing terms, particularly when combined with the U.S.'s stable regulatory environment and existing infrastructure. Furthermore, trump finalises Gulf oil lease plans while Norway's offshore royalty rates typically range from 20-28%, and the UK North Sea imposes rates between 10-40% depending on field characteristics and production levels.

Investment Certainty: By establishing a consistent rate across all sales through 2040, the administration provides the long-term price certainty that major oil companies require for multi-billion dollar offshore development projects. These projects typically require 5-10 years from lease acquisition to first production, making predictable fiscal terms essential.

Revenue Sharing Structure: Federal law mandates that a portion of offshore lease revenues flow to coastal states through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act and similar programs. Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama receive substantial annual payments that support coastal restoration and infrastructure projects.

The revenue potential is substantial. Historical Gulf of Mexico lease sales have generated between $100 million to $9.5 billion per sale, depending on oil prices, acreage offered, and industry confidence. With oil prices currently above $70 per barrel and strong industry demand for domestic production opportunities, the 36 planned sales could generate tens of billions in federal revenues over the program's duration.

Comparison with Previous Administration Approaches

Biden vs Trump: Contrasting Energy Philosophies

The contrast between the Trump and Biden approaches to offshore leasing reflects fundamentally different energy philosophies. The Biden administration, operating under Inflation Reduction Act constraints, conducted only three offshore lease sales during its tenure, emphasising environmental protection and climate considerations over production maximisation.

Key differences include:

Sale Frequency: Trump's 36 sales over 15 years averages 2.4 sales annually, compared to Biden's approach of approximately one sale per year. This represents more than a doubling of lease sale frequency.

Acreage Scope: While Biden-era sales typically offered 10-20 million acres per auction, Trump's BBG1 offering of 80 million acres demonstrates a commitment to maximum resource access. However, this expansion comes amid concerns about us economy tariffs that could impact global energy markets.

Regulatory Streamlining: The Trump administration has modified environmental review processes to reduce approval timelines while maintaining safety standards. Specific changes include expedited NEPA reviews and streamlined consultation requirements.

Climate Considerations: Biden's approach incorporated extensive climate impact assessments and prioritised renewable energy development on federal waters. Trump's framework focuses primarily on traditional oil and gas development with climate considerations limited to statutory requirements.

Historical Context of Federal Offshore Programs

U.S. offshore leasing began in the 1950s with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, establishing federal jurisdiction over offshore resources. Peak leasing activity historically occurred during energy crisis periods, including the 1970s oil embargos and the early 2000s price increases.

The current program's scale exceeds even these historical peaks. During the Reagan administration's peak offshore period (1983-1988), federal lease sales averaged 15-20 million acres annually. Trump's program proposes offering an average of more than 50 million acres annually, representing unprecedented resource access.

Environmental and Regulatory Framework

Protected Area Considerations and Exclusions

Despite its expansive scope, the Trump offshore program maintains important environmental safeguards through specific area exclusions and regulatory requirements. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, encompassing critical coral reef ecosystems, remains completely off-limits to development.

Endangered Species Consultations: All lease areas require biological assessments and consultations with the National Marine Fisheries Service

Seasonal Restrictions: Certain areas face temporal drilling restrictions during marine mammal migration periods

Water Quality Standards: All operations must comply with Clean Water Act discharge requirements

The regulatory framework continues to require comprehensive environmental impact statements for major offshore projects, though the Trump administration has streamlined review timelines to reduce project delays. Industry operators must still demonstrate technical capability and financial responsibility to handle potential environmental incidents.

Industry Safety and Operational Standards

Offshore drilling operations remain subject to stringent federal safety requirements established following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident. These include:

Blowout Preventer Requirements: All drilling operations must utilise certified blowout prevention systems with regular testing and inspection protocols.

Well Control Standards: Operators must demonstrate well design integrity and maintain qualified personnel for all critical operations.

Spill Response Capabilities: Companies must maintain oil spill response plans and equipment positioning requirements based on operational location and scale.

Environmental Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of air and water quality around offshore installations remains mandatory.

Important Note: While the approval process has been streamlined, federal safety and environmental standards remain substantially unchanged from previous administrations, ensuring continued protection of marine ecosystems and operational safety.

Ahead of Monday's official kickoff, officials have sought to build support for initiatives to protect forests and to streamline carbon markets, which seek to reduce the emissions that drive warming. But the meetings also took time to hear impassioned testimony about the harms climate change is dealing around the world.

Haitian diplomat Smith Augustin, whose country was pummeled by Hurricane Melissa, appealed to wealthier countries that produce the greatest share of the world’s emissions to support Haiti in preparing for bigger storms. Developed countries pledged $300 billion to help poor nations cope with climate shocks at last year’s summit, but the money has yet to be distributed.

“The hurricanes and the heavy rain devastated my country,” said Augustin. “Developing countries, and especially the small island states, are the least responsible for climate change.""

Kithure Kindiki, Kenya’s vice president, said rescuers in his country are still searching for scores of people missing after a deadly landslide triggered by torrential rain sent muddy water crashing into villages last week.

“A previously once-in-a-century cycle of extreme droughts alternating with devastating floods continues to wipe out lives,” he said. “This has now become common.”

And Kalani Kaneko, the foreign minister of the Pacific Island nation of the Marshall Islands, said his country already is living a nightmare.

“All we have to do is look out our front doors to witness the impact of climate change,” he said. “Now the sea rises, the coral dies and the fish stock leaves our shores for cooler waters.”

Time running out

Officials warn that it has become almost impossible to keep global warming below the key Paris Agreement benchmark of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).

Last year was the hottest year on record. Scientists say that every fraction of a degree of atmospheric heating unleashes longer droughts, deadlier heat waves and more intense storms.

Hurricane Melissa has made that painfully clear, said Racquel Moses, director of the Caribbean Climate-Smart Accelerator, a coalition investing in climate resilience.

“It will be much, much harder to ignore the Caribbean, to talk around the issues that are absolutely real, because we just had this experience,” said Moses, who has family in Jamaica. “The very way that we live is dependent on these negotiations going according to plan.""

Reduced summit participation hangs over talks

World leaders who were not in the room on Friday were perhaps as important as those who were.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who calls climate change a hoax and prioritizes fossil fuels, boycotted the summit, leaving a hole that many other world powers sought to fill.

Although China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India also skipped the conference, the officials sent in their place used the podium to revive lagging enthusiasm about the global energy transition and assure the gathering that multilateralism was not dead just because the U.S. wished it so.

Praising his country's massive installations of wind and solar power, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang promised to “accelerate the green transition in all areas.” Although China is by far the world's biggest carbon emitter, Ding made clear it was still a leader in switching to cleaner forms of energy.

“China is a country that honors its commitments,” he said.

Indian diplomat Dinesh Bahata on Friday touted his country’s expansion of renewables to half of all energy capacity, portraying the Global South as bending toward the future of affordable, clean power while political calculations trapped wealthier nations in an outdated addiction to fossil fuels.

“While developing countries take decisive climate action,” he said, “developed countries fall short.”

Others criticized that imbalance, with Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chairman of the African Union Commission, questioning how developing nations were expected to decarbonize at a time when financial assistance for poor countries is faltering and the U.S., the world's biggest oil producer, is cashing in on heightened demand for hydrocarbons.

“We do not ask for charity, but for climate justice,” he said.

Maina Vakafua Talia, the environmental minister of the island nation of Tuvalu, at one point addressed Trump directly over the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. “Mr. President, this is a shameful disregard for the rest of the world,” he said.

The White House shot back that Trump “will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Progress on forest protections and carbon markets

Attendees said they made progress on two initiatives over the past two days: Financial incentives to support endangered forests and a shared global carbon market.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was working to win support for a signature new fund that would pay 74 developing countries to better preserve their rainforests.

The fund drew $5.5 billion in pledges on the first day of the U.N. climate summit, as Norway and France joined Brazil and Indonesia in investing. Germany said Friday it would make a “considerable” commitment. The scheme eventually seeks to leverage investments into $125 billion.

Finland's President Alexander Stubb hailed the fund as a model for how to drive climate solutions.

“What we might be seeing now, according to studies, is a turn of the tide on carbon dioxide emissions,” he told The Associated Press. “This is because of financing. This is because of innovation. … That’s why I think (the fund) is a good idea.”

Also on Friday, Brazil and the European Union announced that they were joining forces with China and several other countries to create a coalition aimed at uniting the world's different emission trading systems into a single global carbon market.

A shared carbon pricing framework would motivate countries and companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by allowing those that pollute less than their assigned emission caps to sell credits to counterparts that exceed theirs. It has long been notoriously difficult to get nations on the same page about emission limits and prices.

Indigenous people eye a spot at the table

Brazil has billed this summit in the Amazonian city of Belem as uniquely inclusive of Indigenous leaders who have long been sidelined from decision-making in past climate talks despite feeling the most adverse effects of global warming.

Lula's government, which includes Brazil's first-ever Indigenous Peoples' Ministry, expects over 3,000 Indigenous delegates to participate this month as both members of civil society and negotiators. For comparison, last year's summit in Azerbaijan drew just 170 Indigenous people.

“This time, world leaders are coming Belem, to the heart of the Amazon, closer to our homes, our rivers, our territories,"" said Olivia Bisa, leader of the Chapra nation in Peru. Although Indigenous people cannot represent tribal nations in the talks, Bisa and others will have a greater role as delegates negotiating on behalf of their nation-states.

“We need to be in the room, not right outside of it,"" she said.

Their protests have also shined a light on the contradictions of host Brazil promoting itself as a defender of the Amazon rainforest. Lula's recent approval of an oil drilling project at the mouth of the Amazon river has set off demonstrations and outrage.

On Friday, outside Belem in the wider state of Para, hundreds of Indigenous people scaled cargo boats on the strategic Tapajos River to denounce separate plans for a new railway that would slice through their lands.

“This is our message to the leaders of the world,” Marília Sena, a leader of the Tupinamba nation, told reporters. ""We want people to see us who have been here for centuries, caring for the forest and the river.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87144335007-ap-25310640937115.jpg?crop=5659,3184,x0,y294&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 12:06:45.142855

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world's most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, being showcased Friday at the COP30 climate summit, provides political support for expanding biofuels and relatively low-emission hydrogen-based fuels. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

India's rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India's northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

Mann said prices for sugarcane have also dropped this year. He said it’s good that the government is tackling climate change, but it should put farmers and their prices ahead of ethanol mandates.

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India's ethanol, but that's beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP. “With the push for E20 blends or even more, a lot more area has to be cultivated which in turn means it’ll be replacing other crops,” she said.

Balancing India's needs

Climate experts said biofuel production can have minimal environmental impact when it’s made from waste or inedible vegetation and processed in facilities that run on clean energy. But when crops are grown explicitly for biofuels, it has a higher carbon footprint because of the fertilizer and fuel involved.

India’s ethanol strategy is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions, cut oil imports and boost agriculture, said Purva Jain, an energy specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But she said a faster transition to infrastructure for electric vehicles might be better. A 2022 study by her organization found that installing solar power for EV charging can be a much more efficient land use than growing crops for biofuel.

However, ethanol producers have invested significant sums in manufacturing and need a steady, growing market for their product now, said CK Jain, president of the Grain Ethanol Manufacturers Association. He said India should increase the percentage of ethanol mixed with gas and encourage the sale of compatible vehicles.

“We need to have higher blending as soon as possible, otherwise the industry will go into deep financial trouble,” Jain said.

Other experts advocated for a middle ground.

A 10% blend of ethanol with gasoline, can be a “win-win” solution said Natarajan of CSTEP. She said that would allow for use of existing crops without putting too much pressure on increased cultivation.

Khare, the YouTube influencer, said keeping lower blends available would help older vehicles.

“The government can bring E20 or even up to E85 programs on top of that, that’s completely fine. But consumers need to be given the option,” he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87147200007-ap-25309752249366.jpg?crop=6499,3656,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 13:01:54.666017

“Commitments like this gain traction over time,” said Mauricio Lyrio, secretary for climate, energy and environment for Brazil’s foreign ministry. “Therefore, 19 endorsements so far are an excellent result.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 MWe of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output.
The Calvert Cliffs NPP is located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Lusby in Calvert County, Maryland.
Besides Calvert Cliffs, other Constellation power facilities in Maryland are the Conowingo Dam, the Perryman natural gas plant in Aberdeen, the Philadelphia Road oil plant in Baltimore and three wind farms in Western Maryland.
He said such an agreement could provide Constellation with the confidence to apply for a new 20-year licence for Calvert Cliffs.","Baltimore-based US power utility Constellation has announced a long-range proposal to invest in up to 5,800 MWe of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland. To meet the state’s near-term needs, Constellation submitted battery storage and gas generation proposals to the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) as part of a state programme to fast-track permits for large-scale energy projects. Longer term, the company has proposed a range of new and existing nuclear investments, including a plan to work with state leaders to explore building new NPPs in Maryland.

With respect to near-term projects, Constellation President & CEO Joe Dominguez, said: “Constellation hopes to be a thought partner as Governor Moore and other policymakers consider the state’s many choices.… We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want. Therefore, our plan presents natural gas generation as one of a number of options, with an explanation of the utility work that will be needed to secure this option.”

He added: “What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation…. Constellation has extended the lives of our wind assets for another 20 years, and we are working with willing customers to support the relicensing of the Calvert Cliffs clean nuclear plant.”

He said Constellation was “excited to work with Governor Moore, other state policymakers, and all Maryland stakeholders to investigate the development of new nuclear power in our state just as dozens of states across America are doing today”. He noted: “Importantly, all our investments have been and will be done without any cost to Maryland families and businesses. We are not now and never will be a monopoly that seeks guaranteed profits.”

The full plan starts with more than 1,500 megawatts of fast-track projects that could help address near-term needs, including up to 800 MWe of battery storage capacity and more than 700 MWe (six units) of existing gas-fired power generators that could be rapidly deployed in Maryland and later converted to operate on hydrogen fuel. Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 MWe of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.

Longer term, the company has proposed potential investments in up to 4,000 MWe of new and existing nuclear projects. These include:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Centre: Relicensing the state’s only NPP to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 MWe of generation that serves more than 1.3m homes. Without licence extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036. The two pressurised water reactors (PWRs) rated at 863 MWe and 855 MWe were commissioned in 1975 and 1977.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10%, or 190 MWe, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 MWe of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output.

In addition to investments in new generation, Constellation seeks the to make better use of the energy resources already available in the region by working with large businesses to lower their consumption during peak times, helping to free up capacity for new energy users, relieve strain on the grid and lower overall costs. Constellation plans to make these “demand response” programmes more impactful by using AI to create a 1,000 MWe “virtual power plant” on the regional grid.

The Calvert Cliffs NPP is located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay near Lusby in Calvert County, Maryland. It generates approximately 40% of Maryland’s total power and a significant majority (around 87%) of the state’s clean energy. In February 2009, Calvert Cliffs set a world record for PWRs by operating 692 days non-stop. In 2008, unit 2’s capacity factor was a world-record high of 101.37%.

Besides Calvert Cliffs, other Constellation power facilities in Maryland are the Conowingo Dam, the Perryman natural gas plant in Aberdeen, the Philadelphia Road oil plant in Baltimore and three wind farms in Western Maryland.

Previous efforts to build a third reactor at Calvert Cliffs came to nothing. Constructing a new, large-scale reactor would take “maybe 10 years from start to finish” said Mason Emnett, Constellation’s Senior Vice President for Public Policy.

Emnett said adding a third nuclear reactor to Calvert Cliffs would probably cost around $10bn. A small modular reactor (SMR) might reduce this by several billion. Making technological upgrades, which could boost output by 10%, would probably cost around $1bn.

Constellation is looking to the companies that operate data centres, for support. Emnett said Constellation is in talks with large-load customers who could sponsor upgrades at Calvert Cliffs or other sites, in exchange for pulling power from those sites.

,EPA,2025-11-08 08:16:09+00:00,Yahoo News,Trump administration moves to loosen restrictions it once supported on a harmful pollutant,MATTHEW DALY,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-administration-moves-loosen-restrictions-145052183.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Near the end of his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that aimed to reduce harmful, planet-warming pollutants emitted by refrigerators and air conditioners.
The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.
The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs.
“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.
States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Near the end of his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that aimed to reduce harmful, planet-warming pollutants emitted by refrigerators and air conditioners. The bipartisan measure brought environmentalists and major business groups into rare alignment on the contentious issue of climate change and won praise across the political spectrum.

Five years later, the second Trump administration is reversing course, as it moves to loosen a federal rule — based on the 2020 law — that requires grocery stores, air-conditioning companies and others to reduce powerful greenhouse gases used in cooling equipment.

The shift in approach has upended a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to quickly phase out domestic use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and are considered a major driver of global warming.

The proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency highlights the second Trump administration's drive to roll back regulations perceived as climate-friendly, even at the cost of causing disarray for the very business interests it is claiming to protect. The plan is among a series of sweeping environmental rollbacks that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said will put a “dagger through the heart of climate change religion.”

The HFC proposal will help “make American refrigerants affordable, safe and reliable again,” Zeldin said in a statement.

But environmentalists say the plan will exacerbate climate pollution while disrupting a years-long industry transition to new coolants as an alternative to HFCs.

With HFCs one of the main drivers of extreme heat and pollution, any delay in their phaseout “is going to be have negative outcomes and significant ones,” said Kiff Gallagher, executive director of the Global Heat Reduction Initiative, an international effort to reduce trapped heat that is warming the planet.

Industry groups supported the phaseout

The 2020 law signed by Trump, known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, phased out HFCs as part of an international agreement on ozone pollution. The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chemistry Council, the top lobbying group for the chemical industry, were among numerous business groups that supported the law and an international deal on pollutants, known as the Kigali Amendment, as wins for jobs and the environment. U.S. companies such as Chemours and Honeywell developed and produce the alternative refrigerants sold in the U.S. and around the world.

The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs. Zeldin said the Biden-era rule did not give companies enough time to comply and the rapid switch to other refrigerants had caused shortages and price hikes. Some in the industry dispute this.

In September, the EPA announced it is relaxing standards for cold storage warehouses and other cooling equipment and delaying other aspects of the HFC rule until 2032.

EPA now says the rule is bad for business

On a visit this summer to a refrigeration facility in swing-state Georgia alongside Vice President JD Vance, Zeldin said the administration was responding to grocery stores and refrigeration companies that have complained about the federal rule.

“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.

Zeldin said the so-called Technology Transitions Rule, finalized under former President Joe Biden, has been restricting access to refrigerants Americans need to cool their homes and businesses, while costs are going up and supply is going down. “It was costing more to be able to fix that system,"" Zeldin said.

Alta Refrigeration, along with grocery stores, the semiconductor industry and residents across America, were dissatisfied with the rule, he said, vowing to “fix this mistake.”

The Food Industry Association, which represents grocery stores and suppliers, applauded the EPA plan, saying the current rule “imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines.” Zeldin’s proposal “achieves the intended environmental benefits without placing unnecessary and costly burdens on the food industry,” said Leslie Sarasin, the group’s president and CEO.

Jorge Alvarez, co-founder of iGas USA, a Florida air conditioning company whose products include HFCs, said the Biden rule was “shoved down our throats” and threatened to create havoc. The delay “gives industry a chance to create new refrigerants, and we will,” he said.

The rule's rollback sparks confusion over Trump's strategy

But the change in tack comes after industry players had already made adjustments to ensure they could meet the goals set in motion by the 2020 law.

“Changing the schedule now would disrupt planning and inject uncertainty across the market,” said Samantha Slater, a senior vice president at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, which represents more than 330 HVAC manufacturers and commercial refrigeration companies.

Manufacturers have already retooled product lines and certified models based on the current timeline, she said, noting that nearly 90% of residential and light commercial air conditioning systems use substitute refrigerants.

A delay would give an advantage to foreign-based competitors that did not invest in alternative refrigerants and risks “higher costs for U.S. consumers,” Slater said.

Chemours, the Delaware-based chemical giant that is a leading producer of alternative refrigerants, said in a statement that it has “consistently supported an orderly phasedown schedule of HFCs as outlined in the AIM Act.''

Delays to the transition “risk undermining and stranding U.S. manufacturing and innovation investments, while also increasing uncertainty and supply chain inefficiencies, ultimately driving up consumer costs,'' said Joe Martinko, president of Chemours’ Thermal & Specialized Solutions business.

Even with the holdup, “the transition to low-global warming potential refrigerants is well underway,'' he said.

A temporary shortage this summer of cylinders used by HVAC contractors — which Zeldin and others have cited as a reason to delay the EPA rule — has been resolved, Martinko and other industry representatives said.

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the current rule ensures an efficient, affordable phasedown of harmful HFCs, while offering industry regulatory uniformity and a way to remain globally competitive.

He said the federal rule averts a previous patchwork of state laws and regulations. States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.

“Weakening the rule will confuse the market,'' he said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n5yYiOJz1hsj0gRFQTeFgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/9e485f020e41f955cea8d1385ab4cb74,N,,2025-11-08 10:18:08.893326

With their cutting-edge batteries, unique platforms, and faster pace of innovation, they are challenging the U.S. and Japanese oligopolies, suggesting a future of the automotive industry where an organization’s agility, technology, and scale will matter more than its legacy.

From local manufacturer to global EV disruptor, BYD redefines the auto industry with scale, innovation, and speed

From a domestic Chinese auto manufacturer to an international disruptor, BYD’s evolution is remarkable. BYD’s new EV technology has utilized scale, its vertical integration, including battery manufacturing, and aggressive pricing, as well as the combination of mobility and technology to redefine what an automaker can be and establish itself as a major player in the global EV revolution.

BYD possesses numerous advantages compared to other companies, allowing BYD to create electric vehicles that are less limited while designing and releasing the vehicles more quickly than many legacy carmakers. The growth it has achieved throughout the years has allowed it to compete with the American and Japanese automakers that have always dominated the technology side of the industry.

How the quiet giant learned to grow and conquer the world step by step

BYD has created a structured plan for what it intends to do, which includes developing high-value, yet affordable EVs utilizing the company’s exclusive technology and using this to penetrate the market, which is primarily dominated by established automakers. Its decision to enter Japan shows its intent to compete in complex markets with high barriers to entry.

How BYD is reinventing electric vehicles with cutting-edge technology

BYD is highly valued due to its innovation across the entire stack, beyond the motors and batteries it typically covers. With its Blade LFP batteries and purpose-built EV platforms, it can outperform competitors who retrofit ICE models, resulting in lighter, cheaper, longer-range vehicle production with quicker manufacturing periods.

BYD’s upcoming ultra-compact “kei” EV vehicle series launch set for Japan is a further example of its ambition to offer an EV in both mainstream and niche markets that have been historically dominated by more entrenched market players, just like this unprecedented gasoline-free Japanese powertrain.

A clear example is BYD’s “Racco,” a dedicated electric vehicle for Japan’s stringent kei-car classification. While having a range of approximately 112 miles and certified for 100 kW fast charging, Racco applies superior EV quality to small or compact vehicles. The Racco was explicitly designed for Japan and shows that BYD is not entering the category too late.

How a single move put the U.S. and Japan on alert in the global power game

BYD’s entry into the kei-car segment in Japan suggests that now every market is up for grabs. This threatens the share of the domestic market and illustrates the limits of domestic trade protections. BYD’s global scale and supply chains will allow it to minimize tariffs and redefine the competitive space to compel the U.S. and Japan to rethink potential policies, subsidies, and manufacturing on the pages of EVs.

For American and Japanese manufacturers, the invitation is not optional: act quickly to invest in EVs, gain control of battery and software development, optimize your manufacturing and supply chains, and engage consumers in a value conversation, not just about your brand. Anything less and you may just find yourself sitting back watching an industry disruptor, such as this, take your market share, determine pricing, and establish technology standards.

The emergence shows that in the automotive space, leadership is no longer assured by being an incumbent. By utilizing technology, scale, and speed, BYD is rewriting the rules of engagement, compelling legacy vehicle manufacturers to adapt or else risk being eclipsed in an industry driven by perishable speed that sacrifices tradition in favor of speed, just like this groundbreaking innovation, connecting 100 cities.

Unfortunately for Ford, sales never quite took off in the way it was hoping, and there's a good chance many of those Q3 sales were motivated by Republicans' decision to end the federal EV tax credit.
It doesn't sound like Ford's executives have officially made the decision to kill off their electric truck, but per the WSJ's report, they're seriously considering it.
That's partly because Ford made sure it had the capacity to build as many as 150,000 F-150 Lightnings per year, easily more than three times the actual demand.
That truck, however, isn't expected to go on sale until sometime in 2027, so if Ford did decide to kill off the F-150 Lightning, it would be a while before its new, smaller alternative hit dealer lots.","It's been a little more than three years since Ford officially revealed the F-150 Lightning, the fully electric version of its popular full-size pickup truck, and in that time, Ford's seen sales steadily tick up. In Q3 this year, Lightning sales were even up nearly 40%. Unfortunately for Ford, sales never quite took off in the way it was hoping, and there's a good chance many of those Q3 sales were motivated by Republicans' decision to end the federal EV tax credit. And according to a new report in the Wall Street Journal, it may soon be lights out for the Lightning.

It doesn't sound like Ford's executives have officially made the decision to kill off their electric truck, but per the WSJ's report, they're seriously considering it. On the one hand, it cost them a lot of money to develop, and year-over-year sales have been increasing, but on the other hand, it's only on track to sell about 30,000 Lightnings this year, which isn't very many when you're Ford, and you expect to sell more than 750,000 F-Series pickups this year. It also doesn't help that the least-expensive Lightning you can buy now starts at about $55,000, which is a lot more than the roughly $40,000 base price we were originally promised.

Now that Republicans have gotten rid of the federal tax credit, the effective cost of buying a new F-150 Lightning is even higher than it was back in September, which isn't great news at a time when Republican economic policies are also making everything more expensive. As Adam Kraushaar, owner of the Lester Glenn Auto Group, told the WSJ, ""The demand is just not there. We don't order a lot of them because we don't sell them.""

On top of that, it also didn't help that a recent fire at a supplier's factory caused an aluminum shortage that forced Ford to temporarily pause Lightning production, and we also know Ford has delayed the next-generation F-150 for at least a year, as it attempts to figure out the best way forward.

All told, Ford has reportedly lost about $13 billion on EVs since 2023, which, even in the business world, is a lot of money. That's partly because Ford made sure it had the capacity to build as many as 150,000 F-150 Lightnings per year, easily more than three times the actual demand. If Ford had been able to convert initial interest — it allegedly received more than 200,000 reservations for the Lightning — into higher sales, the massive investment in EVs may have been worth it, but that's just not what happened.

As Ford admitted recently, the kinds of customers who are interested in EVs tend to be more interested in smaller, less expensive options. But while some of its competitors appear to be giving up on all things electric, even if Ford does kill off the F-150 Lightning, it's still working on new EVs that people might actually want (and be able to afford) to buy. Back in August, the Michigan-based automaker revealed that it had developed both a new EV platform, as well as a new production system that would allow it to build several new EVs more cheaply and might even allow it to compete with the Chinese automakers currently threatening to eat Ford's lunch.

While Ford says it plans to build several different EVs on its new platform, the first vehicle we'll see is a new truck. Except, instead of being big enough that you might think crushing children was part of the official design brief, it will be smaller and, perhaps most importantly, cheaper. According to Ford, its upcoming smaller electric truck will start at about $30,000 without any tax credits and offer as much passenger room as a Toyota RAV4, while also being just as quick as a four-cylinder Mustang.

That truck, however, isn't expected to go on sale until sometime in 2027, so if Ford did decide to kill off the F-150 Lightning, it would be a while before its new, smaller alternative hit dealer lots. Then again, if sales aren't high enough to justify continuing to build the Lightning, then maybe it's for the best, at least from Ford's perspective.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/ford-may-soon-kill-off-the-f-150-lightning-to-focus-on-smaller-cheaper-evs/l-intro-1762524465.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 05:18:24.595687

Through this exploration, we’ll clarify how American agriculture continues to lead, adapt, and set examples for a sustainable future.

The Evolution of the American Farm Company

The concept of the American farm company has transformed dramatically over the last decade. Where once farming was seen as the dominion of multi-generational families managing traditional row crops or livestock, today’s American farm company is far more diverse, professionalized, and technologically advanced. Companies now range from independent crop producers and family-owned livestock operations to vertically integrated agribusinesses, precision farming technology firms, and corporate service providers.

In 2026, the backbone of American agriculture rests on these companies’ ability to identify, adapt to, and lead innovation—all while maintaining the integrity and tradition that are characteristic of rural communities and farmland values. This balancing act revolves around clear pillars:

Resilient and adaptive seed technologies

Genetically improved livestock breeds

Land and resource conservation practices

Integration of renewable energy sources

Data-driven monitoring and operational optimization

The ability to continue thriving in an increasingly complex ecosystem is a testament to the vital role these companies play in shaping the future of the American nation and global food systems.

Key Characteristics of Today’s Leading American Farm Companies

Deep commitment to sustainability and land management for economic, social, and environmental resilience.

Adoption of advanced genetics and biotechnology in both plant and animal operations to meet market and environmental demands.

Continued integration of renewable energy and digital monitoring for lower costs, increased productivity, and lower carbon footprints.

Establishment of partnerships with farmland trusts, advocacy organizations, and tech companies to address development pressures and climate change.

With this foundation, let’s explore the crucial components of this evolving agricultural ecosystem, starting with the science behind seeds.

American Seed Companies & The Seed Science Revolution

If American agriculture is an intricate machine, seeds are its gears. American seed companies are the force driving forward resilience and productivity by developing crop varieties that are high-yielding, resilient to climate stress, and less dependent on chemical inputs.

By 2026, the adoption of advanced seeds—especially for corn, soybeans, and wheat—is nearing universal levels, with estimates showing over 60% of all U.S. farmland planted with genetically improved and climate-adaptive seeds. Seed companies have utilized molecular breeding programs, gene editing, and biotechnology to:

Enhance drought and pest resistance while still prioritizing flavor, nutrition, and quality.

Enable farmers to maintain yields despite unpredictable weather conditions.

Reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, thus supporting farmland and ecosystem health.

Case in Point: Drought-Tolerant Corn & Soybeans

American seed companies at the forefront have successfully released lines of corn and soybeans capable of using less water and still delivering strong yields, even during extended dry periods. Developments like gene-edited traits for root optimization or enhanced photosynthetic efficiency are becoming common in commercial seed catalogues.

The result? Not only are farmers less vulnerable to less predictable weather and climate volatility, but the land itself is under less pressure to deliver, reducing stress on water tables and surrounding ecosystems.

For farmers wishing to maximize the efficiency and traceability of their crops, blockchain-based traceability tools—like those provided by Farmonaut—are now an important resource. These tools ensure that every step, from seed selection to harvest, is documented and traceable, increasing transparency, food safety, and alignment with evolving marketplace demands for responsibly grown food.

Today, American farm company strategies are incomplete without the inclusion of advanced genetics, transparency, and digital traceability across the agricultural value chain.

American Cow Breed Genetics: Transforming Livestock Sustainability

Alongside crop innovation, American cow breed genetics have advanced rapidly in the past few years, further reinforcing the nation’s ability to supply the world with high-quality beef and dairy products while simultaneously respecting the need for sustainable farming practices.

Breeds like Angus, Hereford, and Holstein have been selectively bred for trait optimization across disease resistance, feed efficiency, meat yield, and milk quality. Modern American farm companies involved in cattle breeding now use genomic tools and data analytics to:

Accelerate genetic improvements across entire herds;

Ensure herds are healthier and more productive;

Reduce environmental impact by selecting for traits like lower methane production and enhanced feed-to-milk or feed-to-meat ratios.

These advances directly benefit farmers economically but also respond to the consumer demand for higher animal welfare, traceability, and quality assurance in both beef and dairy supply chains. Blockchain-based traceability—supported by platforms such as Farmonaut—enables robust verification of genetic lineage and animal welfare credentials.

“Renewable energy use on US farms is expected to increase by 35% by 2026, boosting resilient agriculture practices.”

Focus on Breed Diversity and Resilience

In 2026, American farm companies are investing in multi-trait, multi-breed herds. This means not just relying on a single cow breed, but leveraging hybrid vigor and crossbreeding for further resilience. This strategy supports continued productivity regardless of shifting disease pressures, climate influences, or consumer trends.

The benefits of these breeding programs extend beyond productivity:

Reduced disease risk through genetic diversity

Improved land use via targeted feeding and rotational grazing systems

Economic viability through premiums for certified, traceable, and high-welfare animal products

Farmland Trusts & Land Conservation: Preserving the Backbone

As America’s rural populations fluctuate and urbanization continues, American farmland trusts play an increasingly vital role in protecting agricultural lands from being lost to infrastructure development and non-farm use. These trusts work directly with farmers, municipalities, and policy makers to:

Implement conservation easements that keep land available for farming in perpetuity;

Support sustainable land management practices including cover cropping, rotational grazing, and biodiversity enhancements;

Preserve soil health, water resources, and the overall ecosystem, ensuring farming can continue sustainably for future generations.

A key part of these efforts is their focus on the triple bottom line: productivity, environmental health, and rural economic sustainability. Increasingly, American farm companies and seed companies are partnering with or taking cues from these land trusts to align their management practices with conservation priorities.

In supporting and following recommendations from trusts, companies defend the long-term economic viability of American agriculture.

Renewable Energy Integration: American Wind Turbine Companies on the Farm

The integration of renewable energy into farming operations is one of the most exciting trends for 2026. American wind turbine companies now routinely design, install, and service wind energy systems—tailored for the unique demands of large farms, ranches, and rural communities.

Wind energy is especially attractive to farmers because it allows them to:

Reduce operational costs and reliance on grid-based fossil fuels

Generate new revenue by selling surplus energy back to utilities

Decrease their farm’s overall carbon footprint and meet increasingly strict environmental standards

The complex ecosystem that is the modern American farm company is further enhanced by renewable integration. Many farms—particularly in the Midwest, Great Plains, and parts of California and Texas—are already reporting substantial energy cost savings and long-term farm resilience due to on-site wind and solar systems.

For those managing large-scale or multiple farm locations, energy integration is made more seamless with digital monitoring tools—like the real-time monitoring and carbon footprint tracking solutions available from Farmonaut. These tools offer farmers the ability to measure, report, and improve their renewable energy performance and sustainability metrics.

As grid fragility and weather-driven power outages become more common in the U.S., integrating renewable energy is one of the single most important resilience strategies for American farm companies today.

We boast the third-highest production rate for marketed natural gas among the states, accounting for approximately 5% of the country’s total natural gas reserves.
This is why it’s imperative that Louisianans take note of the European Union adopting its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.
This includes affiliates, with no connection to the European Union whatsoever, that fall under the Directive’s rules if their parent company operates in an European Union market.
The consequences of this would reverberate throughout the energy economy and every sector connected to it in our state, putting jobs at risk.","Louisiana’s thriving energy economy is a testament to the state and federal regulatory environments that allow it to flourish, because both balance growth with ensuring that the highest safety and environmental standards are followed to the letter of the law.

This balance affords us both residential and industrial electricity rates that are significantly lower than national averages. Yet that is not enough for the European Union, which sought to impose statutes, signed an ocean away, on American businesses — including those in Louisiana. President Trump was right to sink these efforts.

It bears remembering that most of the restrictive energy policies that have been attempted in states like California and New York were inspired by European nations like Germany and the U.K, who learned the hard way by seeing their energy prices triple and their industries fall into decline as a result.

We know better in Louisiana because energy is more than just part of our economy — it’s a defining industry for our state. The United States led the world in natural gas exports last year, with Louisianans handling over 60% of it. We boast the third-highest production rate for marketed natural gas among the states, accounting for approximately 5% of the country’s total natural gas reserves. The energy industry employs thousands of families across the state while maintaining the highest environmental and labor standards.

This is why it’s imperative that Louisianans take note of the European Union adopting its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. These standards would present no concern if they were only seeking to regulate inside Europe; the issue is that the Directive is an unwelcome export of those rules to the rest of the world.

Under its language, any company with an annual revenue from the European Union market exceeding 450 million euros, or about $486 million, is affected. This includes affiliates, with no connection to the European Union whatsoever, that fall under the Directive’s rules if their parent company operates in an European Union market. This overreach imposes new red tape and exposes American businesses that employ thousands of Louisianans to additional liabilities dictated by Brussels.

If this sounds familiar, the United Nations recently garnered headlines because of its International Maritime Organization’s plan to pass a “net-zero framework” that would levy a de facto carbon tax of up to $12 billion annually. This too would fall on one of our great Louisiana industries — shipping — and on everyday Louisianans because it would raise the cost of all goods moving by ships, which The Wall Street Journal called “the ultimate in taxation without representation.”

We should recognize the International Maritime Organization plan and the European Union directive for what they truly are: an attempt by other governments to force their broad restrictions on labor and environmental governance on more competitive, more sustainable American companies. If they are to succeed, we could see American growth throttled to the same degree as the Europeans, which is something we cannot risk in today’s hypercompetitive global climate, particularly in energy markets.

The stakes for Louisiana couldn’t be higher, especially with the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. As one of America’s top exporters of liquefied natural gas and a provider of critical supply to Europe — which is reducing its own reliance on Russian gas — facing European mandates such as carbon neutrality and mandated “climate transition plans” risks undermining our role as a global energy leader. The consequences of this would reverberate throughout the energy economy and every sector connected to it in our state, putting jobs at risk.

We can’t afford to wait and see what the impact of these regulations will be. Just look at the difference in gross domestic product growth between the European Union and the U.S. over the last two decades or so. In that time, our economy grew nearly 90%. As for the European Union, it managed only 13.5% growth. As two international economic superpowers, that stark difference in growth can be primarily explained by the European Union’s onerous regulations.

While President Trump was right to punt these rules for a year at the International Maritime Organization, there’s a way to fix this once and for all, and legislation already stands on the House and Senate to block the European Union from this extraterritorial regulation. Knowing the stakes, I urge Louisiana’s House and Senate leaders to defend the freedom of America’s businesses from European regulations. Our families, workers and energy producers shouldn’t have their futures decided by foreign bureaucrats who have no business telling Louisiana how to work.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/af/6af6c1df-29c4-4b00-b513-23e7ffb27209/68dab86a2580a.image.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 08:59:01.475535

And now for your environmental reports:

The U.S. Department of Energy just closed on a nearly $1.6 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources for a fertilizer facility in West Terre Haute that would inject over 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface —and local residents are speaking out. This type of carbon sequestration, the process of capturing and storing emissions in tanks, is touted as a win for reducing carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Yet the pressurized CO2 stored in these underground tanks can escape leading to heavy metal contamination and potentially undrinkable water quality.

Wabash Valley Resources plans to use carbon capture and storage technology in its fertilizer production, one of the cheaper industries to take advantage of this process. Energy Secretary Chris Wright framed it as reducing America’s dependence on foreign fertilizer sources, saying the project relies on “American coal, American workers, and American innovation.”

Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson called the project “exceptionally dangerous and risky,” arguing that the extended Terre Haute community would be exposed to significant threats to their environment, health, and water should the tanks ever be compromised. He emphasized that this project will increase toxic emissions, CO2 emissions, and is a false solution to the issue of pollution. Yet the EPA issued permits early last year allowing Wabash Valley Resources to construct wells. In fact, in early August, the EPA found that the injection and monitoring wells would have “no significant impact” on the environment. Some supporters even argue that this development would economically benefit Hoosier farmers.

But this project highlights a fundamental question in climate policy: Is carbon capture a necessary means to reduce emissions, or is it a lifeline to fossil fuel companies who let polluters keep polluting while putting communities at risk? For residents near West Terre Haute, this is about their water, their land, and who gets to decide what happens in their backyards. With construction potentially beginning soon, this issue remains an active topic of concern.

As world leaders prepare to gather in Brazil next week for the 30th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP 30, a chorus of voices are issuing an urgent call for “courageous action to protect God’s creation and people. “ Those voices are a collection of U.S. Catholic bishops and relief organizations are issuing an urgent call for meaningful commitments to climate change mitigation. The leaders are urging countries to invest in resiliency efforts, commit to bold mitigation that reduces harmful emissions, pledge recovery initiatives for vulnerable communities, and provide transparent climate finance including debt relief. This faith-based call for climate justice emphasizes that climate action surpasses environmental or even economic issues. Course-correcting climate change is an imperative that connects caring for the planet with caring for the world’s most vulnerable communities. As COP30 convenes in the Amazon, home to Earth’s largest rainforest, the question is whether world leaders will match moral urgency with concrete commitments.

New York continues to drive progress, becoming one of the first states to require that every public school student—from kindergarten through high school—learns climate science.

These climate science classes will cover what’s causing climate change, local and global impacts as well as conservation and solutions. These concepts can be taught as stand-alone courses or by weaving lessons into existing classes through an interdisciplinary approach. In the current school year, 561 districts enrolled more than 135,000 students in climate-related courses, but this new requirement sets lesson standards for everyone, no matter where you live or which school you attend.

This legislation joins similar policies in California, Connecticut, Illinois, and New Jersey. Across the country, this shift considers what students need to thrive as adults—not just traditional academics, but tools to understand and address the environmental challenges they’ll inherit.

The nonprofit organization Climate Central has stepped in to rescue a critical climate tracking tool that the federal government abandoned earlier this year—a NOAA database that’s been documenting the United States’ costliest weather disasters for over four decades.

During just the first six months of 2025, there have been 14 separate weather and climate disasters in the U.S., costing over $101 billion, with the Los Angeles wildfires in January becoming the costliest wildfire event on record at over $60 billion. The average number of these extreme events has surged from about three annually during the 1980s to 19 events per year over the last decade making data collection essential in order to inform preparedness and response plans. Senior climate scientist Adam Smith, who led the project under NOAA for 15 years, will now maintain the database at Climate Central.

This database serves as a tool that communities, researchers, and even insurance companies use to understand escalating climate risks and build resilience. In a time when extreme weather is becoming our new normal, having reliable data to inform our decisions has never been more critical.

The Inflation Reduction Act created a new wave of federal rebates and tax credits to help households switch to cleaner, more efficient electric appliances. But as Canary Media reported, many of these tax credits will sunset by late 2025, even though some rebate programs will continue.

That means the clock is ticking if you want to fully take advantage of everything available to you.

You could snag up to $840 in federal rebates for a new electric or induction stove. The U.S. Department of Energy's Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate Program covers new and replacement electric stoves, cooktops, ranges, and ovens — including induction models that are far safer and faster than gas.

Gas stoves release harmful methane and nitrogen dioxide, which can worsen indoor air quality and cause respiratory issues. Induction models are not only safer but also around three times more efficient than gas-based models, cooking your food even faster and saving you money on monthly energy bills.

For renters or anyone not quite ready for a kitchen overhaul, plug-in induction burners start at only around $50, offering a quick and affordable way to cook cleaner and safer in your home.

Homeowners can claim tax credits by filing IRS Form 5695 when submitting their 2025 taxes, and rebates are managed at the state or tribal level via the Department of Energy's Home Energy Rebates Portal.

Just make sure to act fast, as upgrading to an energy-efficient appliance now could mean hundreds in immediate savings and a more comfortable, pollution-free abode. With many of these federal tax credits approaching their expiration date, switching to an induction stove might just be one of the smartest, healthiest, and most cost-effective upgrades there is.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-11-08 07:00:16+00:00,the Guardian,Electric cars: could leasing a used EV help you afford one? - The Guardian,"Jasper Jolly, www.theguardian.com, jasper-jolly",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/nov/08/electric-cars-leasing-used-ev-secondhand,"“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker.
The Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV.
Salary sacrifice The best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whose employers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme.
Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.
Holding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them.","When Anthony Santos was looking for a car to replace his Audi Q3, a diesel SUV, he felt reluctant about making the switch to an electric car.

“I was considering it, but I probably wouldn’t have,” says Santos, a sales manager at RWinvest, a property investment company in Liverpool. But when he started looking at his options the ability to lease a used electric vehicle (EV) caught his eye.

A couple of years ago someone looking for their next car would have been hard pushed to find a used EV – let alone lease one – but that is changing fast.

There are now 1m EVs on British roads, and the cars bought by early adopters are hitting the secondhand market.

Generally speaking EVs have lost value more quickly than petrol or diesel cars, which is a big problem for the owners of leasing companies, rental businesses or corporate fleets. But the flipside for consumers is that it is possible to find a cheap leasing deal.

In the second quarter of 2025, the number of used car leases in the UK rose by 166%, compared with the same period a year ago, with electric cars driving the growth, according to the latest data available from the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), a lobby group.

“Three years ago used EV leasing was very small because there were very few used EVs on the market,” says Thom Groot, the chief executive of the Electric Car Scheme, a broker. From about 15% of sales in 2024, used EVs now make up nearly half its business.

At Octopus EV, which is part of the UK’s largest energy supplier, the number of used EV leases has doubled in the last year.

The picture is helped by fact that big players in the leasing market, including Lloyds Banking Group’s Lex Autolease, BNP Paribas’s Arval, and the independent group Zenith, have started now offer leases on used EVs.

With the average price tag of a new electric vehicle sitting at £50,000, putting them out of reach of many Britons, in the summer the government launched a subsidy scheme. But buying secondhand makes going electric even more affordable.

Santos discovered that he could lease a lightly used Mercedes-Benz EQA without paying anything upfront. His company offered a salary sacrifice option (more on that later) via the Electric Car Scheme, which meant he could pay £360 a month for a car that would usually cost £570.

“There was no deposit – the tax benefits really made sense,” Santos says. “That’s what made me move forward with it.”

How leasing works

People who lease their cars pay a monthly fee, typically for two or three years, avoiding the need to stump up tens of thousands of pounds upfront. As well as the car, costs such as road tax, breakdown assistance, service and maintenance are often included – but typically not things such as insurance.

Leasing a used EV is a lot cheaper than buying a new one, even for vehicles in good condition that are only two or three years old. That means more expensive models can be more affordable, making it easier for people on lower incomes to cut their carbon emissions.

The Electric Car Scheme gives the example of the Škoda Enyaq, an SUV. On a standard lease a new model costs about £567 a month, but that falls to £292 for a used model on salary sacrifice. Volkswagen’s ID.4 SUV similarly falls from £506 to £296 a month, a decrease of 42%.

However, not every cost will be picked up by the owner. Lessees will still have to pay damage outside fair wear and tear, and some also add an excess mileage charge. While 10p a mile may not sound like much, high-mileage drivers will have to consider whether they will face a big extra bill when they hand the car back.

Salary sacrifice

The best deals will almost certainly be limited to those whose employers have signed up for a salary sacrifice scheme. The key thing about salary sacrifice is that the cost is deducted from your pay before tax – lowering your tax bill. How much you save depends on your tax bracket: so lower-rate taxpayers save 20%, higher-rate taxpayers (salaries of £50,271 to £125,140) save 40%, and 45% above that.

Ian Hughes, the chief executive of the corporate and consumer business of Zenith Group, says salary sacrifice has been “a major foundation stone of the transition” to electric cars due to the tax advantages.

Many employers offer salary sacrifice – ranging from very small companies to household names such as HSBC, BT and Jet2, as well as a number of NHS trusts. There are usually no fees for the employee, but employers pay the scheme provider the equivalent of the tax saved from lower national insurance contributions.

Often the companies offering salary sacrifice impose conditions, such as a minimum contract length, or a gross basic salary above a certain threshold. People leasing will also have to go through a mandatory credit check, as well as affordability checks to make sure they can handle the monthly payments.

There are still options for someone whose employer does not offer a salary sacrifice scheme. Carwow’s “Leasey” leasing service, for example, offers used EVs. An electric 2022 Mini Cooper S with 17,400 miles on the clock would cost £256 a month. That is still significantly more than the £209 offer for those able to use an employer’s scheme, but well below the £310 a month (on top of a £3,000 upfront payment) for the equivalent new model bought from Mini directly.

Gary Comerford, a consultant who runs the EV Musings podcast for electric car drivers, says his experience of leasing a used EV is “very smooth” but adds that he would not say it is flawless. He could not do a test drive before committing via Car360, although he had the option to return with no questions asked within the week. He paid a deposit of £1,200 and pays £310 a month for a 2021 Polestar 2.

“As long as you can work within your budget it’s quite easy to get a lease,” Comerford says – although he adds that limiting tax benefits to salary sacrifice is unfair to self-employed people like him.

Some optional extras can be included with the car (and can benefit from salary sacrifice tax savings), such as car insurance, home chargers, and even electricity.

At the end of the term the choice is generally to either extend your lease or hand the car back, although some companies also offer the ability to buy the car outright. Note though: early returners will probably end up paying an early termination fee (although fees for salary sacrificers are usually waived if they leave they employer through resignation, redundancy or dismissal).

If it works for you, and you meet the conditions, used leases make it much easier to drive an EV, says Zenith’s Hughes. “The very, very exciting opportunity is it lowers the price of entry from an affordability perspective,” he says. Zenith’s newly launched used EV salary sacrifice scheme has had “a nice balance of 20% and 40% taxpayers”, he says.

Beating depreciation

Leasing companies are not offering deals out of the goodness of their hearts. Offering used EVs helps them cope with their least favourite word: depreciation. They bought a load of electric cars a couple of years ago, only for secondhand, or “residual” prices, to drop more than expected amid slower overall demand for EVs.

Leasing companies have a large supply of rapidly depreciating vehicles, says Toby Poston, the BVRLA chief executive. They do not want to sell at a steep loss, so leasing helps solve a problem.

Holding on to electric cars means leasing companies can continue to make money from them. The industry’s experience with thousands of electric cars is that there are far fewer breakdowns, compared with equivalent petrol or diesel cars, meaning they are less likely to face huge repair bills as the vehicles age.

Hughes expects Zenith’s cars to go through two or even three drivers over eight years before they sell it on – potentially meaning no residual loss whatsoever. (Contrary to one persistent anti-EV claim, meaningful battery degradation is “just not a thing” for the average car, he says. And most EVs come with eight-year manufacturer warranties on batteries, which means leased cars would be covered.)

Without costly breakdowns to worry about there is “less potential risk” so it easier to offer leases, Poston says. At the same time, there is “overproduction of cars across the world”, he adds. “The deals you can get now are stupendous.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8457473ebcf6edf59c0f4338b362d1484c63aab2/1480_0_5555_4444/master/5555.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a27e8e2ed0418e5b352baf50475b612",N,,2025-11-08 02:18:01.403592
,American Energy,2025-11-08 06:51:30+00:00,The Corvallis Advocate,This Oregon Utility Broke with Coal and Saved Enough Money to Lower Its Rates,Steve,,,,,https://corvallisadvocate.com/this-oregon-utility-broke-with-coal-and-saved-enough-money-to-lower-its-rates/,"The utility’s roughly 14,000 residential customers who live in eastern Oregon will likely save less than a dollar a month.
Experts have found coal power is significantly more expensive than alternative energy sources.
Electricity rates in West Virginia, where coal powers more than 80% of consumed electricity, are up nearly 25% since 2022.
Rising rates Oregon customers of monopoly electric utilities have also experienced higher-than-average rate hikes in recent years.
Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011.","In a rare departure from the norm, one of the three monopoly electric utilities operating in Oregon is asking state regulators for permission to lower rates for residential customers in 2026.

The reduction, though small at less than 1%, is the result of Idaho Power’s break with coal, according to recent filings with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission. The utility’s roughly 14,000 residential customers who live in eastern Oregon will likely save less than a dollar a month. Idaho Power’s request could be on the commission’s agenda in early December, according to Kandi Young, a commission spokesperson.

It’s the result of the company saving $1.3 million by ceasing operations of a coal-burning power plant in Nevada, and through lower regulatory costs since a Boardman coal plant it co-owned with Portland General Electric in eastern Oregon was fully decommissioned in recent years, the filings explain.

Idaho Power plans to end coal-burning operations at the last coal plant it owns, along with PacifiCorp, in Wyoming by 2030, and to convert the facility to burning natural gas. The company has a goal to reach a 100% “clean energy” portfolio for power by 2045, though for now that involves natural gas — almost entirely methane gas, a powerful heat-warming greenhouse gas.

“Idaho Power has a detailed resource planning process that continually seeks the least-cost, least-risk resources to serve our customers,” Jordan Rodriguez, a company spokesperson, said in an email.

The cost savings from ditching coal come as President Donald Trump and his administration fight to keep coal-burning power plants running past dates many utilities had set for decommissioning them.

Experts have found coal power is significantly more expensive than alternative energy sources. And because so many coal plants in the U.S. are more than 50 years old, reviving them will needlessly cost ratepayers more than they need to pay for power. Coal is also among the primary sources of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions globally, according to the International Energy Agency.

In October, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced a $625 million investment “to expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry,” which includes $350 million in funding to recommission or modernize existing coal-fired power plants. But in the last four years, more than 100 such plants have closed because they’re not cost-effective to operate anymore, according to researchers at the Ohio-based nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.

Electricity prices have risen across the U.S. in recent years — about 13% on average since 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration — in part due to the rise of massive new users like data centers, artificial intelligence processors and bitcoin mining, as well as growing electrification across sectors. But costs have gone up more steeply in several states that rely heavily on coal, including Kentucky and West Virginia. Electricity rates in West Virginia, where coal powers more than 80% of consumed electricity, are up nearly 25% since 2022.

Rising rates

Oregon customers of monopoly electric utilities have also experienced higher-than-average rate hikes in recent years.

Rates for residential customers of Pacific Power and Portland General Electric are up about 50% since 2020.

Officials from both companies blame rising inflation, building infrastructure for more clean energy generation and storage, increasing costs to buy power, higher insurance costs and new customer demand. Power demand from large industrial customers, such as new data centers, is up more than 34% in the last five years, while residential demand is up 5%.

“It’s not very common for a utility to request a decrease in rates, but it does happen occasionally,” said Charlotte Shuff, a spokesperson for the Citizens’ Utility Board, a watchdog group established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of utility consumers.

“What’s more common is a rate decrease after a utility requests an increase,” Shuff said.

Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011. It initially asked the state’s Public Utilities Commission for permission to raise rates 27%, but was ultimately allowed a 4% increase. The company recently asked Idaho regulators to allow it to raise rates 17% on Gem State customers in 2026 for infrastructure upgrades, new energy storage facilities and wildfire prevention.

In its latest request to Oregon’s Public Utilities Commission to lower rates for Oregonians, the company said despite its savings, it will need to spend more than $500,000 on wildfire prevention work in the state in the year ahead.",https://corvallisadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/020325_intermountain_power_plant_06_720.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 06:18:16.898337

On The July 28, 2025 episode Economist Christian Briggs joins News Today to break down President Trump’s historic $2 trillion trade deal with Europe, calling it the most consequential agreement yet.

At the time of the episode’s release, the landmark accord outlined $750 billion in American energy exports paired with $600 billion in foreign investment directed toward U.S. infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean energy projects. Briggs explains how this framework is designed to stimulate domestic production, reduce European dependency on Russian energy, and generate sustainable employment across multiple industries.

“I think it's going to be a trillion dollar win”, said Briggs. “Not just from the selling of the product, but from the direct investments over the next 3 to 5 years.”

Briggs details how the policy could add over 200,000 new high-wage jobs through expanded LNG terminal construction, transportation upgrades, and advanced manufacturing initiatives. The episode also addresses macroeconomic outcomes, including projected GDP growth, supply chain resilience, and strengthened U.S. leverage in global energy markets.

The discussion highlights how the deal’s structure enhances American competitiveness while reinforcing strategic independence from adversarial energy suppliers. Briggs characterizes the move as a calculated economic and geopolitical masterstroke that will bolster U.S. industrial strength and long-term prosperity.

Greenidge Generation and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation have reached a settlement regarding Greenidge’s Title V Air permit renewal application. The company, located in Dresden in Yates County, operates Bitcoin miners using “behind the meter” power from its gas-powered electric generating facility. Additional power generated at the facility is sold into the electric grid.

Under the terms of the agreement, the NYS DEC will issue a final Title V permit modification and renewal for the facility, after the appropriate public process.

Greenidge applied for a renewal of its five-year Title V air permit in 2021. The application was denied in 2022, with the DEC stating ""renewal of the Title V permit would be inconsistent with or would interfere with the attainment of the Statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits established in Article 75 of the Environmental Conservation Law (ECL)"" based on the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CPCLA), that went into effect in 2020.

In 2024, filed suit seeking to overturn the DEC’s denial of the air permit application. The settlement dictates Greenidge will discontinue its appeal.

Additionally as part of the settlement, the permit will require a 44% reduction in permitted emissions by 2030, exceeding the goals set by the CLCPA, and a 25% reduction in actual emissions in that same time frame. According to Greenidge Generation, the 25% condition marks the first of its kind in a Title V air permit renewal in New York State.

During these past four years, the company has been allowed to continue electric and cryptomining operations as the matter regarding the air permit renewal application was reviewed by the NYS DEC and courts.

The Greenidge facility has also been the subject of legal action by environmental agencies and organizations, alleging the facility’s operations violate the state’s CLCPA, and that discharges into Keuka Lake violate the Clean Water Act. All court rulings have ultimately been in favor of Greenidge.

The Dresden facility was purchased by Greenidge in 2016 and converted from a former coal-fired plant to a natural gas facility, beginning electricity production for the local grid in 2017. The company later added a behind-the-meter cryptocurrency datacenter that uses electricity produced at the site and, according to Greenidge, does not burden the local grid. The company said it has invested more than $100 million in the facility and now accounts for nearly 10% of Yates County’s local tax revenues.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/tiogapublishing.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/82/982cccd8-6e41-53f4-8fb3-0444b586b66a/690ed5b6a04c9.image.jpg?crop=1919%2C1009%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-08 07:59:12.098844

Some of them require evaluating the returns they generate for the country, and that must be considered when deciding on cuts,” one source explained.
To achieve that goal, in addition to the 10% linear cut, Mr. Guimarães’s proposal suggests higher taxes on companies under the presumed profit regime.
Lawmakers also noted that the exact number of existing tax incentives in Brazil remains uncertain.","Congress is expected to introduce a proposal in the coming weeks for a gradual reduction of tax incentives, with phased cuts through the end of 2032, when the transition period of the tax reform ends. According to lawmakers involved in drafting the bill, the aim is to create a more structural measure rather than a simple “patch” to help the government meet its 2026 fiscal target.

Another point viewed skeptically in Congress is the government’s plan to implement a “linear” cut—that is, an equal reduction across all incentive programs, done in a single step. “It’s important to note that there are dozens of different incentives, each with its own characteristics. Some of them require evaluating the returns they generate for the country, and that must be considered when deciding on cuts,” one source explained.

There are currently three bills under discussion focusing on incentives. One, authored by Senator Esperidião Amin, addresses the periodic review of criteria for granting benefits and governance rules. Another, from the government’s leader in the Lower House, José Guimarães, proposes a 10% across-the-board cut in non-constitutional tax benefits and an increase in taxation under the presumed profit regime. The third, by Congressman Mauro Benevides, provides for a minimum 10% reduction in tax, financial, and credit incentives, but the government considers it ineffective because it does not specify how the cut would be implemented.

Mr. Benevides is reviewing the Guimarães bill in the Finance and Taxation Committee (CFT) and will later move to the Constitution and Justice Committee (CCJ). The proposals by Mr. Benevides and Mr. Amin have already been granted urgent status, allowing them to go directly to the floor. According to sources involved in the talks, the government’s preferred points will likely be incorporated into the bills already under consideration.

In an interview with Valor, Lower House Speaker Hugo Motta said there is a tendency to combine the texts. Recently, after a meeting with members of the economic team and Senate President Davi Alcolumbre, it was decided that Congressman Aguinaldo Ribeiro would serve as the rapporteur on the issue. He was already acting as rapporteur for Mr. Amin’s bill.

Mr. Motta proposed a “stair-step” cut to Finance Minister Fernando Haddad months ago during discussions on the decree that raised the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF) rates. However, the idea was not well received by the economic team because it would spread out the fiscal impact over time and not address the 2026 fiscal challenge—the year the government aims for a primary surplus of 0.25% of GDP. The Finance Ministry declined to comment.

To achieve that goal, in addition to the 10% linear cut, Mr. Guimarães’s proposal suggests higher taxes on companies under the presumed profit regime. However, the expectation is that the final report in the Lower House will not include this measure, given its high chance of rejection. “The political environment will also be crucial in this process. Only proposals with secured support will be brought to a vote,” the same source said.

Lawmakers also noted that the exact number of existing tax incentives in Brazil remains uncertain. The Federal Revenue Service estimates about R$600 billion annually in tax breaks, but the government has suggested the figure could be as high as R$800 billion. “We’re waiting for the Revenue Service to send us the correct figures so we can better plan potential cuts,” said one of those involved in the discussions.

But how is it enforceable?”Pima County Supervisor Matt Heinz told Arizona Luminaria about Beale’s commitments.
In June, the Pima County Board of Supervisors voted to sell county-owned land to Beale for the future development of a massive data center.
Right now, the only agreement in place is the land sale.” “This is a new project,” Pima County Supervisor Jen Allen told Arizona Luminara of the current plan for the data center.
“Let’s put pen to paper and get a contract, legally binding and enforceable, that the people of Pima county can rely on,” Heinz said.","Beale Infrastructure — the company behind the controversial Project Blue data center — announced Thursday it will match all of its local energy use with renewables and invest $15 million in education, workforce development and community programs. But with no signed agreements or details on how those commitments would be enforced, Pima County officials say the promises offer more publicity than protection.

“Beale’s commitment to pursue 100% renewable energy for its Pima County data center is a

significant additional investment and reflects the company’s dedication to sustainable

infrastructure development,” according to the Nov. 6 letter from the company. “To achieve this, Tucson Electric Power (TEP) will serve the data center through an energy supply agreement and Beale will seek to accelerate the development of new renewable energy resources for TEP’s grid that produce enough energy to match 100% of the data center’s energy consumption — at the data center’s cost.”

“I love that. It’s great. Fantastic. But how is it enforceable?”Pima County Supervisor Matt Heinz told Arizona Luminaria about Beale’s commitments.

A memo from County Administrator Jan Lesher echoed the concern about enforceability. “While Beale states in their letter that details will be captured in a future agreement instrument, at this time there is no specificity on how the Beale commitments would be incorporated into an appropriate form of enforceable agreement to ensure future compliance,” according to the memo.

Lesher also noted the lack of specific information throughout Beale’s memo, including how future new clean energy generation would be developed or paid for, the time frame, and the dollar amount of investment.

“As stated in their letter, Beale has decided to move forward with the project even though Pima

County has unresolved questions at this time,” Lesher’s memo said.

The memo noted that in September the county suggested to Beale various community investments, including “clean energy generation, workforce development, broadband infrastructure, transportation infrastructure and climate mitigation in the form of home weatherization.” Beale chose to focus on “clean energy generation and work development options.”

A group that formed in opposition to the project, No Desert Data Coalition, responded to Beale’s announcement the same day.

“Once again, Beale Infrastructure brings forward vague promises of investment in workforce development that would only serve their own extractive industry. All while failing to address the outstanding public health and environmental concerns that have been raised since the inception of this ill conceived project.”

The coalition warns the county against “getting fooled a second time” by Beale.

They add: “Our community wasn’t fooled by Beale’s initial propaganda, and we aren’t fooled by this latest round of green washing and empty labor promises.”

Heinz said that Beale is “under tremendous pressure” to close the land sale before the end of the year. In June, the Pima County Board of Supervisors voted to sell county-owned land to Beale for the future development of a massive data center. Initially, the sale depended on the City of Tucson annexing the land so they could supply water to be used to cool the servers.

Heinz voted for the project. The board voted 3-2 in favor, with supervisors Jen Allen and Andrés Cano voting against.

After strong public opposition against the data center, the city unanimously rejected the annexation, but then Beale decided to go forward with the project anyway, saying it would use air-cooling technology rather than water. The land sale hasn’t yet closed.

“They want to get this project going, I understand that,” Heinz said. “But my priority isn’t Beale or the labor unions, my priority is to make sure the county has an agreement in place that will hold everyone to their commitments. Right now, the only agreement in place is the land sale.”

“This is a new project,” Pima County Supervisor Jen Allen told Arizona Luminara of the current plan for the data center. “We need a new contract, and these things that they are putting out now need to show up in the contract. This is just them putting out a letter and getting some press and trying to frame themselves as doing good, but it needs to be integrated into a contract.”

Besides the promise to use renewable energy, Beale’s community investment initiative includes a “$5 million scholarship fund designed to support STEM education and trade school training in Pima County.”

Despite county supervisors repeatedly stating that there is no legal means to back out of their agreement to sell the land to Beale, community members have continued to voice their staunch opposition to the project, crowding into supervisors’ meetings and laying out the environmental harms the data center may herald.

At the Nov. 4 supervisors meeting, union members also made their position clear: they want the data center and the construction jobs it will bring, even if those jobs end once the build is complete.

As the standoff continues, Beale has now added community benefits to the package. And yet skepticism remains.

“If in four years, if things change with Beale, what can the county do to enforce any of that?” Heinz said, referring to their commitments.

“Let’s put pen to paper and get a contract, legally binding and enforceable, that the people of Pima county can rely on,” Heinz said.",https://azluminaria.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCF7364.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 09:18:55.439080

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a member of the U.S. Joint Economic Committee (JEC), released the following statement following a new report by JEC Democrats estimating that annual electricity costs for the average New Mexico household are increasing by approximately 8% this year under President Trump:

“When you work hard in America, that should mean something. At the very least, it should mean you don’t have to make tradeoffs between your health care, rent, and energy bills. I am fighting to bring costs down so this can be a reality. But President Trump’s war on affordable, American-made energy, his massive tariff-taxes, and his assault on health care are making things worse, not better.

“Every hardworking person in New Mexico deserves stability and financial security. Period. I’ll continue fighting to make that a reality for all families in our state.”

On the campaign trail and throughout his second term, President Trump repeatedly promised that he would slash electricity prices in half. However, according to new JEC projections, annual electricity costs for the average New Mexico household are increasing by approximately $90 this year, which is 8.1% higher from 2024 to 2025. JEC found that electric bills have increased in 47 states, with consumers in 10 states paying at least 10 percent more for electricity.

Heinrich’s Actions to Lower Utility Costs and Fight Against Trump’s War on Affordable, American-Made Energy

As Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Heinrich has been fighting to lower energy costs and fight against Trump’s war on affordable, American-made energy.

Last month, Heinrich delivered remarks on the Senate floor, blasting President Trump for waging a war on American-made energy — causing energy costs to skyrocket and killing good-paying jobs. Heinrich’s speech came shortly before Senate Republicans once again blocked legislation he has led with U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.), which would have terminated Trump's harmful executive order that is wreaking havoc on working families, raising electricity bills, killing high-quality jobs, and undermining American energy independence.

Heinrich also sent a letter demanding that U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought restore funding for 223 energy projects in Democrat-led states that were unlawfully canceled. The funding for these projects was approved and appropriated by Congress.

In September, Heinrich sent a letter to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright expressing serious concerns surrounding the DOE’s cancellation of two dozen clean energy projects. The cancellation of these projects comes as energy demand continues to grow and consumer electricity bills surge as a result of the Trump Administration’s attacks on clean energy across the country.

In August, Heinrich released fact sheets that outline how the Trump Administration’s actions and Republicans’ Big, Bad Bill raises utility costs for cash-strapped American families.

Heinrich also hosted a roundtable discussion on how many jobs the Trump Administration will kill and how much they will raise New Mexicans' utility bills as a result of Trump’s Big, Bad Bill.

In late July at an ENR hearing, Heinrich raised the alarm on the energy affordability crisis facing working families and cited irresponsible actions taken by the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans that will raise energy costs on working families — including the passage of their Big, Bad Bill.

In early July, Heinrich grilled several pending Trump Administration nominees on the President’s Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) budget request and Republicans’ Big, Bad Bill, which will raise costs on American families by gutting investments in energy efficiency and clean energy programs.

In June, Heinrich slammed the U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright over the Trump Administration’s Fiscal Year 2026 (FY 26) budget request for the Department of Energy, which guts funding for energy programs that ensure Americans have access to affordable, domestic sources of energy and support our research and energy leadership should be shared goals.

In May, Heinrich urged the Trump Administration to immediately reverse course on its plan to illegally and unilaterally terminate the ENERGY STAR program. The ENERGY STAR program saves the average American household $450 on utility bills each year simply by choosing ENERGY STAR certified products.

In late February, Heinrich led his colleagues in delivering remarks on the Senate floor ahead of forcing a vote to end President Trump’s war on affordable, American-made energy. Earlier that month, Heinrich and Kaine introduced legislation to terminate President Trump’s national energy emergency and hosted a press conference to call on their colleagues to support this bill.

Excellencies,

Friends,

Over three decade ago in Rio, humanity set a new course of global climate cooperation.

Ten years ago, in Paris, we took a major step forward.

Without that act of collective courage, we would still be heading for an impossible future of unchecked heating, of up to 5 degrees.

Because of it, the curve has bent below 3°C – still perilous, but proof that climate cooperation works.

The clean energy revolution is booming, though we need to ensure all countries can get fully on board.

Last year, two trillion dollars flowed into renewables – twice as much as fossil fuels.

Ninety per cent of new power capacity worldwide was renewable.

Our focus today – climate plans and climate finance – are the spark that can accelerate action, driving green growth and resilience for every nation.

Our analysis shows progress: not just in bending the emissions curve, but more credible, whole-of-economy plans; stronger links to adaptation, just transitions, and gender equality; closer alignment with the Global Stocktake and with real-world delivery.

And, we see major economies saying they will strive to do better.

Because nations that move fast will gain the greatest share of the clean-energy boom reshaping global growth.

I commend those who have submitted their plans – and urge those who haven’t to do so now.

Here in Belém, we must accelerate on all fronts. That means doubling down on international cooperation. Our not-so-secret weapon in the climate fight.

But we all know that plans without finance cannot reach their full potential.

Finance is the great accelerator.

The Baku to Belém Roadmap charts the path from $300 billion a year to $1.3 trillion by 2035 – and it must become reality.

This is shared interest, not charity – an investment in stability and prosperity.

Every dollar invested in climate solutions brings multiple dividends: jobs, cleaner air, better health, resilient global supply chains, stronger energy and food security.

To unlock that transformation, finance must be scaled up, sped up, and spread out – reaching every nation, fast, fair, and in full.

Friends, the Paris Agreement has proved that global cooperation is working to deliver progress, but still not fast enough.

Ten years on, we must prove it again – by making this extraordinary framework work faster and fairer, for everyone, everywhere.

History will not ask what we intended.

It will ask what we achieved.

Thank you.",https://unfccc.int/themes/custom/unfccc/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-08 05:18:20.480627

The new fund comes amid a revived focus on critical metals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements — commodities now considered as crucial to modern economies as oil once was. These materials lie at the heart of clean energy and advanced manufacturing supply chains, both of which have been under increasing strain from geopolitical and logistical challenges.

First Trust said the ETF is designed to track the Indxx Global Critical Metals Index, which identifies companies generating significant revenue from the mining or processing of those key materials. The benchmark includes developed and emerging market firms outside of Vietnam that are part of the Minerals Security Partnership, a coalition focused on securing reliable mineral supply chains.

The index has been designed to segment eligible companies into three broad themes reflective of their role in global industry: firms supplying sustainable energy metals used in projects including solar and wind power; those involved with next-generation mobility metals that are crucial for the manufacture of electric vehicle batteries; and producers of other metals necessary for high-technology industries, such as semiconductors, consumer electronics and LED lighting.

Together, these segments capture the backbone of the materials economy, driving both the clean energy transition and the digital revolution.

The launch comes at a moment when areas beyond the obvious clean energy plays are also gaining prominence, such as solar and wind ETFs, and toward the supply chain enablers behind them. By offering targeted exposure to metals producers and refiners, FMTL could serve as a backdoor play on the green transition and the tech hardware boom alike.

Executives at Indxx, the index provider, say that the partnership reflects the global pivot towards securing materials needed for the next wave of industrial and technological growth.

As countries double down on resource independence and investors chase the next structural growth theme, First Trust's new fund positions itself squarely at the intersection of energy security, electrification and innovation — a vein that's getting harder to ignore.

The deliberations mark a dramatic reversal for a vehicle Ford once compared to Henry Ford’s Model T and position the Lightning as potentially the first major casualty of the federal EV tax credit’s September 30 expiration.

The news arrives as Ford’s Model E electric vehicle division hemorrhages money and production remains halted following a September fire at key aluminum supplier Novelis. While no final decision has been made, the discussions reveal how quickly market conditions have shifted for automakers banking on large, expensive electric vehicles to drive their electrification strategies.

Lightning Production Halted, Future Uncertain

Ford paused F-150 Lightning production at its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan in October 2025, officially citing the Novelis aluminum shortage. The company prioritized conventional F-150 and F-150 Hybrid production instead, revealing where profits truly lie. Ford COO Kumar Galhotra told media the company would restart Lightning production “at the right time” but declined to provide any timeline.

“F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3,” Ford spokesperson Ian Thibodeau said in a statement to CNBC. “Right now, we’re focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis. We have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center back up at the right time, but don’t have an exact date at this time.”

The carefully worded response notably avoids any commitment to the Lightning’s long-term future. Industry analysts interpreted the vague timeline as evidence Ford may never restart production.

Mounting Losses Drive Discontinuation Discussions

Ford’s Model E division has lost $3.6 billion through the first nine months of 2025, contributing to $13 billion in cumulative EV losses since 2023. The Lightning itself has consistently lost money on every unit sold despite starting at $54,780, with many models selling for upwards of $80,000.

The financial pain intensified immediately after the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. In October 2025—the first full month without the $7,500 incentive—Ford’s overall EV sales plummeted 24% year-over-year. Lightning sales specifically dropped 17% to roughly 1,500 units, according to the Detroit News.

Since launching in May 2022, Ford has sold fewer than 100,000 Lightning trucks total through October 2025. Sales this year through October reached only 24,577 units—essentially flat compared to 2024 despite the Lightning initially receiving over 200,000 non-binding reservations that failed to convert to actual purchases.

Industry-Wide Electric Pickup Struggles

The Lightning’s troubles reflect broader challenges across the electric pickup segment. Ram parent Stellantis canceled plans for a fully electric Ram 1500 earlier this year, instead moving forward with an extended-range EV that includes a gas engine to recharge the battery. The Wall Street Journal report also cited sources saying General Motors executives have discussed discontinuing some electric trucks.

Tesla’s stainless steel Cybertruck, which briefly outsold the Lightning in 2024, has seen sales plummet in recent months. EV startup Rivian Automotive cut jobs this year as production challenges mounted. Even after the Lightning reclaimed the top spot in Q1 2025 registrations with 7,913 units versus the Cybertruck’s 7,126, the entire segment remains niche and unprofitable.

David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, told reporters: “Given weak EV demand, the Lightning long in the tooth, the need for more ICE F-150 capacity to make up for the Novelis fire, and a new generation EV truck in the works, it’s not shocking to see the rumor.”

Tax Credit Expiration Reshapes EV Market

The elimination of federal EV incentives has fundamentally altered the economics for both buyers and manufacturers. Congress passed legislation in July 2025 terminating both the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs effective September 30. The credits had been a cornerstone of U.S. EV policy since 2008, helping offset the higher upfront costs of electric vehicles.

Without the tax credit, a $65,000 Lightning effectively costs buyers $72,500—a price point that makes gas-powered F-150s significantly more attractive to traditional truck buyers. The Lightning’s value proposition always rested on federal subsidies bridging the gap between electric and conventional pricing.

Industry analysts predict sustained sales declines as the post-incentive market reality sets in. Toyota, Honda, and other manufacturers have already adjusted EV production plans downward in response to weakening demand.

Next-Generation Plans In Question

Ford had been planning a second-generation electric pickup, internally nicknamed T3, for production at its BlueOval City plant in Tennessee starting in 2028. However, the potential Lightning cancellation raises questions about whether Ford will proceed with that investment given the massive losses from its current EV portfolio.

CEO Jim Farley recently warned that Chinese automakers could “put us all out of business” with their manufacturing capacity and cost advantages. The company’s struggles to make EVs profitably while competitors like Tesla generate healthy margins suggests Ford may need to fundamentally rethink its electrification strategy rather than simply launching new models.

Ford plans to hire 1,000 workers at factories in Michigan and Kentucky to boost conventional F-150 and Super Duty production by 50,000 vehicles in 2026—a clear signal about where the company sees sustainable profits in the truck market.

EVXL’s Take

The F-150 Lightning’s potential demise tells a story that goes far beyond one vehicle. This is about the consequences of building an EV strategy around expensive, low-volume flagship products subsidized by taxpayer dollars rather than developing genuinely competitive electric vehicles that can succeed on their own merits.

EVXL has been tracking this trajectory for months. Back in May 2025, the Lightning was still beating the Cybertruck in quarterly registrations—7,913 versus 7,126. That seeming victory masked the underlying reality: both trucks were struggling, and the Lightning was only “winning” in a market that barely existed.

When the Novelis fire hit in September, Ford’s response revealed everything. The company immediately prioritized aluminum for profitable gas-powered F-150s while the electric Lightning sat idle. That wasn’t a supply chain decision—it was a business reality check. The Model E division had already lost $1.4 billion in Q3 2025 alone, and Ford couldn’t justify feeding scarce materials into a money-losing product.

The September 30 tax credit expiration simply accelerated the inevitable. Without $7,500 in federal subsidies, the Lightning’s value proposition collapsed. A well-equipped Lightning at $70,000-$80,000 competes directly with gas F-150s that cost $40,000-$50,000 and offer better range, faster refueling, and the utility truck buyers actually need. The math never worked without taxpayer support.

Ford’s predicament illustrates the fundamental flaw in U.S. EV policy that prioritized compliance and political optics over genuine market development. The Inflation Reduction Act funneled billions into expensive EVs that couldn’t compete without subsidies, creating temporary demand that evaporated the moment incentives ended. Meanwhile, Chinese competitors like BYD spent the same years building genuinely affordable EVs with profitable business models.

The broader question is whether traditional automakers can transition to electric vehicles at all. GM is quietly discussing cuts to its electric truck lineup. Stellantis canceled the electric Ram. European manufacturers are retreating from aggressive EV commitments as losses mount. Even Tesla’s market share is slipping as competition intensifies.

Ford bet billions on electric F-Series trucks being its “Model T moment”—a revolutionary product that would transform transportation. Instead, the Lightning may become the industry’s cautionary tale about the perils of subsidized electrification strategies divorced from market realities. The next-generation T3 truck planned for 2028 now looks increasingly unlikely, and Ford’s entire EV strategy faces a reckoning.

The data center needs at least 2600 megawatts.
Meta’s data center will need roughly three times the amount of electricity that the city of New Orleans uses in a year and increase Entergy's electric needs in the state by around 30%.
The Treaty Oak solar farms are expected to break ground before the end of the year, said Chris Elrod, CEO of the Austin-based company.
The 185 MW solar farm in Morehouse Parish, expected to come online in 2027, is the third large-scale solar project in the rural northeast Louisiana parish.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has signed a deal with a developer for two large-scale solar farms in rural Louisiana, projects tied to the tech giant's construction of its largest data center yet in the state's northeast.

The 385-megawatt projects, with developer Treaty Oaks, will generate enough power for around 80,000 homes. Meta will purchase the solar energy generated at the two sites in Morehouse and Sabine Parishes.

The clean energy will flow directly to the region's grid, helping Meta offset a small portion of the emissions from the three gas-fired electricity plants being built for its $27 billion AI data center in Richland Parish. The data center needs at least 2600 megawatts.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's founder, said in July that he planned to expand the massive data center — originally planned to sit on land the size of 70 football fields — to a footprint rivaling Manhattan, though some have cast doubt on if that could be possible.

Meta’s data center will need roughly three times the amount of electricity that the city of New Orleans uses in a year and increase Entergy's electric needs in the state by around 30%. Future expansions could ratchet up these figures much higher.

“When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid – and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy while contributing to local energy resilience and economic growth across Louisiana,"" Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said in a statement.

Meta is also planning to bring an additional 1500 MW of renewable energy to the grid through its contract with Entergy, the state's largest utility. The agreement with Treaty Oak and another with a company for a solar farm in Ouachita Parish are separate from the Entergy process, said Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle.

The Treaty Oak solar farms are expected to break ground before the end of the year, said Chris Elrod, CEO of the Austin-based company. The ""Hollis Creek"" project in Sabine Parish will sit on 2,300 acres of former timberland, and the ""Beekman"" project in Morehouse Parish will sit on 1,600 acres.

Elrod said the company intentionally set out to develop in Louisiana because of growth in the state's digital infrastructure, such as data centers, and manufacturing industries.

""It's a major milestone for our company and we're looking forward frankly to doing a lot more in the state of Louisiana,"" Elrod said.

'Lost a lot of our tax base'

The solar developer entered into a 15-year agreement with Meta, the same length of time as the tech company's contract with Entergy. Treaty Oak has completed all of the permitting and authorizations needed in both parishes, Elrod said, as well as tax abatement agreements in the form of payment-in-lieu-of-taxes, or PILOTs.

The projects are expected to generate over $100 million in state and local tax revenue and bring 300 jobs during the height of construction, according to Treaty Oak. The developer also has Louisiana projects in Vernon and Rapides Parishes, Elrod said.

The 185 MW solar farm in Morehouse Parish, expected to come online in 2027, is the third large-scale solar project in the rural northeast Louisiana parish. Two other tech giants, Amazon and Microsoft, are already purchasing clean energy generated in Morehouse Parish, said Kay King, CEO of the parish's economic development corporation. She said she's thrilled to have Meta as a new partner in the parish, which borders Richland Parish.

King stressed that in recent decades Morehouse Parish has lost almost all of its major industries, leading to a depressed tax base. Some 30% of the population live below the poverty line, half of the children in the parish live below the poverty line and 63 percent of households experience financial hardship.

The clean energy projects bring additional tax revenue during the construction process, King said, and while they don't yield many permanent jobs, the improved grid indirectly leads to more opportunities. For instance, the companies bringing energy infrastructure ""practically have to build the roads,"" which are in poor condition, King said.

""We've lost a lot of our tax base here and that's as important as creating jobs,"" King said. ""You have to be able to provide people with the amenities they're looking for. You have to fix their potholes, you have to keep your roads up, you have to improve the schools.""

The solar developers also improved road conditions in Sabine Parish, in the western-central part of the state where the other new 200-megawatt farm will be located. Bill Weatherford, the secretary treasurer of the Sabine Parish Police Jury, said they were able to negotiate ""a very favorable agreement"" with Treaty Oak. The company has already spent around $1 million on road improvements, he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/21/221d11c8-6513-5af1-a0e4-d5074c5c8c85/6893bb6edd10b.image.jpg?crop=1801%2C946%2C0%2C102&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-07 23:18:09.983857

The purpose of the public hearing is to offer all interested persons an opportunity to comment on current preliminary design plans for the Intersection improvement project at U.S. 40 and C.R. 600 E in Hancock County, Indiana. Doors will open at 5:30 PM to view displays and meet the project team, followed by a presentation at 6:00 PM and an opportunity for public comment. The display area will remain open until 7:30 and project team members will be available to give any further explanations of materials. The project is needed to address the history of severe right-angle crashes and congestion at the intersection. From 2022 to 2024, 12 of the 15 reported crashes were right-angle collisions. Additionally, traffic volumes on the north and south approaches of C.R. 600 E. have exceeded the road’s capacity, leading to long delays and safety concerns. The purpose of the project is to reduce the number of right-angle crashes and reduce traffic congestion on C.R. 600 E. during peak travel times. As proposed, the project involves the construction of a reduced conflict intersection (RCI) by eliminating the cross-street left turns and introducing a two-stage crossing to reduce unsafe operations. Drivers from C.R. 600 East will be required to turn right onto U.S. 40 and use new U-turn loons (expanded paved areas opposite the median crossovers to provide additional space to facilitate the larger turning path of a commercial vehicle along narrow medians) located approximately 600 feet on either side of the intersection. Left turns from U.S. 40 will remain, but through movements from C.R. 600 E will be restricted by new concrete medians. The project will require approximately 1.40 acres of permanent right-of-way (ROW) and 0.12 acres of temporary ROW. Environmental impacts include approximately 0.021 acres of wetland impacts, 1.73 acres of terrestrial habitat impacts, and 0.09 acres of tree clearing. No stream impacts are anticipated. The maintenance of traffic (MOT) for the project will be implemented in phases. Temporary shoulder closures and traffic shifts will accommodate loon construction, U-turn construction, median construction, and CR 600 E approach construction. MOT details will be presented during the public hearing. Access to all properties will be maintained throughout construction. School corporations and emergency services will be notified of closures prior to construction. Work is anticipated to begin during the 2027 construction season. Federal and State funds are proposed to be used for construction of this project. The cost of the project, including engineering, ROW, and construction, is estimated at $3,973,418. INDOT and the Federal Highway Administration have agreed that this project poses minimal impact to natural environment.

The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time.","The world of car sales is entering a new era. There were hints of it last year, when the sales of hybrid vehicles began to explode, but now, thanks to that already-softening demand of EVs and now the lack of a federal tax credit to incentivize sales, it’s clearer than ever: EVs are on the downturn.

The proof lies in October sales, which were released earlier this week; the first round of real data shows just how important that federal incentive was. It revealed a drop of 43 percent year over year. The numbers are forcing automakers to consider whether building EVs is even worth their time. And the first casualty of that thought process could be one of the most important EVs of the 2020s: the F-150 Lightning.

What else is going on in the world? Tesla CEO Elon Musk finally got approval for his controversial $900 billion pay package, winning more than three-quarters of shareholder votes. Whether he’ll actually perform well enough to earn enough to make him the world’s first trillionaire remains to be seen, though it seems unlikely.

Then there’s Toyota, which is building V6s that grenade themselves. The company has recalled another 127,000 engines for “machining debris” that could cause total failure. Oh, and Tesla has delayed the Roadster again, this time to April Fools’ Day, 2026. Let’s get into it.

Ford Reportedly Might Not Bother With Resuscitating F-150 Lightning Production

Back in September, an aluminum plant in Oswego, New York suffered a big fire that reportedly “leveled” a key part of its facility, according to the Wall Street Journal. This plant supplied aluminum to several automakers producing cars in the U.S., with Ford reportedly being the most affected. It was the biggest user of that plant, sourcing material to build its aluminum-bodied F-150—the most popular passenger vehicle in the country.

In response to this supply chain disruption, Ford paused production of the F-150 Lightning to focus production on the more profitable, higher-demand gas-powered variants. This makes a lot of sense; the F-150 Lightning may have been the best-selling EV truck last quarter, but the 10,000 units moved are just a drop in the bucket compared to the 207,000 gas-powered F-150s sold in the same period.

With demand for electric vehicles now falling off a cliff, Ford is reportedly considering whether to restart production of the F-150 Lightning at all, according to this report from the Wall Street Journal:

Ford Motor executives are in active discussions about scrapping the electric version of its F-150 pickup, according to people familiar with the matter, which would make the money-losing truck America’s first major EV casualty.

The Lightning, once described by Ford as a modern Model T for its importance to the company, fell far short of expectations as American truck buyers skipped the electric version of the top-selling truck. Ford has racked up $13 billion in EV losses since 2023.

Overall EV sales, already falling short of expectations, are expected to plummet in the absence of government support. And big, electric pickups and SUVs are the most vulnerable.

The report goes on to say that no final decision has been made, though considering Ram made the call to cancel its yet-to-be-released EV pickup just two months ago, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Ford follow suit. The signs of reduced EV truck demand are elsewhere in the market, too. Rivian, makers of the R1T pickup, just laid off 600 people. And sales of Tesla’s electric pickup, the Cybertruck, haven’t been doing well for months.

It’s not just the F-150 that’s in danger. WSJ says General Motors executives are considering axing some electric trucks from the lineup, too, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The company builds three electric pickups right now: The Silverado EV, the Sierra EV, and the Hummer EV.

In the near future, I predict the demand for electric trucks will stay level or trickle down slightly. The truth is, most people want a gas engine in their pickups if they want to do pickup things, like towing and hauling. The proof can be seen in reservations for Scout’s new truck, where 80% of buyers want the range extender over the pure EV.

Trucks that rely on battery power alone are not the move for serious tow duty, as pulling all that extra weight zaps range to impractical levels. Plus, electric trucks are usually more expensive than their ICE-powered counterparts. Extended-range EV pickups like the new Scout and Ram’s upcoming 1500 REV have all of the same benefits as a pure EV, plus they can cover the range problem thanks to the onboard gas generator. For most buyers, it’s the logical solution.

Elon Gets His Wish. Now He Has To Make It Happen

Back in September, Tesla proposed a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that, should he accomplish a series of lofty financial benchmarks, would add nearly $900 billion to his net worth, making him the world’s first trillionaire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this proposal faced lots of criticism, seeing as how it would make Musk, already the world’s richest person, the highest-paid CEO in the history of CEOs.

Many believe Tesla’s valuation and future success hinge on Musk staying as CEO, though the South African-born exec seems to believe his most important role will be being in control of the company’s forthcoming robot army. Either way, shareholders of the automaker voted overwhelmingly to ratify the pay package, with Musk celebrating in the only way he knows how: Next to his machines. From Reuters:

The proposal was approved with over 75% support, and Musk bounded to the stage of the company’s annual meeting at its factory in Austin, Texas, accompanied by dancing robots.

Musk, already the world’s richest person, could get as much as $1 trillion in stock over the next decade, although required payments would take the value down to $878 billion.

The vote is crucial for Tesla’s future and its valuation, which hangs on Musk’s vision of making vehicles that drive themselves, creating a robotaxi network across the U.S. and selling humanoid robots, even though his far-right political rhetoric has hurt the Tesla brand this year.

“What we are about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” Musk told a cheering group of shareholders.

[…]

“Other shareholder meetings are like snoozefests, but ours are bangers,” Musk said. “I mean, look at this. This is sick.”

It’s important to note that Tesla won’t just hand Musk $878 billion over the next decade. The package requires him to accomplish some incredibly lofty tasks, including growing Tesla’s stock value by eight times, deploying a million robotaxis, selling a million humanoid robots, selling 20 million more cars, growing full self-driving subscriptions to 10 million users, and increasing operating profits to $400 billion. As I said in my previous coverage of Musk’s pay proposal, doing all of that seems pretty impossible, considering Tesla’s reputation and aging lineup.

Toyota Still Can’t Get Its V6s Right

Last year, Toyota, widely known as builders of some of the most reliable, durable, and longest-lasting vehicles on the planet, caught a lot of flak for having to replace the engines in over 100,000 trucks and SUVs equipped with the company’s relatively new 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6.

Back then, Toyota said leftover machining debris from the factory was wreaking havoc on the V6’s internals, could could lead to engine knock and total engine shutdown. The company quickly reworked its manufacturing process, saying that any engine built after those deemed potentially faulty “were manufactured with new or improved processes that better clear machining debris.”

Well, it turns out that the new process wasn’t good enough, because Toyota is recalling even more V6s for the same problem. From the company’s website:

Toyota is conducting a safety recall involving certain model year 2022-2024 Toyota Tundra, 2022-2024 Lexus LX, and 2024 Lexus GX vehicles in North America. Approximately 127,000 Toyota- and Lexus-branded vehicles (conventional gas models only) are involved in this recall in the U.S.

There is a possibility that certain machining debris may not have been cleared from the engine when it was produced. In the involved vehicles, this can lead to potential engine knocking, engine rough running, engine no start, and/or a loss of motive power. A loss of motive power while driving at higher speeds can increase the risk of a crash.

Toyota says it’s “currently developing the remedy” for this problem, though if I had to guess, it’s probably just going to replace these engines like it did with the last bad batch. If I were an owner, that’s what I’d want. Even if an engine doesn’t immediately fail due to errant metal debris, I’d worry it could be enough to cause serious damage in the long term.

Can You Believe It? The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again

In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time. This comes after reports that Musk had planned to show off the car by the end of this year. The new proposed reveal date isn’t inspiring much confidence. From TechCrunch:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.

Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.”

“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said.

In some even more upsetting news for reservation-holders of the car, Musk went on to say that production of the Roadster won’t begin until 12 to 18 months after the reveal. So, at minimum, it won’t be until April 2027 that this car hits the road—nearly an entire decade since it was first revealed.

If Musk is to be believed, the production Roadster should, at least, be pretty different from the car we saw in 2017. From TechCrunch:

Musk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.

I’ll believe it when I see it (on the road, that is).

Leaders broadly agreed that global climate action is diminishing. In his opening remarks, UN Secretary-General António Guterres criticized countries that have abandoned their climate commitments and “remain captive to… fossil fuel interests.” Leaders from Brazil, Chile, and Colombia echoed this sentiment and urged other leaders not to follow suit. Guterres added that exceeding 1.5°C (2.7°F) of warming is a “moral failure and deadly negligence.”

Roll Call: The World Leaders Summit had only half of the attendance of COP29’s. Leaders from China, the EU, France, the UK, COP29 host Azerbaijan, COP28 host UAE, and Australia and Turkey (both of whom hold competing bids to host COP31) all made opening remarks. The U.S., India, and Russia were notably absent.

New Forest Fund: On the first day of the World Leaders Climate Action Summit, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF). The multilateral fund will pay heavily forested developing countries to leave these ecosystems intact, with 20% of these payments going to Indigenous and local communities. Upon its launch, the TFFF collected endorsements from 53 countries and more than $5.5 billion in pledges, with $3 billion from Norway, $1 billion each from Brazil and Indonesia, $500 million from France, $250 million from Colombia, $5 million from the Netherlands, and $1 million from Portugal, with more pledges expected over the course of COP30.

Kate Johnson, regional director for North America at C40, stated on EESI’s podcast that C40’s main goals for the summit are to give hope that city-level climate action can accelerate progress towards national goals, to inspire confidence among mayors who are facing political headwinds, and to influence momentum at the upcoming negotiations in Belém.

EESI Podcast: “Smaller Scale, Greater Impact: Subnational Climate Diplomacy at COP30”

Mind the Gap: Each year ahead of COP, the UN Environment Programme publishes the Emissions Gap Report and the Adaptation Gap Report, designed to highlight the difference between climate commitments made and actual progress achieved. The Emissions Gap Report, bluntly titled Off Target, states that keeping warming to under 1.5°C (2.7°F) and 2°C (3.6°F) would require “rapid and unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions far above what has been pledged.” It adds that in a best-case scenario, warming would be kept to 1.9°C (3.4°F), and emphasizes that the U.S.'s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is expected to cut progress by about 0.1°C (0.18°F). The Adaptation Gap Report, Running on Empty, found adaptation financing needs of developing countries to be 12 to 14 times greater than current finance flows.

And Another Emissions Report: The new Rhodium Climate Outlook 2025 generally echoes the findings of the Emissions Gap Report, leading with the headline, “although we’ve avoided the most catastrophic projections, the world is on track to exceed 2°C [3.6°F] of temperature rise.” The report details sector-by-sector emissions, highlighting that the industrial sector is responsible for the highest share of emissions globally and is projected to remain in that position through 2050.

EESI Briefing: How Can We Cut Industrial Emissions?

Green Climate Fund: The Green Climate Fund was established in 2015 by countries under the UNFCCC. In the 10 years since, funding for mitigation and adaptation projects has reached $19.3 billion (up from $145.8 million), and project support has expanded to 134 countries (up from eight countries). Together, these projects have avoided the equivalent of 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. At its most recent meeting last week, the Green Climate Fund board approved a record $3.26 billion for projects in developing countries.

Representation at COPs: A report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development examines the history of Indigenous Peoples’ engagement with and access to the UNFCCC process and that of its two sister conventions, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. The report details how Indigenous knowledge is currently incorporated into the draft indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation.

Private Sector in São Paulo: The Bloomberg-sponsored COP30 Business and Finance Forum took place in São Paulo, Brazil, earlier this week. Coming out of this event, the We Mean Business Coalition penned a letter to world leaders. The core message is twofold: national governments should commit to high ambition at COP30, and reconsider the way their domestic clean energy finance incentives are written in order to boost private sector investment. The letter specifically calls for redirecting the $1 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies to the clean energy transition. The letter’s signatories represent more than 135,000 companies.

The event follows the Governor’s recent signing of new legislation and funding to propel and maintain the state’s leadership in the quantum industry, research, and development.

Quantum: computing capability for the future

Quantum computing has the potential to solve equations in mere minutes that would take existing computers thousands of years to complete — enabling immense potential to enhance medication discovery, improve artificial intelligence tools, combat climate change, and model complex scenarios. Quantum sensing can revolutionize how we see the world, and quantum communication can usher in unhackable quantum networks.

During today’s convening, officials and experts in the field discussed recent breakthroughs and near-term use cases in quantum computing, sensing, networking, and materials & devices (M&D) — tools and technologies likely to revolutionize medicine, climate research, security, and the way we connect to the world. The Governor opened the event with a video message.

They also examined how California’s national quantum centers, national labs, and quantum foundries can provide shared infrastructure and secure testbeds, standardize materials and devices, and move prototypes toward deployed systems for critical applications such as drug discovery and advanced manufacturing.

The Golden State’s quantum advantage

California is uniquely positioned to lead in this critical sector. It is the only state home to both the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy quantum research centers, produces the nation’s top quantum talent, is headquarters for the world’s leading quantum companies, and has five of the world’s top fifteen artificial intelligence programs — at UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, UCLA, Stanford and Caltech.

“Quantum California brings together some of the world’s best researchers, most successful businesses, and top state leaders to advance technology, science, and economic strength — and ensure that California remains the world’s innovation hub,” said University of California President James B. Milliken. “From our campuses to our national labs, UC researchers are at the vanguard of quantum breakthroughs, paving the way to a healthier, safer, and more prosperous California. UC is proud to join our partners in this effort.”

Leading quantum research centers are also based at UC Berkeley, UCLA, USC, and Stanford, alongside industry partners like the Google Quantum AI Campus (affiliated with UC Santa Barbara), Microsoft’s Station Q Lab (UC Santa Barbara), and the Amazon Web Services Center for Quantum Computing (Caltech).

“Berkeley is thrilled and honored to be the launchpad for ‘Quantum California,” said UC Berkeley Chancellor Rich Lyons. “Our university excels at what this moment demands: fueling and facilitating the free exchange of ideas between academia, industry, and the government in pursuit of discoveries that will advance the health, well-being, and security of the American people.”

Investing in the technologies of the future

As breakthroughs in research increasingly rely on advanced technology, California is investing in emerging fields such as quantum to drive innovation across disciplines. In October, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation and announced new funding to propel the state’s quantum industry, a key tradeable “bet” sector under the California Jobs First Economic Blueprint.

Assembly Bill 940, authored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), will drive California’s efforts forward by creating a statewide strategy to transform quantum research into industry output. Under the bill, GO-Biz will publish a strategic framework, aligned with the state’s Economic Blueprint, to help grow the quantum economy in regions throughout the state. This framework, paired with a $4 million investment from the state’s budget, will support a robust talent pipeline, foster new research and development, and unlock new possibilities across strategic sectors and industries.

“Quantum California is about turning discovery into opportunity so that our state’s research powerhouses can connect with entrepreneurs and companies to drive real innovation, investment, and job creation,” said Dee Dee Myers, Senior Advisor to Governor Newsom and Director of the GO-Biz. “No other place in the world has the ability to bring together this depth of talent, technology, and creativity as a force for economic progress.”

California’s economic strength

California is not only a national economic powerhouse — it is driving the future. The state is one of the world’s largest economies, feeds the country, and leads the nation in new business starts, access to venture capital funding, manufacturing, and agriculture. With an increasing state population and record-high tourism spending, California’s economy continues to grow across key regions and sectors — proving that innovation and inclusion go hand in hand.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Quantum-California.png,N,,2025-11-07 21:18:29.591179

“It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told The Associated Press at the close of a two-day business conference in Athens. He added that he might attend next year's summit “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

Wright’s comments came as world leaders gathering over 5,000 miles away, on the edge of the Amazon in Brazil, blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for his absence from the United Nations-sponsored discussions on climate change running through Nov. 21. His remarks echoed the U.S. administration’s rejection of global climate agreements and Trump's prioritization of fossil fuels.

The White House confirmed Friday the U.S. will send no high-level officials to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Wright led a senior U.S. delegation to Athens for talks centered on boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe and Ukraine. Among them were Interior secretary Doug Burgum, deputy secretaries and the new U.S. ambassador to Greece and close Trump ally, Kimberly Guilfoyle.

At the forum, top U.S. officials criticized European Union carbon reduction policies, arguing they undermine economic growth, democratic alliances, and global leadership in AI and energy innovation.

A world away, leaders take aim at Trump's claims

It was a stark contrast with the Brazilian city of Belem, where world leaders at COP30 issued urgent warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming, driven in large part by emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said a “moral failure” to act would trigger rising hunger, displacement, and environmental damage.

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.

Latin American leaders attending COP30 in Belem took swipes at Trump for his stance on climate discussions.

“Today Mr. Trump is against humanity. His absence is proof of that,” Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said in his speech on Thursday. “What should we do then? Leave him alone. Oblivion is the biggest punishment.”

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva struck a more moderate tone regarding Trump’s absence, expressing hope that his U.S. counterpart would eventually change his mind.

“President Trump told me he doesn’t believe in green energy, Lula told reporters earlier this week. “He will believe in it, because he'll realize that we don’t have much of an alternative.”

Trump wasn’t the only one staying away; the summit was also notably absent of leaders from China and India. Together, these three nations are the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Wright — a former fossil fuel executive who has been a leading voice against efforts to fight climate change — defended Washington’s stance, arguing that global gatherings should prioritize energy access, growth and technological advancement over what he described as fear-driven environmentalism.

“Gatherings of global leaders and businesses should be about humans … not on the desire to scare children and grow government power,” he told the AP in Athens. “They’ve lost the plot.”

The Belem talks opened as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, the World Meteorological Organization reported Thursday.

Climate policy reversals under Trump

Trump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

At the start of his second term, Trump again withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, while the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations.

Trump created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers. Under executive orders, the EPA and other federal agencies have sought to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.

“Perhaps in no other time in history have leaders in Washington been more determined to pull the United States backwards in the fight against the climate crisis,"" Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Friday in a statement.

Smith",,,,,https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2025/11/07/the_texas_energy_experiment_1146123.html,"It is not as well known that Texas also leads the U.S. in electricity production using renewables.
In the first half of 2025, Texas led the nation in renewable energy production, 181,000 GWh.
Texas also leads in the installation of new solar and wind capacity and battery storage.
In 2025, Texas is installing enough new solar capacity to exceed California’s utility-scale solar capacity.
There are several reasons: Texas has a state-wide electric grid managed by ERCOT (The Electric Reliability Council of Texas).","A very important experiment is being conducted in Texas. It will demonstrate the relative merits of electricity production using fossil fuels versus solar and wind based upon cost, availability and reliability.

We know that Texas is a fossil fuel powerhouse accounting for about 42% of oil production and 27% of natural gas production in the U.S.

It is not as well known that Texas also leads the U.S. in electricity production using renewables. In the first half of 2025, Texas led the nation in renewable energy production, 181,000 GWh. California was second with 85,000 MWh.

Texas also leads in the installation of new solar and wind capacity and battery storage. Texas has the largest wind capacity of any state by a wide margin. In 2025, Texas is installing enough new solar capacity to exceed California’s utility-scale solar capacity. Texas also leads on the installation of utility-scale battery capacity needed to stabilize the electric grid by storing electricity when renewable electricity production exceeds demand and releasing electricity when demand exceeds supply.

How is this possible? There are several reasons:

Texas has a state-wide electric grid managed by ERCOT (The Electric Reliability Council of Texas). Thanks to this grid, it is easy to connect the best areas for solar and wind farms to electricity customers throughout the state.

Texas has a competitive retail electricity market. Producers have incentives to use the lowest cost sources for electricity and pass the lower costs on to customers. Low electricity prices result from the use of low-cost natural gas, not just renewables. The average electricity rate in Texas is 12 cents/kWh compared to the national average of 15 cents/kWh. The average rate in California is 30 cents/kWh.

Texas favors new development and it is easier and quicker to get new energy projects approved and implemented than in most other states.

The state leads in the addition of utility scale batteries to store electricity to smooth out supply and demand to stabilize the grid. ERCOT actively manages the grid in real time. Large electricity users can be required to adjust their electricity use when total demand is high. Additions to solar, wind and battery capacities has added to electricity reserves and strengthened the state’s ability to reduce or avoid blackouts and brownouts during times of peak demand.

Texas’ abundant and low-cost electricity will be a big help in developing the state’s economy. Low-cost electricity from renewables will support Texas’ production of green hydrogen, a fuel for the future.

California is second to Texas in renewable energy. However, California has among the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S. and imports up to 25% of its electricity. This is in spite of having excellent potential for solar and wind projects. California does not have a competitive electricity market. The Public Utilities Commission approves electricity rates requested by the state’s three large utilities. This high and rising cost of electricity in California works against the greater use of electricity from renewables for transportation, home heating and other uses being mandated by the state.

Conclusions.

The current administration is cancelling or discouraging renewable energy projects and their federal subsidies. However, solar and wind farms with battery backup are increasingly the lowest cost source of electricity in many locations.

Longer-term renewables future success in the U.S. will depend upon the cost and reliability of electricity from renewables compare to fossil fuels without subsidies and other government incentives. Based upon what is happening in Texas and many other locations, renewables could increasingly be the preferred alternative. For cost comparisons without subsidies, an adjustment is needed to eliminate the fossil fuel subsidy associated with the ability to discharge greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere for free.

""The silver lining here is that EPA is returning expired RINs to the six refineries who were granted exemptions from their 2021 and 2022 RFS obligations,"" Cooper said.
Cooper said if EPA decides not to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes, the ""impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating.""","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- The Trump administration granted two full small-refinery exemptions, 50% exemptions on 12 petitions and denied two other petitions for compliance years 2021 to 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a Renewable Fuel Standard announcement on Friday.

The announcement comes as the agency also considers public comments made on a proposal to reallocate biofuels gallons lost on 140 partial and full exemptions granted by the administration recently.

""With most of the old petitions now cleared, EPA is committed to working with DOE (U.S. Department of Energy) to address new petitions as quickly as possible and within the 90-day statutory review period, ... "" the EPA said in a news release.

""Furthermore, on Sept. 16, 2025, the agency announced a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking that takes into consideration the expected impacts of the Aug. 22, 2025, SRE decisions. EPA is reviewing comments on the supplemental proposed rule as the agency continues to work on final regulations for the 'Set 2' rule. As stated in the (supplemental proposal), EPA intends to update the agency's projections of exempted gasoline and diesel volumes in the final rule based on any additional SREs issued after the proposal, including the petition decisions in this action.""

EPA said announcement was part of the Trump EPA's ""commitment to get the RFS program back on track"" with an approach that recognizes ""some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others"" and that EPA's relief should reflect those differences.

""EPA is reaffirming the agency's policy of returning RFS compliance credits, known as renewable identification numbers, previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year,"" the agency said.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement he questions EPA's decision.

""Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,"" Cooper said.

""EPA added another 14 small-refinery exemptions to the already-massive pile today, based on the agency's questionable new approach to determining whether those refiners experienced 'disproportionate economic hardship.'""

Cooper said the RFA continues to dispute the notion that SREs are ""warranted at all"" since the agency's own analysis shows that all refiners -- large and small -- face a proportional RFS compliance obligation and pass their RIN costs through to buyers of their refined products.

""The silver lining here is that EPA is returning expired RINs to the six refineries who were granted exemptions from their 2021 and 2022 RFS obligations,"" Cooper said.

""However, more than 500 million valid RINs will be issued to eight refineries who were gifted exemptions from their 2023 and 2024 obligations, meaning there are now more than 2.5 billion RINs associated with 2023-2025 SREs that are likely to be dropped back onto the market in the months ahead.""

Cooper said if EPA decides not to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes, the ""impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating.""

He said EPA's decision further underscores the ""crucial need"" for EPA to finalize 2026-2027 renewable volume obligations that fully reallocate any and all SREs granted, or expected to be granted, for the 2023-2027 compliance years.

A trade and climate partnership would serve the common interest of both China and Europe.
But it can be envisioned only if China ends its support for Russian aggression and adopts a more neutral stance.","GENEVA/PARIS – In early 2021, the European Union shelved the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment it had negotiated with China after the United States signaled its disapproval. At the time, deferring to the new US administration seemed prudent, because Europe was eager to rebuild transatlantic unity after Donald Trump’s first term. For a while, it looked like a wise move: US President Joe Biden soon rejoined the Paris climate agreement and proclaimed that “America is back.”

To be sure, the relationship between Europe and the Biden administration was not frictionless, especially after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which mobilized tens of billions of dollars to support US industries. Overall, though, transatlantic disputes were contained, and America’s steadfast support for Ukraine appeared to have shored up transatlantic relations.

But since Trump’s return to the White House, transatlantic solidarity has again curdled into strategic vulnerability. Sweeping US tariffs have hurt friends and foes alike. Fearing a complete withdrawal of US military support for Ukraine (or worse), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to a one-sided handshake trade deal with Trump in Scotland. Meanwhile, the US has continued to dismantle the postwar order, regarding it as what Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls a “weapon being used against us.”

After again withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, Trump is actively undermining renewable energy and climate action more broadly. In mid-October, the US unilaterally sabotaged a recently agreed International Maritime Organization compact on reducing emissions from shipping; and this month, it will do what it can to derail an ambitious agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil.

Tragically, with the world missing meaningful chances to keep global temperatures near the Paris targets, the risk of a deeper unraveling has grown. That may suit US short-term interests and the fossil-fuel lobbies, but it will spell disaster for the planet – especially the most vulnerable developing countries.

The one point on which Republicans and Democrats agree is that China must not be allowed to supplant the US as the de facto leader of the international order. While the latest rapprochement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may de-escalate bilateral tensions for a while, it certainly does not change the nature of a rivalry that will shape international relations for many years, if not decades.

Faced with American nationalism and Chinese assertiveness, Europe can no longer afford strategic passivity. Despite its economic weight, it has not been a player in this game, and certainly not in the contest for global dominance.

As a supporter of a rules-based international order, Europe cannot side comfortably with either China or Trump’s America. But in an increasingly multipolar world, it does have enough clout to tilt the balance one way or another. While it has so far sided with the US, the Trump administration’s unpredictability and belligerence give Europe reason to consider alternative options.

Yes, the EU has its own grievances vis-à-vis China. But the two also have ample common ground, not least when it comes to climage change and the energy transition. As the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gases and top producer of clean tech, China’s manufacturing future hinges on the success of the global green transition.

China and Europe thus share a strategic interest in advancing the climate transition across emerging markets and low-income countries. After all, the fate of the climate – and of the natural environment – increasingly depends on developing economies, which already account for the bulk of current and future emissions. If their growth continues to be powered by fossil fuels, the resulting climate-driven damage will impose mounting costs on everyone. As we show in a recent policy paper, it is far more cost-effective to help emerging markets and developing economies expand through renewable energy than to pay for rapidly increasing climate-related costs.

To that end, a pragmatic partnership between Europe and China could help not only Europe and China, but all current and future generations. What would it take to pull it off? Given low mutual trust, several conditions must be met.

First, trade frictions must not become a stumbling block as Chinese net exports surge (owing to weak domestic demand), and as trade is redirected away from the US and toward Europe. To prevent increased frictions, both sides must show maturity and agree on a clear quid pro quo.

As French and German economists proposed in a recent memo to both governments, Chinese access to the European market should be unconditional for certain goods such as solar panels, but still conditional on Chinese direct investment in, and technology transfers to, Europe for goods like electric vehicles; at the same time, imports should remain severely restricted in certain industries deemed critical for national security.

The second and most challenging condition is geopolitical. Most Chinese analysts regard Europe as a mere vassal of the US, and see the war in Ukraine as a conflict between the latter and Russia over their relative spheres of influence.

Europeans, of course, have a different reading. They see Russia as an aggressive neo-imperial power that aims to get its hands on Europe if it can manage to neutralize Ukraine. In a context where the US is increasingly fixated on Asia and the rivalry with China, the Kremlin’s brazen hybrid war on Western Europe makes its intentions clear. A trade and climate partnership would serve the common interest of both China and Europe. But it can be envisioned only if China ends its support for Russian aggression and adopts a more neutral stance. The quid pro quo would be that Europe asserts real strategic autonomy vis-à-vis the US.

If Europe and China can meet these conditions, they can lay the foundation for a green, rules-based partnership – not against America, but in defense of the global commons and their own future.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/622685ad20f6960922635517853bb189.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 01:19:05.669195

The shutdown plan of the DOE reveals what projects and departments are essential to serving American energy priorities and which are not. Congress should make this restructuring of the DOE permanent by defunding projects and offices that are not contributing to a reliable, cheap, and secure energy supply.

The DOE Shutdown Plan

Under the Antideficiency Act, government agencies must halt activities that do not have appropriated funds unless they are expressly authorized by law, necessary to discharge the President’s constitutional duties, or required for the protection of life and property. Of the DOE’s 15,523 employees, 9,816 (63%) were furloughed on September 30, 2025, and 5,707 (37%) were retained as “essential.”

The DOE’s plan is built around those guardrails. Essential activities performed by the DOE are primarily focused on nuclear security issues (i.e., experts on naval nuclear reactors and nonproliferation staff stay on duty to monitor and secure nuclear materials). Other departments that have received the essential designation include the Power Administrations, the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, and the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence.

Most DOE offices closed during the government shutdown are resource and advocacy offices that issue grants and fund energy projects outside of the scope of national security or constitutional duties.

Not All Operating DOE Offices Are Truly “Essential”

Most offices under the essential heading are fulfilling constitutional duties or ensuring the security of essential personnel or property.

Others that do not perform these essential functions continue operating because they have current appropriations, not necessarily because they are national priorities.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) leads efforts to develop and implement clean energy technologies and is part of the grant issuing process for those projects. Because of advance appropriations, they can continue this work with the nearly $8 billion dollars in budgetary resources available.

Similarly, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED)has over $10.5 billion in available budgetary resources that they can use to continue funding “green” energy projects and promoting decarbonization initiatives despite the government shutdown.

The DOE’s four Power Marketing Administrations (Bonneville, Southwestern, Southeastern, and Western Area) should face tougher scrutiny from Congress despite their continued operation during the shutdown. The Bonneville Power Administration operates under an indefinite appropriation and has funds available to continue operating fully during the government shutdown. The other Power Marketing Administrations still have budgetary resources available to them and have continued to operate and provide power during the shutdown.

Power Administrations were created to sell federal hydropower and support rural electrification. Today, they function as government-run utilities with access to taxpayer money. The shutdown is an opportunity to re-evaluate the usefulness of these Power Administrations and whether they are still necessary. Rural electrification is well established with state and regional energy markets operating electricity generation and transmission systems across America. These Power Administrations should be phased out and removed to minimize the distortion of energy prices and allow more market competition between energy producers.

When the government reopens, Congress should consider defunding and phasing out these entities as part of the effort to right-size Washington and bring the growing national debt under control.

Office Closures that Should be Made Permanent

The DOE shutdown plan includes thirteen offices that it considers non-essential. Primarily, these offices focus on implementing climate programs, grant distribution, or industrial policy initiatives are not deemed necessary for the protection of life and property.

For example, the Arctic Energy Office largely funds studies, partnerships, and initiatives that focus on energy development in Alaska and the Arctic that do not contribute to nationwide energy reliability or security. They primarily focus on introducing and experimenting with renewable energy in the Arctic regions, such as the Alaska Solar Microgrid Working Group.

Similarly, the Indian Energy Policy and Programs Office provides grants, technical assistance, and planning support to Tribal governments for energy projects. In the absence of this Office, private partnerships and state-level programs could support Tribal energy development without requiring federal funds.

The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization should be removed entirely. This office promotes contracting opportunities for small and minority-owned businesses within DOE. Tax dollars should not be steered towards identity-based categories and DEI targets which results in the government picking winners and losers. Grants to minority-owned businesses are not essential to protect public safety and do not serve to enhance the performance of our energy grid.

Other offices providing grants or loans with little real value added include the State and Community Energy Program, the Loan Programs Office, the Office of Technology Commercialization. None of these offices provide critical funds for energy reliability or securing energy grids from attacks. Instead, they increase government interventions in the energy marketplace, driving up prices and reducing competition. Grants to “green energy sources” are not dispatchable, meaning that they cannot provide power when it is needed most, forcing utilities to maintain backup systems powered by fossil fuels or nuclear energy or else be unable to supply power when demand peaks. By subsidizing these projects, American consumers receive more expensive energy with less reliability. Offices dedicated to funding these projects are not serving the American people and should be closed.

The Energy Information Administration collects and publishes energy data, forecasts, and statistics. Although this data is useful, pausing these reports during a shutdown does not stop government operations or energy delivery. Congress should reassess whether to restart the office at its current scale, as many energy statistics are already produced by industry and independent analysts.

A Path to Sound Policymaking

Policymakers should use the DOE’s shutdown plan and office designations as a prioritization map going forward. Certain functions and projects that are still operating cannot fail without harmful effects: safeguarding nuclear materials, defending the energy system against cyber and physical threats, and meeting specific constitutional and legal obligations.

To prevent taxpayer funds from continuing to support wasteful energy initiatives, reforms such as the OCED Elimination Act of 2025 (H.R. 4172) sponsored by Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX-26) are needed.",https://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/matthew-henry-yETqkLnhsUI-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 00:22:14.071505

The deal disappointed some environmentalists, who had pushed for explicit requirements that data center power come from renewable sources.
The deal comes amid an uncertain time for the data industry, which is growing fast because of artificial intelligence.
The other big utility in Michigan, DTE Energy, is taking a different approach.
Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece.","Michigan regulators on Thursday adopted landmark standards for the booming data center industry with a plan they say tries to protect residents from subsidizing the industry's hefty energy use.

In a 3-0 vote, the Michigan Public Service Commission adopted a rate structure that requires data centers and other energy-intensive industries in Consumers Energy's territory to sign long-term power contracts with steep penalties for exiting early.

The order also requires Consumers to show that data centers will shoulder all costs to build transmission lines, substations and other infrastructure before adding them to the grid.

Commission Chair Dan Scripps called it a ""balanced approach"" that shows Michigan is ""open for business from data centers and other large load customers, while also leveraging those potential benefits of the growth … in a way that's good for all customers.""

The deal disappointed some environmentalists, who had pushed for explicit requirements that data center power come from renewable sources. Michigan utilities are legally required to achieve 100% clean energy by 2040. They must detail how they plan to meet that requirement in filings next year.

""While the order includes important consumer protection terms, the commission missed an opportunity to emphasize the importance of the state's climate goals,"" said Daniel Abrams, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

The rate structure applies to customers whose energy use exceeds 100 megawatts. Data centers are among very few industries that demand that much power. Often, they demand an order of magnitude more.

Consumers serves 1.9 million customers across much of the Lower Peninsula. Company spokesperson Matt Johnson said officials are still reviewing Thursday's order and ""its impact on all stakeholders.

""Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state's economic development,"" he added.

The deal comes amid an uncertain time for the data industry, which is growing fast because of artificial intelligence. Much more energy is needed to power the transformation, but many industry analysts fear rising AI stocks are a bubble and demand for the technology won't materialize, leaving utilities and ratepayers to pick up the infrastructure tab for failed projects.

Hoping to avoid such an outcome, Consumers in February proposed special regulations that would lock data centers into 15-year contracts that guarantee consistent electricity use and require payments even if a facility ceases or downsizes operations mid-contract.

The commission's decision Thursday approves much of that request, with some significant modifications.

The other big utility in Michigan, DTE Energy, is taking a different approach.

Rather than establishing a blanket rate structure like Consumers, DTE wants to negotiate its first data center contract individually while aiming to avoid public vetting of the deal.

After announcing last week that it had inked an agreement to supply power for a proposed Stargate data center in Saline Township, DTE filed a draft 19-year contract with state energy regulators and requested swift approval without a public hearing.

Michigan law allows such expedited reviews in cases that would bring no added costs to utility consumers.

DTE officials argue adding the Stargate data center to its system will help keep rates down for everyone by spreading fixed costs among more paying customers.

""Given the sizable affordability benefits for our customers, as well as the economic impact the project will have, we think moving forward in this fashion makes the most sense,"" spokesperson Jill Wilmot said.

But DTE officials also stated in its filing that the company expects to spend some $500 million upgrading its transmission system and building a substation to serve the data center. Critics argue the utility is so intentionally vague it is impossible to vet DTE's claims about affordability.

""It's just highly concerning that they are trying to keep this somewhat private, because there's so much at stake,"" said Bryan Smigielski, a Michigan organizer with the Sierra Club.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also opposes DTE's quest for expedited review, and has requested a thorough vetting of the proposed contract.

Members of the Public Service Commission have not decided whether to grant DTE's request for quick approval, Scripps said.

Michigan's data center electricity rate deliberations come amid a surge of interest from developers looking to take advantage of new tax breaks that could save the industry tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers last year voted to exempt large data centers from Michigan's 6% sales and use tax in an effort to lure the industry to Michigan.

Beyond the Stargate campus, DTE is in late-stage negotiations for another 3 gigawatts' worth of data center capacity, while Consumers Energy is nearing deals for three large data centers amounting to a collective 2 gigawatts of power.

Developers are also scoping out rural land throughout the southern Lower Peninsula, from the Grand Rapids area to the outskirts of Monroe.

The wave of interest could have big implications for water and land use in Michigan. Hyperscale data centers occupy hundreds of acres apiece. Those that use water vapor to cool the servers inside the facilities — the industry's most common cooling technique — also use large amounts of water.

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT THE CLIMATE AND DEMOCRACY

STATE NEWS

VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS SECURE WINS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT: Democrats in Virginia had a historic election night, securing more seats in the House of Delegates than they’ve had in three decades while sweeping all three statewide offices. Energy affordability was top of mind for Virginia voters, who are facing rising costs and utility bills from data centers. Virginia LCV’s Political Action Committee invested more than $3 million this cycle through field, mail, digital, and direct contributions, knocked over 208,000 doors, and mobilized more than 400 volunteers. Read more about Virginia LCV’s role in the 2025 elections.

VALCV TAKE: VALCV Executive Director Michael Town said, “Tonight was an incredible night for Democrats who ran and won on a message of putting Virginians – not big corporations – first, addressing rising energy costs, and standing up for an affordable, clean energy future. By and large this was a message that resonated with voters, and the incoming majority – the largest in three decades – now has a mandate to deliver on policies that cut energy bills, hold big corporations accountable, and secure our transition to an affordable, clean energy future. After four years of stalled progress in Virginia, we look forward to working with the new ‘Conservation Majority’ to get this done.”

AFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY CHAMPIONS WIN PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION RACE IN GEORGIA: In a historic election, Dr. Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard were elected to Georgia’s Public Service Commission. These wins mark the first time a Democrat has won a statewide, nonfederal office in Georgia since 2006. Georgia Conservation Voters Action Fund (GCVAF) played an integral role in this race, spending more than $2.3 million this cycle and targeting over 1.8 million voters through billboards, SMS texting, direct mail and digital ads squarely focused on costs. GCVAF also published a webpage where voters could see just how much their bills have risen.

GCV TAKE: Georgia Conservation Voters Executive Director Brionté McCorkle said, “The message of this election is unmistakable: Georgians demand an end to utility bill rate hikes and corporate politics as usual on the PSC. Georgia Conservation Voters and our affiliated entities invested over $3 million in these elections, marking our largest investment ever because we had to make sure voters knew the stakes at the ballot box – from utility bills to corporate polluters.”

MIKIE SHERRILL WINS NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR’S RACE: In New Jersey, former Representative Mikie Sherrill celebrated a decisive victory in the governor’s race, beating her opponent Jack Ciatarelli by a wide margin. New Jersey LCV Victory Fund invested over $1.7 million in a campaign showcasing Ciatarelli’s costly energy policies, successfully driving up his unfavorability. Sherrill is a dedicated climate champion who has committed to declaring a statewide energy emergency and full rate freeze on day one in office to address rising utility costs and hold Big Polluters accountable.

NEW JERSEY LCV TAKE: New Jersey LCV Executive Director Ed Potosnak said, “Mikie Sherrill’s historic win in Tuesday’s election marks a strong rebuke of the right-wing, MAGA agenda parroted by Jack Ciattarelli. The environment was on the ballot in the Garden State – and we were there from the beginning as the first issue group to endorse Mikie Sherrill for Governor and invested the largest ever to elect her because of her unflinching support for the environment and offensive to lower electricity costs by rapidly expanding the cheapest source of power, clean energy.

“Her victory ensures that a strong environmental champion will be taking the reins of our state, one who is laser-focused on lowering skyrocketing electricity prices with new sources of clean energy which is the cheapest source of power. We look forward to working with Governor-elect Sherrill and continuing New Jersey’s role as a national leader in environmental protection, safeguarding clean drinking water, preserving open spaces and advancing clean energy. We know that robust environmental policies create good union jobs, lower costs for working families, and ensure all New Jerseyans, regardless of zip code, can breathe clean air and drink pure water. Working together, we know that we can build a stronger and more prosperous future for ourselves and our children, one where clean energy powers our state, creates union jobs, improves public health, and lowers costs for overburdened families.”

MAINE REJECTS LIMITS ON VOTING: Voters in Maine rejected Question 1, a ballot measure that would limit absentee voting and impose onerous voter ID requirements. The state overwhelmingly voted to keep the current system in place, ensuring changes that may limit people from voting will not be enacted.

MCV TAKE: Maine Conservation Voters said, “Mainers from all over the state overwhelmingly said no to limits on absentee voting and harmful voter ID requirements. Mainers know our election system works and allows voters to cast their ballot in a way that best suits their needs. We have some of the highest voter turnout of ANY state in the country to prove it!

“Today, the message from voters is clear – our system works, and we don’t want changes that would stop people from voting. We are immensely proud of the coalition that drove these results and of the Mainers everywhere who made their voices heard. There are still many fights ahead, but please take a moment today to celebrate and enjoy this hard-earned victory.”

NATIONAL NEWS

ENERGY AFFORDABILITY DRIVES DEMOCRATIC WINS ACROSS THE NATION: In Georgia, New Jersey, and Virginia, Democratic candidates responded to voters’ concerns on energy cost and celebrated wins across the board. Decisive victories for Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Democratic candidates for Georgia Public Service Commission proved that electricity bills are the kitchen table issue driving Democratic wins in 2025 and beyond.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber said, “In Georgia, New Jersey, and Virginia there was a clear line drawn between candidates responding to voters’ concerns about energy costs with real solutions, and those toeing the MAGA party line. Candidates who ignore rising energy costs do so at their own peril. This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump Administration’s ban on clean energy, multi-million dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher.

“Cost of living continues to be a major issue on voters’ minds, with rising energy costs among their top household budget concerns. Recent polling shows that the majority of voters believe that elected leaders have an impact on electricity costs. A majority of Americans also attribute rising costs to the GOP agenda, utility companies, and Big Oil CEOs. The reasoning is simple. The public understands that actively blocking the development of the cheapest and fastest-to-deploy power sources–wind, solar, and battery storage – only leads to more expensive options dominating the grid.”

More than 40% of Oklahoma’s energy generation comes from wind turbines and solar companies are showing increased interest in building projects in the state. Yet Oklahoma’s position as a top-tier renewable energy producer may fade following the passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Signed into law July 4, the megabill slashed tax incentives for wind and solar projects that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which were lauded as the U.S.’s first climate change mitigation law and passed during the Biden administration.

These cuts are expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Without tax credits the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies will most likely respond by building fewer of these projects, and those facilities that do come on line will be much more costly.

When that occurs, it’s expected that the country will increase generation of electricity from natural gas plants which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar operations.

That shift will hit states hardest that do not diversify their energy resources and require that a specified percentage of the electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resources.

In Oklahoma, Energy Innovation predicts that electricity rates for residential, commercial and industrial consumers will grow between 60% and 350% over the next decade. That means $100 annual increases in household energy bills by 2030 and $540 by 2035. There is also a dire forecast for decreased economic activity. Their modeling suggests that Oklahoma will lose out on significant planned private investment and suffer job losses.

These cuts along with multiple laws passed by the 2025 Oklahoma Legislature that tightened regulations on wind and solar energy will at the very least slow down if not effectively stop the state’s renewable energy development.

The One Big Beautiful Bill was signed into law about two weeks after representatives from utilities and the Southwest Power Pool warned the Oklahoma Corporation Commission that the state would see a significant energy demand that is likely to outgrow its current supply.

Clearly, our electric utilities and regulators were caught off guard by the biggest jump in demand in a generation. One of the things they didn’t properly plan for is artificial intelligence, an immensely power-hungry technology, and the accompanying explosion in data centers.

One data center today consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but some of those currently under construction will require 20 times more.

As projections soar the question about the energy sources that will power the increased demand remain unanswered.

Natural gas in Oklahoma makes up about half of its generation. But it’s unclear if an adequate number of new plants will be built in time since gas-fired turbines, which are used in a majority of the country’s facilities, are backlogged for up to seven years.

Over-reliance on gas plants, coupled with mistaken assumptions about their reliability, is a significant grid vulnerability.

Gas plant operations are particularly susceptible to damage and disruptions during extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and severe as the climate changes. Remember in 2021 Winter Storm Uri hit the central United States and knocked nearly a quarter of the affected area’s power plant capacity offline. Gas plants accounted for most of the failed capacity.

Utilities can bolster grid reliability by utilizing clean energy solutions. Pursuing clean energy solutions instead of fossil fuels lessens not only global warming emissions but also toxic air pollutants that harm public health, particularly in communities of color where gas plants are disproportionately located. Further, these demand-side solutions can reduce the need for new infrastructure and decrease the land-use impacts that come with large-scale projects.

Ratepayers should not bear the burden of hosting dirty gas plants whose pollution puts their health at risk nor should they be responsible for the infrastructure and service costs associated with rapid load growth due to large users such as data

Our legislators, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as well as utilities themselves should create unique electricity rate structures, or tariffs, for data centers. What this means is that data centers should be subject to rates, terms, and conditions that are more appropriate to how they use energy and their impact on the grid. Utility costs have long been assigned to the customers that cause those costs, at least in theory.

Meanwhile, utilities must prioritize the use of renewables, efficiency, energy storage, and other grid-supporting technologies to meet this demand.

Throwing new gas plants at the problem is an ineffectual attempt to keep up with energy demand predictions. We must recognize the paradigm shift that load growth from data centers represent and stop trying to solve new problems with old tools.

Conventional fertiliser production is heavily dependent on natural gas and coal, releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Instead of using fossil fuels to power industries, geothermal energy provides a clean, consistent, and locally available source of power.
Beyond its technical achievements, the green fertiliser innovation carries a powerful message: the transition to sustainable development is already underway.
The green fertiliser initiative embodies the spirit of innovation and self-reliance that is driving transformation across East Africa and beyond.","For decades, many farmers across the region have faced unpredictable fertiliser prices, high import costs, and erratic supply chains. However, a groundbreaking innovation recently realised in Kenya is transforming the way energy and agriculture intersect. Now, geothermal power can be utilised to produce ammonia and fertiliser locally, rendering the high costs and supply chain inconsistencies concerns of the past.

Developed by KenGen in partnership with China’s Kaishan Group, the fertiliser plant will use around 165 megawatts of geothermal power from Olkaria to synthesise green ammonia, which is then converted into fertiliser, projected at up to 480,000 tonnes annually. This development reflects a broader transformation in which clean energy and technology are woven into the fabric of daily life and livelihoods.

The green fertiliser plant will use steam to produce ammonia, the key ingredient in most fertilisers, without relying on fossil fuels. Through this process, renewable energy is directly linked to food production, demonstrating how sustainable technologies can drive both environmental and economic progress.

Locally produced fertiliser powered by renewable energy offers a path toward greater stability, affordability, and independence. It means that food producers can plan with confidence, grow more sustainably, and reduce the costs that often strain smallholder farmers.

What makes this project especially significant is its “green” foundation. Conventional fertiliser production is heavily dependent on natural gas and coal, releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By using geothermal energy, the new facility drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions, cutting more than half a million tonnes of CO₂ annually, equivalent to removing over 100,000 cars from the road. The result is an agricultural solution that not only feeds communities but also protects the planet.

This shift carries three broad benefits that extend well beyond agriculture itself:

Empowering communities and strengthening livelihoods

Sustainable fertiliser production opens new opportunities for employment, training, and innovation. Thousands of jobs are expected to be created in construction, operations, and maintenance, boosting local economies. Farmers will gain access to more reliable fertiliser supplies, leading to improved yields and incomes. This ripple effect can enhance food security, reduce poverty, and strengthen community resilience in both rural and peri-urban areas.

Pioneering a new model of clean industrial growth

The project demonstrates how renewable energy can be the foundation for modern manufacturing. Instead of using fossil fuels to power industries, geothermal energy provides a clean, consistent, and locally available source of power. This model of clean industrialisation could be replicated across the region, where abundant natural resources, such as geothermal energy, wind, and sunlight, offer immense potential. It signals a future in which sustainability and economic growth are not in conflict but in harmony.

Building a greener, more resilient regional economy

Producing fertiliser locally means fewer imports, lower transport emissions, and greater control over supply chains. It also aligns with global shifts toward sustainable production and trade, giving local products a competitive advantage in international markets. By reducing dependence on external inputs and fossil fuels, the region strengthens its resilience against economic shocks and environmental challenges.

Beyond its technical achievements, the green fertiliser innovation carries a powerful message: the transition to sustainable development is already underway. It shows that the tools to tackle climate change and food insecurity can be homegrown, drawing on local resources and ingenuity. With the right policies and partnerships, such innovations can be scaled to benefit millions, supporting not only agriculture but also the broader goals of clean energy, decent work, and environmental restoration.

Of course, the journey ahead requires commitment. Ensuring equitable access to affordable fertiliser, empowering smallholder farmers, and building the infrastructure to distribute products efficiently will be critical. But the foundation has been laid. The combination of renewable energy and local manufacturing represents a new chapter in how societies can grow food, create jobs, and protect natural resources simultaneously.

This is a glimpse into a future where sustainability is practical, profitable, and inclusive. The green fertiliser initiative embodies the spirit of innovation and self-reliance that is driving transformation across East Africa and beyond. As geothermal steam powers the production of clean, green fertiliser, it symbolises something more profound: the energy of a region ready to cultivate its own sustainable future, one harvest at a time.",https://vellum.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cropped-logo.png,N,,2025-11-07 21:18:43.496945

The majority dismissed these concerns, arguing that as long as any gas furnace types are still available, there is no coerced fuel switching.","On November 4, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit handed down a decision that is bad news for millions of homeowners in need of a new furnace. The only silver lining from American Gas Association et al. v. Dept. of Energy is that it might encourage Congress to step in and address the issue.

The Biden Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a wave of anti-consumer appliance efficiency standards, including one targeting residential gas furnaces. This 2023 rule effectively outlawed non-condensing gas furnaces in favor of condensing models. Condensing gas furnaces are more efficient and can comply with the new standard, but they can create costly installation challenges for millions of homes with venting systems designed for non-condensing models. This mandated transition will be most difficult–and in some cases virtually impossible–for older and space-constrained homes, which are disproportionately owned by low-income homeowners. The American Gas Association cites DOE data estimating that 30 percent of senior households and 26 percent of low-income households would experience net costs from the rule.

The statute authorizing appliance regulations, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), contains provisions protecting consumers from overzealous appliance efficiency regulations that deprive them of any desired product characteristics. Specifically, it expressly forbids any standard “likely to result in the unavailability in the United States…of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary’s finding.” It is hard to imagine any stronger language preserving consumer choice.

Nonetheless, DOE sidestepped this provision by essentially claiming that the specific type of gas furnace is not a protected feature. In the agency’s words, “the technology used to supply heated air or hot water is not a performance-related ‘feature’ that provides a distinct consumer utility under EPCA.”

CEI strongly disagreed with this interpretation. In comments critical of the proposed rule, we said that:

This is an unacceptably narrow reading of the features provision, whose broad language protects every aspect of a product that is of relevance to consumers. Here, the feature at issue is more accurately characterized as the furnace’s compatibility with the home in which it is to be installed – which of course is of great importance to the homeowner.

Unfortunately, a two-judge majority upheld DOE’s interpretation, deferring to the agency and confirming that non-condensing gas furnaces can be eliminated as an option in the regulatory pursuit of efficiency. However, a powerful dissent by Judge Neomi Rao came to the same conclusion as CEI, saying that:

Under the best meaning of EPCA, a “performance characteristic” is a distinctive product attribute that provides utility to the consumer. Non-condensing appliances plainly provide such utility through their unique venting method, which allows for direct integration into many existing exhaust systems without cumbersome and costly retrofits. This integration capability is a “performance characteristic” of noncondensing appliances that EPCA protects from regulatory elimination.

Rao noted that, in light of Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo (2024), DOE’s implausibly cramped interpretation of EPCA’s consumer protections should receive no deference, yet that is precisely what the majority opinion did.

DOE’s rule conceded that some homeowners, when faced with the high costs of a new condensing gas furnace (up to $867 more, according to DOE) would choose electric heat instead. CEI’s comments noted that such fuel-switching to electric is part of the climate agenda-inspired antipathy to natural gas and in any event is forbidden under EPCA’s prohibition against fuel-switching. The majority dismissed these concerns, arguing that as long as any gas furnace types are still available, there is no coerced fuel switching. The dissent argued that making gas versions prohibitively expensive and inconvenient for some homeowners amounts to coerced fuel switching and is one more reason DOE’s rule violates the law.

The case will likely be appealed, but the clock is ticking, and manufacturers need to know well ahead of the rule’s 2028 effective date which models are legal to manufacture and sell. In addition, the Trump DOE can and should revisit the regulation to better preserve consumer choice, but that will also take time and be subject to judicial review.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1344298893-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 18:58:49.747237

The project was finished two weeks ahead of schedule and is expected to reduce energy costs while cutting carbon emissions.

Sustainability at the Core of Operations

Managing Director JJ Fitzgerald said sustainability was central to the company’s approach. “Sustainability and finding new ways of working to leave positive impacts on communities is what drives us as a business. This is a project we are particularly proud of,” he said.

“This investment in clean, green electricity will significantly reduce carbon emissions and help create a more sustainable future for the community. By generating renewable energy on-site, Gorton Market can lower electricity bills, making operations more cost-efficient while supporting environmental goals.”

Collaboration Drives Success

Mr Fitzgerald thanked Evolution’s partners and staff for their contribution. “We thank our valued partners Warden, the main contractor on this project, for their collaboration and support. A huge thank you also to all our team at Evolution for their hard work, expertise, and dedication to delivering this quality job on budget, and ahead of schedule.”

Expanding Renewable Energy Capabilities

The Gorton Market project marks a significant step for Evolution as it expands its renewables division. The company has already made similar progress at its own headquarters, where it has installed 46 photovoltaic panels on the roof of its offices at Blackpool Airport Enterprise Zone. The system supplies enough power for its 12 office-based staff and its fleet of electric vehicles, making the site self-sufficient in energy.

Industry Recognition for Sustainability

Evolution’s commitment to sustainability and community impact has also been recognised within the industry. The company is a finalist for the Social Impact Award at Insider’s Lancashire Property Awards 2025, which will be held on Thursday, 13 November at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool.

Mr Fitzgerald added: “We have always built our business on our reputation for delivering quality on time and on budget.

But out of the political spotlight, the real story is unfolding in colder homes, emptier fridges and workplaces where people are showing up without pay. The pain can be quiet, cumulative and largely invisible to those in power who call basic assistance like heating help and food security measures “extreme.”

In Maine, the emergency heating assistance program administered by MaineHousing has been halted due to the shutdown. For families already stretched thin, this isn’t a policy inconvenience – it’s a direct threat to their ability to stay warm as temperatures drop. Meanwhile, SNAP benefits are hanging in the balance, leaving households unsure of how they’ll pay for groceries this month.

At the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, more than 7,700 civilian employees are trapped in a cruel paradox. Classified as “essential,” they’re required to report to work during the federal shutdown, yet receive no pay. Because they remain technically employed, they’re ineligible for unemployment benefits. They can’t seek other jobs. They’re working without compensation, expected to shoulder the burden of political gridlock. But for many, that burden is simply too heavy.

And, in the middle of this, Republicans in Washington are arguing that extending health care tax credits, one of the most effective tools for keeping people insured, is somehow “extreme.” Let’s be clear: there is nothing extreme about helping people afford health care.

These enhanced premium tax credits, expanded under the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, have made coverage accessible for millions of Americans. They’ve lowered monthly premiums, stabilized the health care marketplace and helped reduce the uninsured rate to historic lows. If they are allowed to expire at the end of the year, premiums will skyrocket, coverage will drop and the very people already reeling from the shutdown, those relying on SNAP, heating assistance or working without pay, will be hit again.

This isn’t a theoretical policy debate. It’s a question of whether we believe that basic stability, food, heat, health care, is a right or a reward.

Calling these tax credits “extreme” is a rhetorical sleight of hand. It distracts from the real stakes: whether we choose to support working families or let them fall through the cracks. What’s truly extreme is asking people to navigate a shutdown, rising costs and health care insecurity all at once while pretending the tools to help them are somehow too generous or not available when the truth is they are simply being redirected to help fund tax breaks for billionaires.

We must stop framing basic survival as a partisan debate. Programs like SNAP, heating assistance, unemployment benefits and affordable health care aren’t optional extras, they’re essential infrastructure that keep thousands of Mainers and millions of families across the country afloat. These supports not only protect lives, they strengthen our economy with a proven return on investment. When the system falters, especially during a shutdown, these lifelines should never be the first to go, nor should they be used as political leverage.

Maine people deserve leaders who are fighting to make sure they can afford to build healthy, happy lives. I remain committed to this, and to maintaining our strong Maine communities and way of life.

The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.
""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we're breathing.
DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.
Though LEAN's early mobile testing didn't find St. Rose was an emissions hotspot, according to a report on that work, IMTT agreed to finance additional LEAN sensors.","After months of work and political wrangling over potential legal impact, a new, small network of air sensors began collecting real-time data in four Mississippi River communities and has already detected spikes in pollution since going live in September, an environmental group says.

For years, community and environmental advocates have argued that the state should require real-time, fence-line air monitoring around the state's major industrial facilities to supplement its regional network with more localized data. But the idea has faced resistance from industry, regulators and legislators over the cost, the fear of false positives and of providing fuel for lawsuits.

Located between Baton Rouge and New Orleans , new AQMesh sensors sponsored by environmental group LEAN represent a different tack, putting monitors in the community and offering, the nonprofit's officials believe, the potential to spur voluntary air quality improvements even if the sensors' data don't have regulatory teeth.

""It is our hope that by shining a light on contaminants in the air, we can show companies where their operations are having potentially adverse impacts on neighboring citizens, as well as on company workers, and can spur constructive discussions of ways to reduce emissions and lessen the health impacts,"" Marylee Orr, LEAN's executive director, said in a statement.

The AQMesh sensors can't carry the force of law because they don't meet a new state equipment standard, LEAN officials acknowledge, but they insist the accuracy is close to regulatory-level equipment.

Financed with part of a $500,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant, the four LEAN air sensors are located in Alsen, Geismar, St. James and Donaldsonville. The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.

Running since the beginning of the year, the four sensors were first calibrated for months standing next to Louisiana regulatory air monitors and were found to meet EPA thresholds for data comparability with the state equipment, LEAN's scientific advisors say.

The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. They also collect data on wind speed and direction, with the information published on LEAN's website every 15 minutes.

These pollutants are regulated by the state and federal government, have known health impacts and are common near industrial sources, but, in many cases, can come from many other sources as well.

Slawomir Lomnicki, an LSU environmental science professor who is advising LEAN, explained that the data so far are providing clear trends, including spikes in Geismar for volatile organic compounds, a class of chemicals that can be tied to toxic industrial pollution.

""When we look at the correlation between atmospherical conditions and these pollutants, in many cases, you can see a very clear correlation with the direction from where the plume is coming,"" he said.

'This is historic'

LEAN officials say they have been meeting with community members to discuss the data and then will facilitate meetings between residents and area companies ""to explore ways to correct and prevent emissions incidents.""

The arrival of the sensors has sparked a mix of praise and criticism from community groups, as well as caution from industry and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we're breathing. And now, we—the people—can be part of the solution,"" Pastor Harry Joseph, LEAN's local community shepherd, who oversees the air quality sensor in St. James Parish, said in a LEAN statement.

DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.

The Louisiana Chemical Association, a key trade group for river industries and outspoken critic of the cost and feasibility of public fence-line monitors, said it wants to review the findings ""to better understand"" them, ""confirm their methods and quality controls, and interpret how the results compare with reported emissions data from state and federal authorities.""

""Ambient measurements can reflect background levels and non-industrial contributors, including traffic and other businesses, so we want to ensure these are properly taken into account,"" said David Cresson, president and CEO of LCA and its sister organization, the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance.

""We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue.""

Other community groups have criticized the sensors as technologically insufficient, though those criticisms have come in the context of a parallel LEAN project still under development in St. Rose.

Four more AQMesh sensors are in place and being calibrated for future reporting in the St. Charles Parish community, where chronic smells and emissions have fueled concern over a large tank farm owned by International Matex Tank Terminals.

Those sensors come after DEQ removed one of its own community monitors a few years ago that both residents and IMTT had wanted to remain.

Though LEAN's early mobile testing didn't find St. Rose was an emissions hotspot, according to a report on that work, IMTT agreed to finance additional LEAN sensors. The data will be collected by a third party and published in real time on LEAN's website, like the current data.

Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh, who leads the St. Rose community group Refined Community Empowerment, said she didn't trust LEAN's early hotspot findings and argued the LEAN sensors won't provide specific enough information about what kinds of toxic chemicals are in the air.

Traci Johnson, IMTT's vice president for environment, health, safety and security, said the company followed LEAN's recommendations on which chemicals the sensors should test for.

'What's going on here?'

In 2024, as environmental groups began proposing their own community-based systems and conducting other efforts like mobile air monitoring, the Legislature pushed through new rules that barred data from these systems from being used for regulatory actions or lawsuits if they didn't match federal standards for regulatory air monitoring equipment.

That law is the subject of a 1st Amendment lawsuit brought in federal court by environmental groups, though not LEAN.

Larry Starfield, a retired top EPA official and lawyer who also advised LEAN, said that while the sensors are not the same as regulatory air monitors, they have seen great improvement in accuracy over the past decade and come at significantly lower cost than regulatory equipment.

Starfield, who spent his last 12 years at EPA as the principal deputy assistant administrator for enforcement before his retirement in 2023, said that LEAN's advance calibration work has shown the results ""are highly consistent with readings that would be expected using LDEQ's regulatory monitor.""

But he added that LEAN's intended application will fit a role that EPA says is acceptable for sensors and won't violate the new state law, highlighting instead elevated emissions in the hopes of voluntary corrections, not to allege violations of law.

""Where you have people living so close to industry, having a local, real-time, every-15-minute look at what's going on in your neighborhood in terms of air quality is just unique, and so it just gives them a chance to raise a flag and say, 'Hey, what's going on here?'"" he said.

Starfield pointed out that the earlier phase of the LEAN project that used the air monitoring car found elevated emissions and a company quickly corrected the problem after it was informed. He called it a ""different way of doing business"" than more traditional, slower methods through enforcement or litigation.

President Donald Trump’s anti-wind energy agenda is harming Louisiana businesses that form the backbone of America’s offshore oil and gas industry, which stands to lose billions if the president fulfills his campaign promise to end construction of offshore wind turbines.

In recent years, offshore leases have opened in state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind farms to be built. Wind technology has advanced, allowing for taller turbines to capture more of the Gulf region’s wind power higher up in the air. A trained workforce, built off the back of oil and gas, provided a wide base of support for the industry to expand.

On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an executive order halting construction on all offshore wind projects. The president has long expressed a dislike of wind turbines, sometimes making dubious claims that they “destroy everything,” are the “most expensive energy there is” and that they produce noise that causes cancer.

These actions and statements have slowed supply chain investments and threatened the jobs of blue-collar workers in Louisiana and nationwide, all while electricity demand is growing, in large part because of increasing numbers of large, power-hungry data centers.

There are no offshore wind projects under construction off Louisiana’s coast, but the state is deeply entwined with developments in other parts of the country. Most of the businesses working on offshore wind farms on the East Coast come from the oil and gas sector in the Gulf of Mexico.

Even without a single industrial-scale wind turbine generating electricity in Louisiana, offshore wind has so far spurred over $500 million worth of supply chain investments in the state, according to Oceantic, an offshore energy trade association with about 400 members worldwide. Almost all of Oceantic’s members work in both the wind and fossil fuel sectors, spokeswoman Stephanie Fracoeur said.

It’s the same across the Gulf South. The offshore wind sector has spurred roughly $14 billion in investments into U.S. supply chain and manufacturing companies, with nearly two-thirds coming from businesses in Republican congressional districts, according to Oceantic.

But those investments have grown risky as many offshore wind projects that were planned have been paused or scrapped altogether.

“Oil and gas hasn’t been exceptionally busy over the last decade, so offshore wind was helping keep many of these companies in business,” Francoeur said. “Unfortunately, these policy changes have put a pause on things … The federal actions have been crippling for hundreds of American businesses that were planning on this work.”

State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, represents an area of the state that has invested and made a lot of money in the wind industry. Lafourche Parish is home to shipbuilders, metal fabricators, ocean crane operators and many other companies in the offshore energy sector. Having once built and serviced the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, these businesses on the bayou were called on to do the same thing for offshore wind farms along the East Coast, Orgeron said.

Orgeron, a former Nicholls State University professor with a doctorate in experimental physics, once managed his family’s offshore vessel business and helped it expand into the wind sector. Like other companies, they didn’t abandon oil and gas; they expanded into wind energy because it offered a stable revenue stream to offset volatile fossil fuel commodity prices, he said. While an abundant oil supply and low fuel costs are good for consumers, Louisiana’s energy service sector hits the doldrums when profit margins lead exploration companies to press pause on their Gulf drilling plans.

“For 60 years, we went through economic booms and busts, and it’s just so nice to know there’s an alternative market where your identical expertise is required and appreciated,” Orgeron said. “I really don’t wanna see one of our down-the-bayou operators lose an alternative revenue stream that’s not tied to the price of oil.”

A handful of offshore wind projects are still in progress on the East Coast, where dozens of Louisiana oil-and-gas service companies are now working.

Jake Cheramie is the general manager of Encore Group, a company in Houma that provides cooks, cleaners, crane operators and other personnel to offshore work sites. Just a few years ago, all of Encore’s clientele were in the oil and gas sector, but Cheramie said Encore gravitated to East Coast wind energy development in 2021. It now encompasses roughly 20% of their business, he said.

“Most of the major vessels in lower Lafourche are up in the Northeast working now, and that’s cool to see,” Cheramie said. “It’s been good to us. I certainly don’t wanna see offshore wind go away.”

Oceantic categorizes Encore as one of many auxiliary services businesses that work for one of Louisiana’s 42 offshore energy companies that currently hold active wind contracts.

Much of the work has gone to shipyards that build vessels that specialize in offshore construction. For instance, Edison Chouest Offshore in Cut Off spearheaded construction of the $97 million Eco Edison vessel for Revolution Wind, a wind farm project off the Rhode Island coast, and other East Coast projects. That single contract, one among several others like it, employed nearly 600 Edison Chouest workers across multiple states.

About a year ago, Encore opened an office in Rhode Island to support its personnel working on the Revolution Wind project. That wind farm made headlines Aug. 22 when the Trump administration rescinded its federal permit and issued a stop-work order, citing vague national security concerns. Scheduled to come online in early 2026, the $5 billion project was about 80% complete at that time.

Revolution Wind sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge sided with the company a month later, ruling the government’s actions “arbitrary and capricious” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns.

The judge’s temporary injunction allowed the company to resume work for the time being, but the order is temporary and could change if the Trump administration succeeds on appeal. The setback has already cost Revolution Wind $77 million, according to company officials who also blamed Trump’s anti-wind policies and tariffs for increasing the cost of steel and other construction materials.

It’s a new reality that Encore and other businesses are having to grapple with. The part of their business model that was the most stable just a year ago has suddenly become shaky.

“Louisiana is going to be one of the hardest-hit areas,” Francoeur said. “Once the current projects are completed, some of those companies will have idle shipyards or idle vessels.”

Cheramie said Encore is working on other offshore wind projects in New Jersey and Virginia but worries about losing them if the Trump administration continues to target the industry. If things stay on track, Encore should have steady work for another two to three years, he said, admitting new contracts for future jobs are now hard to come by.

“There’s been quite a few projects that aren’t being permitted or may be canceled,” Cheramie said.

The pause is largely due to Trump’s executive orders, pausing all wind leases and permitting. He has followed those up with actions that have made business particularly difficult for wind and solar companies, including directing his Commerce Department to investigate the wind sector for any national security implications and directing his Interior Department to block the nation’s largest solar project, which was planned for federal land in Nevada.

“Things are likely not to move forward in the next couple of years because of the actions by the Trump administration to essentially put a pause on federal permitting for offshore projects,” said Madelyn Smith with the renewable energy industry group Southeastern Wind Coalition.

One example is RWE Wind, a German company that held the first federal wind lease off the coast of Louisiana in addition to leases on the East and West coasts. It scrapped all three projects this year and laid off 73 of its U.S. employees after Trump started his assault on the wind sector, according to a Reuters report. The company said it is focusing on onshore wind and solar for the time being while still holding onto its offshore leases.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Many Louisiana-based offshore energy businesses with wind interests refused to speak on the record for this report. The same was true for some trade groups, including the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents members in the offshore wind and fossil fuels sectors.

Orgeron said he has noticed the same pattern among some of his constituents who prefer to not say or do anything that draws attention from the White House.

“I have friends who know they’re in the crosshairs of the Trump administration,” he said. “They’re kinda in a holding pattern.”

There is one active lease in Louisiana state waters for a wind farm, according to the state Department of Energy and Conservation. The Cajun Wind project is proposed by the North American arm of Vestas, a Denmark-based renewable energy company. It’s planned off the coast of Cameron Parish and would generate enough electricity to power 144,000 Louisiana homes at peak output, according to the project’s webpage. It’s unclear when or if Vestas plans to start construction. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Diamond Offshore Wind, backed by the Mitsubishi Corp., initially planned to build a wind farm in Louisiana waters. It abandoned its lease at the beginning of 2025 but terminated its operating agreement in March.

Offshore wind farms are “enormous infrastructure projects,” Smith said. Such projects can take eight to 13 years and millions of dollars to build. Any permitting delay, political uncertainty or disruption in supply can be significant enough to chase off investors, she added.

“It has definitely given some developers pause that there have been so many changes,” she said “They are going to be looking for more stability and clarity in the federal regulatory landscape in order to move forward.”

Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, said he doesn’t expect much expansion in offshore wind over the next few years unless the Trump administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which has paused offshore wind leases, reverses its current stance.

That could be detrimental for other industries that need new sources of energy to operate, such as artificial intelligence. The AI sector has been building data centers across the country that require massive amounts of power to operate, such as Meta’s proposed facility in North Louisiana. Data centers will need an estimated 22% more electricity by the end of this year and nearly three times as much in 2030, according to a report by S&P Global.

“We are facing a pretty severe energy crunch, not just in Louisiana, but nationally,” Mahan said. “Any sort of delay that we’re seeing, that is only going to hamper our energy dominance agenda.”

For the time being, many of those in Louisiana’s offshore energy sector are counting the days until the next presidential election, Orgeron said.

“Everybody’s just waiting it out until Trump leaves office,” he said. “I just hope that the president I voted for doesn’t, because of his little idiosyncrasies, destroy it completely.”

Still, the French energy giant would like to invest more in the US, where it’s already one of the largest renewable developers, and it’s also finding opportunities in other parts of the world, Clamadieu said. That includes the Middle East and India, where the focus is “on quick development” and “trying to reduce” investor risks, he said.

Under President Donald Trump, the US has scaled back tax subsidies that were supporting zero emission energy ventures. The Trump administration also has canceled permits for some renewable projects and issued stop-work orders for others.

Among the targets is SouthCoast Wind, an offshore wind farm planned near Massachusetts that’s a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie.

Article content

A federal district court dealt a blow to SouthCoast Wind earlier this week when it ruled that the Trump administration could reconsider a Biden-era permitting decision for the project. The developers are now weighing their options. They still have the underlying government offshore wind lease.

Article content

“To be frank, we aren’t expecting to develop this project at this point in time,” Clamadieu said, adding that while it’s not a good thing to wait, “it might be the reality.” Because SouthCoast isn’t as advanced as other wind farms under construction in US waters, “it offers opportunities for us to be a little bit more patient,” he said.

In the meantime, electricity demand is climbing, fed by the fast-growing AI industry and the development of power-hungry data centers essential to support it. Renewable wind and solar are key near-term sources of electricity, as new nuclear projects take years to develop and there’s a shortage of turbines for natural gas power plants.

Customers clamoring for energy “think that renewable solar and wind are indeed important opportunities to secure their access to low-carbon energy, and they’re coming to us,” Clamadieu said. “Renewable is a technology which has demonstrated its efficiency, both on wind and solar, and we are able today to develop new projects in a pretty short period of time.”",,N,,2025-11-07 17:59:25.731180

The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time.","The world of car sales is entering a new era. There were hints of it last year, when the sales of hybrid vehicles began to explode, but now, thanks to that already-softening demand of EVs and now the lack of a federal tax credit to incentivize sales, it’s clearer than ever: EVs are on the downturn.

The proof lies in October sales, which were released earlier this week; the first round of real data shows just how important that federal incentive was. It revealed a drop of 43 percent year over year. The numbers are forcing automakers to consider whether building EVs is even worth their time. And the first casualty of that thought process could be one of the most important EVs of the 2020s: the F-150 Lightning.

What else is going on in the world? Tesla CEO Elon Musk finally got approval for his controversial $900 billion pay package, winning more than three-quarters of shareholder votes. Whether he’ll actually perform well enough to earn enough to make him the world’s first trillionaire remains to be seen, though it seems unlikely.

Then there’s Toyota, which is building V6s that grenade themselves. The company has recalled another 127,000 engines for “machining debris” that could cause total failure. Oh, and Tesla has delayed the Roadster again, this time to April Fools’ Day, 2026. Let’s get into it.

Ford Reportedly Might Not Bother With Resuscitating F-150 Lightning Production

Back in September, an aluminum plant in Oswego, New York suffered a big fire that reportedly “leveled” a key part of its facility, according to the Wall Street Journal. This plant supplied aluminum to several automakers producing cars in the U.S., with Ford reportedly being the most affected. It was the biggest user of that plant, sourcing material to build its aluminum-bodied F-150—the most popular passenger vehicle in the country.

In response to this supply chain disruption, Ford paused production of the F-150 Lightning to focus production on the more profitable, higher-demand gas-powered variants. This makes a lot of sense; the F-150 Lightning may have been the best-selling EV truck last quarter, but the 10,000 units moved are just a drop in the bucket compared to the 207,000 gas-powered F-150s sold in the same period.

With demand for electric vehicles now falling off a cliff, Ford is reportedly considering whether to restart production of the F-150 Lightning at all, according to this report from the Wall Street Journal:

Ford Motor executives are in active discussions about scrapping the electric version of its F-150 pickup, according to people familiar with the matter, which would make the money-losing truck America’s first major EV casualty.

The Lightning, once described by Ford as a modern Model T for its importance to the company, fell far short of expectations as American truck buyers skipped the electric version of the top-selling truck. Ford has racked up $13 billion in EV losses since 2023.

Overall EV sales, already falling short of expectations, are expected to plummet in the absence of government support. And big, electric pickups and SUVs are the most vulnerable.

The report goes on to say that no final decision has been made, though considering Ram made the call to cancel its yet-to-be-released EV pickup just two months ago, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Ford follow suit. The signs of reduced EV truck demand are elsewhere in the market, too. Rivian, makers of the R1T pickup, just laid off 600 people. And sales of Tesla’s electric pickup, the Cybertruck, haven’t been doing well for months.

It’s not just the F-150 that’s in danger. WSJ says General Motors executives are considering axing some electric trucks from the lineup, too, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The company builds three electric pickups right now: The Silverado EV, the Sierra EV, and the Hummer EV.

In the near future, I predict the demand for electric trucks will stay level or trickle down slightly. The truth is, most people want a gas engine in their pickups if they want to do pickup things, like towing and hauling. The proof can be seen in reservations for Scout’s new truck, where 80% of buyers want the range extender over the pure EV.

Trucks that rely on battery power alone are not the move for serious tow duty, as pulling all that extra weight zaps range to impractical levels. Plus, electric trucks are usually more expensive than their ICE-powered counterparts. Extended-range EV pickups like the new Scout and Ram’s upcoming 1500 REV have all of the same benefits as a pure EV, plus they can cover the range problem thanks to the onboard gas generator. For most buyers, it’s the logical solution.

Elon Gets His Wish. Now He Has To Make It Happen

Back in September, Tesla proposed a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that, should he accomplish a series of lofty financial benchmarks, would add nearly $900 billion to his net worth, making him the world’s first trillionaire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this proposal faced lots of criticism, seeing as how it would make Musk, already the world’s richest person, the highest-paid CEO in the history of CEOs.

Many believe Tesla’s valuation and future success hinge on Musk staying as CEO, though the South African-born exec seems to believe his most important role will be being in control of the company’s forthcoming robot army. Either way, shareholders of the automaker voted overwhelmingly to ratify the pay package, with Musk celebrating in the only way he knows how: Next to his machines. From Reuters:

The proposal was approved with over 75% support, and Musk bounded to the stage of the company’s annual meeting at its factory in Austin, Texas, accompanied by dancing robots.

Musk, already the world’s richest person, could get as much as $1 trillion in stock over the next decade, although required payments would take the value down to $878 billion.

The vote is crucial for Tesla’s future and its valuation, which hangs on Musk’s vision of making vehicles that drive themselves, creating a robotaxi network across the U.S. and selling humanoid robots, even though his far-right political rhetoric has hurt the Tesla brand this year.

“What we are about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” Musk told a cheering group of shareholders.

[…]

“Other shareholder meetings are like snoozefests, but ours are bangers,” Musk said. “I mean, look at this. This is sick.”

It’s important to note that Tesla won’t just hand Musk $878 billion over the next decade. The package requires him to accomplish some incredibly lofty tasks, including growing Tesla’s stock value by eight times, deploying a million robotaxis, selling a million humanoid robots, selling 20 million more cars, growing full self-driving subscriptions to 10 million users, and increasing operating profits to $400 billion. As I said in my previous coverage of Musk’s pay proposal, doing all of that seems pretty impossible, considering Tesla’s reputation and aging lineup.

Toyota Still Can’t Get Its V6s Right

Last year, Toyota, widely known as builders of some of the most reliable, durable, and longest-lasting vehicles on the planet, caught a lot of flak for having to replace the engines in over 100,000 trucks and SUVs equipped with the company’s relatively new 3.4-liter twin-turbo V6.

Back then, Toyota said leftover machining debris from the factory was wreaking havoc on the V6’s internals, could could lead to engine knock and total engine shutdown. The company quickly reworked its manufacturing process, saying that any engine built after those deemed potentially faulty “were manufactured with new or improved processes that better clear machining debris.”

Well, it turns out that the new process wasn’t good enough, because Toyota is recalling even more V6s for the same problem. From the company’s website:

Toyota is conducting a safety recall involving certain model year 2022-2024 Toyota Tundra, 2022-2024 Lexus LX, and 2024 Lexus GX vehicles in North America. Approximately 127,000 Toyota- and Lexus-branded vehicles (conventional gas models only) are involved in this recall in the U.S.

There is a possibility that certain machining debris may not have been cleared from the engine when it was produced. In the involved vehicles, this can lead to potential engine knocking, engine rough running, engine no start, and/or a loss of motive power. A loss of motive power while driving at higher speeds can increase the risk of a crash.

Toyota says it’s “currently developing the remedy” for this problem, though if I had to guess, it’s probably just going to replace these engines like it did with the last bad batch. If I were an owner, that’s what I’d want. Even if an engine doesn’t immediately fail due to errant metal debris, I’d worry it could be enough to cause serious damage in the long term.

Can You Believe It? The Tesla Roadster Has Been Delayed Again

In what is undoubtedly the least surprising news of the week, the long-awaited Tesla Roadster 2.0 has been delayed for what feels the 37th time. This comes after reports that Musk had planned to show off the car by the end of this year. The new proposed reveal date isn’t inspiring much confidence. From TechCrunch:

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday the company will reveal the production version of its second-generation Roadster supercar on April 1, 2026 — nearly nine years after he first revealed the project.

Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said during Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting that he chose April Fools’ Day in part because it affords “some deniability.”

“Like, I could say I was just kidding” if it happens to be later, he said.

In some even more upsetting news for reservation-holders of the car, Musk went on to say that production of the Roadster won’t begin until 12 to 18 months after the reveal. So, at minimum, it won’t be until April 2027 that this car hits the road—nearly an entire decade since it was first revealed.

If Musk is to be believed, the production Roadster should, at least, be pretty different from the car we saw in 2017. From TechCrunch:

Musk stressed Thursday the car “will be very different from what was shown previously,” and again teased that the demo will be the “most exciting, whether it works or not, demo ever of any product” — a not-so-sly nod to the fact that he’s spent years trying to make the new Roadster fly in some fashion, possibly with SpaceX-built thrusters.

I’ll believe it when I see it (on the road, that is).

The violations were identified following a U.S. EPA inspection that found massive methane leaks at the facility.

Despite the violations, the landfill recently won approval for a controversial expansion from Benton County.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality has notified Coffin Butte Landfill’s owners it has identified seven serious violations of state and federal law at the site, most related to dangerous methane leaks.

DEQ found that the landfill’s gas collection system is not large enough to function properly and that it too often runs without an operating flare to prevent landfill gas from escaping uncombusted; that the company does not monitor for methane leaks as required, or fix methane leaks as quickly as required; and that it does not monitor for and fix tears in the surface cover.

In a pre-enforcement notice issued Nov. 6, DEQ warned owner Republic Services it may be cited and fined for the violations, and asked it to voluntarily take actions to correct the problems.

In its notice, DEQ states the company’s failure to control landfill gas emissions already has had significant environmental and public health impacts.

Phoenix-based Republic Services is the second-largest waste disposal company in the U.S. Company officials declined the Statesman Journal’s interview request.

In an emailed statement, spokeswoman Melissa Quillard said the company will work with DEQ on next steps.

“Much of the notice relates to older matters that have already been addressed"" or matters in the process of being addressed, Quillard wrote.

Quillard did not respond to a follow-up question about which violations have been or are in the process of being corrected, or what specific actions the company has taken.

DEQ’s enforcement action came more than three years after a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inspection found massive methane leaks at the facility, and less than 48 hours after the company won approval for a controversial expansion of the landfill, located just north of Corvallis.

DEQ expects to complete a formal enforcement order, with financial penalties, in early 2026, spokesman Dylan Darling said. That could also include enforceable orders to correct violations.

DEQ enforcing EPA case against Coffin Butte Landfill

Coffin Butte Landfill accepts waste from nearly two dozen Oregon counties and southwest Washington.

It takes most of Marion County’s and all of Polk County’s municipal waste, including some of the waste that previously went to the Reworld Marion incinerator in Brooks. Reworld stopped taking Marion County waste on Dec. 31, 2024.

The U.S. EPA has been investigating the landfill since its 2022 inspection. EPA monitored only a portion of the landfill and documented 61 methane exceedances, 21 of which were more than 20 times over the standard.

During a follow-up inspection in 2024, EPA again monitored only a portion of the landfill and found 41 methane exceedances.

EPA turned the case over to DEQ for enforcement in October 2025, Darling said.

EPA still could pursue its own enforcement action as well, he said.

Republic Services has repeatedly claimed, as far back as October 2023, that EPA had completed its investigation and that the company had already addressed all regulatory concerns.

Meanwhile, Republic Services has been pursuing a controversial expansion of the landfill.

Its first application for a conditional use permit to expand, in 2021, was denied unanimously by the Benton County Planning Commission.

In July 2024, the company came back with another, smaller proposal.

In July 2025, the planning commission again denied the proposal, saying the company had failed to prove the expansion would not seriously interfere with adjacent land uses, alter the character of the area or pose an undue burden on local services.

Republic Services then appealed the planning commission’s decision to the Benton County Commissioners, which decided on Nov. 4 to approve it with more than three dozen conditions.

Darling said the timing of the enforcement action was independent of the local planning decision and was based on when the case was turned over from EPA to DEQ.

DEQ identified 7 serious violations at Coffin Butte Landfill

DEQ’s pre-enforcement notice identified seven violations, all Class III, the most serious.

Two of the violations relate to methane monitoring.

DEQ found that, since 2022, Coffin Butte has exempted large areas of the landfill from required methane monitoring by claiming they were too dangerous or inaccessible to walk upon, in violation of state and federal rules.

It also found little evidence that Coffin Butte has performed remonitoring and repairs where methane exceedances were found, as required.

Four of the violations relate to the landfill’s gas collection and control system, which keeps methane and other gases from escaping to the environment.

DEQ found Coffin Butte used incorrect calculations in a 2021 amended design plan for the landfill, resulting in an undersized gas collection and control system. The company’s calculations did not include waste placed in the landfill before 1998, did not use total waste and did not use required model parameters.

DEQ found Coffin Butte failed to amend the design plan after installing a new enclosed flare in 2024.

It also found that Coffin Butte has reported extensive downtime events for its flares, but has not shut down the gas collection system during those events as required.

And it found that Coffin Butte failed to conduct monthly monitoring at each wellhead, as required. Monitoring for gauge pressure, temperature, nitrogen and oxygen help indicate the performance of the well, and results can require corrective action.

One of the violations relates to the integrity of the cover used where waste has been placed but is not at final grade. Maintaining the landfill cover helps minimize landfill gas leaks to the atmosphere.

DEQ found that while the company consistently reported conducting monthly inspections of the cover and finding no issues or holes, a 2024 EPA inspection found many holes and a significant number of trees, some of which were 3-feet tall, growing through the cover.

DEQ also noted, but didn’t identify as a violation, documented incidences of plumes of dust generated when loads are tipped into the landfill. The company’s air pollution permit requires it to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne.

Coffin Butte Landfill must hire experts, plan for drone technology

DEQ has asked the company to take the following voluntary corrective actions:

By Jan. 1, 2026:

Request a change to its air pollution permit that will allow it to use drone technology to monitor methane emissions. After the company makes the request, the process to change the permit, which includes public notice and comment, will take about six months, DEQ’s Darling said. Senate Bill 726, passed by the Oregon Legislature in June 2025, already requires Coffin Butte to use satellite, airflight or drone monitoring by Jan. 1, 2027.

Submit an operation and maintenance plan for the flare to ensure compliance.

By Feb. 1, 2026:

Submit a plan to update the landfill gas collection and control system that complies with state and federal requirements.

Have a third-party conduct an inspection of the entire landfill’s cover integrity, and submit the findings to DEQ.

Have a third-party conduct a study of fugitive dust control management and options for the landfill, and submit that along with a dust control plan, to DEQ.

Coffin Butte Landfill expansion set for final vote Nov. 17

Benton County Commissioners are scheduled to formally adopt their decision to allow the landfill to expand at a meeting beginning at 9 a.m. Nov. 17 at the county’s Kalapuya Building, at 4500 SW Research Way in Corvallis.

Opponents then will have 21 days to appeal the decision to the Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals, if they choose.

LUBA’s decision can be appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals.

TORONTO and SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Global Battery Materials Corp. (“Global Battery Materials” or “GB Materials” or the “Company“) has launched as a vertically integrated Critical Minerals and technology company. This new platform was created through the strategic combination of South Korea’s SongWoo EM Co., Ltd. and the Canadian assets of G6 Energy Corp. Backed by strategic and institutional investors, this new company is focused on rapidly building and scaling an independent, 100% ex-China supply chain for graphite-based anode materials—a core component for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) and grid energy storage.

The launch comes as demand for secure and transparent Critical Mineral supply chains accelerates across the global energy sector. Graphite, which makes up the largest portion of raw materials in every lithium-ion battery, is designated a Critical Mineral across North America, Europe, and Asia. Nearly 98 percent of global graphite processing is concentrated in China, creating significant strategic and economic risks. Recent Chinese export controls and U.S. anti-dumping measures underscore the urgency of developing robust domestic and allied sources of supply.

Renaud Adams, Chairman of Global Battery Materials, said:

Critical Minerals are at the heart of energy security and industrial strategy.

”We are bringing together proven assets in Tier 1 jurisdictions and experienced leadership to accelerate the development of a sustainable supply chain for graphite anode materials,”

GB Materials directly addresses this challenge by combining Canadian natural resource strength with South Korean process technology. This structure establishes a vertically integrated supply chain designed specifically for speed, cost efficiency, and resilience.

Canadian Operations

In Canada, GB Materials owns the Kearney Mine in Ontario—one of North America’s only previously producing natural graphite assets. The site features a high-quality mineral resource, substantial existing infrastructure, and government support. The Company is advancing a restart plan designed to deliver one of the sector’s fastest, lowest-cost paths to commercial-scale production.

South Korean Operations

In South Korea, GB Materials operates an advanced pilot plant and research center in Siheung, providing the technological foundation for its downstream operations. The facility utilizes patented processes to create anode materials that meet rigorous customer requirements. This process achieves high yields and consistent quality while simultaneously reducing the environmental impact. These materials are engineered to meet the high-performance standards required for electric mobility, grid-scale storage, defense, and AI infrastructure.

GB Materials is led by a seasoned management team, bringing deep global expertise in mining, advanced materials, and lithium-ion battery manufacturing.

Renaud Adams, Non-Executive Chairman, brings over 30 years of global mining leadership and currently serves as CEO of IAMGOLD Corp.

Eric Miller, Chief Executive Officer, has two decades of leadership in advanced manufacturing and automotive materials.

Ian McCallum, Chief Operating Officer – Materials, has nearly 30 years of experience in advanced materials and battery technology, and holds several lithium-ion patents.

Karl Trudeau, Chief Operating Officer – Mining, brings more than 20 years of specialized experience in sustainable graphite mining operations.

Eric Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GB Materials, said:

Graphite remains one of the most essential yet vulnerable materials in the energy transition.

” Our company was built to address the urgent need for a reliable supply of Critical Minerals,”

“By combining Canada’s resource base with Korea’s advanced processing expertise, we will bring practical and scalable solutions to the market.”

The Company anticipates production of active anode material to commence in 2028. By combining a prior producing, proven Canadian resource with leading-edge processing capabilities, GB Materials delivers a scalable, resilient, and de-risked solution for supplying graphite Critical Minerals in North America.

As the Hungarian minister said, “It is crucial for Hungary’s energy security to increase its nuclear energy capacities. And in order to do it, we need more nuclear fuel. Therefore, while maintaining our existing supplier relationships, we will also purchase American nuclear fuel elements for the first time in Hungarian energy history.”

“In addition, it is important that we store spent nuclear fuel elements safely, so that they cannot be harmful to the environment or health. We are purchasing the most modern American technology available, which will make it possible to store spent fuel elements safely at the Paks Nuclear Power Plant without having to transport them elsewhere,” he added.

The minister also touched on small modular reactors (SMRs) in bilateral cooperation, which will be able to cover the energy supply of a larger industrial area or city.

“So now we have these three areas: nuclear fuel elements, the proper storage of spent fuel elements, and small nuclear power plants. We have agreed on these three issues, and tomorrow we will sign a major intergovernmental nuclear energy cooperation agreement with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This adds a whole new dimension to Hungarian-American cooperation, namely nuclear cooperation. This is one of the most important agreements to be signed tomorrow.”

Péter Szijjártó also touched on the Paks expansion, reminding that this summer the Trump administration removed the Paks construction project from its sanctions list. This exemption is now valid until December. “I hope that tomorrow we will be able to agree on this, or receive a promise that the US government will extend the sanctions exemption for the Paks expansion. We have good reason to hope for this, because if they have already granted an exemption once, why wouldn’t they do so again?”

He noted that American companies are now participating in the Paks investment, as the digitisation of the Paks construction project is being carried out by an international consortium of three companies, one of which is Australian, one Hungarian, and the third American (IBM).

He noted that it is also important for the Americans to exempt Hungary from sanctions on the purchase of crude oil and natural gas.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-25-at-09.03.56.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 21:07:18.105816

The drop in consumer sentiment has tracked with persistent inflation and rising prices, driven in part by Trump’s tariffs and Republican-passed legislation.

As Americans’ concern about the state of the economy has grown, Trump’s has shown no interest in addressing it. He is too busy traveling the world, holding a lavish Great Gatsby party with wealthy friends at Mar-A-Lago as SNAP funding lapsed, and getting a fancy ballroom and bathroom at the White House to pay attention to the needs of American families. Trump is completely out of touch with working families, and shows no interest in addressing skyrocketing health care costs, or in ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

The very next day, the Texas Secretary of State’s office announced that the number of registered business entities in Texas has surpassed 3 million.","This week, Texans overwhelmingly approved 17 new amendments to the Texas Constitution, including several measures that will supercharge our state’s rapid economic growth and secure long-term prosperity for all Texans.

I’m fond of saying Texas has the best business environment in the galaxy, but now we’re on track to be the best business environment in the universe.

Combined with critical legislation passed during the regular session, including a permanent extension of the R&D tax credit, robust funding in key sectors like space, semiconductors and advanced nuclear power, as well as record investment in education and infrastructure, the propositions approved by Texas voters this week stand to make the Lone Star State’s business environment even stronger, attracting even more people, companies, and entrepreneurs from across the nation and world.

Proposition 1 invests $850 million from the state’s general revenue to fund job-training programs and expansion projects at Texas State Technical College (TSTC), one of the state’s leading producers of skilled workers. This is a win not just for employers, but also for taxpayers and hardworking Texas families who stand to benefit from good-paying, stable jobs.

Proposition 2 permanently bans a state capital gains tax, ensuring Texans will no longer have to pay a tax on profits from selling any asset – including stocks, real estate, and other investments. This proposition will cement Texas’ pro-investment advantage and attract startups, venture capital, and high-growth firms that create jobs and inject massive growth into the Texas economy.

Proposition 4 creates a $1 billion annual state sales tax revenue dedication to the Texas Water Fund, starting in 2027, allowing for an allocation of up to $20 billion toward our state’s long-term water infrastructure needs – including expanding our water supply portfolio, fixing aging systems, and building flood protection projects. This proposition does not increase the current state sales tax rate but instead allows the Legislature to dedicate existing state sales tax revenues to the Texas Water Fund.

Proposition 6 prohibits the state from creating any new taxes on stock or securities trades, which protects investors and entrepreneurs and positions Texas to dominate the competition in financial services sector, particularly compared to high-tax states like New York, where the threat of re-imposing taxes on stock transactions is ever-present. This amendment makes Texas an unrivalled destination for financial institutions, brokers, and dealers, while protecting investments that support Texans’ retirement accounts and pensions from additional taxes.

Proposition 7 authorizes the Texas Legislature to enact a property tax cut for surviving spouses of fallen veterans. For families of our brave servicemembers who have made the ultimate sacrifice, Texas should relieve property tax burdens as much as possible, allowing them to keep their homes without fear of being forced to sell.

Proposition 8 bans estate, inheritance, and gift taxes, allowing family businesses and farms to grow and pass on wealth to the next generation without fear of penalty. Though Texas does not currently have an inheritance tax, this amendment ensures lawmakers cannot impose one in future legislative sessions, providing certainty and clarity for those who are carefully planning for financial stability for their children and grandchildren.

Proposition 9 eliminates the small business inventory tax and creates a $125,000 personal property tax exemption for small businesses that keep inventory – including for their products, storage, equipment, vehicles, and other property used for business operations. Under the previous ‘inventory tax,’ small business owners would have to pay taxes each year on any inventory valued at $2,500 or more. Proposition 9 was a key measure that came from our work on Governor Abbott’s Small Business Freedom Council this session.

Proposition 11 increases the school homestead exemption for seniors – Texans 65 years of age or older – and Texans with disabilities from $10,000 to $60,000, allowing greater financial flexibility for Texans who may have complex medical needs and transportation challenges, which is especially important for those who live on fixed incomes.

Proposition 14 establishes the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT) as a permanent state institution, injecting $3 billion of existing general revenue funds into dementia and neurodegenerative disease research without requiring an increase in taxes.

But before the polls even closed on Election Day, Texas was announced as the nation’s top business climate for the third year in a row by Site Selection Magazine, which cited “no corporate tax, sensible business regulations, business-dedicated courts, unbeatable logistics infrastructure and a huge labor force, among other factors” as the reason for our state’s success.

The very next day, the Texas Secretary of State’s office announced that the number of registered business entities in Texas has surpassed 3 million. Secretary Jane Nelson affirmed this milestone “demonstrates the strong confidence the business community has in our state, and there are no signs of this trend slowing down.”

By continuing to work together with our state leadership, legislators, and Texas voters who hold our state’s future in their hands, we have been able to achieve new heights in cultivating a pro-business environment that is second to none.

When it comes to creating jobs, attracting investment, and growing prosperity, Texans know that policy matters, and voters took important steps this week to ensure the Texas economy remains the envy of every other state in the nation.

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world’s most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, being showcased Friday at the COP30 climate summit, provides political support for expanding biofuels and relatively low-emission hydrogen-based fuels. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

India’s rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India’s northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

Mann said prices for sugarcane have also dropped this year. He said it’s good that the government is tackling climate change, but it should put farmers and their prices ahead of ethanol mandates.

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India’s ethanol, but that’s beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP. “With the push for E20 blends or even more, a lot more area has to be cultivated which in turn means it’ll be replacing other crops,” she said.

Balancing India’s needs

Climate experts said biofuel production can have minimal environmental impact when it’s made from waste or inedible vegetation and processed in facilities that run on clean energy. But when crops are grown explicitly for biofuels, it has a higher carbon footprint because of the fertilizer and fuel involved.

India’s ethanol strategy is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions, cut oil imports and boost agriculture, said Purva Jain, an energy specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But she said a faster transition to infrastructure for electric vehicles might be better. A 2022 study by her organization found that installing solar power for EV charging can be a much more efficient land use than growing crops for biofuel.

However, ethanol producers have invested significant sums in manufacturing and need a steady, growing market for their product now, said CK Jain, president of the Grain Ethanol Manufacturers Association. He said India should increase the percentage of ethanol mixed with gas and encourage the sale of compatible vehicles.

“We need to have higher blending as soon as possible, otherwise the industry will go into deep financial trouble,” Jain said.

Other experts advocated for a middle ground.

A 10% blend of ethanol with gasoline, can be a “win-win” solution said Natarajan of CSTEP. She said that would allow for use of existing crops without putting too much pressure on increased cultivation.

Khare, the YouTube influencer, said keeping lower blends available would help older vehicles.

“The government can bring E20 or even up to E85 programs on top of that, that’s completely fine. But consumers need to be given the option,” he said.

Today, we're diving deep into one of Detroit's biggest challenges and, possibly, its greatest opportunity: what to do with our city's vast tracts of vacant land.

Since 1950, Detroit has lost 65% of its population, creating more than 100,000 vacant lots and 18 square miles of unused land.

Right now, the city spends more than $1.3 million each year just mowing the grass on these empty parcels, among other costs.

But what if these vacant lots were transformed into something new? Parks, forests, community gardens, and green spaces that could help stabilize neighborhoods, improve health and safety, and help us adapt to a changing climate?

That's the question at the heart of the latest report from Detroit Future City: ""Saving for the Future.""

To break this all down, I'm joined by two key voices behind the report. Kimberly Faisson, Vice President for Thriving, Resilient Neighborhoods, and Sarah Hayosh, Director of Land Use and Sustainability at Detroit Future City.

We'll talk about how a dedicated land conservancy could be a game-changer for Detroit, what the research says about green space and community health, and the practical steps ahead to make this vision real.

Though the gas tax charged per gallon increases along with inflation, the percentage of drivers buying gas and paying gas tax is decreasing amid the green energy transition.
In Carson City, the gas tax dilemma has transportation officials making difficult decisions about what to prioritize.
Nevada is one of only a handful of states to not charge an additional annual registration fee on electric vehicles.","In Nevada's capital city, some local roads are beyond repair. One can walk out onto Spooner Drive in Carson City and pick up chunks of asphalt that are flaking away.

""The asphalt's failing. It's crumbling, pieces are falling out, you can literally pick pieces out of the ground if you wanted to and hold them in your hand,"" said Chris Martinovic, transportation manager for Carson City public works.

This is one of the worst roads in Carson City.

The problem of deteriorating streets is not unique to Carson City — it's an issue municipalities across the Silver State face as the primary funding source for road construction and maintenance lags further behind the need.

How are roads funded?

All drivers of gas-powered and hybrid cars pay gas tax, which is approximately 57 cents per gallon in Washoe County, according to the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County.

Though the gas tax charged per gallon increases along with inflation, the percentage of drivers buying gas and paying gas tax is decreasing amid the green energy transition.

There was a 407% increase in electric vehicle registrations in Washoe County from June 2020 to June 2024, according to the recent 'Bridging the Gap' report from the Guinn Center, a nonpartisan think tank.

As Teslas and Rivians start to become a greater share of the vehicles on our roads, the main revenue source for road building and repairs is struggling to keep up with the cost of roadwork.

In Carson City, the gas tax dilemma has transportation officials making difficult decisions about what to prioritize. Roads like Spooner Drive may never be repaved.

""At the moment, there's no anticipated plan to replace it,"" Martinovic said.

We don't have enough money to keep up with all the needs in Carson City, so our focus tends to be keeping the roads good and the good pavement in better condition. It's cheaper to maintain than it is to reconstruct.

Policy solutions

So what can be done to address this growing problem? The Guinn Center recently commissioned a 49-page report for RTC that examined the policies passed and implemented in other U.S. states. Nevada is one of only a handful of states to not charge an additional annual registration fee on electric vehicles.

""39 states throughout the country at least charge an additional registration fee for electric vehicles,"" said Mark Krmpotic, author of the report and The Guinn Center's interim director of economic and fiscal policy.

Krmpotic told News 4-Fox 11 that of the many solutions researchers analyzed, the additional EV registration fee makes the most sense for Nevada. Fees in other states range from $50 to $250.

""The registration fee might be a fairly equitable solution. It's also less costly to implement. If you look at an agency like the Department of Motor Vehicles that currently collects the registration fee, they may not incur as much cost to implement it. And it may be a timelier implementation as well,"" he said.

Other commonly used fees might be harder to enact or less fair, he said. For example, a vehicle miles traveled tax would charge EV owners a per mile fee capped at a certain amount, but would require a third-party vendor and extensive training and programming.

Additionally, a tax on public electric vehicle charging stations is another possibility, but that option doesn't capture drivers who charge their vehicles at home.

All three policies, Krmpotic said, would require a two-thirds vote of both chambers of the Nevada legislature because they would alter the state's tax structure or raise revenue.

Legislation to charge electric vehicle owners more for road construction budgets hasn't been introduced since 2019. Senator James Settelmeyer sponsored a measure to enact a 10% surcharge on electric vehicle charging ports, with the revenue generated going to Nevada's highway fund.

Carson City's attempt

In the 2024 election, Carson City voters were asked to consider two ballot measures intended to raise revenue for road construction and maintenance.

One would've increased the sales and use tax by .25%. Another would've imposed a small supplemental government services tax on car sales. Though the measures didn't specifically single out electric vehicles, all the money generated would've been allocated to a special road fund.

Both measures failed by wide margins, with less than a third of Carson City residents voting in favor of the measures.

Possible consequences

In lieu of a solution, municipalities are left grappling with the potential consequences down the line as the transition to electric vehicles continues.

""In Carson City, it looks pretty bleak. Most roads will be similar to what we see here on Spooner,"" Martinovic said.

We've even talked about, well, what do we do for some of those rural roads? Do we grind them up and turn them back to dirt?

""Because if there's not asphalt to maintain, we don't have that cost associated with maintaining it,"" he said.

NOTABLE OBITUARIES

Eleanor “Ellie” Boda

1934 – 2025

Eleanor “Ellie” Boda, who taught generations of students as an adjunct instructor of flute at Furman, passed away on June 17, 2025.

Boda received her Bachelor of Music degree from the Eastman School of Music. She was an elementary music educator in the Greenville County, South Carolina, public schools before teaching at Furman. Boda was a longtime musician in the Greenville Symphony playing flute and piccolo, and played both in the Brevard Music Center Orchestra for many summer seasons.

Boda and her husband Dan, a professor emeritus of music, were fixtures in the Furman library and around campus and loved to travel internationally. Ellie imparted a deep appreciation for music to her students, many of whom went on to stellar careers performing and teaching music.

The couple founded the Daniel and Eleanor Boda String Player Scholarship, the Eleanor and Daniel Boda Flutist Scholarship, the Daniel and Eleanor Boda Scholarship for Orchestral Conducting and the Eleanor and Daniel Boda Scholarship for Music Education. These scholarships have been set up in perpetuity and are awarded to students annually. They will continue the Boda family legacy of keeping music and the arts alive in future generations.

Ellie, whose husband Dan died in June 2024, is survived by two children and four grandchildren.

Philip Elliott Jr.

1934 – 2024

Philip “Phil” Elliott Jr. ’56, professor emeritus of English, passed away on Oct. 23, 2024.

Elliott earned his undergraduate degree at Furman and later pursued his master’s at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Georgia and teaching at Stetson University, Clemson University and North Carolina Wesleyan University, Elliott returned to Furman and joined the faculty in 1967.

During his 32-year tenure, Elliott was known to engage colleagues and students in meaningful conversations about complex issues. His students also held him in high regard as a challenging, enthusiastic teacher. He was known to be a conscientious advisor with high standards who would lend a supportive ear.

Elliott’s publications included articles in “Victorian Poetry” and a book, “The Making of the Memoir,” first published in 1978 and reissued in 1995. The latter is considered a major work of Tennyson scholarship. Elliott served as interim chair of the English department, editor of the Furman Catalog and faculty advisor for the student newspaper, “The Paladin,” and was a valued contributor on numerous university committees.

Phil is survived by his wife, Kacky, two children, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Lon Knight Jr.

1944 – 2025

Lon Knight Jr., Charles Ezra Daniel Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, passed away on May 2, 2025.

After completing his undergraduate degree at Mercer University, Knight earned his Ph.D. from the University of Florida. He joined Furman’s faculty in 1971 and served for 48 years.

Knight was known as a consummate scholar. During his first 30 years at Furman, he averaged more than three publications per year in top journals. In 1989, Knight became the fourth recipient of the American Chemical Society Award for Research at an Undergraduate Institution and was widely recognized as one of the top scientists in the world in the field of electron spin resonance. His body of work was completed largely with the assistance of undergraduate students and with highly sophisticated instruments designed and built by Knight himself.

In 1981, Knight became chair of the chemistry department, a role he held for 33 years. Under his leadership, the department grew into one of the best equipped and most productive undergraduate chemistry programs in the country.

Knight also wrote and received multiple highly competitive grants. Of particular significance was his leadership in creating the Kresge Endowment that provides critical maintenance support for the chemistry department’s extensive equipment holdings. His key role in the design and construction of the Charles H. Townes Science Center was transformational across the sciences at Furman.

In 2006, Knight received the Alester G. Furman Jr. and Janie Earle Furman Meritorious Teaching Award. Knight retired in 2019. He is survived by his wife, Marian, three daughters and two grandchildren.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, petroleum is a fossil fuel created from ancient plants, algae, and microorganism remains buried under layers of sediment and rock.

Over millions of years, heat and pressure transformed the organic matter into crude oil and natural gas. It's a process that's well documented by geology and chemistry.

The post, shared to r/confidentlyincorrect, shows a Facebook comment about green energy that quickly went off the rails. One participant insisted that oil doesn't come from ancient plants and marine life decomposing underground over millions of years. They instead thought it ""forms naturally in the Earth's mantle.""

Commenters were quick to point out that the claim simply isn't backed by modern science.

In the 1950s, researchers explored the ""abiogenic petroleum"" theory mentioned by the OP in the comments. The theory proposes that oil is formed deep within Earth's mantle without any biological material. However, decades of data have shown that nearly all commercially extracted petroleum is biological in origin.

Modern evidence, from carbon isotopes to fossilized biomarkers, confirm that oil comes from living organisms and not deep mantle chemistry.

Knowing how petroleum actually forms matters because it helps scientists and policymakers plan for cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. The planet's oil reserves are finite. Relying on them continues to have serious health and environmental costs.

Investing in renewable energy sources helps reduce pollution and dependence on fuels that take millions of years to form.

As someone who has spent much of my career working to bring opportunities to Indiana’s rural communities, I’ve seen firsthand the transformative power of renewable energy. The conversation about wind, solar and battery storage is more than sustainability and grid diversification. It’s about more than jobs, tax revenue and keeping Indiana competitive in a rapidly changing economy. The clean-energy conversation is about how we best serve our communities, our landowners and our people.

Here in Warren County, the Jordan Creek Wind Farm has been an incredible success for keeping our government well-funded so it can better serve our residents. The project put $6.7 million into the Jordan Creek fund over the last three years for our local government. This is increasing our local tax revenue, which is funding schools, road improvements and essential services without raising property taxes on residents. Warren County’s annual operating budget for 2025 is $12.2 million. It’s easy math to see the wind farm’s immediate impact, but it’s almost impossible to believe that an energy project could do so much for us.

Clean-energy projects start generating positive outcomes for their communities as soon as they start construction, and they continue to do so for years after they begin operation.

I look at the impact that the project is having on our local generational farm landowners. In today’s economy, a corn planter can cost more than a quarter of a million dollars, and an upgrade on that machine can cost almost $100,000. The confidence that comes from knowing that the annual payment from wind farms on a farmer’s property will help offset a significant portion of those costs is remarkable.

Clean energy has the power not only to keep farms viable but also to enable them to be more profitable and to survive the current depressed grain prices. The annual land lease payment income does more than just assist in affording farm equipment. Landowners don’t have to save for years just to take a trip to see their grandchildren. That’s all thanks to the checks coming in from energy projects on their land—checks that keep coming for years over the life of a lease agreement.

These projects mean new life for rural communities that have faced decades of population decline and shrinking tax bases. During construction, these projects create hundreds of jobs, from heavy equipment operators to electricians and engineers. The operations and maintenance roles they leave behind are well-paid, stable careers that don’t require leaving your hometown. In a state where too many young people feel they have had to move away to find good jobs, renewable energy is helping keep Hoosiers at home.

We all know farming isn’t for everyone, and these types of clean-energy careers offer new options, new opportunities and new futures for those who want to stay in Indiana but can’t find an alternative vocation that allows them to support their community.

The economic benefits extend far beyond the project site. Local restaurants feed construction crews, hardware stores see more sales, and hotels stay booked. Renewable-energy development has a ripple effect that touches nearly every corner of the community.

It is frustrating that despite all these benefits, Indiana’s ability to grow its renewable energy capacity is being held back by a patchwork of local siting rules that make it unnecessarily difficult to build. Every project must navigate a maze of differing ordinances, setbacks and permitting processes under rules that can vary widely from one county to the next.

This uncertainty drives up costs, delays construction and in some cases forces projects to break ground in other states. We need a smarter approach that respects local input but also establishes clear, consistent standards that make Indiana a welcoming place for renewable investment.

Expanding our renewable-energy portfolio is more than an important step in securing a stronger Indiana; it’s a necessary one. Indiana farmers have been supporting our communities, state and country for decades, and these wind and solar farms are now starting to return the favor. Energy development gives me hope that Indiana will be able to continue its agriculture heritage long into the future.•",https://i0.wp.com/myrenewableresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MRR-Logo-150-100.png?fit=150100&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-07 21:07:12.512851

Fossil fuel production is still increasing, driving up planet-warming pollution; the United States is in climate denial mode; and turbulent geopolitics have pushed the climate crisis down the agenda and into the culture wars.

But there’s another, more hopeful, story unfolding simultaneously: the exponential rise of clean energy. Countries around the world are adding renewables at a blistering pace — and this surge is happening in some surprising places. Experts say it could herald the start of a new energy age, powered by the sun and wind.

In the first half of 2025, for the first time ever, renewables overtook coal as the top source of global electricity — a major milestone, according to analysts. How the world gets its electricity is hugely important; the energy sector is the largest source of global emissions, and clean electricity is also key to decarbonizing transportation, another heavily polluting industry.

This clean energy surge is set to increase exponentially as wind, solar and batteries become cheaper and easier to install than fossil fuels.

Global renewable power capacity is projected to double over the next five years, increasing by 4,600 gigawatts (GW) — roughly the same as adding the total power generating capacity of China, the European Union and Japan, according to a recent International Energy Agency report.

“There is no going back,” Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at climate think tank Ember, told CNN.

Yet despite the pace, some experts say much more is needed. Renewables aren’t supplanting planet-heating fossil fuels in many countries because energy demand is growing so rapidly. That means planet heating pollution levels are still rising and every bit of warming translates to more catastrophic climate outcomes.

Transforming the entire power sector to clean energy isn’t yet inevitable, said Hannah Pitt, a director at the nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group, where she oversees international energy research. “We don’t have it in the bag,” she told CNN.

Big polluters are turning to solar, even if they aren’t quitting fossil fuels yet

After spending decades pumping planet-heating carbon into the atmosphere to grow their economies, the world’s most-polluting countries are increasingly turning to clean energy. One of the big reasons is economics: renewables are getting cheaper and cheaper. Low-cost solar, in particular, is driving the clean energy boom.

China has been described as the “first electrostate.” No other country comes close on renewables; last year, it installed more wind and solar power in just one year than the total amount of renewable energy currently operating in the United States.

By the end of last year, China had installed more than 1,400 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity and it’s not stopping there; another 500 gigawatts of clean energy is currently being built.

The US, in contrast, is pulling back on renewables as President Donald Trump seeks to strangle clean energy projects, but even that hasn’t stopped the renewable energy march. Wind and solar installations account for the vast majority of new power coming online. The US ranks second globally in new solar growth after China, according to Ember data.

The current clean energy boom in the US is, in part, driven by businesses rushing to take advantage of Biden-era clean energy tax credits before they expire. But even without federal tax credits, solar, batteries and onshore wind are some of the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to install.

India, the planet’s most populous nation, is also setting new records on renewables; it is one of the leading developing countries for new solar and wind capacity, according to a report from BloombergNEF. And the EU, which has plenty of policies favoring clean energy, aims to generate nearly 43% of its energy from renewables by the end of the decade.

That’s not to say the planet’s biggest emitters have given up on fossil fuels.

In China — the world biggest climate polluter by far — new coal production reached a ten year high last year, according to one analysis. Having released a tepid climate goal for the next decade, it remains to be seen how much its emissions fall, especially as demand for power accelerates.

The US is relying more on coal-fired power, leading to an increase in its planet-heating pollution, according to Ember’s recent report, and India is turning to fossil fuels to help power its exponential growth. The EU saw a slight uptick in fossil fuel generation this year to compensate for both falling wind power generation and declining hydropower due to lingering drought.

The surprising countries that are going all out on renewables

The world’s biggest polluters matter because of their sheer size and climate footprint. But equally important, experts say, is the pollution trajectory of smaller economies — many in the global south — which are hungry for energy and growing rapidly.

There is a shift toward renewables in countries across South America, Africa, southeast Asia and the Middle East, in many cases helped by the flood of cheap solar panels, batteries and wind turbine components from China, which dominates the world in clean tech manufacturing.

“We’ve seen the world starting to benefit from that scale, enabling these emerging economies to seize the opportunity to really leap-frog into the next energy era,” said Lars Nitter Havro, who leads energy macro research at Norwegian-headquartered firm Rystad Energy.

Nepal, for example, has gone from barely having any electric vehicles just a few years ago, to EVs making up nearly 76% of all new vehicles thanks to imports of battery-powered cars from China. The Himalayan country relies heavily on clean energy, using its abundant hydropower resources to power its grid.

Some countries are pulling off stunningly fast energy transitions, adding solar so rapidly, it’s become a major source of electricity over the course of years — not decades.

Pakistan, Chile, Greece and Hungary are among those charging ahead.

A decade ago, Hungary had next to no solar power but it’s seen a rapid boom. Led by a far-right authoritarian government, the country has nevertheless encouraged rooftop and utility-scale solar through a mix of government rebates and relaxed regulations.

Chile has been installing vast amounts of solar in its remote Atacama Desert, while Greece has also seen a major boom as solar panels are installed on its Mediterranean hills and islands.

Perhaps the most startling surge is in Pakistan, which is experiencing one of the fastest solar revolutions in the world. In just six years, the share of solar in its power mix went from zero to 30%. Pakistan’s surge is “preposterous,” said Havro. “This is the tipping point. Things are starting to unfold faster than many foresaw in the past.”

However, building renewables alone isn’t the whole picture. Countries also need to work on better connecting intermittent renewables — those which work only when the sun shines or the wind blows — with batteries that can store their energy.

Some analysts caution that the coal, oil and gas aren’t going away in many places. “A lot of fossil power technologies continue to play a really meaningful role (in developing countries), even growing in our projection going through 2050,” Rhodium’s Pitt said. “Renewables have an even bigger job to do in keeping pace with that economic growth in order to really keep driving down emissions,” she added.

Rystad has a more optimistic view, because renewables are often the cheapest option. “In countries where there isn’t any entrenched pre-existing (fossil fuel) infrastructure that’s hard to replace, we do see more of a leapfrog dynamic unfolding,” Rystad’s Havro said.

Developing countries could be poised to race past the world’s biggest economies on renewables, demonstrating a new era of clean energy, said Ember’s Wiatros-Motyka. “You cannot stop it now.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2224649264.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-07 16:07:39.234630

Balancing Act: Delivering Resiliency and Decarbonization with Integrated Resources

As U.S. power demand accelerates at an unprecedented pace, the conversation around our energy mix is fundamentally shifting. The old paradigm that marginalized renewables as “alternative energy” is obsolete. Now, the industry is moving beyond a simple competition between resources and toward a more integrated strategy where natural gas and renewables are no longer just competitors, but partners.

Upcoming Webinar

The New Health Data Laws Every Retailer Must Know

Speakers: Paul Schmeltzer and John Howard

November 12, 2025 | 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM (ET)

Click here to register.

State laws like Washington’s My Health My Data Act and Nevada’s SB 370 are redefining what counts as health data—casting a wide net over common retail signals such as location, browsing behavior, loyalty IDs, and ad tags when linked to sensitive topics like pregnancy, fertility, contraception, or even vitamins.

In this essential session, we’ll break down the fast-evolving compliance landscape, including:

Consent requirements

Geofencing bans

Sensitive data sale rules

Vendor contracting

California’s new ADMT/AI rules and their impact on product recommendations and fraud screening

Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how these laws affect advertising, analytics, and data monetization, as well as actionable insights for retailers on how to adapt data practices and mitigate risk in a rapidly shifting regulatory environment.

Alcohol Law

Can Distilleries Ship Spirits Direct-to-Consumer in California? California’s New Spirits Shipping Law Explained

Michael Laszlo and Jason Canvasser authored an article, “Can Distilleries Ship Spirits Direct-to-Consumer in California? California’s New Spirits Shipping Law Explained.”

Yes, as of January 1, 2026, distilleries will be permitted to ship spirits direct-to-consumer in California under the state’s groundbreaking new alcohol shipping law, Assembly Bill 1246, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Oct. 3rd. This landmark legislation creates a one-year pilot program that could fundamentally reshape spirits distribution in the nation’s largest consumer market. Distilleries must act quickly to understand compliance requirements and prepare for this significant market opportunity.

The law goes into effect on January 1, 2026, and expires January 1, 2027—giving the industry exactly one year to demonstrate compliance and viability.

Construction

An Owner’s Checklist When Embarking on a Construction Project

Ted Degenhardt and Scott Garbo authored an article, “An Owner’s Checklist When Embarking on a Construction Project.”

Even the most sophisticated owners can become overwhelmed when embarking on a new construction project. Whether the project is new construction or a renovation, any construction project is loaded with risks for the owner. The best and most cost-effective way to limit these risks is to address the issues at the beginning of the project. To this end, this article provides a high-level checklist to guide owners on construction projects. While this checklist is by no means exhaustive, it will provide owners with a good start to ensuring the project proceeds smoothly.

The California Opt Me Out Act: What it Means for Businesses Subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act

Melissa Ventrone and John Howard authored an article, “The California Opt Me Out Act: What it Means for Businesses Subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act.”

On Oct. 8, California Governor Gavin Newsom, signed the California Opt Me Out Act (“AB566”) into law. AB566 amends the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) by requiring companies that develop or maintain internet browsers to create an opt-out preference signal (“OOPS”) that will allow consumers to configure it to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information. The new law intends to allow consumers to use the OOPS to communicate their preferences without having to do so on every website they visit.

NY Algorithmic Pricing Act Withstands First Amendment Challenge

Myriah Jaworski, Chirag Patel, and Ali Blook authored an article, “NY Algorithmic Pricing Act Withstands First Amendment Challenge.”

In June 2025, New York enacted a series of new consumer protection requirements as part of the Transportation, Economic Development and Environmental Conservation Article VII Legislation section of the FY 2026 New York State Executive Budget (the “Ted Bill”).

The Ted Bill included the Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act (“the Act”), a mandatory disclosure requirement for covered companies that use algorithmic-driven dynamic pricing. We covered the specific requirements of the Act in our prior June 2025 article.

AI Raises the Bar for Alcohol Advertising Standards

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has published the results of a world-leading trial using artificial intelligence to monitor alcohol advertising, finding that around 96% of ads are likely to comply with industry rules.

While compliance across alcohol brands was high, the alcohol-free sector showed more frequent issues. Nearly half (48%) of alcohol-free product ads were flagged for potential breaches, primarily due to unclear or missing ABV labelling. Click here to read more.

ESG & Sustainability

Truth in Green Advertising: Lessons from a $1.5-Million Class Action Settlement

Kraig Jennett and Maram Salaheldin authored an article, “Truth in Green Advertising: Lessons from a $1.5-Million Class Action Settlement.”

As customers increasingly demand more sustainable products, companies understandably want to meet that demand. However, overstating or misrepresenting the sustainability of their products or services can come with a steep cost, including financial and reputational harm. Even the best intentions can face legal challenges, but adequate substantiation and legal review can help reduce the risk. This settlement offers several important lessons for companies that want to make green marketing claims about their products or services.

Food Labeling

Texas Proposes Regulation Implementing Warning Label Requirement

The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has published its proposed rule (see p. 29, 50 TexReg 6301) implementing The “Make Texas Healthy Again” law (SB25) that was signed in June 2025, as we previously blogged. The law includes a provision requiring on-pack warning labels for food and beverage products that contain any of 44 listed substances, including certified food colors and titanium dioxide.

UPF Food Labeling is Coming – But in What Form?

Ultra-processed foods could soon be immediately recognizable front-of-pack. Click here to read more.

California to Require Food Allergen Labels on Menus by 2026

Starting in 2026, restaurant chains in California will be required to list major food allergens on their menus in a first-of-its-kind law.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill Monday, making California the first state to require allergen labeling for restaurants with 20 or more locations.

Under the new law, menus must identify items containing milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy or sesame — the most common allergens — when restaurants know or “reasonably should know” those ingredients are present. Click here to read more.

U.S. Expands Section 232 Tariffs to Wood Products

Mark Ludwikowski, Kevin Williams, Aristeo Lopez, Kelsey Christensen, and Laura Quesada authored an article, “U.S. Expands Section 232 Tariffs to Wood Products.”

On Sept. 29, President Trump issued a Proclamation expanding Section 232 tariffs to cover imports of timber, lumber, and their derivative products. These include common household products such as cabinets, vanities, and certain furniture products.

Labor & Employment

HR By the Numbers: Thresholds for Employer Coverage

Jonathan Vegosen authored an article, “HR By the Numbers: Thresholds for Employer Coverage.”

Given recent developments in labor and employment laws, employers may wish to review whether certain laws apply to them based on their current employee counts and whether they have appropriate policies and practices in place to comply with them. Click here to review a summary of certain federal and Illinois laws that may be of interest.

Litigation

The Ubiquitous Nature of PFAS Regulation and Litigation

Ashley Buck authored an article, “The Ubiquitous Nature of PFAS Regulation and Litigation.”

Litigation surrounding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), commonly referred to as “forever chemicals,” seems to be as ubiquitous as PFAS allegedly is. Days ago, on Sept. 29, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a lawsuit brought in August 2024 by, among others, Texas farmers, which alleged the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) failure to regulate PFAS in treated sewage sludge used as fertilizer (also known as biosolids) violates federal law, namely, the Clean Water Act.

I really did enjoy my internship this summer with the North Carolina Resources Commission and recommend working with them to any student looking for a place to flourish and grow.","My internship started at 10 pm the night before my first day with my roommates. We decided to go and scout out my parking spot for my first day that night because of how much first day jitters I was having. I was so nervous to start my internship at the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. I knew how important the agency was to the entirety of North Carolina. They protect and conserve our state’s wildlife and I was so excited to be a part of something bigger than myself. My internship was with their policy and analysis division but I worked closely with their wildlife education division as well. The policy and analysis division completes tasks like program development and evaluation which is what I participated in, as well as many other things such as surveys of constituents, and rule making.

The program evaluation that I worked on this summer was for their volunteer program. Before this internship I had an interest in volunteering specifically with conservation and environmental groups so when I saw the opportunity I jumped at it. This experience has shown me that I have a real passion for how our communities tie in with the greater conservation need. I want to continue to participate in volunteer programs like the one at NCWRC as part of the team behind the coordination as well as part of the team on the ground. Volunteering is a great way to connect with and give back to your community; and when you are volunteering for conservation you are giving back on an even larger scale. As for the responsibilities during my internship I worked on creating a logic model, an annotated bibliography, three interview guides, completing 24 interviews with various staff members and volunteers, and generating a final report of my findings.

At first the office aspect of my internship was hard for me to get used to because I am such an outdoorsy person. I spend most of my time out in nature so getting used to office work was something that took time. However, my supervisor and fellow interns made the office an entertaining learning environment where I built life long connections. My supervisor also set up outside of the office learning experiences for me to get out of the office and learn about different divisions and aspects of the agency. Overall I enjoyed the internship with NCWRC greatly and learned so much throughout my experience. I developed a logic model for the first time to show the agency a visual representation of how the volunteer program’s intended work leads to real conservation results. I also was able to talk to so many different people from different walks of life that gave me different perspectives on conservation. Such as how hunting and shooting sports connect to conservation which I had no previous knowledge about.

My favorite part of the internship was being able to connect with so many people on something I was really passionate about. The entire summer didn’t feel like a job because of how much enjoyment I got out of meeting and discussing conservation and volunteering with various different people. Each day was different and brought up new challenges for me to figure out and overcome, even if that challenge was figuring out the printer.

From here I learned that I may want to do something more outside for my career. However, I definitely want a career that pushes me like this internship I had and that contributes to conservation on a large scale. The feeling of knowing I was participating in something that was going to make real change felt empowering. I can see myself looking for jobs within this agency and companies like it after graduation. I really did enjoy my internship this summer with the North Carolina Resources Commission and recommend working with them to any student looking for a place to flourish and grow.",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/fer/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/11/Jenna.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 18:20:34.340268

According to rankings by Business Facilities Magazine, it secured the No. 1 spot for the third year in a row in 2025, thanks to its favorable tax environment (including no personal income tax), a large and skilled workforce, infrastructure capable of supporting growth and strong appeal to corporate expansion — more than 1,300 qualified investment projects were reported for 2024. At the same time, in the annual survey by CNBC of 2025, Texas ranked No. 2 overall, with particular strength in workforce quality and innovation metrics but scored lower in quality of life categories. In short, Texas’s consistent top tier ranking signals to businesses that it remains a highly competitive environment for growth, though states also must continue improving ancillary factors such as livability and long term infrastructure to maintain that edge.

Additionally, Maryland imposed a new 3 percent sales tax on data, IT, and other business-to-business services. These measures pushed Maryland down one spot overall to 46th and dropping five places on the sales tax measure (from 35th to 40th), underscoring the state’s growing tax burden relative to other states.",https://sbybiz.org/app/uploads/2023/02/maryland-chamber-of-commerce-logo.png,N,,2025-11-07 18:20:24.808860

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Campaign begins with Yam Jam, a volunteer event in Greenville that packages 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for holiday food boxes

GREENVILLE, S.C., Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That's why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

The big picture: Starting this week, Duke Energy with support from Duke Energy Foundation launches the company's annual monthlong campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities across the state.

The initiative will provide over $600,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

This year's campaign also consists of a contribution of $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: Food pantries and rainy-day funds are drained, and many are unsure when government funding will be available. Though many donors and relief efforts like the One SC Fund have stepped up to support them, many communities still need an extra hand.

Zoom in: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That's 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

Bottom line: Throughout November, Duke Energy will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others.

The monthlong campaign began Nov. 6, when Duke Energy joined Mill Village Farms, WYFF, Bon Secours Wellness Arena and nearly 200 volunteers from dozens of companies and organizations around Greenville to bag nearly 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving food boxes to be distributed by FoodShare South Carolina hubs and other food programs across South Carolina.

Additionally, Duke Energy Foundation contributed $105,000 to FoodShare South Carolina organizations across the company's service territory, including $39,000 to Mill Village Farms.

What they're saying

Dan Weidenbenner, executive director of Mill Village Farms and Mill Village Ministries: ""As we enter the holiday season, Mill Village Ministries remains steadfast in our commitment to ensuring food access for every resident in our community. In the wake of reduced federal support, Mill Village Farms' FoodShare program is stepping up to fill the gap – bringing fresh, affordable produce directly to neighborhoods where it's needed most. Thanks to the continued partnership of Duke Energy and the generosity of our community, we're able to stand in the gap for our neighbors and make sure everyone has access to the healthy food they deserve.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""Our hope is by shining a light on these organizations they will continue to receive the support they need to help address the real problem of hunger in our communities. They are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but now more than ever they cannot do it alone.""

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

After years of growth, Wood Mackenzie forecast that solar installations may decline 1% annually through 2035.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released a report saying that political attacks are threatening 500 U.S. solar and energy storage projects totaling nearly 116 GW of capacity, or about half of all planned capacity additions nationwide through 2030.

“This blockade is undermining American energy security, driving up costs for families and businesses, and exacerbating the ‘energy emergency’ that the Trump administration itself declared earlier this year,” said SEIA in a press statement.

New SEIA analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects have not yet received all necessary federal, state and local permits and are at risk of being targeted by the administration. The projects, spread across 44 states, would produce enough electricity to power 16 million U.S. homes.

Solar and storage projects developed on federal lands now face “final review” from Trump-appointed Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum’s office, leaving many to be “trapped in limbo,” said SEIA.

“And this extends well beyond projects on public lands,” said SEIA. “Many solar and storage projects located partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in a myriad of federal reviews.”

SEIA said federal obstruction erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host. It poses a risk to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if your project complies with regulations the federal government can still pull the plug, said SEIA.

Eighteen states have over 50% of their planned electricity capacity at risk of being blocked. Many of these states, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada, are expected to lead the country in energy-intensive data center growth. The report from SEIA tracks planned capacity and what is at risk state-by-state on a dashboard here.

American Battery Technology Company will manage cleanup of thousands of damaged battery modules as part of a $30 million contract with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The cleanup — described by the EPA as “the largest lithium-ion battery cleanup in agency history"" — stems from a Jan. 16 fire that flared up at a 300-megawatt battery energy storage facility at Moss Landing just northwest of Monterey, California.

The Moss Landing 300 building, which is owned by Texas-based retail electricity and power generation company Vistra, burned for several days until Jan. 18 and saw another flareup on Feb. 18. The facility contained about 100,000 lithium-ion battery modules, 55% of which were damaged in the fire, according to the EPA.

The EPA described the work as an “unprecedented battery cleanup effort.”

“After months of careful planning and prep work by our experts to safely execute this unprecedented lithium-ion battery cleanup, the removal of potentially dangerous batteries begins,” said Mike Montgomery, EPA Pacific Southwest Region Superfund program and emergency management director.

Crews started entering the building in September to take out each battery module and individually discharge them to reduce fire risk. Materials that can be recycled will be sent to EPA-approved recyclers, including the American Battery Technology Company facility in McCarran, just east of Reno-Sparks.

In addition to preventing environmental contamination, the cleanup will allow materials to reenter the domestic battery supply chain. American Battery Technology Company’s technology, for example, will allow it to extract materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel from the battery modules.

Nevada has been pushing to build its own “lithium loop,” a circular battery economy that sources, manufactures and recycles lithium within the state.

The state’s efforts received recognition in 2023 when the Nevada lithium loop was chosen by the Biden administration as one of 31 regional tech hubs that qualify for federal funding. The University of Nevada, Reno-led Nevada Tech Hub program also received $21 million from the Department of Commerce in 2024 as part of the federal program.

The latest cleanup contract with the EPA reflects the importance of investing in battery technology development.

“This project underscores the critical need for advanced battery recycling infrastructure as the nation accelerates its transition to renewable energy,” American Battery Technology Company said in a statement.

“This operation highlights the growing demand for specialized battery recycling capabilities as electric vehicles and grid storage systems become more prevalent.”","https://www.rgj.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/01/24/USAT/77915948007-20250117-t-073607-z-1232156219-rc-2-jbcaluff-6-rtrmadp-3-californiavistrafire.JPG?crop=3765,2117,x16,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-07 15:00:43.824963

Mitsubishi can connect you with vetted professionals who can help you determine which heat pump is right for your home.","Analysis of nearly 18,500 homes across every U.S. state found that households using electricity rather than gas for heating required significantly less energy to achieve indoor comfort.

The study, published in the Energy Policy journal, used machine learning to sift through the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, the most detailed and current set of data available on household energy use. It discovered that electric heat pumps were by far the most efficient type of heating device, particularly compared to gas furnaces.

""For the average U.S. home, this difference indicates significant savings potential on utility bills,"" wrote StudyFinds, an online outlet that dug into the new analysis.

In fact, some estimates suggest a household could save up to $1,000 each year on energy bills. That's because heating is by far the largest energy expense in most homes, according to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Cooling also doesn't come cheap.

Moreover, since the U.S. grid still relies heavily on dirty fuels, heating and cooling account for around 441 million tons of planet-warming carbon pollution each year.

However, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that heat pumps can slash electricity use for heating compared to furnaces and baseboard heaters by roughly 50%.

While each home's energy needs are unique, Mitsubishi offers a variety of heat pumps, including easy-to-install mini-splits for those who value design flexibility.

Even though their name may suggest otherwise, heat pumps also do more than just heat your home. They work by moving heat around, so they can keep your living space cool in the summer by transferring heat from inside your home to the outside.

""We had a massive heat wave a few years ago and needed to install A/C but opted for a heat pump so we could get more efficient heating and cooling,"" one TCD community member shared. ""I love that it's fast to cool or heat, super quiet and very efficient.""

If you’re among the heat-pump or EV-car-charger curious, read on for how to take advantage of the savings that are disappearing.

The Biden administration put these credits in play with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, its signature climate policy. The goal was to encourage homeowners to replace gas appliances with electric ones, which can have higher upfront price tags.

When the Trump administration pushed through the expansive legislative package, H.R. 1 last summer, the “Big Beautiful Bill” moved up the expiration date of many of the credits for heat pumps, solar and batteries, electrical panel upgrades, and more from 2032 to the end of this year.

Using gas as a fuel, in appliances like furnaces and water heaters, leads to more planet-warming emissions than using electricity, which instead powers up on California’s greening grid. Gas appliances can also pollute the air inside your home.

California also offers state incentive programs for specific regions and households, which your contractor can usually apply for on your behalf. You can enter your location and other information into the Switch Is On (check out their product and vetted vendor pages) and Rewiring America (they have a “savings calculator”) to get a sense of existing opportunities and find a contractor.

One of the biggest is TECH Clean California, which can cut thousands of dollars off the upfront cost of installing electric heat pump water heaters or heat pump HVAC systems.

Funds are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so it’s worth checking soon — reservations open periodically and often fill up within a few months.

What federal tax incentives expire on Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $2,000 off new heat pump installations

A heat pump can warm or cool a home, and a heat pump water heater warms water. The technology has been around for decades: most refrigerators are heat pumps. The appliances work by capturing heat and moving it to where it’s needed to do its job.

“Heat pumps provide heating and cooling in one appliance,” said Laura Wilson, director of marketing for The Switch Is On, a website and campaign that educates and helps homeowners transition to electric appliances.

Heat pumps are far more efficient than gas furnaces and can significantly cut a home’s carbon pollution as compared to gas furnaces.

Details: These federal tax breaks can get you 30% off of heat pump installation (labor and equipment) up to $2,000, and there are no income limitations.

Up to $600 off electrical panel upgrades

Some people may want to increase the size of their electrical panels as they electrify their homes, but this can be unnecessary, so talk to a trusted electrician.

Details: You can get 30% off the total cost up to $600.

Up to $1,200 off home weatherization

Weatherization — insulation, sealing cracks, upgrading windows and doors — helps keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and lowers monthly electricity bills.

Details: People can get 30% off of equipment (not labor) up to:

$1,200 for insulation and air sealing

$500 for exterior doors (limit $250 per door)

$600 for exterior windows and skylights

If you’re both weatherizing and upgrading your panel, the total cost cap is $1,200.

Up to $150 on a ‘home energy audit’

A building energy audit is like a “physical for your home,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Contractors take a comprehensive look at home energy use, find leaks, and recommend improvements.

Details: People can get up to $150 back.

30% off solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters and back-up batteries

This category includes rooftop solar panels and plug-in solar, which allow you to generate some of your own energy.

Back-up batteries store electricity either from the grid or solar panels. You can use that energy to power your home when the power goes out, or in the case of solar panels, at night when your solar panels are not generating electricity. Batteries must store at least three kilowatt-hours, which could power a home anywhere from 1–6 hours, to qualify.

Geothermal heat pumps heat and cool homes through a loop of piping buried underground or submerged in water, like a pond. Liquid circulates through the loop, absorbing heat from the ground in winter to warm your home and releasing heat back into the ground in summer to keep it cool.

A solar water heater uses sunlight to warm water for your home.

Details: These federal tax breaks cover 30% of total costs, without a cap.

Need-to-knows:

These tax credits reduce the amount of federal income tax you owe; they won’t give you money back beyond that. Rebates reset each year.

If you used them last year, you can take advantage of them again now.

All the work of installation should be done by Dec. 31, 2025; a signed contract for future work won’t cut it.

Many solar and battery residential contractors are reporting being booked through the end of 2025, said Josh Buswell-Charkow, deputy director at the California Solar and Storage Association.

Which federal credits can I still get after Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $1,000 off EV charger installation

If you live in what’s considered a non-urban or low-income community by the Census Bureau, you’re eligible for 30% off the total cost of installing an electric vehicle charger in your home, with a cap of $1,000.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a257ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2769x1454+0+312/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2023%2F09%2F28%2Fimg_5943-20731a0ceb48aeaba09a1bdeebba11a38851f891.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 15:01:05.060594

Trump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.","ATHENS, Greece(AP) — U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday condemned the COP30 environmental summit as harmful and misguided — defying the global scientific consensus and concern by governments worldwide on climate change.

“It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives,” Wright told The Associated Press at the close of a two-day business conference in Athens. He added that he might attend next year's summit “just to try to deliver some common sense.”

Wright’s comments came as world leaders gathering over 5,000 miles away, on the edge of the Amazon in Brazil, blasted U.S. President Donald Trump for his absence from the United Nations-sponsored discussions on climate change running through Nov. 21. His remarks echoed the U.S. administration’s rejection of global climate agreements and Trump's prioritization of fossil fuels.

The U.S. will send no high-level officials to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, the White House said Friday.

“President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.

Wright led a senior U.S. delegation to Athens for talks centered on boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to eastern Europe and Ukraine. Among them were Interior secretary Doug Burgum, deputy secretaries and the new U.S. ambassador to Greece and close Trump ally, Kimberly Guilfoyle.

At the forum, top U.S. officials criticized European Union carbon reduction policies, arguing they undermine economic growth, democratic alliances, and global leadership in AI and energy innovation.

It was a stark contrast with the Brazilian city of Belem, where world leaders at COP30 issued urgent warnings about the accelerating pace of global warming, driven in large part by emissions from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said a “moral failure” to act would trigger rising hunger, displacement, and environmental damage.

Backed by overwhelming scientific consensus, the U.N. reaffirmed that climate change is already underway, requiring urgent global action to prevent irreversible harm.

Latin American leaders attending COP30 in Belem took swipes at Trump for his stance on climate discussions.

“Today Mr. Trump is against humanity. His absence is proof of that,” Colombia's President Gustavo Petro said in his speech on Thursday. “What should we do then? Leave him alone. Oblivion is the biggest punishment.”

Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva struck a more moderate tone regarding Trump’s absence, expressing hope that his U.S. counterpart would eventually change his mind.

“President Trump told me he doesn’t believe in green energy, Lula told reporters earlier this week. “He will believe in it, because he'll realize that we don’t have much of an alternative.”

Trump wasn’t the only one staying away; the summit was also notably absent of leaders from China and India. Together, these three nations are the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Wright — a former fossil fuel executive who has been a leading voice against efforts to fight climate change — defended Washington’s stance, arguing that global gatherings should prioritize energy access, growth and technological advancement over what he described as fear-driven environmentalism.

“Gatherings of global leaders and businesses should be about humans … not on the desire to scare children and grow government power,” he told the AP in Athens. “They’ve lost the plot.”

The Belem talks opened as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, the World Meteorological Organization reported Thursday.

Trump has reversed Biden’s focus on slowing climate change to pursue what the Republican calls U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

At the start of his second term, Trump again withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, while the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark regulations.

Trump created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and remove regulatory barriers. Under executive orders, the EPA and other federal agencies have sought to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.

“Perhaps in no other time in history have leaders in Washington been more determined to pull the United States backwards in the fight against the climate crisis,"" Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Friday in a statement.

If you’re among the heat-pump or EV-car-charger curious, read on for how to take advantage of the savings that are disappearing.

The Biden administration put these credits in play with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, its signature climate policy. The goal was to encourage homeowners to replace gas appliances with electric ones, which can have higher upfront price tags.

When the Trump administration pushed through the expansive legislative package, H.R. 1 last summer, the “Big Beautiful Bill” moved up the expiration date of many of the credits for heat pumps, solar and batteries, electrical panel upgrades, and more from 2032 to the end of this year.

Using gas as a fuel, in appliances like furnaces and water heaters, leads to more planet-warming emissions than using electricity, which instead powers up on California’s greening grid. Gas appliances can also pollute the air inside your home.

California also offers state incentive programs for specific regions and households, which your contractor can usually apply for on your behalf. You can enter your location and other information into the Switch Is On (check out their product and vetted vendor pages) and Rewiring America (they have a “savings calculator”) to get a sense of existing opportunities and find a contractor.

One of the biggest is TECH Clean California, which can cut thousands of dollars off the upfront cost of installing electric heat pump water heaters or heat pump HVAC systems.

Funds are limited and awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so it’s worth checking soon — reservations open periodically and often fill up within a few months.

What federal tax incentives expire on Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $2,000 off new heat pump installations

A heat pump can warm or cool a home, and a heat pump water heater warms water. The technology has been around for decades: most refrigerators are heat pumps. The appliances work by capturing heat and moving it to where it’s needed to do its job.

“Heat pumps provide heating and cooling in one appliance,” said Laura Wilson, director of marketing for The Switch Is On, a website and campaign that educates and helps homeowners transition to electric appliances.

Heat pumps are far more efficient than gas furnaces and can significantly cut a home’s carbon pollution as compared to gas furnaces.

Details: These federal tax breaks can get you 30% off of heat pump installation (labor and equipment) up to $2,000, and there are no income limitations.

Up to $600 off electrical panel upgrades

Some people may want to increase the size of their electrical panels as they electrify their homes, but this can be unnecessary, so talk to a trusted electrician.

Details: You can get 30% off the total cost up to $600.

Up to $1,200 off home weatherization

Weatherization — insulation, sealing cracks, upgrading windows and doors — helps keep your home warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and lowers monthly electricity bills.

Details: People can get 30% off of equipment (not labor) up to:

$1,200 for insulation and air sealing

$500 for exterior doors (limit $250 per door)

$600 for exterior windows and skylights

If you’re both weatherizing and upgrading your panel, the total cost cap is $1,200.

Up to $150 on a ‘home energy audit’

A building energy audit is like a “physical for your home,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at electrification nonprofit Rewiring America. Contractors take a comprehensive look at home energy use, find leaks, and recommend improvements.

Details: People can get up to $150 back.

30% off solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters and back-up batteries

This category includes rooftop solar panels and plug-in solar, which allow you to generate some of your own energy.

Back-up batteries store electricity either from the grid or solar panels. You can use that energy to power your home when the power goes out, or in the case of solar panels, at night when your solar panels are not generating electricity. Batteries must store at least three kilowatt-hours, which could power a home anywhere from 1–6 hours, to qualify.

Geothermal heat pumps heat and cool homes through a loop of piping buried underground or submerged in water, like a pond. Liquid circulates through the loop, absorbing heat from the ground in winter to warm your home and releasing heat back into the ground in summer to keep it cool.

A solar water heater uses sunlight to warm water for your home.

Details: These federal tax breaks cover 30% of total costs, without a cap.

Need-to-knows:

These tax credits reduce the amount of federal income tax you owe; they won’t give you money back beyond that. Rebates reset each year.

If you used them last year, you can take advantage of them again now.

All the work of installation should be done by Dec. 31, 2025; a signed contract for future work won’t cut it.

Many solar and battery residential contractors are reporting being booked through the end of 2025, said Josh Buswell-Charkow, deputy director at the California Solar and Storage Association.

Which federal credits can I still get after Dec. 31, 2025?

Up to $1,000 off EV charger installation

If you live in what’s considered a non-urban or low-income community by the Census Bureau, you’re eligible for 30% off the total cost of installing an electric vehicle charger in your home, with a cap of $1,000.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a257ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2769x1454+0+312/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2023%2F09%2F28%2Fimg_5943-20731a0ceb48aeaba09a1bdeebba11a38851f891.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 15:01:09.018481

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-07 18:50:11+00:00,www.ans.org,Mike Kramer: Navigating power deals in the new data economy - American Nuclear Society,Not Available,,,,,https://www.ans.org/news/2025-11-07/article-7479/mike-kramer-navigating-power-deals-in-the-new-data-economy/,"A number of other deals are “in the pipeline,” Kramer said, as he shared insights into Constellation’s strategy for meeting data-driven demand growth, getting maximum power from existing nuclear reactors, and preparing to invest in new nuclear power.
Data Economy Strategy is a group we created in the fall of 2024 in response to the demand that’s coming from the data economy.
In our earnings call in early August we put out a slide that shows existing data centers use quite a bit more power than they have before.
And if you look at what’s getting built, a typical data center two years ago was in the 10- to 20-MW range.
Does Constellation see itself in a leadership position, modeling how nuclear power can support the data economy?","Meta gets power, and Clinton gets an end to more than a decade of economic challenges for the 1,092 net MWe boiling water reactor that was slated to shut down in 2017 and put more than 500 plant staff out of work. Clinton is a single-unit plant, but it also has an early site permit for new construction—Constellation’s only ESP.

“Now we have revenue certainty for 20 years,” Kramer said. “And the excitement at the plant for a sustained future, the community impact, and the jobs impact was fun to be a part of.”

Jobs are back in Pennsylvania, too, where about 500 people are working at Constellation’s Crane Clean Energy Center, preparing the former Three Mile Island-1 for restart in 2027, backed by a PPA with Microsoft.

A number of other deals are “in the pipeline,” Kramer said, as he shared insights into Constellation’s strategy for meeting data-driven demand growth, getting maximum power from existing nuclear reactors, and preparing to invest in new nuclear power.

What do you do as Constellation’s VP of Data Economy Strategy?

Data Economy Strategy is a group we created in the fall of 2024 in response to the demand that’s coming from the data economy. We saw changes in the size of data centers and where they’ll be located and wanted to make sure that we were proactive in meeting that demand.

My group is responsible for a couple of things. The first is tracking deal flow for the opportunities we have to provide power solutions to data companies. A lot of what I do is making sure we understand how that’s evolving and what types of transactions are possible. You’ve seen that come to fruition in the deal we did for the Crane Clean Energy Center and also the one we celebrated at Clinton.

The second thing that I’m responsible for is market intelligence on that industry: what’s changing, how it’s changing, and what that means for energy needs, load forecasting, and other key considerations that impact not just our ability to serve those customers but also our actions related to the energy industry and Constellation’s broad business.

What gives you confidence that the demand you’re seeing now has staying power?

It’s challenging right now to get a good feel for where and when data centers are coming and to what extent they’re going to use energy on the system. What we argue is that existing data show there’s a very clear demand. In our earnings call in early August we put out a slide that shows existing data centers use quite a bit more power than they have before. And if you look at what’s getting built, a typical data center two years ago was in the 10- to 20-MW range. Those getting built today are in the 50- to 100-MW range, with some up to 1 GW.

You can tell there’s a real demand for the AI economy in the amount of spend that’s coming from the large tech companies. The most recent estimates for this year for the top four—Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft—are over $350 billion. Clearly a significant amount of demand is out there.

I’ve heard both you and Bryan Hanson—executive VP and chief generation officer of Constellation Energy—warn that double accounting may be at play, exaggerating data center demand. Can you explain?

Because there is a lot of activity in the industry, you have a lot of people trying to meet those needs with speculative data centers. They buy property, and typically before they even have a customer, before they have the financing to build a $10 billion data center, they have to get a utility service center interconnection. These developers are potentially putting in multiple utility service requests to see which ones move fastest, and when they get that answer, they try to turn that site into a data center.

There’s also some regulatory uncertainty. States have different policies that often change as these companies go through the building process. Companies trying to figure out where they can get power fastest and most reliably end up weighing some different options.

Utilities are having a hard time parsing these speculative requests. They’re doing their best and trying to add requirements—whether that’s additional financial requirements or details on customer arrangements—but you can’t get too far down that path if you don’t know when you’re going to be able to get those customers power.

In our business, the location matters quite a bit because if it all gets built in one place, that changes the way you plan from an infrastructure perspective. I appreciate all the work that’s happening on the utility front and with the RTOs [regional transmission organizations] trying to figure out better ways to do this. But it’s difficult to figure out how much demand is coming to an individual location. To the extent we know where the end-use customers are, that’s helpful. Our deals have been with big tech companies because we know there’s an end-use customer.

How has it been working with hyperscalers, specifically on the Microsoft and the Meta deals?

We’ve always had good relationships with those customers. Constellation serves three-quarters of the Fortune 100, so working with hyperscalers is not new from our perspective.

I’d say there are two things that are interesting about working with those customers. First, they have very good sustainability goals. They’ve been vocal and we’ve heard repeatedly that nuclear is a good fit with what they’re trying to accomplish from a sustainability perspective.

The second thing is their long-term perspective. Typically in competitive markets a customer might be looking for a short-term deal for two or three years of power. Getting long-term revenue certainty from hyperscalers has been super helpful, because we are making long-term investments at these sites.

Constellation is competing with other power producers to land the best deals and with new reactor developers offering to site smaller reactors at the point of need. How is Constellation marketing its fleet of larger reactors that were sited decades ago?

I think there are a couple of things that are important in this question. The first is it does take a long time to get new things built. With these needs coming in the near term, you have to figure out what you can do in the existing system.

The first priority is making sure that the existing fleet has some revenue certainty and we can extend the license lives of the existing assets. We have a number of plants that are coming up on their license renewal dates. We’re trying to figure out how to renew those licenses and make the long-term investments required to operate those plants at the safe and reliable levels that we’re used to. That was a big part of the deal we did at Clinton. Clinton’s license expires in 2027, and this allows us to extend it and renew the license for another 20 years.

Renewing those licenses and having revenue certainty for a period of time allows you to consider how you add new capacity to units. Uprating is one way to get additional capacity, but that is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Some units are candidates for considerable uprates, while others have less potential and some have already done all possible uprates. What we’ve said is that we have about a gigawatt’s worth of additional uprates we can do across our fleet, pending some customer commitments. We’re working toward getting those on the system, which is faster than building new capacity.

Where—and when—does new capacity come into the picture?

One option is restarting existing reactors that have shut down. There’s only a handful of those across the country, of course, so that’s not a sustainable solution, but it does get us—in the case of the Crane Clean Energy Center—an 835-MW pickup by 2027. Between the gigawatt’s worth of uprates and the 835 MW at Crane, we’re adding the equivalent of about two large reactors to the existing fleet.

By having existing assets run for an additional 20 years, we also preserve great locations for new builds. At those locations, you have existing infrastructure, community support, and good technical people who live in those areas and are capable of supporting new builds. When it comes to getting new generation built in the U.S., one of the best places to do that is at an existing reactor site.

Constellation has said the deal with Meta opens the possibility of building a new reactor at Clinton. Is new generation incentivized? Could it be folded into the PPA with Meta if and when it’s built?

We haven’t disclosed any details on how that would work, but it is something that is of interest, and we’re exploring that opportunity.

Returning to Constellation’s planned uprates, licensing timeline changes at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission mean you can likely get NRC approval for those uprates quicker than you could last year. Will this allow Constellation to turn planned uprates around faster?

The short answer to your question is that for those that are regulatory driven, I agree that you can probably pull some of the regulatory work to the left. The real question is the physical work that needs to happen. The supply chain considerations for large equipment that generally come with some of the bigger uprates are probably constrained by those equipment challenges and not by other things.

We haven’t disclosed specifics on many of the uprates. The only ones that we’ve talked about publicly are the turbines that we’re doing at Braidwood and Byron—those projects are underway—and we expect to get 30 MWe from uprates at Clinton. We announced as part of the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit in July that we have a potential uprate at Limerick. That is an extended power uprate that includes some pretty long-lead-time equipment. We’ve already started thinking about how to make sure that we can meet the timelines that we have planned, for example, by either having those components on order or by working through the engineering and design on those projects.

What are some other ways Constellation is trying to meet growing demand with its existing assets, such as demand response tools or battery storage?

Demand response is definitely something that we are working on. We are partnering with a company called Grid Beyond to work through how to focus on getting more demand response on the system and working through solutions for our customers to aggregate and potentially use that as a means to help offset some of the concerns that exist today around peak and reliability challenges.

From a battery storage perspective, we have evaluated that and continue to evaluate where we can potentially play in that space. We are in the process of acquiring Calpine, which does have some battery storage assets. We can’t really talk too much about what we’re doing with Calpine assets until that deal closes for legal purposes, so I’ll just leave it at that.

Nuclear plants do best with a stable, predictable load, but data center loads can fluctuate, especially when they’re serving generative AI. What are the challenges to integrating the power supply and the load and protecting your nuclear assets?

Yeah, it’s a really good question. I’m not an engineer, so I’ll give you my nontechnical answer. I would frame it by saying a lot of the data centers getting built today are on the grid. All our deals so far have been front-of-the-meter PPAs. They’re not directly connected to the plant, so the load variability that you see coming from potential data centers gets managed like every other load variability. There have been some studies about how to do that best, knowing that we could be seeing some significant variability in size relative to what exists on the grid today. A lot of people are working on the solutions to that problem.

The second thing that’s interesting, at least from my perspective, is that those problems are also being considered in the design of racks in the data centers. They’re designing racks to balance some of the compute variability by looking at workloads both in terms of when they happen and from a power conductibility standpoint. NVIDIA in particular just came out with their latest rack design that includes some balancing components to space out some of the load.

Through the Electric Power Research Institute’s DCFlex project, we’re working with the hyperscalers, the generators, and the utilities, trying to figure out ways in which we can have more flexible data centers to support peak load and manage the compute in a different manner to protect the grid or protect the generators.

I think the approach to integrating the grid and the load is a combination of those two things: the macro scale of using the grid and the balancing effect that comes from more resources, and the micro scale of how the data center itself operates.

We at Constellation are not the ones managing the transmission and distribution system and we’re not the ones dealing with the data center build-out design work itself. But I’m involved in understanding how the other stakeholders are trying to work through that. And I think they are all coming up with different solutions that will hopefully avoid any concerns there.

Understanding that Constellation first wants to get maximum value out of its existing assets, what is the plan for new nuclear builds?

There’s definitely a need for new nuclear, and there is a role for us to play. The short answer to your question is that there is a lot of activity in the space and people are working on different solutions.

Trying to figure out which solutions you can scale quickly from first-of-a-kind to nth-of-a-kind has been a priority. We’re figuring out how we can help facilitate that, potentially with projects at our existing sites or in terms of support from a technology development perspective, and we’re looking at ways we’ve done that in the past. Getting a better understanding of how we can move those quickly down that cost curve is really our effort in terms of getting new build.

Does that include looking at new ways of collaborating with end users on siting, offtakes, or operation, for example?

The answer is yes. I can’t go into detail, but yes, we talk to customers on a regular basis about the potential for new nuclear, where facilities might be located, how we think about the offtake agreements, how we think about risk sharing—all of those are part of the discussions. Individual discussions are all confidential, so I can’t really get into those details.

Similarly, on the construction side, thinking through potential folks we can partner with is something that we’ve had a lot of conversations on. There’s been a lot of activity there, but not a lot that we can talk about in specifics at this time.

What does Constellation like about what it sees in current policy and legislation and what are you looking for more certainty on?

I think the thing that we like and that has been very clear is the bipartisan support for nuclear. You saw that with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the way in which it treated nuclear and kept those tax credits for both the existing nuclear fleet with the 45U [production] tax credit, but then also in the way in which new nuclear gets treated under the 45Y [production] or the 48E [investment] tax credits.

We are getting a lot of support from the administration and from the Democrats. Seeing both of those groups come together behind a type of technology, and nuclear in particular, has been something that we’re super proud of.

That said, it’s hard to get new reactors built. There are a lot of people working in the administration on ways in which we can put all that together. Making sure that there’s the right level of risk sharing and protection for the companies that want to take that on and figuring out market design elements that will help are some of the biggest issues from a policy support standpoint.

It’s very exciting to be part of this industry today, and advocacy is still important despite the bipartisan support. I think it doesn’t hurt to continue to educate folks on the benefits of nuclear and the attributes that it provides to the system.

Does Constellation see itself in a leadership position, modeling how nuclear power can support the data economy?

Yes, I would say definitely we see ourselves as a leader in the industry and we want to stay in that position. We have a role to play in both making sure the existing fleet runs for as long as possible and runs at excellent levels. Where new nuclear can be added we have a role as well.

So, I would say yes, we certainly want to be a big player as it relates to how we participate and also in terms of thought leadership, which requires a lot of effort from the industry. We work closely with a lot of industry partners trying to figure out the best ways to do that and how Constellation can contribute.",https://www.ans.org/file/22003/l/Crane Turbine.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 17:59:16.450591

Freezing federal permitting for wind energy projects, leaving major offshore wind projects in limbo

Delaying and canceling renewable projects on federal lands, including the Esmeralda Seven Project in Nevada, a solar & battery project that would have provided three Hoover Dams-worth of power

Canceling grants for electric grid upgrades that would support more reliable power in rural communities

Revocation of Grants

To preserve funds, the DOE has cancelled 321 grants and awards supporting 223 projects during the shutdown. This saves $7.56 billion. The DOE issued these grants under the Biden Administration, many of which were made in the last few months of the Administration. Most of these revoked grants were for spending on “green” energy projects or funded energy advocacy groups. Below are a few of the most wasteful projects and groups the Biden DOE funded which have since been canceled.

Community Environmental Council (CEC) – $2 Million

The DOE granted $2 million for the CEC to promote climate workshops and environmental education initiatives. CEC is an advocacy organization that promotes climate activism rather than education. They sponsor community climate resilience hubs that “consider socioeconomic inequities and structural racism” as essential for environmental efforts. Taxpayer funds should not go to climate justice advocacy that leads to energy forced transitions to unreliable energy resources.

United States Green Building Council (USGBC) – $3.8 Million

This $3.8 million dollar DOE grant explicitly went towards creating “equitable building performance standards” in California. The USBGC is already dedicated to implementing the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design green building rating system. This system, created and run by the USGBC, focuses on promoting zero-carbon buildings based on a sustainability point system that developers follow to receive tax breaks in some states. The equitable building performance standards “applies an equity lens to each credit within the rating system”.

Rather than allowing the market to drive innovation and efficiency, this grant subsidized a subjective “equity-based” framework that distorts incentives and forces developers to prioritize political goals over affordability and economic growth.

ARCHES H2 LLC (California hydrogen hub) – $1.2 Billion

Through a 2023 Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations grant, the DOE gave $1.2 billion dollars for the development of a California hydrogen hub that would replace current baseload power sources. Baseload power is the minimum level of continuous electricity supply needed to meet consistent energy demand. It is typically provided by reliable, always-on sources such as coal, nuclear, or natural gas plants that operate steadily to ensure grid stability. Hydrogen hubs waste large amounts of electricity during production, storage, and use, which drives up system costs and strains the power grid rather than supporting it.

SunPower Corporation – $6.65 Million

Biden’s DOE gave almost $7 million to build “zero-energy-ready” homes with rooftop solar and a community battery storage facility. Paying a commercial solar vendor $6.65 million dollars of public money to develop solar powered housing communities is industrial policy, not energy development. The public should not bankroll the development of inefficient solar communities and certainly not by subsidizing the solar corporations that stand to profit from them.

Plug In America – $5 Million

The DOE contributed $5 million to EV education initiatives by Plug in America. Participants learned about the benefits of EVs and how to receive tax credits for purchasing one. This is an advocacy group, not an energy producer or developer. They organize and sponsor groups that aim to accelerate EV adoption including on campus EV support groups. Public money should not fund campaigns to accelerate EV adoption.

EV Right of Way Project in Portland – $1.78 Million

This $1.78 million DOE grant funded an initiative to place EV chargers on curbs and power poles next to city streets. Specifically, in areas that are predominantly “low-income and communities of color”.

Taxpayer dollars should not go towards funding the social justice agenda of Portland.

The Political Economy of Power

These projects are not only costly and ineffective, but also fund causes that are not in line with the priorities of the American people. Americans want reliable, affordable energy and subsidies for renewables do not deliver that. Solar and wind power depend entirely on weather conditions, such as sunlight and wind that cannot be summoned on demand, making them non-dispatchable and therefore unreliable sources of energy. They cannot provide power when it is needed most, forcing utilities to maintain backup systems powered by fossil fuels or nuclear energy or else be unable to supply power when demand peaks. By subsidizing these projects, American consumers receive more expensive energy with less reliability.

In an attempt to reduce these costs, the government often subsidizes green energy projects through grants or tax credits. However, government subsidies create more problems than they solve. Instead of fostering genuine innovation, subsidies prop up technologies that cannot compete on their own merit, distorting market signals and discouraging private investment in more efficient solutions.

When the government guarantees profit through tax credits, grants, and mandates, companies are rewarded for political connections and compliance rather than performance and innovation. This results in wasted taxpayer dollars, inflated project costs, and an energy sector that becomes dependent on continual government support. Worse still, once subsidies are introduced, industries rarely wean off them, creating long-term fiscal liabilities without delivering the promised environmental or economic benefits.

Towards Principled Energy Policy

The DOE’s revocation of wasteful Biden-era grants during the shutdown has exposed that billions in taxpayer money was being funneled into advocacy groups, green lobbying efforts, and projects that do not strengthen America’s energy system.

This moment offers lawmakers a clear opportunity to redirect federal spending away from politically motivated initiatives. Future funding must prioritize energy reliability, affordability, and national security, with strict oversight to prevent taxpayer dollars from being misused again. By doing so, policymakers can rebuild trust, protect public funds, and ensure America’s energy policy serves the people rather than special interests.",https://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/alex-shuper-JrUR-ra9bsM-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:06:04.909299

Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger will become Virginia’s new governor after a decisive win this week — and after a campaign that centered around rising power prices in the data-center capital of the world.

With Spanberger’s win, Democrats now control all branches of the state government. Virginia Democrats added more than a dozen seats to their majority in the House of Delegates on Tuesday; the Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t face an election.

That outcome may be a game-changer when it comes to preserving and enforcing the Virginia Clean Economy Act. Passed in 2020, the law requires top utilities Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power to achieve 100% renewable power production in the coming decades. Virginia’s Republican delegates and current Gov. Glenn Youngkin have blamed the legislation for rising power prices and pushed to repeal it, while state regulators have approved Dominion’s plans to build a raft of new gas plants in spite of the law.

The Clean Economy Act remains divisive even among Virginia Democrats. Spanberger has said that she’s committed to its long-term goals and to scaling up clean energy generation. But Democratic House Speaker Don Scott was reluctant to get into details about its future in a press conference this week, and didn’t deny the possibility of weakening its fossil-fuel restrictions, Inside Climate News reports.

The trifecta could also pave the way for Virginia to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a collaborative of East Coast states that requires power generators to meet a set cap on carbon emissions or buy allowances to exceed it. States reinvest those proceeds into emissions-reducing projects and clean energy. Youngkin pulled Virginia out of the partnership two years ago, but Spanberger has promised to rejoin.

But there’s one piece of the clean-energy landscape where Spanberger’s win could be more problem than solution. Dominion is currently building what will be the country’s largest offshore wind farm, with support from Youngkin. That Republican backing could be why the Trump administration hasn’t targeted the Dominion array, while at the same time dealing blow after blow to offshore wind projects in blue states.

Climate action wins in elections big and small

It wasn’t just Virginia: Democrats swept statewide races across the country this week. In New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill campaigned on a promise to rein in rising power prices, and, in contrast to her Republican opponent, showed support for offshore wind. Still, the state has no operational or under-construction offshore wind projects, and Sherrill will have limited power to counteract the Trump administration’s anti-wind policies, Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler reports.

In Georgia, Democrats beat Republican incumbents in two elections widely seen as referendums on rising utility bills. Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson will now take seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, which oversees for-profit utilities and their requests to raise rates. And in New York City, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani — who tied climate action into his affordability-focused campaign — won the mayoral race.

Several other smaller races also have energy implications. Here are the results of a few:

The Minneapolis City Council held on to a majority of progressive officials who have clashed with Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey, including by overriding his veto of a local carbon-emissions fee.

Wise County, Virginia, voted against creating a local electric authority that would exclusively handle large customers like data centers, with one advocate saying the authority would be ​“a gift to big profitable corporations.”

Clean energy carries on

As the world prepares to meet in Brazil next week for the COP30 climate conference (sans the Trump administration), new reports show that clean-energy progress is still happening in defiance of White House opposition.

BloombergNEF took a look at the impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which rolled back federal incentives for clean energy. The legislation will slow solar, wind, and storage deployment over the next few years, BloombergNEF predicts, but growing power demand will ultimately lead renewables to rebound after 2028.

And while the world remains far off track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, it’s still making progress. A United Nations report projects the impact of many countries’ new, bolstered emissions-reduction commitments, and finds they’ll limit warming to around 2.5°C this century if fully implemented. It’s not ideal, but it’s still a win from previous reports that forecast as much as 5°C of warming through 2100.

Unfortunately, the COP30 hosts have hired a public relations firm that represents fossil fuel companies—and not for the first time.","As nations gather in Belém, Brazil for the international climate negotiations (known as COP30), the fossil fuel industry is emboldened and empowered by its dominant influence over the Trump Administration. At the same time, there is growing momentum to hold this industry accountable for its deception and the massive damage caused by its products and business model. With the world in danger of breaching 1.5° C of global warming and the Trump administration not sending a high-level delegation (having announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement for the second time), COP30 will be a pivotal moment in global efforts to limit the worst impacts of climate change and advance a just transition centering workers, communities, and Indigenous Peoples.

Despite the commitment made two years ago at COP28 in Dubai to transition away from fossil fuels, the 2025 Production Gap Report shows that nations’ fossil fuel production plans are on track to be twice as much in 2030 as would be consistent with a 1.5° C pathway. And the annual Emissions Gap Report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) found that none of the more than 60 countries that have submitted pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions have included targets to reduce oil and gas production or phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.

Fossil fuel industry obstruction is one key explanation for this glaring omission. Just as the tobacco industry has a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest with public health policymaking, the fossil fuel industry has a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest with the development and implementation of public policies intended to limit fossil fuel-driven climate change and accelerate the transition to clean renewable energy.

What would it look like if the nations of the world came together to prevent the fossil fuel industry from obstructing science-informed public policy and its implementation? I decided to imagine what a COP free from fossil fuel industry influence would look like.

Safeguards against conflicts of interest

Since 2023, when COP delegates were first required to disclose their affiliations, the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition has counted thousands of fossil fuel lobbyists granted access to the negotiations. The industry’s presence has outnumbered the size of delegations of most nations—and eclipsed the representation of the most climate-vulnerable nations.

CEOs and lobbyists from BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, and other major fossil fuel corporations have no place at the table where climate goals are being set and the transition to clean energy is being planned. An important new study underscores Big Oil’s conflict of interest: the largest 250 oil and gas companies only own about 1.42% of the global renewable energy capacity in operation, and may only produce 0.1% of their primary energy from renewable sources. The bottom line: these companies’ actual investment in clean energy is negligible compared to their massive fossil fuel extraction.

In a COP safeguarded against conflicts of interest, the nations most affected by extreme heat, sea level rise, and other climate impacts would not have to worry about their voices being drowned out by lobbyists from the industry primarily responsible for destructive and deadly climate change.

Science-informed decisionmaking

COP relies on science, including from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to inform its decisions. Even as the latest IPCC plenary meeting stalled on some key issues, the science is clear: climate action is far off track.

Of particular relevance to holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for its role in the climate crisis is attribution science, which is rapidly advancing—despite attacks from climate science deniers tied to fossil fuel interests. Here are a few recent examples:

A peer-reviewed study led by my former UCS colleague Dr. Shaina Sadai built on and extended earlier research by quantifying not only the historical but also the long-term future contributions of major fossil fuel companies to sea level rise.

A new study published in Nature presents the first systematic attribution of extreme heat events to the emissions of 180 fossil fuel and cement producers. Analyzing 213 major heatwaves that occurred between 2000 and 2023, the authors found that emissions traced to the major carbon producers account for roughly half of the observed increase in heatwave intensity since preindustrial times.

Another 2025 Nature study provides a robust scientific basis for climate liability claims. Using an “end-to-end” attribution framework, the researchers link emissions from individual fossil fuel companies to specific economic harms caused by extreme heat between 1991 and 2020. For example, emissions traced to Chevron are associated with between $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in global heat-related losses.

Attribution science is showing how specific emissions have driven today’s climate impacts. In a fossil-free COP, this evidence would help shape policies rooted in evidence and fairness, not industry influence.

Polluter pays principle

Finance for cutting emissions, adaptation, and loss and damage remains a central issue in the COP process. Last year’s COP in Baku, Azerbaijan, failed to deliver an ambitious and much-needed climate finance commitment from richer nations for lower income countries.

Fossil fuel interests permeated COP29, and their push to maintain massive profits from oil and gas showed in the flawed final outcome. The final COP29 finance text made no explicit reference to the “polluter pays principle,” phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, or cutting investment flows to fossil fuels.

According to the 2025 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change, the health threats of climate change have reached unprecedented levels and “The escalating economic costs of climate change are becoming ever more visible, with profound implications for human health and societal stability.” To rebuild trust, wealthy nations that have built their economic power on fossil fuels must demonstrate their commitment to climate justice—which includes stepping up climate finance and making fossil fuel polluters pay an equitable share of the costs of:

climate damages;

climate adaptation; and

the environmental, social, and systemic impacts of fossil fuel products and production.

This is the first COP after two landmark international court rulings that affirmed the right to a healthy climate and clarified that climate inaction is a violation of international law and that nations must regulate fossil fuel companies.

Climate justice means nations should ensure access to judicial remedies, including for extraterritorial climate impacts resulting from actions that occur within their borders or under their jurisdiction. Survivors of Super Typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette), which struck the Philippines in 2021, have announced legal action in the United Kingdom against Shell, seeking compensation for deaths and damages linked to the company’s role in driving the climate crisis. The survivors argue that Shell violated the Philippine constitutional right to a healthy environment and continued expanding fossil fuel operations despite internal documents acknowledging the catastrophic risks of climate change.

International cooperation for climate justice and accountability is especially vital now as the fossil fuel industry wields its influence with the Trump administration and the US Congress to lobby for a shield from liability for the harm caused by its products and business model.

Transparency and fair accounting

Disclosure and transparency are essential to the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective climate policies at all levels, from subnational to international. Seizing the advantage of a friendly US administration and Congress, fossil fuel corporations and their surrogates are attacking climate disclosure rules and attempting to shift how global warming emissions are calculated in an effort to dodge responsibility.

ExxonMobil, for example, lobbied aggressively against the European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, a landmark law aimed at holding corporations accountable for human rights violations, environmental harms, and climate impacts in global supply chains. CEO Darren Woods has now leveraged his access to President Trump in an effort to defang the law before it takes effect.

At the same time, ExxonMobil is suing to block California’s agenda-setting climate disclosure laws, as my colleague Laura Peterson writes in her latest blog. Enacted in 2023, California’s laws require, among other provisions, disclosure of Scope 3 emissions.

Woods and ExxonMobil have also undertaken a crusade to change how Scope 3 emissions are calculated. Scope 3 encompasses emissions up and down a company’s value chain, including those produced from burning the company’s products—around 90% of the total for an oil and gas company. (The Trump administration is going a step farther, proposing a rule that would eliminate requirements for measuring and reporting carbon emissions for the vast majority of US industries, including fossil fuel producers and refiners).

Heading into COP30, ExxonMobil and the International Chamber of Commerce are among those kicking off a campaign to change carbon accounting. This system is favored by the oil and gas industry because it would shift responsibility for emissions from sold products from companies to consumers.

Information integrity

In the absence of transparency, disinformation can flourish. That’s why putting information integrity on the agenda at international climate meetings this year is a major breakthrough, as my colleague Kate Cell explains. November 12 is an official thematic day on information integrity, a cross-cutting objective on the Action Agenda of COP30.

The fossil fuel industry has been a key driver and beneficiary of disinformation and delayed climate action, as documented in the latest report by my team at the Union of Concerned Scientists, Decades of Deceit: The Case Against Major Fossil Fuel Companies for Climate Fraud and Damages.

Another compelling new resource is Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment, which brought together nearly one hundred scholars and experts to advance our understanding of efforts by organized interests to slow or block policies on climate change. To equip actors to better recognize, anticipate, and respond to efforts that could undermine climate ambition, the Climate Social Science Network has published a policy brief on Climate Obstruction in the UN FCCC.

An international commitment to information integrity can support implementation and enforcement at the national level. Climate advocates are already seeing some success through litigation against greenwashing:

Advocates in New Zealand recently secured a public apology from Z Energy after legal action. The petroleum retailer took out full-page ads in newspapers apologizing for “any confusion” caused by a greenwashing 2022 PR campaign that misrepresented its focus on alternative fuels and emissions reductions.

A French court ruled that TotalEnergies misled the public with false claims about its path to carbon neutrality, marking the first use of France’s anti-greenwashing law against an energy company. The decision requires the company to remove misleading statements from its website and pay damages to the environmental groups that brought the case, signaling growing legal scrutiny of corporate climate claims in Europe.

Unfortunately, the COP30 hosts have hired a public relations firm that represents fossil fuel companies—and not for the first time. With this conflict of interest baked in, there is a real risk that the fossil fuel industry’s role in the climate crisis could be whitewashed—and the results of COP30 negotiations could be greenwashed.

Holding the line in Belém

On its own, a fossil-free COP process won’t solve the climate crisis or secure a people-centered just transition to a future rooted in rights, fairness, equity and solidarity. National and subnational policymakers, litigators, investors, business partners, communities, workers, Indigenous Peoples, consumers, and (of course) scientists all have key roles to play.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Blog-Thumbnail-Kick-Big-Polluters-Out.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 17:04:52.364884

A new nuclear partnership

Independent power producer Brookfield Renewable Partners celebrated a recently-announced $80 billion partnership between Westinghouse Electric, of which it owns 51%, and the U.S. government to deploy nuclear reactors during a third-quarter earnings call this week.

Westinghouse Electric is the U.S.-based developer of the AP1000 nuclear reactor design. Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, owns the other 49% of Westinghouse.

Though the U.S. government has yet to make a final investment decision, the agreement reportedly includes a profit-sharing arrangement that Brookfield Renewable Partners co-President Jen Mazin said on Wednesday could produce $17.5 billion of upside for the organization. She said the deal has already spurred customer interest in AP1000 technology and suggested it could position Westinghouse as a top nuclear vendor outside the United States.

“[The deal positions] Westinghouse to far exceed our original underwriting expectations, and deliver significant value for our shareholders and over the long term,” she said.

Brookfield Renewable Partnersis a Canadian limited partnership that is majority-owned by Brookfield Asset Management, an alternative asset manager with more than $1 trillion under management. Its third-quarter investor update reveals 48.7 GW of operating capacity with annualized generation of approximately 127,000 GWh and a development pipeline of more than 200 GW. Ninety-seven percent of its portfolio is in renewables, including both firm (hydropower) and intermittent (wind, solar) assets.

Brookfield could begin booking revenue from the U.S. government deal “as quickly as the next couple quarters,” though its earnings during early-stage development would likely be “modest,” said Connor Teskey, president of Brookfield Asset Management.

In the third quarter, Brookfield reported 9% year over year revenue growth, 38% growth in generating capacity and 40% growth in actual generation. A mix of asset acquisitions and new commercial deployments drove the generation increase.

Movement on V.C. Summer construction restart

Also last month, Brookfield signed a letter of intent to look into restarting construction on the unfinished AP1000 reactors at the V.C. Summer generating station in South Carolina.

Former project partners Santee Cooper and South Carolina Electric & Gas — now owned by Dominion Energy — abandoned construction in 2017 as costs escalated and Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy.

The fiasco left South Carolina ratepayers on the hook for billions, but Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton insisted last month that completing the reactors now would have “no additional financial risks for our customers at all.”

If Brookfield decides to move forward after a six-week due diligence process, the company could officially take over construction, select a project manager and pursue agreements with power offtakers, The State newspaper reported last month.

On Wednesday, Teskey sounded optimistic about the project while cautioning that it was still early in the process.

“We are encouraged by our initial feedback from potential partners and hyperscaler off-takers,” he said, adding that the project could position Brookfield as a supplier of bulk nuclear power to utilities and large corporate offtakers.

“But we will only do so if the appropriate downside protections and risk adjusted returns are available to us,” he added.

Notable corporate power procurements

Teskey also sounded upbeat about offtake and revenue opportunities for Brookfield’s large hydropower portfolio. The organization has five terawatt-hours of hydro assets coming up for recontracting, he said, just as hyperscalers are “seeking long-term access to reliable and sustainable energy sources to power this growth.”

In July, Google said it would buy up to 3 GW of hydropower from Brookfield, beginning with 670 MW from the Holtwood and Safe Harbor dams in the PJM Interconnection. Brookfield is in the process of relicensing both dams, a time-consuming process that committed offtake deals can make easier.

More recently, Brookfield signed a similar agreement with Microsoft for a third hydropower facility in PJM, Teskey said.

1. How virtual power plants could meet data centre energy demand — The Financial Times

Rocky Mountain Institute just released a report on virtual power plants (networks of distributed energy assets like solar panels, batteries and smart thermostats) that shows they can provide energy flexibility to meet data center energy demand without increasing electricity bills for Americans.

The report estimates they can expand to meet more than 20% of peak US demand in 2030 and reach a market size that covers projected data center growth, by shifting demand during peak periods. By helping shift demand away from the peaks, VPPs can be a much cheaper alternative to building whole new power plants, which can take years to build or connect to the grid.

2. White House Fossil Fuel Bet Is Losing to Green Energy — Bloomberg

Despite Trump’s efforts to weaken wind and solar initiatives, investment keeps pouring into clean power. According to BloombergNEF, in the first half of 2025, global investment in new renewable energy projects reached a record $386 billion. As much as $56 billion from private and public investors worldwide went into cleantech companies ranging from storage to EVs by September. That exceeds the entire $51 billion invested in cleantech companies during 2024.

Investment in clean energy has also pulled ahead of traditional power sources since the 2024 US elections. Renewables are expected to see 16% sales growth next year and 21% in 2027, while oil and gas will rise only 1% and 6%.

In a new autopsy of Biden’s energy agenda, former administration officials argue that bureaucracy, indecision, and fear of repeating past mistakes caused his agencies to slow-roll the administration’s clean energy ambitions. The document shared that as the administration worked to build clean energy projects, they underestimated how aggressively the incoming administration could turn its programs upside down.

Three years after the IRA, only a few federally funded projects broke ground, so most of the public never saw the benefits of these projects. For example, Biden’s $7.5 billion effort to install EV chargers in the US had created only 47 charging stations by December 2024.

4. $615,000 a Day: Order to Keep Coal Plant Open Ignites Debate in Michigan — The Wall Street Journal

In May, a Michigan coal-fired power plant was days from shutting down. Most workers had either retired or been reassigned. However, the Trump administration ordered the Campbell plant to stay open after declaring a grid-reliability emergency due to rising electricity demand.

Keeping the Campbell plant open has cost $80 million through September 30th, equivalent to $615,000 a day.

Keeping aging fossil-fuel plants open could cost U.S. consumers more than $3 billion each year, according to a report by consulting firm Grid Strategies on behalf of environmental groups.

The report warns that federal orders to keep plants running could incentivize other plants to claim they want to retire, in hopes of receiving similar mandates.

Beale Infrastructure, in a letter attached to a memo County Administrator Jan Lesher released Thursday, says its “commitment to pursue 100% renewable energy for its Pima County data center is a significant additional investment and reflects the company’s dedication to sustainable infrastructure development.”

It will be achieved, Beale said in the letter, through the energy supply agreement it is seeking with Tucson Electric Power. Beale “will seek to accelerate the development of new renewable energy resources for TEP’s grid that produce enough energy to match 100% of the data center’s energy consumption — at the data center’s cost.”

But Lesher said a mutual agreement on the specific details of such commitments hasn’t been reached.

“Of primary issue is the lack of specificity on exactly how future new clean energy generation would be developed and paid for, the time frame for generation, the dollar amount of investment, and the best method for obtaining third-party validation of the proposed approach,” Lesher wrote to the Board of Supervisors.

Beale is also committing to invest $15 million in Pima County, it says in the letter, “to support local education, workforce development, and long-term community growth.”

“The community investment initiative will launch with a $5 million scholarship fund designed to support STEM education and trade school training in Pima County,” Beale says. “An additional $10 million will be allocated in future phases of the project for community benefit projects identified in collaboration with Pima County leadership. These investments will be tailored to local priorities and will provide long lasting benefits for county residents, such as digital equity investments and fiber infrastructure expansions.”

Lesher, in her memo to the Board of Supervisors, said these commitments were reached following a series of meetings between county administrators and Beale in recent months. She says the county suggested options and examples of “potential benefit projects” in September, and that Beale “indicated a preference for clean energy generation and work development options, which became the key focus of subsequent discussions.”

But she wrote that “while Beale states in their letter that details will be captured in a future agreement instrument, at this time there is no specificity on how the Beale commitments would be incorporated into an appropriate form of enforceable agreement to ensure future compliance.”

Beale said in the letter that it plans to finalize acquiring the property, which the Board of Supervisors approved selling to it in June, “and subsequently begin construction” by the end of the year. This is despite Pima County having “unresolved questions at this time,” Lesher said in her memo.

Cooper said if EPA decides not to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes, the ""impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating.""","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- The Trump administration granted two full small-refinery exemptions, 50% exemptions on 12 petitions and denied two other petitions for compliance years 2021 to 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a Renewable Fuel Standard announcement on Friday.

The announcement comes as the agency also considers public comments made on a proposal to reallocate biofuels gallons lost on 140 partial and full exemptions granted by the administration recently.

""With most of the old petitions now cleared, EPA is committed to working with DOE (U.S. Department of Energy) to address new petitions as quickly as possible and within the 90-day statutory review period, ... "" the EPA said in a news release.

""Furthermore, on Sept. 16, 2025, the agency announced a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking that takes into consideration the expected impacts of the Aug. 22, 2025, SRE decisions. EPA is reviewing comments on the supplemental proposed rule as the agency continues to work on final regulations for the 'Set 2' rule. As stated in the (supplemental proposal), EPA intends to update the agency's projections of exempted gasoline and diesel volumes in the final rule based on any additional SREs issued after the proposal, including the petition decisions in this action.""

EPA said announcement was part of the Trump EPA's ""commitment to get the RFS program back on track"" with an approach that recognizes ""some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others"" and that EPA's relief should reflect those differences.

""EPA is reaffirming the agency's policy of returning RFS compliance credits, known as renewable identification numbers, previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year,"" the agency said.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement he questions EPA's decision.

""Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,"" Cooper said.

""EPA added another 14 small-refinery exemptions to the already-massive pile today, based on the agency's questionable new approach to determining whether those refiners experienced 'disproportionate economic hardship.'""

Cooper said the RFA continues to dispute the notion that SREs are ""warranted at all"" since the agency's own analysis shows that all refiners -- large and small -- face a proportional RFS compliance obligation and pass their RIN costs through to buyers of their refined products.

""The silver lining here is that EPA is returning expired RINs to the six refineries who were granted exemptions from their 2021 and 2022 RFS obligations,"" Cooper said.

""However, more than 500 million valid RINs will be issued to eight refineries who were gifted exemptions from their 2023 and 2024 obligations, meaning there are now more than 2.5 billion RINs associated with 2023-2025 SREs that are likely to be dropped back onto the market in the months ahead.""

Cooper said if EPA decides not to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes, the ""impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating.""

He said EPA's decision further underscores the ""crucial need"" for EPA to finalize 2026-2027 renewable volume obligations that fully reallocate any and all SREs granted, or expected to be granted, for the 2023-2027 compliance years.

Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.” Other incentives in Musk’s $1tn pay package include delivering 20m Tesla vehicles, 10m self-driving car subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots and 1m robotaxis.
Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.","For all the headlines about an on-off relationship with Donald Trump, baiting liberals and erratic behaviour, Tesla shareholders are loath to part with Elon Musk.

Investors in the electric vehicle maker voted on Thursday to put the world’s richest person on the path to become the world’s first trillionaire, despite the controversy that is now seemingly intrinsic to his public profile.

Shareholders approved the $1tn compensation plan, which could yield the largest corporate payout in history if he meets a series of tough-looking goals, not least pushing Tesla from its current market value of $1.4tn to $8.5tn (£1.06tn to £6.4tn). Musk’s fortune, which includes a stake of about 12.5% in Tesla, is already worth $461bn.

“Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,” says Dan Ives, a managing director at the US financial firm Wedbush. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”

Ives is a self-described Tesla “core bull” who nonetheless has consistently raised concerns about the damage that the chief executive’s political stance has been doing to one of the world’s best-known brands.

Tesla sales suffered as Musk’s on-off relationship with Trump – funding his presidential campaign and his stint leading sweeping cuts at the “department of government efficiency” – damaged the appeal of its vehicles to a left-leaning consumer base.

There were signs of trouble before that as well, with market research firm Strategic Vision recording a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Musk bought Twitter (now X) in 2022, rolled back content moderation on the platform and reinstated banned accounts.

Other off-putting factors have been swirling around the Trump soap opera, such as reports of Musk’s alleged extensive drug consumption, his public support for far-right political parties and making fascist-style salutes at political rallies.

At one point in March, Ives warned that Tesla and Musk were embroiled in a “brand tornado crisis moment” as the backlash against the boss’s behaviour became a global problem amid falling sales. Other factors were at play in Tesla’s commercial wobbles, not least stiff competition from Chinese-made vehicles, but Musk’s notoriety has had an impact.

So why have investors stuck by Musk? Shares in Tesla have risen by nearly two-thirds since May, when the Tesla chief executive announced he was leaving the Trump administration (and then worrying investors by falling out with the president publicly). Third-quarter deliveries – a proxy for sales – trounced Wall Street estimates last month thanks to US consumers taking advantage of expiring federal tax credits for electric vehicles, although European sales suffered and analysts warned that Musk needs to cushion a post-credit slowdown by selling cheaper models.

Another factor is the culture among US investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged and Jeff Bezos had a long reign at the top of Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Indeed, most Tesla shareholders seemed concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company, instead of wanting him to leave altogether.

“Money talks in the US more,” says Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”

Other incentives in Musk’s $1tn pay package include delivering 20m Tesla vehicles, 10m self-driving car subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots and 1m robotaxis. These targets, particularly the robots and autonomous vehicles, require the kind of entrepreneurial and technological chutzpah that Musk has shown at Tesla and his rocket company SpaceX.

Matthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst, says the added value Musk has brought to Tesla’s stock is “undeniable” and has made “many people rich, including himself”.

However, Schmidt adds that Tesla’s core car business has reached its peak and describes the autonomous vehicle plans as “certainly not the best in the market”.

“Have shareholders been naively blind-sided by past achievements rather than the foresight of future prospects? Perhaps!” he says.

Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cb8833e4592b9303ab0d6e5865b64e9e0c5596c/277_0_2586_2069/master/2586.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d5963c151088c8697206d2ca493a6f2",N,,2025-11-07 13:18:55.732080

The Southern Environmental Law Center plans to bring an upcoming Duke Energy program before the North Carolina Court of Appeals. The program, called Clean Energy Impact, is supposed to allow companies and individuals to buy energy credits to support North Carolina’s clean energy transition.

A version of the program is currently available in Florida, where Duke advertises that customers can “offset [their] energy use with clean solar energy” generated in the state. State regulators approved the program’s expansion into North Carolina earlier this year, where it would launch sometime in 2026, replacing Go Renewable.

The SELC filed a Notice of Appeal on behalf of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy last Thursday. The appeal claims that the commission does not require the credits to come from projects beyond what the company is already required to build by law.

“If you’re subscribing to a program, and nothing in Duke’s behavior is changing, there’s no additional solar being procured, you’re not offsetting anything,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at SELC.

But what does that mean? And what even are these energy credits?

What is Duke Energy selling?

Duke Energy is selling a renewable energy credit plus the value of the carbon emissions it avoided when it produced the credit. A renewable energy credit, or REC, is equal to one megawatt hour of renewable energy. If you’re a business, you might buy some of these to meet your company's sustainability goals. They’re not offsets, but a company might buy them and say something like, “We’re powered by 100% green energy.”

But what counts as renewable energy? In North Carolina, the term “renewable energy” casts a wide net. It includes:

Solar and wind energy

Burning the methane gas trapped from hog or human waste

Burning wood pellets

It also includes some surprising additions, such as burning rubber tires (see pg. 24). When we’re talking about Clean Energy Impact, Duke plans to start with RECs that come from solar projects, then broaden the program to include some of the methods mentioned above

In 2023, state legislators expanded RECs to include nuclear energy. The state’s new “Clean Energy Portfolio Standard” included renewables as well, although that category still includes generation techniques that release carbon dioxide and other air pollutants as byproducts, such as biogas and, well, tires.

In other states, such as California, RECs included “avoided carbon emissions.” This refers to the carbon emissions the utility didn’t release when it chose renewable energy over burning fossil fuels. This is measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide.

When North Carolina legislators created RECs in 2007, they excluded “avoided carbon” from the definition, writing that “a 'renewable energy certificate' does not include the related emission reductions, including, but not limited to, reductions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, mercury, or carbon dioxide.”

What Duke sells is a little different than what North Carolina calls a “REC.” Clean Energy Environmental Attributes, or CEEAs, are Duke’s energy credits that include one megawatt-hour of renewable energy, plus additional characteristics such as the emissions the utility avoided when it generated that unit of energy. In that way, they’re more similar to the RECs that other states offer, though Duke’s new credits aren’t going to be certified by Green-e® Energy, a third-party organization that verifies that a credit hasn’t already been used for something else, like regulatory compliance.

The RECs that Duke sells under its existing program, Go Renewable, are certified, but they don’t come with the guarantee that the utility generated them in-state.

Duke plans to sell these CEEAs in 250-kilowatt-hour “blocks,” so folks can purchase fractions of a total credit.

Making an appeal based on simple addition

So, why is SACE appealing state regulators’ decision to approve Clean Energy Impact? At the crux of their argument is an idea called “regulatory surplus.”

When state legislators set North Carolina’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal, they also directed state regulators to develop a voluntary program with Duke Energy that allows residential, commercial and industrial customers to buy RECS “to offset their energy consumption.”

“The word offset has to mean something,” Jimenez said.

Every couple of years, Duke Energy proposes a new resource plan, which the Utilities Commission considers and votes on. The plan states Duke Energy will build or procure a certain amount of clean energy. For example, the 2023 resource plan ordered the utility to add 3,460 megawatts of new solar to the grid by 2031. The question that SACE is asking is: If I buy a REC, does that money go toward those megawatts? Or does it go toward the procurement of clean energy in addition to those 3,460 MW?

Imagine a pie. This pie is the cost of building 3,460 megawatts of solar energy. Normally, ratepayers within a given customer class (residential, commercial or industrial) would eat an identical slice of that payment pie. But with Clean Energy Impact, you could choose to eat more of that pie. Either way, the pie’s gonna get eaten, but you could say you ate more of that pie and even get a certificate that says you did.

It’s a problem of “additionality” — does the program create additional renewable energy resources, or would Duke Energy have built or procured these resources anyway? Duke responded to a WFAE inquiry that “the program was not designed to offer additionality.” State regulators noted that “CEEAs from the [Clean Energy Impact] Program will be applied by Duke towards Duke’s compliance with the Carbon Plan and will not constitute procurements over-and-above Duke’s compliance obligations under the Carbon Plan.” Duke’s resource plan is also called its “Carbon Plan.”

The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy wrote in an earlier filing that “the CEI Program has the potential to mislead customers into believing that the CEEAs they purchase are surplus to regulation.”

“Duke’s new customer program undermines the trust of North Carolinians seeking to protect their families and future generations from the consequences of climate-warming carbon pollution,” said Stacey Washington, clean energy and equity director with SACE, in a written statement.

SACE isn’t alone. The North Carolina Public Staff, the state agency that represents ratepayers, said “participants could mistakenly believe that their participation in the Program would support additional development of renewable energy in the State.”

Then-commissioner Jeffrey A. Hughes wrote in his dissenting opinion that the CEEAs have “not been shown to provide a meaningful public or private benefit to customers.”

“It appears to be nothing more than an accounting exercise that will require implementation resources and funds that could be better spent in other ways to have a more impactful reduction on carbon emissions,” Hughes wrote.

But it didn’t have to be this way, as Hughes goes on to point out. Duke and the commission could have designed credits that accelerated the buildout of renewable resources, even if those resources would have been built eventually anyway. Alternatively, the program could have funded new behind-the-meter resources, like rooftop solar. In either example, buying the credits would have reduced carbon emissions.

During its resource planning, Duke Energy chooses resources based on the “least cost” pathway to reliable energy and regulatory compliance. When asked if the utility included the sale of RECs or CEEAs when forecasting the cost of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind, the company responded that it did not.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fbf0352/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4800x2520+0+340/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F93%2F3411f8fe463bbf0969ef175ee114%2Fduke-energy-solar-panels01.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:07:11.746146

Even if the F-150 Lightning gets dropped, which hasn’t been decided yet, Ford won’t give up on EVs.

Demand for electric trucks is falling across the nation: Ram notably canceled the battery-powered version of the 1500 earlier in 2025, and the lack of interest is making it tough for Ford to justify spending money on the Lightning.

Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the Wall Street Journal wrote that Ford executives “are in active discussions” about the truck’s future. Lightning production has been on hiatus since October 2025 due to a shortage of aluminum, which is widely used in every current-generation F-150, and Ford is debating whether it’s worth resuming production once the situation improves. The brand sold 1500 units of the Lightning in October 2025, compared to about 66,000 examples of the gasoline-powered F-Series pickup.

On paper, the case against the Lightning is pretty strong. EV sales have dropped recently, which explains why the list of companies that have softened or rolled back their electric-only plans is fairly long. The truck segment has been hit particularly hard as relatively high prices, limited driving range, and below-average towing and hauling capabilities keep buyers on the gasoline- or hybrid-powered side of the segment. Ford has previously had to pause F-150 Lightning production to keep inventory levels in check.

Even if the F-150 Lightning gets dropped, which hasn’t been decided yet, Ford won’t give up on EVs. It’s still planning to build an electric compact pickup with a base price of about $30,000, according to the same report. This strategy falls in line with Ford CEO Jim Farley’s recent comments that American drivers want smaller, more affordable EVs that they can use to commute in rather than big, expensive models.

Ford has logged $13 billion in EV losses since 2023, according to the Wall Street Journal, so the writing may have been on the wall years ago. The brand hasn’t announced what’s next for the F-150 Lightning, however, and a spokesperson that Hagerty reached out to refused to confirm or deny the report.

“We have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center (REVC) back up at the right time, but don’t have an exact date at this time,” a spokesperson told Hagerty.

It’s not just Ford whose electric pickups haven’t struck a chord with buyers. General Motors sells the Chevrolet Silverado EV, the GMC Sierra EV, and the GMC Hummer EV, and none have lived up to the lofty volume expectations set for them years ago. Sales of the three trucks combined totaled about 1800 units in October 2025, the Wall Street Journal wrote, which represents a droplet in the proverbial pickup bucket. Executives are now asking themselves the same question as their counterparts at Ford: What’s the point?

MONTREAL, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: HPQ, OTCQB: HPQFF, FRA: O08), a technology company driving innovation in advanced materials and critical process development, welcomes the Government of Canada’s 2025 Federal Budget, which introduces $141 billion in new spending to strengthen domestic industrial capacity, expand clean-energy infrastructure, and accelerate the commercialization of next-generation technologies.

HPQ CEO Bernard Tourillon said the budget’s focus on productivity, clean manufacturing, and Canadian supply resilience sends a clear signal: Canada wants to build things again, and it’s ready to back innovators turning R&D into industrial reality.

Bernard Tourillon, President and CEO of HPQ Silicon Inc, said:

This budget is good for companies like HPQ because it recognizes that real growth happens when ideas become assets,

“Our three core technology pillars: Fumed Silica, HPQ ENDURA+ Batteries, and METAGENE™ Hydrogen, are exactly the kind of made-in-Canada, clean-industrial projects the government wants to see scale. The measures announced this week make it easier, faster, and more competitive to build that capacity here at home.”

FUMED SILICA: Reshoring High-Value Materials to North America

HPQ’s proprietary Fumed Silica Reactor technology transforms quartz in one step into fumed silica, without the need for toxic feedstocks. The budget’s Productivity Super-Deduction and emphasis on clean-power infrastructure directly support HPQ’s plan to establish the only domestic production in Canada, replacing imports from the United States, China and Europe [see October 23, 2025, release for latest development on this technology].

Tourillon explained,

The government is lowering the cost of capital for companies investing in clean manufacturing,

“That means every dollar we spend building fumed-silica reactors or downstream finishing equipment goes further—while Canada’s push for low-carbon power ensures our process remains one of the cleanest in the world.”

HPQ ENDURA+ Batteries: Building Domestic Energy Storage

The budget’s Defence Industrial Strategy and Buy Canadian procurement rule create strong demand channels for home-grown energy storage. HPQ’s ENDURA+ GEN3 silicon-anode lithium-ion cells, now in industrial testing in both 18650 and 21700 formats, align perfectly with this policy [see October 30, 2025, release for latest development on this technology].

Tourillon noted,

We see a clear intersection between the government’s procurement priorities and our technology,

“HPQ ENDURA+ delivers higher energy density, longer cycle life, and the advantage of being manufactured in Canada. From defence and telecommunications to mobility and grid storage, there’s now a policy framework encouraging those sectors to source domestically.”

METAGENE™ Hydrogen: Powering Canada’s Clean-Fuel Future

Under the budget’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy, hydrogen is identified as a critical pillar of the clean-economy transition. HPQ, through its exclusive North American license from Novacium SAS for the METAGENE™ technology, is ideally positioned to manufacture and deploy this proprietary hydrogen production process in Canada. The on-demand, autonomous, and low-carbon nature of METAGENE™ not only aligns with Ottawa’s clean-fuel and industrial-decarbonization goals but is also exceptionally well suited to Canada’s vast geography and distributed energy needs [see June 10, 2025, release for latest development on this technology].

Tourillon, said:

Hydrogen isn’t just an energy source; it’s a strategic asset,

“METAGENE™ gives Canada a path to produce safely and on demand clean hydrogen locally, without depending on the massive infrastructure required for traditional Hydrogen production processes. The incentives outlined in this budget make domestic deployment and scale-up significantly more achievable.”

Positioned for Canada’s Next Industrial Phase

The 2025 Federal Budget marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s shift from policy ambition to industrial execution. Its new investment tools (accelerated write-offs, refundable tax credits, and national procurement preferences) are designed to anchor clean-technology manufacturing on Canadian soil.

For HPQ, these measures reinforce a strategy already in motion:

advancing Fumed Silica production that reduces reliance on imports,

scaling HPQ ENDURA+ cell manufacturing that supports energy storage and mobility, and

deploying METAGENE™ Hydrogen systems that enable low-carbon fuel generation.

Tourillon concluded,

HPQ has been building toward this kind of industrial landscape for years,

“This budget confirms that Canada is serious about translating innovation into domestic capacity—and HPQ is ideally positioned to turn that vision into results.”

Duke Energy on Friday reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81 for the third quarter, up by 11% from the same period a year earlier.

The earnings also beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.75 per share.

The higher earnings for the third quarter “were driven by the implementation of new rates and riders, along with higher retail sales volumes,” said Duke Energy, whose electric utilities serve 8.6 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, and collectively own 55,100 megawatts (MW) of energy capacity.

“As load growth materializes across our jurisdictions, we are expecting our new five-year capital plan to be between $95 and $105 billion when we refresh the plan in February, increasing the largest capital plan in the industry,” Duke Energy president and CEO Harry Sideris said in a statement.

In August, Duke Energy agreed to sell an indirect 19.7% stake in its Florida business to infrastructure investor Brookfield for $6 billion in cash, part of which will fund Duke’s increased capital spending plan for the next five years.

A total of $2 billion of the proceeds from the transaction will fund Duke Energy’s increased $87 billion, current five-year capital plan, while the remaining $4 billion will be used to displace holding company debt, the firm said.

In recent months, U.S. power utilities have announced billions of U.S. dollars in capital plans until the end of the decade and are getting a lot of requests from Big Tech for new power capacity in certain areas as the surge in AI and the expansion of data centers drive demand.

Electric utilities in the United States are set to spend $212.1 billion in capex this year alone, which would be a 22.3% annual increase, as they race to secure new electricity supply for data centers, the Financial Times has reported, citing data from Jefferies.

Aubeny said the offshore wind industry is expected to grow significantly, with an estimated 270,000 megawatts of floating wind capacity by 2050.
This expansion will demand a large number of anchors — about 40,000 for the projected 13,500 floating wind turbines, roughly three anchors per turbine.
Aubeny and his team developed a reliable and affordable anchoring solution that optimizes offshore wind farms, boosts geotechnical efficiency and promotes the broader adoption of sustainable energy.
The system’s versatility makes it suited for other offshore enterprises beyond wind energy.","As the race to harness offshore wind power accelerates, a Texas A&M University civil engineering professor is anchoring innovation, literally.

Dr. Charles Aubeny, a professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, has developed an anchoring system to securely and affordably moor thousands of floating wind turbines in deep ocean waters. The innovative Deeply Embedded Ring Anchor (DERA) system provides a more efficient solution than traditional anchors created for the oil and gas industry, which are not ideal for extensive renewable energy initiatives.

Aubeny began exploring the concept around 2017. His lab’s research, including a collaboration with partners at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Maine and the University of California, Davis, demonstrated that a key to higher efficiency is deep embedment. Subsequent development of the concept led to a commercialization effort with Dr. Junho Lee, a recently graduated doctoral student.

Aubeny said the offshore wind industry is expected to grow significantly, with an estimated 270,000 megawatts of floating wind capacity by 2050. This expansion will demand a large number of anchors — about 40,000 for the projected 13,500 floating wind turbines, roughly three anchors per turbine. In comparison, a typical oil and gas project usually needs 12 to 20 anchors. This scale of renewable energy demands a new approach.

“The existing anchors, which were largely developed for oil and gas applications, were not particularly economical, and they didn’t really need to be,” he said. “Anchors for a multi-billion-dollar oil production system are less than 1% of the cost. Oil companies have little motivation to try to sharpen the pencil and cut costs on efficiency. But for floating renewables, the mooring and anchoring system is about 15 to 20% of the project cost.”

Anchor strength increases the deeper it is embedded in the soil. Achieving deep embedment in a marine environment turns out to be a challenging task, but recent research has demonstrated that it is feasible using a novel follower system to drive the anchor deep below the seabed surface with existing marine equipment. This deep placement allows the anchor to be significantly smaller and more compact than traditional anchor designs, resulting in substantial cost savings and reduced logistical efforts.

One major benefit of the DERA system is its adaptability across different seabed conditions. The anchor can be installed in soft clay using suction techniques or in sand and layered soils using vibratory methods. This flexibility is especially valuable in regions like Taiwan and South Korea, where sandy soils are prone to geohazard risks such as earthquake-induced liquefaction and erosion from strong currents. Because DERA is embedded deep below the seabed, it remains unaffected by surface-level geohazards, ensuring a high load capacity and exceptional reliability.

DERA’s compact size addresses logistical issues and bypasses infrastructure problems by reducing the need for support vessels and allowing construction at existing plants.

“The idea is to have a small, efficient anchor that solves a host of problems,” Aubeny explained. “It allows you to use existing fabrication plants, reduces demand on port facilities and minimizes the need for specialized marine vessels.”

The DERA addresses the need for renewable energy innovation. Aubeny and his team developed a reliable and affordable anchoring solution that optimizes offshore wind farms, boosts geotechnical efficiency and promotes the broader adoption of sustainable energy.

Workers must navigate high-voltage systems, automated processes and digital quality controls that bear little resemblance to the combustion engine factories of previous generations. Georgia has just opened a facility designed to bridge that gap.

The Hyundai Mobility Training Centre, unveiled on 5th November in Ellabell, represents the state's first purpose-built EV training facility. Positioned adjacent to Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Bryan County, the 89,000 sq ft centre can accommodate 824 trainees simultaneously, preparing them for roles at the Metaplant and its network of affiliate companies.

""With record-breaking economic development statewide, our focus has never wavered from bringing quality jobs to hardworking Georgians and connecting them to the skills needed for success,"" said Governor Brian Kemp. ""The Hyundai Mobility Training Centre of Georgia will give thousands of people over the years the knowledge they need to benefit from this generational project.""

The timing proves significant. Hyundai recently announced expansion plans to incorporate hybrid vehicle production at the Metaplant, requiring the training infrastructure to adapt beyond its original electric-only mandate. The facility's flexible design anticipates this evolution, though the immediate focus remains on battery-electric manufacturing processes.

Georgia's EV workforce infrastructure reaches completion

Georgia Quick Start, the state's workforce development programme operating under the Technical College System of Georgia, manages the facility. The programme holds the distinction of being America's oldest workforce training initiative and claims multiple awards from site selection consultants, though such accolades matter less than the practical challenge ahead.

""The Hyundai Mobility Training Centre of Georgia represents our commitment to investing in people as we continue to create high-paying American jobs,"" said José Muñoz, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company. ""As we expand production at HMGMA, one of the most advanced facilities in the world, we need a workforce equipped with the skills to build next-generation vehicles with next-generation production processes.

""Our partnership with Georgia Quick Start ensures our Meta Pros have access to world-class training that will help them succeed and help Georgia lead in advanced manufacturing. A special thank you to Governor Kemp, Commissioner Wilson, and the economic development team in Georgia for their ongoing support. It's a great time to be with Hyundai in Georgia.""

Hyundai ups US bet to $26bn

Despite an immigration raid at its Georgia plant, Hyundai Motor Group boosts US investment to $26bn, including a $2.7bn EV expansion, to counter tariffs and leverage EV incentives, spotlighting labour reliance issues.

The facility emerges from direct collaboration between Quick Start's training professionals and Hyundai's engineering teams, ensuring the simulated environment reflects actual production conditions rather than theoretical approximations.

Training capacity designed to support 8,500 manufacturing jobs

Hyundai projects its Georgia operation will generate approximately 8,500 jobs by 2031. The training centre must therefore function as a continuous pipeline rather than a one-time preparation exercise for automotive production. Workers will cycle through multiple training modules, each designed to build specific competencies required for different stages of EV assembly.

""This centre is about giving Georgians the tools to build their own futures, right here at home,"" said Greg Dozier, Commissioner of the Technical College System of Georgia. ""It reflects Georgia's commitment to innovation, accessibility, and long-term economic opportunity.""

The infrastructure includes a High Voltage Battery and Safety Lab, addressing what may be the most critical safety differential between traditional and EV manufacturing. Workers handling battery systems must understand electrical risks that rarely existed on conventional assembly lines. A VR Experience Lab provides simulated safety scenarios and hazard identification training without exposing trainees to actual danger.

Simulated production lines mirror Metaplant operations

The facility's centrepiece consists of two distinct production training systems. The STEP Line (Safe Transition for Efficient Production), functions as an introductory environment where workers develop timing, coordination and spatial awareness in a controlled digital setting. Trainees progress to the IMPACT Line (Immersive Manufacturing Process and Conveyor Training), which replicates full-scale production conditions. This moving line incorporates 53 integrated assembly activities and an embedded quality verification system, mirroring the actual Metaplant workflow.

GM and Hyundai form a wide-ranging new partnership, and Toyota reinvents its Kentucky plant to pioneer global manufacturing standards

""Our subject matter experts partnered directly with HMGMA to learn the skills its Meta Pros will need when they hit the production floor,"" said Scott McMurray, Quick Start Deputy Commissioner. ""Our team has simulated those processes in a safe, hands-on training environment.""

Beyond assembly training, the centre houses an Automation and Mechatronics Lab focused on programmable logic controllers, sensors, motion systems and industrial automation protocols. These technologies increasingly define modern automotive manufacturing, where human workers collaborate with robotic systems rather than operate independently.

Supporting facilities include a 5,764 sq ft multipurpose space designated the Momentum Room, six flexible classrooms, and specialised labs for robotics, welding and paint processes. The centre even deploys a robotic dog for advanced automation training, though the practical applications of this particular technology remain to be demonstrated in actual production environments.

Hybrid vehicle expansion demands flexible training approach

The recent announcement of hybrid vehicle production at the Metaplant adds complexity to the training mandate. Hybrid powertrains combine combustion engines with electric drive systems, requiring workers to understand both traditional mechanical assembly and high-voltage electrical integration. The training centre's flexible design theoretically accommodates this dual requirement, though the specific curriculum adaptations have yet to be detailed.

""This training centre gives us confidence that we'll have the trained talent needed to shape the future of mobility and American manufacturing, right here in Southeast Georgia.""

Ultimately, it will be quality metrics, efficiency rates and safety records which reveal whether simulated training environments adequately prepare workers for the pressures and complexities of actual EV manufacturing.

The Trump administration’s tariffs aimed at promoting U.S. manufacturing are a major factor, prompting a $9.5 billion hit for the Japanese company’s full year results, Toyota estimates.

The factory in Liberty has about 2,000 workers assembling battery components for the Corolla Cross hybrid electric vehicle and, starting in September, for Camrys made in Kentucky, Toyota said in July.

Many data centers are affiliated with well-resourced companies that pride themselves on innovation.
Texas, for example, recently enacted legislation allowing data centers to connect to the grid but be subject to curtailment.
While some other state public utilities commissions and utilities are contemplating similar arrangements for data centers, most are still operating under old models and assumptions.","Alexandra Klass is the James G. Degnan Professor of Law at Michigan Law, and Dave Owen is the Albert Abramson ’54 Distinguished Professor of Law at UC Law San Francisco.

The United States faces massive growth in electricity demand. If utilities’ projections are right, data centers will drive much of that growth. And if utilities try to meet that demand in traditional ways, the results could be bad for consumers, the environment and the tech industry.

Those traditional ways assume that utilities must meet the needs of electricity customers at all times. This requires utilities to build new power plants and transmission and distribution lines and (in most states) pass those costs, plus a profit margin, on to consumers. Utilities also will not allow major new users to connect to the grid until those users’ needs can be met.

These principles are a poor fit for the present moment. Building new power plants and transmission lines has become increasingly difficult. If data centers must wait until that infrastructure is fully built, they may wait for years. Worse, utilities and government officials are citing the potential data-center boom as a reason to extend the life of old, expensive, and heavily polluting coal plants or to build new gas plants. If they do so, and if they pass those costs on to consumers, retail electricity prices and pollution will rise.

And if current demand projections turn out to be overestimates — which has happened during past tech booms — consumers will pay for new power plants that never needed to be built.

But this unfortunate scenario is not inevitable. We are scholars of energy, natural resources, and environmental law, and in a paper we explore a better way of meeting this moment. Our inspiration comes from legal systems for allocating water, particularly in the American West, and natural gas. For both resources, intermittent scarcity has often been assumed, and legal systems evolved to manage shortages. These systems provide instructive models for electricity.

Allocation systems for water and natural gas have a few key elements. First, they generally allow new users to connect to the system even if supplies won’t always meet those users’ demand. Second, resource managers can curtail users’ access in times of shortage. And third, importantly, these systems allow and encourage users to find innovative ways to insure against uncertainty.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

For example, a water user who holds a “junior” — and therefore relatively insecure — water right but wants highly secure deliveries could contract with a more “senior” right-holder for additional water in times of scarcity at a mutually agreeable price. Or the junior right-holder might construct additional storage facilities or water-recycling facilities to help it through times of need. A combination of trading and innovation thus creates security for users and makes more efficient use of the resource, while alleviating the need to find expensive new supplies.

The same concepts hold promise for electricity. Instead of waiting five years for electric utilities to build expensive new gas plants, state regulators and utilities could allow a data center to connect to the grid but be subject to curtailment. Knowing that risk, the data center could contract with demand-response providers, who specialize in freeing up electricity through short-term shifts in the timing or level of use, to provide backup supplies. Or the data center might build its own solar-and-storage resources. Many data centers are affiliated with well-resourced companies that pride themselves on innovation. They can find creative solutions if legal systems encourage them to do so.

Already, this model is emerging. Texas, for example, recently enacted legislation allowing data centers to connect to the grid but be subject to curtailment. But Texas remains an outlier. While some other state public utilities commissions and utilities are contemplating similar arrangements for data centers, most are still operating under old models and assumptions. We urge other state commissions and legislatures to use their authority to begin to fashion similar creative solutions. State action in this area can make progress even while regulators and stakeholders debate whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission organizations also have Federal Power Act jurisdiction to act, as the U.S. Department of Energy recently proposed.

Is history repeating itself? The last time a technology boom drove a surge in gas generation, it didn’t turn out so well, but that’s not stopping investors from pouring billions into new and expanded thermal generation.

Here are the numbers that jumped out from some of the biggest stories of the week.

By the Numbers

$1.93 million/MW

The price gas power merger and acquisitions have reached in some markets, according to energy analytics firm Enverus. The artificial intelligence boom, along with expectations of increased manufacturing and electrification, is driving a surge in natural gas investment, but thermal generation remains risky, some analysts say, drawing parallels to the dot com bubble at the turn of the century.

26 GW

About how much generating capacity the U.S. added between January and August of this year, led by solar and wind, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s monthly infrastructure report. That figure does not include storage. In February, the Energy Information Administration said it expected the U.S. grid to add 63 GW of new utility-scale electric-generating capacity, including storage, up from 48.6 GW in 2024. China installed between 430 GW and 470 GW in 2024, 356 GW of which was from non-hydro renewables.

48.7%

The Institute for Supply Management’s latest Purchasing Managers’ Index for the month of October, a key metric for measuring the health of the manufacturing sector. A PMI index below 50% indicates an industry in contraction. Manufacturing, along with artificial intelligence and electrification, is one of the main drivers behind projections of surging load growth in some parts of the country. October marked the 8th consecutive month of contraction for the sector.

$84/MWh

How much Dominion now expects the levelized cost of electricity generated by its 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project to be after the One Bill Beautiful Bill Act cut renewable energy tax credits. That estimate is within the $80/MWh to $90/MWh range Dominion envisioned in its 2021 initial filing and would support a net monthly customer bill savings of 63 cents, the utility says. The project is still scheduled to come online in late 2026 or early 2027, executives say.

949

Miles of new 765-kV lines included in an $8.6 billion transmission plan approved by the Southwest Power Pool board of directors this week. SPP says its planned 765-kV regional transmission “backbone” will be able to carry four times the power its existing 345 kV lines do, and do so more efficiently. 765 kV transmission lines are the highest operating voltages in the U.S. but are new in both SPP and in the neighboring Electric Reliability Council of Texas market.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gfYa5mAqSbzOt2vlW1hDsaPXUYEd2zeIjzeWhAMTJQE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CYXN0cm9wX0VuZXJneV9DZW50ZXJfLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-07 15:00:39.809551

Speaking at Redhills in Durham this week on the 40th anniversary of the Miners’ Strike, which ripped the heart out of many communities and sent the region’s once vast coalfield community into terminal decline, he said: “A previous generation was let down by the last transition, when the Government failed to support communities in deindustrialisation.

“The changes happened without their consent - it didn’t happen with them, it happened to them - and I see the scars of that today.

“That’s why, at this moment in time, the green industrial revolution is so important in terms of the positive impacts it can make to our local communities, and it is so important we explain that to people.

""We expect 20,000 green jobs to come to the North East by 2030 as we train up a whole new generation of workers in good, well-paid jobs.

""In Hartlepool, that's going to mean well-paid, secure jobs in the offshore wind sector, in carbon capture and in nuclear.

""There'll be plenty of other jobs in the area as well that will come from the supply chain involved in constructing these projects and running them when they're operational.

“It’s going to have a great impact and instead of being in very clustered places - which tends to be the case with the coal, oil and gas industries - these new clean energy jobs will be spread much more evenly around the North East.

“We want to avoid the mistakes of the past, where we saw deindustrialisation happening without a clear plan of what comes next.

“I’m interested in reindustrialisation of the North East, not deindustrialisation - I don’t want a single factory to be closing because of the clean energy transition.”

McDonald, who has strong family connections to the coal industry, was delivering a keynote speech at Redhills, home of the Durham Miners Association, at a clean energy conference being held by the Durham Energy Institute.

Redhills itself is a metaphor for the green transition, having fallen into disuse before being restored and reopened, powered almost entirely by renewable energy.

McDonald, who has been promoted to the Government’s Under Secretary of State, (Department for Energy Security and Net Zero), recently oversaw the release of the first-ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy, with over 400,000 extra jobs by 2030.

The plan highlighted 31 priority occupations, such as plumbers, electricians and welders who will be particularly in demand and announced five new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train the next generation of workers.

McDonald said: “The green energy sector is growing three times faster than the rest of the economy, so if you’re looking for growth, that’s where growth is.

“Wind and solar are the cheapest forms of energy that we have.

“We know it is a big change and a big challenge in transitioning but it’s also a real opportunity.

“Britain is a nation with a coastline that makes it perfect for renewable energy and we plan to double investment in green energy and become a world leader so that investors have long-term confidence in the UK.

“We have the biggest market in the world for the offshore industry but we want it not just to supply British businesses and homes, but to provide jobs here.

“We want the supply chain to be captured as much as possible so that the jobs are here - good, long-term, well-paid jobs and I want to see the North East really benefit from that.""

McDonald’s keynote speech was made at a conference bringing groups from across society together at the former ‘Pitman’s Parliament' to discuss the latest developments in renewable energy, including mine water heating, hydrogen technology, offshore wind, clean shipping and sustainable energy solutions for the NHS.

The event also focused on community involvement, with workshops led by pupils from Prince Bishops Primary School in Bishop Auckland, creative writing sessions on the climate crisis, and community energy consultations.

McDonald said meetings like the one at Redhills had a very important role to play in making sure that the public could see the clear benefits of clean energy and get on board with the drive to decarbonise.

He said: “I’m disappointed that there’s a political fracture just now because we used to have a consensus around the energy transition in the UK.

“Some political parties are keen to move away from that climate consensus and, in my view, that's not because they care about communities in the North East.

“It's because fundamentally they are responding to big corporations who are concerned that maybe their global trading ambitions won’t be realised in the same way.

“All I’m concerned about is delivering good jobs in the North East and getting people's energy bills down, and the green energy transition is how we’re going to do that.

“Where we have high energy costs, it is because we've been reliant on international gas markets; those prices have been driven up by Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

“But by having our own domestic energy again, just as we had before we dug it out of the ground, now we will harness it from the sun and the wind and have our own nuclear power

“It means that as well as owning our own domestic energy and energy security, we’ll deliver lower-cost energy for people and for businesses and create good jobs locally.

“It’s such an opportunity for the North East and for the country and I support anyone who is trying to help people in the region see that and realise the opportunities the North East has to become a major player in the energy sector again for the first time in generations.”","https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjJiYjQ0NDMyLTdmNzEtNDdhOS1iMzM4LTYyNDFkMTIyOWE5ODo0OTRmN2I3NS03NzZiLTQzMmYtOTExZS1iMGIyZDk5MmU3MDU=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-11-07 17:59:20.701166

But even as building owners face mounting pressure to comply with stricter energy codes, making smart decisions about how to invest in efficiency is a major challenge.

Lamarr.AI, born in part from MIT research, is making the process of finding ways to improve the energy efficiency of buildings as easy as clicking a button. When customers order a building review, it triggers a coordinated symphony of drones, thermal and visible-range cameras, and artificial intelligence designed to identify problems and quantify the impact of potential upgrades. Lamarr.AI's technology also assesses structural conditions, creates detailed 3D models of buildings, and recommends retrofits. The solution is already being used by leading organizations across facilities management as well as by architecture, engineering, and construction firms.

""We identify the root cause of the anomalies we find,"" says CEO and co-founder Tarek Rakha PhD '15. ""Our platform doesn't just say, 'This is a hot spot and this is a cold spot.' It specifies 'This is infiltration or exfiltration. This is missing insulation. This is water intrusion.' The detected anomalies are also mapped to a 3D model of the building, and there are deeper analytics, such as the cost of each retrofit and the return on investment.""

To date, the company estimates its platform has helped clients across health care, higher education, and multifamily housing avoid over $3 million in unnecessary construction and retrofit costs by recommending targeted interventions over costly full-system replacements, while improving energy performance and extending asset life. For building owners managing portfolios worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Lamarr.AI's approach represents a fundamental shift from reactive maintenance to strategic asset management.

The founders, who also include MIT Professor John Fernández and Research Scientist Norhan Bayomi SM '17, PhD '21, are thrilled to see their technology accelerating the transition to more energy-efficient and higher-performing buildings.

""Reducing carbon emissions in buildings gets you the greatest return on investment in terms of climate interventions, but what has been needed are the technologies and tools to help the real estate and construction sectors make the right decisions in a timely and economical way,"" Fernández says.

Automating building scans

Bayomi and Rakha completed their PhDs in the MIT Department of Architecture's Building Technology Program. For her thesis, Bayomi developed technology to detect features of building exteriors and classify thermal anomalies through scans of buildings, with a specific focus on the impact of heat waves on low-income communities. Bayomi and her collaborators eventually deployed the system to detect air leaks as part of a partnership with a community in New York City.

After graduating MIT, Rakha became an assistant professor at Syracuse University. In 2015, together with fellow Syracuse University Professor Senem Velipasalar, he began developing his concept for drone-based building analytics - an idea that later received support through a grant from New York State's Department of Economic Development. In 2019, Bayomi and Fernández joined the project, and the team received a $1.8 million research award from the U.S. Department of Energy.

""The technology is like giving a building an MRI using drones, infrared imaging, visible light imaging, and proprietary AI that we developed through computer vision technology, along with large language models for report generation,"" Rakha explains.

""When we started the research, we saw firsthand how vulnerable communities were suffering from inefficient buildings, but couldn't afford comprehensive diagnostics,"" Bayomi says. ""We knew that if we could automate this process and reduce costs while improving accuracy, we'd unlock a massive market. Now we're seeing demand from everyone, from municipal buildings to major institutional portfolios.""

Lamarr.AI was officially founded in 2021 to commercialize the technology, and the founders wasted no time tapping into MIT's entrepreneurial ecosystem. First, they received a small seed grant from the MIT Sandbox Innovation Fund. In 2022, they won the MITdesignX prize and were semifinalists in the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. The founders named the company after Hedy Lamarr, the famous actress and inventor of a patented technology that became the basis for many modern secure communications.

Current methods for detecting air leaks in buildings utilize fan pressurizers or smoke. Contractors or building engineers may also spot-check buildings with handheld infrared cameras to manually identify temperature differences across individual walls, windows, and ductwork.

Lamarr.AI's system can perform building inspections far more quickly. Building managers can order the company's scans online and select when they'd like the drone to fly. Lamarr.AI partners with drone companies worldwide to fly off-the-shelf drones around buildings, providing them with flight plans and specifications for success. Images are then uploaded onto Lamarr.AI's platform for automated analysis.

""As an example, a survey of a 180,000-square-foot building like the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, which we scanned, produces around 2,000 images,"" Fernández says. ""For someone to go through those manually would take a couple of weeks. Our models autonomously analyze those images in a few seconds.""

After the analysis, Lamarr.AI's platform generates a report that includes the suspected root cause of every weak point found, an estimated cost to correct that problem, and its estimated return on investment using advanced building energy simulations.

""We knew if we were able to quickly, inexpensively, and accurately survey the thermal envelope of buildings and understand their performance, we would be addressing a huge need in the real estate, building construction, and built environment sectors,"" Fernández explains. ""Thermal anomalies are a huge cause of unwanted heat loss, and more than 45 percent of construction defects are tied to envelope failures.""

The ability to operate at scale is especially attractive to building owners and operators, who often manage large portfolios of buildings across multiple campuses.

""We see Lamarr.AI becoming the premier solution for building portfolio diagnostics and prognosis across the globe, where every building can be equipped not just for the climate crisis, but also to minimize energy losses and be more efficient, safer, and sustainable,"" Rakha says.

Building science for everyone

Lamarr.AI has worked with building operators across the U.S. as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.

In June, Lamarr.AI partnered with the City of Detroit, with support from Newlab and Michigan Central, to inspect three municipal buildings to identify areas for improvement. Across two of the buildings, the system identified more than 460 problems like insulation gaps and water leaks. The findings were presented in a report that also utilized energy simulations to demonstrate that upgrades, such as window replacements and targeted weatherization, could reduce HVAC energy use by up to 22 percent.

The entire process took a few days. The founders note that it was the first building inspection drone flight to utilize an off-site operator, an approach that further enhances the scalability of their platform. It also helps further reduce costs, which could make building scans available to a broader swath of people around the world.

""We're democratizing access to very high-value building science expertise that previously cost tens of thousands per audit,"" Bayomi says. ""Our platform makes advanced diagnostics affordable enough for routine use, not just one-time assessments. The bigger vision is automated, regular building health monitoring that keeps facilities teams informed in real-time, enabling proactive decisions rather than reactive crisis management. When building intelligence becomes continuous and accessible, operators can optimize performance systematically rather than waiting for problems to emerge.""",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202511/MIT-LamarrAI-01-press.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 15:01:01.466796

DHL currently operates some 39,000 EVs in pickup and delivery services, representing more than 41% of its fleet. The company plans to raise that proportion to 66% by 2030. New electric trucks and light commercial vehicles are to be deployed across all markets.

The company’s largest sources of emissions are air freight, road transport and facilities. Therefore, the company is investing heavily in technology, renewable energy and sustainable fuels.

“Our emissions peaked in 2021,” said Toby Groom, Global Head of EV Logistics Solutions. “If we want to hit these targets coming down from that 2021 number, we need to reduce our emissions significantly—and we have to have targeted measures to do that.”

“We doubled our electric vehicle fleet between 2021 and 2024,” said Groom. “But this isn’t just about mature markets—we’re rolling out electric vehicles globally. We need structurally sound energy systems to support them, powered by renewable sources, so we’re not shifting emissions from one scope to another.”

Groom acknowledged that electric truck adoption remains challenging: “An electric truck is still two to three times the price of a diesel truck, but that’s early in the evolution.”

DHL is also focusing on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), as air freight makes up 68% of its total emissions. SAF now represents 3.5% of DHL’s total jet fuel mix. The company has partnered with fuel producers including Neste and Shell to scale production and advocate for stronger policy support.

The US$331 million debt from ADB comprises up to US$291 million in local currency financing from ADB’s ordinary capital resources and up to US$40 million from the ADB-administered Leading Asia’s Private Infrastructure Fund 2 (LEAP 2), with ADB arranging the remainder.

The signing of financing agreements was presided by Bhargav Dasgupta, Vice-President for Market Solutions at ADB, and Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO of ReNew.

Sumant Sinha, Founder, Chairman and CEO of ReNew, said, “India is entering a new phase of the clean energy transition under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership. This phase is defined not only by scale, but by reliability and flexibility. This project demonstrates that renewable energy can now be delivered competitively at grid scale as per peak power demand requirements. Our long-standing collaboration with ADB has enabled us to continually push the boundaries of what is possible in clean energy infrastructure, and this partnership reinforces our shared commitment to building a resilient, low-carbon energy system for India.”

“This is the first peak power renewable energy project to be financed by ADB and is expected to generate about 1,641 gigawatt-hours of clean energy per year,” said Mr. Dasgupta. “Combining battery energy storage with wind–solar hybrid systems is a game-changer unlocking dependable clean power, stabilizing the grid, and advancing the country’s renewable energy sector.”

The project deepens a long-standing relationship between ReNew and ADB, which has supported multiple investments aimed at decarbonising India’s power sector. It also builds on the strategic cooperation outlined under a Memorandum of Understanding signed at UNFCCC COP28 to accelerate clean energy deployment and grid transformation.

Earlier this year, in April, ReNew announced US$2.5 billion investment to develop a 2.8 GW hybrid renewable energy complex in Andhra Pradesh, one of India’s largest at a single location. By integrating wind, solar, and battery storage, the project sets a blueprint for firm, dispatchable clean energy, delivering reliable power during peak demand and supporting India’s low-carbon growth. Aligned with the Make in India mission, it will feature 100% domestically manufactured solar panels, advanced tracking systems, and waterless robotic cleaning to maximize output and conserve resources.

The termination will take effect on December 3.

According to Alliance, the contract termination stems from certain milestone dates not being met, making the existing agreement “inoperative”.

The company attributed the missed milestones chiefly to subdued nickel market conditions and the resulting difficulties in securing project financing.

Despite the termination, Alliance said Stellantis remains interested in the NiWest Project and has signalled a willingness to renegotiate offtake terms that would better align with a revised project development timetable and current market dynamics.

Alliance said it will provide further updates as discussions with Stellantis progress.

The company highlighted the nickel rout, noting the commodity’s prices have been under pressure for the past two years, a trend that has constrained funding for new nickel ventures worldwide.

Those conditions have forced the company to delay project development while it seeks suitable financing arrangements aimed at delivering shareholder value.

The company added it is weighing strategic options, including a potential special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction, which could lead to a Nasdaq listing.

Alliance managing director Paul Kopejtka said: “We understand the rationale for the Stellantis decision, and at the same time we recognise that this presents a good opportunity for both sides to negotiate on a new agreement which is more reflective of the revised project development timeline and forward strategy. I firmly believe that the long-term outlook for nickel and cobalt remains positive”

Stellantis and Alliance entered the supply agreement in 2023 for the delivery of 170,000t of nickel sulphate and 12,000t of cobalt sulphate over an initial five‑year term. That volume equated to roughly 40% of the NiWest project’s estimated annual output.

The deal also included a €9.2m equity subscription by Stellantis for an 11.5% stake in Alliance Nickel.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a September 2nd interpretive letter addressing the definition of “Begin Actual Construction” in the Clean Air Act New Source Review (“NSR”) regulations.

The September 2nd letter revised EPA’s view of the phrase “Begin Actual Construction” under the Clean Air Act NSR regulations.

The September 2nd letter arguably narrowed the scope of the phrase “begin actual construction.”

Three environmental organizations transmitted an October 30th letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin challenging the federal agency’s September 9th press release announcing the position, stating in part:

… In reality, there is no new EPA guidance document or rule allowing pre-permit construction. The link to “new guidance” in the above quote takes the reader to a page that says EPA “is providing guidance on a case-by-case basis and intends to propose and finalize a rule in 2026 that would revise the definition of ‘begin actual construction’ in EPA’s NSR regulations.” EPA’s intent to propose a new rule does not qualify as new guidance, and any case-by-case thoughts that EPA is providing is not nationwide guidance and does not have the force of law. Permitting authorities and permit applicants should not be misled into believing that EPA can weaken the Act’s restrictions by issuing a press release or sending letters to permitting agencies.

The organizations transmitting the letter include:

Earthjustice

Natural Resources Defense Council

Sierra Club

(Collectively, “Earthjustice”).

Earthjustice further states that EPA does not have the authority to allow any substantial onsite construction to start on major new polluting facilities without permits mandated by the Clean Air Act. They argue that the Clean Air Act does not limit the requirement for a preconstruction permit to:

… only an ‘emission unit’ in isolation.

The Clean Air Act is noted to bar pre-permit construction of “a major emitting facility” and “new or modified major sources” as opposed to just emission units.

Additional points put forth in the letter include:

In non-attainment areas pre-construction review must also weigh impacts from construction and location of the facility, as opposed to just the emission unit.

A permitting agency in a non-attainment area must determine that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification.

In attainment areas, in advance of any public hearing on whether to grant a construction permit, the agencies must weigh impacts of growth projected for the area and of emissions from facility construction activity on the site.

Earthjustice argues that EPA’s approach would unlawfully allow construction to commence at the facility site and for significant impacts to already occur before the required analyses have been conducted and subjected to a public hearing.

The rationale for pre-construction permitting is stated to also be designed to avoid bias in favor granting a permit merely because an applicant has already invested substantial time and money in site construction before the permitting decision.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:06.901704

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivized high-road jobs standards in renewable energy construction by linking federal tax credits to fair wages and registered apprenticeship programs

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) slashed those incentives, destabilizing Maine’s energy pipeline

Thousands of clean energy jobs for Maine’s electricians, laborers, and other trade workers may be lost and critical training programs will suffer

Maine lawmakers can protect the state’s clean energy future by incentivizing production that meets the needs of workers and ratepayers, comprehensively tracking progress, and proactively enforcing the law to ensure workers and ratepayers get what they deserve

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022, was a landmark piece of legislation that, among other things, linked renewable energy investment to high-quality, family-supporting jobs. It unleashed the rapid production of clean energy and created incentives for projects to pay fair wages and invest in registered apprenticeship programs that train workers for these essential careers.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed in July 2025, will terminate those incentives for wind and solar energy by the end of 2027, five years earlier than previously scheduled, with an exception for projects commencing construction by July 2026. This abrupt change threatens Maine’s growing clean-energy industry, and with it, the high-quality jobs and locally produced energy the IRA helped advance. In the wake of the new federal law, Maine lawmakers must take bold action to maintain progress towards producing more renewable energy, creating good jobs, and lowering prices for energy ratepayers.

Maine’s clean-energy footprint

According to the Climate Jobs National Resource Center, two years after the IRA’s passage, there were 129 incentive-eligible projects in Maine, in planning, under construction, or which had recently been completed. Those projects created more than 4,000 megawatts of clean power, $6.9 billion in associated investment, and more than 8,000 jobs. By May 2025, those figures had grown to an estimated 145 utility-scale projects, more than 9,100 jobs, and nearly 5,000 megawatts of power generation or storage.1 It remains to be seen how many of those projects will not come to fruition because of the new law, but workers in those trades reported a significant slowdown in jobs during negotiations and following passage of the OBBBA.

In addition to lost jobs, the termination of wind and solar energy credits is projected to significantly raise the cost of energy for ratepayers. Analysts project eliminating the IRA’s wind and solar tax credits would increase US household electricity rates by up to 10% or $400 per year by the year 2035.

Maine lawmakers can lead

With the federal government in gridlock, Maine must continue to lead toward creating good jobs while building out renewable energy infrastructure. Last session, lawmakers took important steps: creating the Department of Energy Resources and including prevailing wage requirements and incentives for Project Labor Agreements and utilization of registered apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeship programs; and committing Maine to achieving 100% clean or renewable electricity by 2040. Here are ways lawmakers can continue that progress this session:

Develop a successor to the state’s solar subsidies. Last session, lawmakers voted to phase out Maine’s net energy billing system for community solar farms. While the program incentivized significant solar development, it failed to control costs for ratepayers or incentivize high-road labor standards. As lawmakers work toward a replacement to continue developing clean energy, the interests of consumers and workers must be front-and-center.

Expedite project permitting. Many renewable energy projects take years to get all the permits and approvals ready to even begin construction. Lawmakers should streamline and expedite the permitting and interconnection of clean energy and storage projects to deliver affordable energy to the grid more quickly. Strong labor standards should be attached to that expedited process to ensure quick delivery does not fall on the backs of workers.

Provide cheaper capital to lower costs. Lawmakers should utilize the state’s bonding authority to provide cheaper capital to clean energy development and grid modernization upgrades. This approach could simultaneously save ratepayers due to the lower capital costs compared to private financing sources and allow for stronger, enforceable labor standards on the work itself.

Create a public database of renewable energy projects. LD 1850, introduced by Rep. Kilton Webb, would task state agencies like the Public Utilities Commission and Department of Environmental Protection to propose a system that breaks down information siloes and improves coordination to advance renewable energy projects. The bill passed both legislative chambers but was held and awaits action by Governor Mills.

Proactively enforce existing standards. Existing laws include incentives for energy developers to use high-road labor standards to build future infrastructure. Since 2023, utility-scale renewable energy projects must pay prevailing wages, build out pre-apprenticeship programs, and are incentivized to sign Project Labor Agreements that improve project outcomes and costs. The Department of Labor should take a proactive approach in ensuring those commitments are being met.

Invest in pre-apprenticeship programs. The State has an important role in balancing the supply and demand of skilled workers to build out energy infrastructure. If we make long-term commitments to produce renewable energy in the state, Maine workers will seek careers in the sector. Pre-apprenticeship programs have proven effective at preparing workers for pay-while-you-learn apprenticeships that are critical for successfully completing utility-scale projects.

OEUK outlined in its statement that its new report provides “a blueprint for decision-makers and those navigating the expansion to a broader energy mix” and “details steps to equip the workforce for its essential role in supporting a low-carbon economy across oil and gas, offshore wind, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and hydrogen”.

“Highlighting the potential to grow jobs, ensure good jobs and guard existing jobs, OEUK calls for timely intervention to support a robust domestic energy sector, warning that inaction will lead to an unprecedented exodus of supply chain capability, continued job losses, further loss of critical expertise, and hinder progress toward the UK’s net zero targets,” OEUK said in the statement.

OEUK noted in the statement that, in the past year, more than 55 percent of the UK’s offshore energy firms have reduced their staff headcount, according to a Pulse survey OEUK conducted in October 2025. Looking ahead, nearly 45 percent of surveyed companies are expecting to cut jobs further over the next 12 months if the current policy environment continues, OEUK warned.

OEUK’s Workforce Insight report highlights that the UK’s integrated energy workforce totals 154,000 people. According to the report, there were a total of 40,023 offshore oil and gas workers in 2024, with the bulk of those, 17,957, based in Scotland. The report stated that the integrated energy workforce is highly skilled and adaptable, with around 90 percent of oil and gas competencies transferable to emerging energy fields.

“Ahead of the [UK] budget, OEUK has urged the government to reform the fiscal regime to secure investment, safeguard jobs, and strengthen the UK’s homegrown energy future, arguing that the choice is not between economic growth and climate ambition but how to deliver both,” OEUK said in the statement.

The budget, or financial statement, is a statement made to the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the nation’s finances and the government’s proposals for changes to taxation, the UK parliament website states, adding that the government has announced that the next budget will take place on Wednesday, November 26.

Katy Heidenreich, OEUK’s supply chain and people director, noted in the statement, “the government’s Clean Energy Jobs Plan presents an ambitious goal as the country works towards net zero emissions, energy security, and a strong economy”.

“It’s vital that we ground ambition in reality. The windfall tax is costing jobs and investment and reducing tax revenues that support families, communities, and vital services across the UK,” Heidenreich added.

“Nine out of ten supply chain companies believe growing their business is only possible by finding new markets outside the UK. Many of the renewable energy sector jobs will not materialize before 2030 and we must act now to avoid losing the skilled people who are essential to achieving the UK’s climate ambition,” Heidenreich said.

“We have an incredible opportunity, as we expand and diversify our energy mix across oil and gas, wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. We should build the energy jobs of the future on the shoulders of energy workers today,” the OEUK representative continued.

“With the right policies and investment, the UK can achieve a net addition of jobs, growing the offshore energy workforce from 154,000 today to over 212,000 by 2030, with continued growth in oil and gas playing a central role. OEUK and its members are ready to lead but success depends on decisive action from government, industry, and academia,” Heidenreich went on to state.

Rigzone has contacted the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and HM Treasury (HMT) for comment on OEUK’s statement and Workforce Insight report. At the time of writing, neither have responded to Rigzone.

In a statement made on March 5, which was posted on the UK parliament website, James Murray, now Chief Secretary to the Treasury, noted that the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) was introduced in 2022 “in response to extraordinary profits made by oil and gas companies driven by global events, including resurgent demand for energy post-Covid 19 and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia”.

“The EPL will end in 2030, or earlier if the EPL’s price floor, the Energy Security Investment Mechanism, is triggered,” the statement added.

In that statement, Murray highlighted that HMT and HM Revenue and Customs had published a consultation on how the oil and gas fiscal regime “will respond to future oil and gas price shocks once the EPL ends”. The consultation closed on May 28.

But even with this federal support in place, the nascent industry has been on shaky ground.
Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.
While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.
The DOE’s “hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031.","“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio. In his view, federal funding “makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”

Many see hydrogen as necessary for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify operations, such as steel and glassmaking, as well as some transportation sectors.

Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.

The Biden administration’s hub initiative meant to change that by bringing down the cost of low-carbon hydrogen, which can be produced with renewable energy, nuclear power, or natural gas with carbon capture and storage.

The initiative sparked detailed planning for dozens of projects throughout the hub regions. In Ohio, proposals took on different shapes: One developer wanted to use solar power to make hydrogen for buses in Stark County, while another planned to derive the fuel from a chemical plant’s waste stream. Still others looked to expand storage and refueling operations in central and northeastern Ohio.

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act also created a lucrative federal tax credit for clean-hydrogen projects, an incentive that successful lobbying preserved through the end of 2027 in Republicans’ massive budget bill signed into law in July. But even with this federal support in place, the nascent industry has been on shaky ground. Some high-profile green-hydrogen projects were already floundering before this year.

The Trump administration’s October cancellation of federal dollars for two of the hubs that focused on hydrogen from renewable energy raised urgent questions about the viability of many hydrogen ventures nationwide.

The fate of the other five hubs remains uncertain. Last month, their names appeared on a leaked Energy Department list alongside a note to “terminate,” but the DOE has not confirmed their status.

Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.

There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.

“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.

At the outset, though, the systems planned in central Ohio for Amazon Data Services and Cologix Johnstown will run on natural gas. Eventually, AEP has said, they could switch to run on hydrogen.

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.

Hydrogen also features in vehicle offerings from American Honda Motor Co. Although its hybrid cars that can use either hydrogen or battery electric power are built in Marysville, most of them go to California.

In general, battery-powered electric vehicles are probably the best option for “small mobility,” said Gary Robinson, vice president of sustainability and business development for the company. Indeed, hydrogen cars remain niche at best. But “trucks, buses, industrial equipment — all of those things, in our opinion, are perfect candidates for hydrogen,” Robinson said. The company is exploring shipping and aviation as other potential markets for fuel cells.

Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.

Dayton-based Millennium Reign Energy supplied electrolyzer equipment to provide initial fill-ups for the fuel-cell hybrids that Honda has made in Marysville since last year, and it has provided fueling equipment to other locations in the United States and abroad. The company plans to add two fueling stations for its Emerald H2 network in the Dayton area by April, CEO Chris McWhinney told Canary Media.

Plug Power also relies on electrolyzers to produce its hydrogen. The 28-year-old company’s first big order back in 2007 was for fuel cells to power pallet trucks at a Walmart distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio, said Mike Ahearn, vice president for North American service. He did not talk about projects the company would do as part of ARCH2, if it moves ahead, but he did describe work outside of Ohio.

Plug Power remains on track to start construction next year on a wind-powered hydrogen plant capable of producing around 45 tons per day in Graham, Texas.

“We are on a good trajectory,” Ahearn said, adding that the company’s goal is to turn a profit next year — something it hasn’t done yet over its almost three decades in operation.

Independence Hydrogen, another ARCH2 project-development partner, concentrates on local hydrogen production and distribution. While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.

The company’s method of making the alternative fuel doesn’t fit neatly on the “hydrogen rainbow” that indicates whether production relies on renewable energy or fossil fuels.

Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen. Independence Hydrogen would basically “clean up” the gas by removing water and other impurities and then compress it for transport.

But “I need an offtaker,” said William Lehner, chief strategy officer for the company. “We would love to provide that project.”

Indeed, most companies at last week’s symposium would love more customers, but it’s unclear how quickly interest in the alternative fuel will ramp up if federal funding for ARCH2 and other hydrogen hubs remains in limbo and if tax incentives aren’t extended further.

The DOE’s “hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031. While developers would still cover at least half the project costs at the hubs, federal grants would have reduced total expenses and let them charge customers less for their hydrogen. The hope was that the lower prices would stoke demand.

The Trump administration’s actions to dismantle decarbonization policy also raise questions about clean hydrogen’s future. Without sticks that punish greenhouse gas emissions or carrots that make zero- and low-carbon fuels cheaper, a lot of projects face a difficult road ahead.",https://s3-prod.crainscleveland.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/H2%20with%20renewables_i.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:20.001143

OPAL Fuels missed Wall Street’s revenue targets last quarter but drew attention by increasing renewable natural gas production and securing fresh capital from strategic tax credit sales.

What does this mean?

OPAL Fuels reported $83.36 million in revenue for the third quarter of 2025, just under the $93.07 million consensus and down 1% from a year ago. While the top line was light, the company’s adjusted EBITDA edged past expectations, showing solid cost control at $19.46 million, a touch above estimates. Despite facing softer pricing for D3 RIN credits—a key industry benchmark—OPAL Fuels stuck with its full-year guidance, underscoring management’s confidence. Operationally, renewables output jumped 30% year-over-year, highlighted by the kickoff of new projects like Atlantic RNG and CMS RNG. On the financial side, the firm wrapped up its fourth investment tax credit sale under the Inflation Reduction Act, pocketing over $40 million and setting itself up to tap into new production tax credits before year-end.

Why should I care?

For markets: Mixed signals on clean fuel momentum.

OPAL Fuels ended November 6 trading at $2.02 per share and just 3 times expected earnings over the next year, a drop from earlier this year that shows investor caution. The analyst consensus is split, but a median 12-month price target of $3.50 hints at potential upside if the company delivers on policy-driven growth. Still, muted D3 RIN prices and a split view across renewable fuel peers suggest that investor sentiment around the clean fuel transition remains a bit hesitant.

The bigger picture: Policy tailwinds keep green gas flowing.

Major US policies like the Inflation Reduction Act and the new 45Z production tax credits are shoring up the renewable natural gas sector even as pricing pressure lingers. OPAL Fuels’ recent tax credit windfall and its readiness to tap more credits highlight the stronger financial safety net now available for clean energy firms. Looking ahead, these tailwinds could speed up the US energy transition and influence how quickly investors and industry double down on decarbonization.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L1N3WJ03L_27083628.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=e4c88737eeed52a3c9e478245e01dba1,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:24.241749

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Campaign begins with Yam Jam, a volunteer event in Greenville that packages 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for holiday food boxes

GREENVILLE, S.C., Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That's why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

The big picture: Starting this week, Duke Energy with support from Duke Energy Foundation launches the company's annual monthlong campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities across the state.

The initiative will provide over $600,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

This year's campaign also consists of a contribution of $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: Food pantries and rainy-day funds are drained, and many are unsure when government funding will be available. Though many donors and relief efforts like the One SC Fund have stepped up to support them, many communities still need an extra hand.

Zoom in: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That's 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

Bottom line: Throughout November, Duke Energy will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others.

The monthlong campaign began Nov. 6, when Duke Energy joined Mill Village Farms, WYFF, Bon Secours Wellness Arena and nearly 200 volunteers from dozens of companies and organizations around Greenville to bag nearly 50,000 pounds of sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving food boxes to be distributed by FoodShare South Carolina hubs and other food programs across South Carolina.

Additionally, Duke Energy Foundation contributed $105,000 to FoodShare South Carolina organizations across the company's service territory, including $39,000 to Mill Village Farms.

What they're saying

Dan Weidenbenner, executive director of Mill Village Farms and Mill Village Ministries: ""As we enter the holiday season, Mill Village Ministries remains steadfast in our commitment to ensuring food access for every resident in our community. In the wake of reduced federal support, Mill Village Farms' FoodShare program is stepping up to fill the gap – bringing fresh, affordable produce directly to neighborhoods where it's needed most. Thanks to the continued partnership of Duke Energy and the generosity of our community, we're able to stand in the gap for our neighbors and make sure everyone has access to the healthy food they deserve.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""Our hope is by shining a light on these organizations they will continue to receive the support they need to help address the real problem of hunger in our communities. They are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but now more than ever they cannot do it alone.""

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

Now, we’re bringing our first operations online at our South Carolina campus, adding an initial 20,000 metric tons of annual materials production.
The same critical minerals that power batteries also underpin the technologies that keep the nation running and secure.
On our 600-acre campus in Berkeley County, South Carolina, operations have begun, with the first facility now recovering critical minerals.
Over the next decade, Redwood will continue to grow in South Carolina, creating more than 1,500 good-paying jobs.","America runs on critical materials: cobalt, lithium, nickel, and copper. They are the backbone of our modern economy, powering everything from computers and smartphones to energy storage, defense systems, and AI data centers. Yet today, the United States imports nearly all of these minerals, often from unstable regions or adversarial nations.

Redwood’s mission is to change this.

Today, Redwood is on par with the largest U.S. source of nickel and stands as the only domestic source of cobalt at scale. Our operations also represent one of the most significant, and only new, domestic sources of lithium and copper to come online in decades. With roughly 90% of all lithium-ion batteries processed in North America coming through our facilities, Redwood’s Nevada Campus produced more than 60,000 metric tons of materials last year—making it one of the nation’s most important sources of critical minerals, mined or recycled. Now, we’re bringing our first operations online at our South Carolina campus, adding an initial 20,000 metric tons of annual materials production.

Critical minerals are costly to mine and concentrated in fragile supply chains dominated by China. Yet as one of the world’s largest markets for EVs, consumer electronics, and power tools, America already holds a tremendous stockpile of lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese locked inside the products we use every day. Within the U.S. fleet of five million electric vehicles alone lies an estimated 2.25 million metric tons of these materials—resources we can unlock first through reuse in stationary storage systems and later through recovery of the underlying minerals.

Redwood’s goal is to keep these resources here; recovered, refined, and redeployed for America’s advantage. This strategy turns yesterday’s imports into tomorrow’s strategic stockpile, making the U.S. stronger, more competitive, and less vulnerable to supply chains controlled by China and other foreign adversaries.

This isn’t just an economic issue; it’s a matter of national security. The same critical minerals that power batteries also underpin the technologies that keep the nation running and secure. Nickel and cobalt are also essential for aerospace and defense alloys, while copper forms the backbone of industrial wiring and power transmission. Even semiconductors and advanced electronics rely on cobalt and copper in their manufacturing processes. Redwood is providing domestic access to these materials, ensuring the U.S. maintains the resources needed for military readiness, technological leadership, and energy resilience here at home.

On our 600-acre campus in Berkeley County, South Carolina, operations have begun, with the first facility now recovering critical minerals. This is a small but significant start toward what will become one of the world’s largest recovery, refining, and manufacturing campuses. Over the next decade, Redwood will continue to grow in South Carolina, creating more than 1,500 good-paying jobs.

South Carolina has long been a leader in advanced manufacturing—from textiles to automotive to aerospace. With Redwood’s campus ramping up, the state is taking its next step into critical minerals. By keeping these resources at home, South Carolina is strengthening both the state and the nation—rebuilding American industry through high-value manufacturing, energy security, and local job creation.

By recovering critical minerals at scale, we’re building the foundation for American leadership in advanced manufacturing, infrastructure, and the high-power technologies of tomorrow. With recycling operations now online in South Carolina, Redwood helping transform the U.S. into a nation that can secure and reuse its own resources.

EV truck sales have dropped industry-wide, prompting automakers to rethink large vehicle electrification strategies.

The expiration of tax credits and rising costs have led to declining consumer interest in full-size EVs.

Ford is evaluating whether to discontinue the electric version of its F-150 pickup, the Lightning. Persistent losses and lagging demand in the full-size electric truck segment have sparked the internal debate. According to people familiar with the matter, discussions are ongoing, though no final decision has been made.

The automaker paused production of the F-150 Lightning last month, citing an aluminum shortage, and is now considering whether to keep the plant idle as it reassesses its EV strategy. Ford has posted approximately $13 billion in losses tied to its EV operations since 2023.

Comparison: 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning vs 2026 GMC Sierra EV

Despite being marketed as a milestone vehicle for Ford, the Lightning has struggled to attract mainstream truck buyers. In October, Ford reported selling only 1,500 Lightnings in the U.S., compared to 66,000 gasoline-powered F-Series pickups. EV sales across the industry have also slowed in the wake of expiring government incentives, with larger trucks and SUVs being particularly affected.

Ford is not alone in reconsidering its EV truck plans. Stellantis cancelled its planned electric Ram 1500 earlier this year. General Motors has paused production at a Detroit facility that assembles electric trucks, stopped BrightDrop production at its CAMI plant in Ontario, and is reviewing the future of its electric pickup portfolio. Tesla’s Cybertruck has experienced declining sales, and EV startup Rivian has reduced its workforce to conserve cash.

The retreat from electric pickups is a generalized shift in EV strategy among North American automakers. Ford CEO Jim Farley has acknowledged the limitations of full-size EVs for extended driving and towing, pointing instead to hybrid systems and smaller EVs as the more viable options for most consumers. Ford is currently developing a compact $30,000 electric pickup aimed at addressing affordability concerns.

Ford Midsize EV Pickup Enters Testing Ahead of 2027 Production Launch

Originally launched as a flagship electric vehicle, the F-150 Lightning was introduced with promises of sports car acceleration, jobsite utility, and backup power capabilities. Early production targets suggested the company could manufacture up to 150,000 units annually. However, with base models priced closer to $50,000 ($63,000 CDN) and premium versions nearing $90,000 ($104,000 CDN), cost became a major barrier for many prospective buyers.

The high development and manufacturing costs of full-size EV trucks, combined with reduced government support and uncertain consumer uptake, have prompted automakers to rethink long-term plans. GM set aside $1.6 billion in the third quarter to cover EV-related losses and warned of additional charges in the future.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.
The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.
Targeting cars with new regulation If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on.
Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone.","California has long cast itself as the nation’s climate conscience — and its policy lab.

Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.

Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy.

While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.

Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Authority states have never had before

A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act – who is also a law professor at UCLA – first floated this idea.

Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”

The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”

Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.

Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”

In other words, she says, preemption has its limits.

Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering.

Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them.

Not a slam dunk for California to step in

For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.

“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”

California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.

UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”

California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.

The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung peoples’ eyes.

In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.

In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.

Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.

“So this wouldn’t necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.

Targeting cars with new regulation

If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.

California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”

Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.

Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.

If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.

California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.

The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort. Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals. “

“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.

“It’s something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.

No downside to trying, and some upsides

Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice.

“There’s a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You’re buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don’t think there’s much downside in trying to do it.”

Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.

California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.

The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a “no-win, Catch 22.”

After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars.

“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That’s usually a flag for policymakers.”

Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.

With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.

“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who’s serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world’s fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030223_los-altos-ev_sk_cm_161762530432.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=xN6dI3Go,N,,2025-11-07 11:08:59.162337

The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.
The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs.
“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.
States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.","Washington — Near the end of his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that aimed to reduce harmful, planet-warming pollutants emitted by refrigerators and air conditioners. The bipartisan measure brought environmentalists and major business groups into rare alignment on the contentious issue of climate change and won praise across the political spectrum.

Five years later, the second Trump administration is reversing course, as it moves to loosen a federal rule — based on the 2020 law — that requires grocery stores, air-conditioning companies and others to reduce powerful greenhouse gases used in cooling equipment.

The shift in approach has upended a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to quickly phase out domestic use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and are considered a major driver of global warming.

The proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency highlights the second Trump administration's drive to roll back regulations perceived as climate-friendly, even at the cost of causing disarray for the very business interests it is claiming to protect. The plan is among a series of sweeping environmental rollbacks that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said will put a “dagger through the heart of climate change religion.”

The HFC proposal will help “make American refrigerants affordable, safe and reliable again,” Zeldin said in a statement.

But environmentalists say the plan will exacerbate climate pollution while disrupting a years-long industry transition to new coolants as an alternative to HFCs.

With HFCs one of the main drivers of extreme heat and pollution, any delay in their phaseout “is going to be have negative outcomes and significant ones,” said Kiff Gallagher, executive director of the Global Heat Reduction Initiative, an international effort to reduce trapped heat that is warming the planet.

Industry groups supported the phaseout

The 2020 law signed by Trump, known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, phased out HFCs as part of an international agreement on ozone pollution. The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Chemistry Council, the top lobbying group for the chemical industry, were among numerous business groups that supported the law and an international deal on pollutants, known as the Kigali Amendment, as wins for jobs and the environment. U.S. companies such as Chemours and Honeywell developed and produce the alternative refrigerants sold in the U.S. and around the world.

The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs. Zeldin said the Biden-era rule did not give companies enough time to comply and the rapid switch to other refrigerants had caused shortages and price hikes. Some in the industry dispute this.

In September, the EPA announced it is relaxing standards for cold storage warehouses and other cooling equipment and delaying other aspects of the HFC rule until 2032.

EPA now says the rule is bad for business

On a visit this summer to a refrigeration facility in swing-state Georgia alongside Vice President JD Vance, Zeldin said the administration was responding to grocery stores and refrigeration companies that have complained about the federal rule.

“We at the Trump administration are heeding the call of Alta Refrigeration,'' Zeldin said at an Aug. 21 appearance at the company in Peachtree City, Georgia, outside Atlanta.

Zeldin said the so-called Technology Transitions Rule, finalized under former President Joe Biden, has been restricting access to refrigerants Americans need to cool their homes and businesses, while costs are going up and supply is going down.

He said Alta Refrigeration, along with grocery stores, the semiconductor industry and residents across America, were dissatisfied with the rule and vowed to “fix this mistake.”

The Food Industry Association, which represents grocery stores and suppliers, applauded the EPA plan, saying the current rule “imposed significant and unrealistic compliance timelines.” Zeldin’s proposal “achieves the intended environmental benefits without placing unnecessary and costly burdens on the food industry,” said Leslie Sarasin, the group’s president and CEO.

Jorge Alvarez, co-founder of iGas USA, a Florida air conditioning company whose products include HFCs, said the Biden rule was “shoved down our throats” and threatened to create havoc. The delay “gives industry a chance to create new refrigerants, and we will,” he said.

The rule's rollback sparks confusion over Trump's strategy

But the change in tack comes after industry players had already made adjustments to ensure they could meet the goals set in motion by the 2020 law.

“Changing the schedule now would disrupt planning and inject uncertainty across the market,” said Samantha Slater, a senior vice president at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, which represents more than 330 HVAC manufacturers and commercial refrigeration companies.

Manufacturers have already retooled product lines and certified models based on the current timeline, she said, noting that nearly 90% of residential and light commercial air conditioning systems use substitute refrigerants.

A delay would give an advantage to foreign-based competitors that did not invest in alternative refrigerants and risks “higher costs for U.S. consumers,” Slater said.

Chemours, the Delaware-based chemical giant that is a leading producer of alternative refrigerants, said in a statement that it has “consistently supported an orderly phasedown schedule of HFCs as outlined in the AIM Act.''

Delays to the transition “risk undermining and stranding U.S. manufacturing and innovation investments, while also increasing uncertainty and supply chain inefficiencies, ultimately driving up consumer costs,'' said Joe Martinko, president of Chemours’ Thermal & Specialized Solutions business.

Even with the holdup, “the transition to low-global warming potential refrigerants is well underway,'' he said.

A temporary shortage this summer of cylinders used by HVAC contractors — which Zeldin and others have cited as a reason to delay the EPA rule — has been resolved, Martinko and other industry representatives said.

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the current rule ensures an efficient, affordable phasedown of harmful HFCs, while offering industry regulatory uniformity and a way to remain globally competitive.

He said the federal rule averts a previous patchwork of state laws and regulations. States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.

“Weakening the rule will confuse the market,'' he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/07/PDTN/87144864007-ap-25310819301268.jpg?crop=3299,1856,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-07 11:07:49.835113

In the early years of the past decade, there appeared to be a growing international consensus on the need to finance the transition to net zero. In its ambitious Sustainable Finance Action Plan, published in 2018, the European Union (""EU"") sought to position itself as a global leader in the area of sustainable finance, introducing a complex framework of new disclosure rules intended to provide investors with the information they needed to make investments aligned with their sustainability goals. In the US, at a federal level, the SEC proposed rules aiming to standardise how companies report their climate-related risks and impacts, while a large number of states introduced sustainability reporting regulations. The Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") introduced significant tax incentives to facilitate the transition towards sustainable energy.

In more recent years, we have seen the US's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and denouncement of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (""SDGs""), legal challenges to the SEC's proposed corporate disclosure rules, ultimately leading to their defence being abandoned earlier this year, and a significant rollback on the clean energy tax credits and other climate-related provisions in the IRA. A number of US states have implemented policies to restrict ESG considerations in state investments, requiring investment decisions to be based solely on financial considerations, and ""blacklisting"" asset managers deemed to be boycotting fossil fuels. A number of asset managers have withdrawn from climate initiatives such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which had launched as recently as 2020 but suspended its activities in January of this year.

The EU's Ongoing Commitment

The ""ESG backlash"" and change in the administration in the US coincided with the reconstitution of the European Commission in 2024, a year in which both the Letta1 and Draghi2 reports on the future of the EU's single market and on EU competitiveness were published. The EU's renewed focus on competitiveness and growth posed questions as to whether the EU would pursue its European Green Deal with continued zeal, particularly in light of the prospect of increasing deregulation across the Atlantic. President von der Leyen's mission letter3 to Commissioner Albuquerque reaffirmed the Commission's climate objectives, including its goal to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050, and its commitment to the UN SDGs and the Green Deal. The letter made it clear that the EU intends to remain a global leader in sustainable finance, referring to scaling up sustainable finance, in particular transition finance and climate resilience.

The Simplification Agenda

Notably, the mission letter also referred to the Commission's focus on reducing administrative burdens and simplifying legislation, including reducing reporting obligations by at least 25%. The new Commission acted with purpose in this regard, publishing the Omnibus I proposal in February of this year, which includes proposals to significantly reduce the scope of the reporting requirements under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (""CSRD"") and proposed amendments to reporting obligations under the Taxonomy Regulation. While the proposals have been described by the Commission as 'simplification' rather than 'deregulation' efforts, the effect of the proposals, if adopted, would be to significantly scale-back CSRD reporting obligations, with 80% of companies taken out of scope and a twoyear delay to reporting for those that would continue to be subject to the CSRD.4

From a burden reduction perspective, the CSRD changes will no doubt be welcomed by many EU companies. However, reduced sustainability reporting poses challenges to fund managers already dealing with significant data challenges in meeting their obligations under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (""SFDR"") and the Taxonomy Regulation. To fill the data gap, fund managers will have to continue to rely on ESG data and ratings sold by third-party providers, potentially increasing costs for investors. The fact that ESG data providers remain unregulated at EU level, and that ESG data is not standardised and often incomparable, adds to the compliance challenges for asset managers. The lack of available, reliable data will likely lead to the increased use of estimates in meeting disclosure obligations, which, in the absence of clear guidance on the use of such estimates, may increase the risk of greenwashing and undermine the trust and confidence of investors in the financial system.

Recognising that the ""regulatory burden has become a brake on Europe's competitiveness"",5 the Commission's simplification agenda includes proposals to address the issue of fragmentation and the unnecessary duplication of regulatory burdens, particularly the barriers and costs relating to operating group structures across EU member states and to the distribution of investment funds across the EU, with legislative proposals expected later this year.6

The review of the SFDR, one of the cornerstones of the EU's sustainable finance framework, does not fit neatly into this new simplification and burden reduction agenda. Work on the review of the SFDR commenced in 2023, prior to the publication of the Draghi report and the reconstitution of the Commission, and the introduction of a new product classification regime to replace the current disclosure regime is difficult to reconcile with a simplification objective. While criticisms of the current SFDR censuring the complexity of the disclosures for retail investors and questioning the usefulness of the disclosures for professional investors are warranted, asset managers have already incurred significant compliance costs and made substantial changes in order to comply with the disclosure regime and are now faced with a further potentially significant overhaul of the framework.

One of the most notable challenges in implementing the SFDR related to the misalignment in timing of the introduction of obligations. For example, the EU imposed detailed disclosure obligations on market participants at a time when there were no corresponding reporting obligations on investee companies, creating significant data gaps and resulting in less comparable, comprehensible disclosures for investors, undermining the purpose of the EU disclosure regime. The proposed reduced scope of the CSRD is likely to compound these challenges. There continues to be misalignment between the SFDR, the Taxonomy Regulation and the provisions relating to investor's sustainability preferences in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (""MiFID""). A more coherent, consistent framework should be the objective of an holistic approach to the Omnibus I Proposal, the SFDR review and a future review of MiFID.

What do investors have to say?

In addition to diverging policy and regulatory approaches with regard to ESG reporting and disclosures, there may also be divergence in investor preferences between the EU and US. In both jurisdictions, the geopolitical environment has drawn attention away from sustainability issues and towards economic growth, competitiveness and defence. While assets in global ESG funds ended 2024 8% higher than in 2023 to reach an annual record high of $3.2 trillion, inflows had been declining in the three years prior to 2025, and redemptions were at a record high of $11.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025 globally. While not representative of an established pattern, in the second quarter of 2025, European investors drove a recovery in sustainable funds, investing $8.6 billion of net new money into ESG funds over those three months, after redeeming $7.3 billion in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, the US saw the eleventh consecutive quarter of withdrawals.7

There has also been a marked difference between the EU and the US in relation to the level of support for shareholder resolutions with an ESG objective, with asset managers in the UK and Europe supporting 81% of shareholder ESG proposals on average in 2024, compared with 25% support in the US.8 New restrictions on permissible shareholder resolutions introduced by the SEC earlier this year preceded a sharp fall in the number of environmental and social proposals submitted to shareholder vote. Arguably, this could impact US companies' insight into the market's view of financially material ESG themes.9

There have been instances of EU pension funds withdrawing from or reviewing mandates with asset managers that have revised their ESG credentials or withdrawn from climate initiatives such as NZAM and Climate Action 100+. Although it may be too early to determine whether this is the ""early phase of a broader movement"", European pension funds and other long-term asset owners remain committed to sustainable investing.10

Closing Comment

As the political debate continues regarding issues such as climate change, DEI and whether defence investment is compatible with ESG principles, from a market participant's perspective, the future direction for ESG and sustainable finance is arguably less about values and principles and more about reputational management, satisfying investor demand for opportunities meeting their preferences, and the need for greater regulatory alignment.

In order to fulfil their duties to their investors and for risk management purposes, asset managers must take into account sustainability risks that may impact fund performance. While the EU devised its sustainable finance framework with a view to channelling capital towards sustainable investments to assist the EU in meeting its 2050 net zero target, from a purely market-driven point of view, investors ought to be given the opportunity to benefit from climate adaptation as an investment strategy, giving investors access to investment returns from companies and projects that promote and progress the transition.

It is often argued that the US innovates while the EU regulates, but it must be remembered that regulation in itself is not inherently bad, as attested by the asset managers who lobbied for and supported the introduction of the US Investment Companies Act 1940 and who saw the benefits regulation brought to the collective reputation of the industry and the enhanced trust it engendered. Accepting that regulation can bring benefits to an industry, there is, however, a need for alignment between the various legislative and regulatory initiatives contributing to the EU's sustainable finance agenda, to ensure that the complexities and costs of compliance do not undermine EU competitiveness.

(FANCO) is planning what could eventually amount to a $4-billion investment in Indiana. The massive program will encompass a new headquarters, as well as manufacturing facilities and an energy park, and fund the development of FANCO’s small modular reactor (SMR) technology, the company announced.

The Indiana energy park will be the first in the United States to operate in a “closed-fuel cycle,” a system that reprocesses and reuses spent nuclear fuel on-site, according to the company. Boasting that SMR can “deliver the most cost-effective utility-scale power in the world,” FANCO says its flagship EAGL-1 SMR can create more fuel than it burns, resulting in clean, renewable nuclear energy.

Using a liquid-metal alloy called lead bismuth for cooling, the EAGL-1 is able to generate 240 megawatts of electricity—enough to power 1.5 million homes from the typical six-reactor cluster, with one-tenth the footprint of traditional nuclear power plants producing similar wattage, the company notes.

Initially, however, the plant will use natural gas to produce power, CEO Mike Reinboth told the Indianapolis Business Journal. The transition to nuclear power production is expected to happen early next decade. But skeptics pointed out that SMR is largely unproven and costly.

Indiana has put in place a 20% tax credit for businesses developing SMR technology, American Machinist reports. FANCO aims to establish an office in Indiana by early 2026 but hasn’t finalized site selection for the project.

Rivian posted positive gross profit but still projects a massive loss for the full year.

The quarter benefited from a rush before EV tax credits expired, creating near-term air-pocket risk.

Rivian's upcoming R2 launch could help sales. But it will likely weigh on the bottom line.

10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›

Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) ripped higher after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results this week. The stock rose more than 23% on Wednesday. With shares still down massively from levels five years ago (even after Wednesday's rise), it is fair to ask whether the move signals something more durable -- or if it's just noise.

Sure, the electric vehicle company did give investors some things to be excited about. For instance, revenue growth accelerated sharply, and gross profit turned positive for the quarter. In addition, it was good to hear that the company's upcoming lower-priced model, the R2, is slated to hit the market in the first half of 2026. Overall, however, significant concerns remain.

Here are three reasons I'd stay on the sidelines for now -- despite the strong results.

Profit is still a long way off

Rivian reported third-quarter revenue of about $1.56 billion, up 78% year over year, and generated $24 million of gross profit -- a welcome milestone after a long stretch of losses.

While the improvement is notable, gross profit isn't a bottom-line figure. Move down to the lowest line on the income statement, after all the expenses are accounted for, and you'll see a staggering loss of $1.17 billion -- worse than the $1.1 billion loss in the year-ago quarter.

Additionally, management still expects a full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of roughly $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion.

Negative cash flow

The company's cash flow statement isn't pretty either. While Rivian generated $26 million in cash from operations in the quarter, capital expenditures were $447 million, up from $227 million in the year-ago period -- an increase management attributed to investments in expanding production capacity. This means free cash flow for the quarter was negative $421 million.

While the company does boast more than $7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, Rivian is clearly far from being cash generative -- so it's either going to need to burn through this cash in the coming years or raise more cash by taking on debt or diluting shareholders by selling equity.

In 2025 alone, Rivian expects capital expenditures to total between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion.

A demand air pocket

Rivian's quarterly strength was helped by U.S. buyers rushing to capture federal EV tax credits before they expired on Sept. 30. In other words, there was a significant pull-forward in demand. To this end, management expects a huge step down in deliveries for the final quarter of the year; the mid-point of the company's full-year vehicle delivery guidance range implies about 10,000 deliveries in Q4, down from just over 13,200 in Q3 and about even with the year-ago period -- not the sort of growth profile you want from a company operating with massive losses.

So, is the stock's big gain the beginning of a longer-term upward move? While there's no way to know what a stock will do in the future, I personally wouldn't bet on good returns from here. The stock's nearly $19 billion market cap, even as Rivian burns through cash, just isn't a compelling investment thesis. Indeed, given the capital intensity of its business, it wouldn't be surprising to see losses accelerate as production of a lower-priced model ramps up next year.

With all of this said, I would consider changing my mind if sales growth begins accelerating on a more consistent basis next year. But I'd need to see signs of significant improvement in profitability, too. Additionally, I might consider the stock if it were cheaper; to convince me to invest in a risky, capital-intensive operation, I'm going to need a really good deal.

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced that it achieved its goal of mixing 20% of the plant-based fuel with gasoline five years ahead of schedule. The world’s most populous country is joining Brazil, Japan and Italy to promote ethanol and other biofuels as part of the Belem 4x initiative.

The initiative, being showcased Friday at the COP30 climate summit, provides political support for expanding biofuels and relatively low-emission hydrogen-based fuels. Brazil, long a biofuel leader, commonly sells a 27% ethanol blend and its government recently announced plans to increase the percentage.

India’s rapid ethanol shift shows challenges other countries could face. While the Indian government said ethanol usage reduces pollution, some users said it is affecting their mileage and damaging older engines. Most fuel pumps in India now sell the 20% ethanol blend or unblended gasoline that’s nearly twice as expensive. Lower ethanol blends are being phased out.

Environment experts also said grain production for ethanol can displace food crops and sometimes generates more planet-warming gases than it saves.

Indian car owners say ethanol reduces mileage

Ethanol, typically made from corn, sugarcane or rice, is considered cleaner than petroleum-based gasoline. The Indian government said its blending program has already cut carbon emissions by 74 billion kilograms (163 billion pounds)— equivalent to planting 300 million trees — and saved over $12 billion in oil imports in the last decade.

“I think it’s good for the environment,” said Vijay Ramakrishnan, a businessman in Chennai. “But I’ve noticed a drop in mileage in my vehicle in recent months. Given how expensive fuel already is this further drop is only adding to my costs.”

Ramakrishnan, who commutes over 100 kilometers (62 miles) daily, wants the government to offer more fuel choices.

Amit Khare, who runs a popular YouTube channel on automobiles, said many followers complain about a significant drop in mileage from E20. Some owners of older cars have told him that they are having engine trouble.

“E5 is the best fuel, E10 is manageable, but E20 has given a lot of trouble,” he said.

Ramya Natarajan of the Bengaluru-based Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy said ethanol can be good for some engines if they are compatible, but agreed that it can reduce mileage.

Indian farmers want clarity on crops needed for ethanol

Farmers said they need clarity on government procurement plans for ethanol production. Ramandeep Mann, a farmer in India’s northern Punjab state, said farmers significantly increased corn acreage last year in hopes of selling it for fuel, but the price dropped after the government allocated large amounts of rice to ethanol makers.

The amount of ethanol blended with gasoline in India grew from 8% to 20% in the last five years. Most of the ethanol now comes from grains, as opposed to the sugarcane, its traditional source.

Mann said prices for sugarcane have also dropped this year. He said it’s good that the government is tackling climate change, but it should put farmers and their prices ahead of ethanol mandates.

Previously, surplus crops not needed for food were the primary source of India’s ethanol, but that’s beginning to change, according to Natarajan of CSTEP. “With the push for E20 blends or even more, a lot more area has to be cultivated which in turn means it’ll be replacing other crops,” she said.

Balancing India’s needs

Climate experts said biofuel production can have minimal environmental impact when it’s made from waste or inedible vegetation and processed in facilities that run on clean energy. But when crops are grown explicitly for biofuels, it has a higher carbon footprint because of the fertilizer and fuel involved.

India’s ethanol strategy is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions, cut oil imports and boost agriculture, said Purva Jain, an energy specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But she said a faster transition to infrastructure for electric vehicles might be better. A 2022 study by her organization found that installing solar power for EV charging can be a much more efficient land use than growing crops for biofuel.

However, ethanol producers have invested significant sums in manufacturing and need a steady, growing market for their product now, said CK Jain, president of the Grain Ethanol Manufacturers Association. He said India should increase the percentage of ethanol mixed with gas and encourage the sale of compatible vehicles.

“We need to have higher blending as soon as possible, otherwise the industry will go into deep financial trouble,” Jain said.

Other experts advocated for a middle ground.

A 10% blend of ethanol with gasoline, can be a “win-win” solution said Natarajan of CSTEP. She said that would allow for use of existing crops without putting too much pressure on increased cultivation.

Khare, the YouTube influencer, said keeping lower blends available would help older vehicles.

“The government can bring E20 or even up to E85 programs on top of that, that’s completely fine. But consumers need to be given the option,” he said.

“It’s a contradiction that the Brazilian president is more or less owning up to,” Aubertin said.
True to form, the Brazilian president seems to have carefully sidestepped the awkward issue of fossil fuels for the moment.","Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has worked hard to cultivate a reputation as a staunch defender of the climate. Speaking at his 2023 inauguration, Lula promised to turn his country into “a leader in the fight against the climate crisis”.

And there have been some notable successes: last month, Amazon deforestation hit an 11-year low.

These lofty ambitions will be on full display as Brazil prepares to host the COP30 climate summit in the port city of Belem on the edge of the sprawling Amazon.

Read moreCOP30: Host city Belem is 'at the heart of the issues' and a gateway to the Amazon

But barely three weeks earlier, Brazil's majority state-owned oil giant Petrobas announced that it had received approval to drill exploratory oil wells at the mouth of the Amazon River. The decision had many environmental activists criticising this apparent paradox at the heart of Lula’s climate policy.

“Brazil's presidency of COP30 is hypocritical, as it claims to want to raise climate ambitions while granting a new oil exploration license to its national company,” said Fanny Petitbon, France director of the 350.org clean energy NGO.

“It's completely mind-boggling.”

Brazilian activists were also quick to condemn the decision.

“The approval is an act of sabotage against the COP and undermines the climate leadership claimed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,” the country's Climate Observatory said in a statement.

Black gold

Petrobas has for decades been eyeing this stretch of water in what’s known as the Equatorial Margin, some 500 kilometres from the mouth of the Amazon River. And with good reason – like similar swaths of territory off the coasts of neighbouring Suriname and Guyana, it holds vast reserves of oil. Brazilian authorities estimate that the black gold buried beneath these waters could bring in €46 billion and create more than 350,000 new jobs.

Although the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has long baulked at the project, it finally gave its approval after what it described as a “rigorous process” with “more than 65 technical consultations”.

But the project is far from risk-free, either for the region’s biodiversity or the communities living along the coast. In a technical report published by Brazilian daily Folha de São Paulo, IBAMA found that the drilling could have dire repercussions for the manatees that call the coast home – mammals that are already facing the risk of extinction.

The region is also home to the largest expanse of mangroves in the world – a fragile ecosystem that Brazil Journal said is also threatened by the project. The Equatorial Margin’s coast also harbours three Indigenous lands and six quilombola territories – peopled by the descendants of African slaves – as well as countless fishing villages that would be the first to bear the brunt of any oil spills or other industrial accidents.

Up in smoke

So why was such a project approved under a self-proclaimed climate defender such as Lula?

“This sums up the duality of the Brazilian president, caught between economic and ecological interests,” said Catherine Aubertin, research director at France's Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations.

With an average of 3.4 million barrels produced every day in 2024, Brazil is the world’s eighth-largest oil exporter. In 2024, crude oil became the country’s chief export, overtaking soybeans and making up 13.3 percent of Brazil’s total exports.

Speaking last year at COP29 in Azerbaijan – another major crude oil producer – Lula said he wanted to continue to increase Brazil’s oil exports to 36 percent by 2035.

There’s just one problem. According to projections, Brazil’s oil production will begin to decline from 2030 onwards as its current reserves are depleted. It’s a prognosis that has set off something of a panic in the upper ranks of the Brazilian government as well as the halls of Petrobas.

“The Equatorial Margin is the future of Brazil's energy sovereignty,” Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira wrote in a social media post. “We are ensuring that exploration is carried out with environmental responsibility, in accordance with the highest international standards, generating benefits for the Brazilian people.”

But climate scientists and activists agree that the time for looking for new oil reserves is over. Instead, they say, moving away from fossil fuels – the leading emitters of greenhouse gases – is crucial if humanity is to slow the world’s warming.

Read moreWorld leaders to rally in support of climate action before COP30 summit

According to a Climate Observatory analysis, emissions released by Brazil’s energy sector are likely to rise from 490.6 million tonnes to 558 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050. It’s a far cry from the country’s ambitious promise to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from 67 percent to 59 percent by the same year.

“It’s a contradiction that the Brazilian president is more or less owning up to,” Aubertin said. “He responds to it by repeating the same argument as other large oil producers: he supports the idea that oil revenue is used to finance the energy transition.”

“Is it contradictory? It is,” Lula conceded in a June 2024 interview with Brazilian radio CBN. “But as long as the energy transition isn’t solving our problem, Brazil needs to make money from this oil.”

Saving the forests

Aubertin stressed that Lula’s track record on climate change is more nuanced than the president’s oil ambitions make it seem.

“Even though Brazil is exporting its oil, it has still reached a very good level in terms of [the sustainability of] its internal energy consumption,” she said. “Eighty-nine percent of its electricity production comes from renewable energy.”

The Brazilian president has also undertaken a range of actions to make good on his climate commitments, Aubertin said. Since 2023, Lula has put in place a national energy transition policy with investment potential of up to €330 billion as well as ratifying a law creating a mandatory carbon market.

But his main victory in the fight to protect the environment has taken place on a different front: the fight against deforestation. Since coming to office, Lula has championed the struggle against illegal logging as one of the most critical goals of his presidency.

Read moreBrazil's Lula urges less talk, more action at COP30 climate meet

He brought back Marina Silva as environment minister, who had already managed to drastically lower the rate of deforestation during Lula’s first two terms (2003-2010). At the same time, the Brazilian president reactivated the Amazon Fund, an international financial mechanism designed to raise money in the fight against deforestation, strengthened regulations and stiffened penalties for illegal logging.

In just two years, the results have been spectacular. Although deforestation affected more than 10,000 square kilometres in 2022, the last year of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro’s term in office, Brazil’s deforestation had been halved by 2023 and continued to fall to close to 4,200 square kilometres in 2024. Outside of the nation’s massive rainforests, deforestation levels also fell in other vulnerable ecosystems such as the Cerrado, the biodiverse savanna south of the Amazon.

“Deforestation is mainly due to infrastructure construction and agricultural expansion, whether legal or illegal,” said Erin Matson, a consultant at Climate Focus and the author of a comprehensive report published in mid-October on the state of the world's forests.

“Brazil's excellent results show that simply strengthening controls can quickly and drastically reduce deforestation.”

“In the long term, curbing deforestation will only be possible through profound changes to our economic model, as pressure on forests continues to increase in line with global demand for soy, wood and paper,” she added. “But Brazil provides a very good example of how, when a head of state takes action, results can be achieved.”

A president ‘bound hand and foot’

“Lula acts with the leverage that he has,” Aubertin said. With Brazil's Congress dominated by conservatives keen on continued investment in petrol and representatives of agribusiness still carrying significant weight in the halls of power, “he is bound hand and foot and has to deal with a lot of pressures – sometimes contradictory ones”.

Perhaps because of this, Brazil’s agribusiness sector, which is responsible for 30.5 percent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, seems to have remained untouched by any environmental measures that would cut into its profit margins.

The industry managed to avoid the application of the carbon market law thanks to the support of the Parliamentary Agricultural Front, a powerful legislative bloc that often advocates for the agribusiness industry.

As COP30 begins, it remains to be seen just how Brazil's climate contradictions will be reflected in negotiations. True to form, the Brazilian president seems to have carefully sidestepped the awkward issue of fossil fuels for the moment.

Lula has already made it clear that protecting forests will take pride of place in COP30. He has said he hopes that one of the summit’s major advances will be the adoption of the Tropical Forest Forever Facilities, a new financial mechanism that would compensate countries for preserving their tropical forests – and which advocates say is as a much-needed weapon in the bitter fight against deforestation.",https://s.france24.com/media/display/2300fada-b0be-11f0-9029-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-64U36NP.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 12:04:02.137648

A policy paper for the clean energy jobs plan published this week includes the estimated demand – up from around 66,000 workers in the sector in 2023 – but noted challenges to scaling up the workforce.

“Previously, sector dependence on an uncertain pipeline of grant programmes and policy frameworks has created increased insecurity for businesses and job precarity,” read the paper.

It noted that consistent training was harder to achieve in a sector dominated by micro-enterprises, while a lack of data created difficulty in identifying skills gaps.

“There are also constraints in training provider capacity, including a lack of retrofit course availability and shortages of qualified tutors,” it continued.

The Government said these estimated figures may be revised under the £13.2bn Warm Homes Plan – expected later this year – which will address specific retrofit initiatives.

In the foreword to the report, energy secretary Ed Miliband said the Government has announced more than £50bn in clean energy investments since July 2024.

“This represents the biggest investment in homegrown clean energy in the UK’s history and is allowing us to take back control from petrostates and dictators and bring down bills for good,” he said.

Clean energy policies would also result in secure, well-paid work across the country, continued Miliband. This could triple jobs in the sector in Scotland and double them throughout the rest of the country, he said, supporting 856,000 jobs by 2030.

Noting that around 9,000 people underwent heat pump training in 2024, the policy paper outlined an action plan to scale up training opportunities.

This will involve phase one of the Warm Home Skills programme competition that is investing £8bn in grants to subsidise up to 9,000 trainees before July 2026, explained the paper.

An additional £5m for the Heat Training Grant will support the training of an additional 9,000 heat pump installers and heat network professionals during the current financial year.

“When Illinoisans use clean energy, they don’t just reap the benefits themselves; they help create a greener and healthier future for us all.”","Springfield, Ill. – Hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans have incorporated clean energy technologies into their lives according to Clean Energy Across America, a new report unveiled Wednesday by Environment Illinois Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group. The report recommends tips and policies to help more Americans adopt clean energy, even as federal tax credits phase out.

The analysis comes as Illinois legislators passed a bill to bolster clean energy projects and help meet the state’s climate goals.

“From Carbondale to Rockford, Illinoisans have invested their own time and money to install solar panels on their roofs, put EVs in their driveways, or buy clean energy from their utilities,” said Emily Kowalski, outreach and engagement manager with Environment Illinois Research and Policy Center. “Clean energy adoption in Illinois is a movement hiding in plain sight.”

The topline findings of the report show the breadth of public adoption of clean energy technologies across Illinois:

159,840 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are now registered in Illinois.

131,112 Illinois households have installed solar panels on their homes.

111,760 Illinoisans chose to purchase clean energy through their power supplier.

In 2023, 111,690 Illinoisans claimed the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, and 32,530 claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit on their federal income taxes – an indicator of Illinoisans’ adoption of energy efficiency and clean energy at home.

“This data shows that Americans are hungry for ways to reduce the use of dirty, dangerous and costly forms of energy in their daily lives. Elected leaders can make that easier by removing unnecessary barriers,” said Tony Dutzik, associate director and senior policy analyst for Frontier Group.

Illinois can help more residents adopt renewable energy by encouraging or requiring local jurisdictions to adopt instant permitting platforms for residential solar and energy storage systems, and ensure that utility rate structures do not disincentivize the adoption of energy-saving technologies.

Additionally, by establishing minimum energy efficiency standards for a variety of consumer and commercial appliances, Illinois could drastically cut climate emissions, energy waste and save consumers millions of dollars.

This is a fair question, but the sticker price of a car (and the lack of a government rebate) is only one piece of the total cost of vehicle ownership, which also includes fuel costs, maintenance and depreciation.

When you take that all into account, EVs are still usually cheaper to own in the long run, according to auto experts. We did the math to show you how the costs break down, and how you can make an accurate comparison before making your next car purchase.

Comparing the upfront costs of an EV, hybrid and gasoline car

The sticker price is what most people think about when they compare the prices of different cars. From that perspective, the disappearance of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit puts EVs at a significant disadvantage on upfront costs when compared to gasoline or passive-hybrid cars.

When it comes to upfront costs, we've mapped out the winner, loser and runner-up:

Comparing fuel and charging costs

This is where you start to see some of the biggest savings between EVs and gasoline vehicles. Here's how the costs shake out:

Maintenance and repair costs: Less is more

EVs are also a big winner for lower maintenance costs, which adds a nice bit of savings to their total cost of ownership. Here's how they compare to gasoline cars:

Comparing insurance costs

Insurance costs vary a lot depending on the type of car you own. Here are the general trends for different vehicles:

Depreciation and resale value: The wild card

Depreciation -- or how much your vehicle decreases in value over time -- can have a huge impact on your total cost of ownership. That's because when you go to sell your car, its residual value can make a big difference in how much money you lose in the transaction.

Here's the breakdown between gasoline and electric cars:

The verdict on total cost of ownership

I did the math with a real example, comparing an electric and gasoline-powered version of the same car: the new 2026 release of the Chevrolet Equinox.

Winner: Electric vehicles 🏆

Loser: Internal combustion engine vehicles 💸

Even without the federal government's $7,500 tax credit, EVs can still have a lower total cost of ownership than ICE cars.

""In general, you're going to be better off with an EV,"" Dalgaard says. That's because even though EVs have a higher upfront cost, gasoline cars can have more than double the fuel costs, and significantly higher maintenance costs.

Hybrids, meanwhile, probably have an advantage over ICE vehicles (due to the improved gas mileage), and offer a good middle ground if you're not ready for an EV.

Of course, the best choice for you is also going to depend on your driving habits: How much you drive, how long you plan to keep the car and whether you can charge an EV at home, for example.

TRANSCRIPT

The Public News Service Daily Newscast, November the 7th, 2025.

I'm Mike Clifford.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration Thursday to fund food stamps in full after admonishing the government for delaying aid under the nation's largest anti-hunger program during the shutdown.

That's the New York Times.

They report the Trump Justice Department almost immediately told the court that it would appeal the ruling.

The move renewed fears that the poorest Americans would not receive their full benefits to purchase groceries this month, leaving many at risk of imminent and severe financial hardship.

The order by the judge marked his second legal rebuke of the administration.

Meantime, New Mexico's largest city is expanding a program aimed at reducing violence by promoting peace, safety and community engagement.

Albuquerque is consistently ranked among U.S. cities with the highest crime rate.

To reverse the trend, the city has hosted Summer of Nonviolence campaigns the past two years featuring 20 events that attracted nearly 15,000 attendees including youth, adults and families.

City of Albuquerque Community Outreach Manager Jeffrey Bustamante says the program's success prompted a commitment to year-round activities.

We firmly believe that having fun, safe activities for our community is a violence prevention strategy and we love offering our parents the ability to send their kids home tired and full.

I'm Roz Brown.

Other cities that have introduced non-violence campaigns include Austin, Texas, Cincinnati, Ohio and Wilmington, Delaware.

And as violent encounters with federal immigration agents across Illinois continue to escalate, community organizers remain committed to ensuring everyone is armed with knowledge about their legal rights.

Federal officials report thousands have been arrested across the state since targeted immigrations and customs enforcement operations began in September.

The use of force by ICE agents has been legally challenged, but reports of physical encounters with both U.S. citizens and undocumented people are ongoing.

Ido Osagbovo with the Chicago Black Voter Project says she's hopeful collective lawful resistance will prevail.

It's common to assume that only folks of a certain demographic are impacted, but but Chicago's always been an interconnected city.

So we're talking about people who share space, whether that's living space or their kids go to school together.

She says her group has prioritized responding to community needs by hosting Know Your Rights training and through mutual aid hubs that offer donated food, clothing, and other essentials.

Corina Martinez with Cicero Family Services says the possibility of facing ICE is exacerbating legal issues in many communities, especially those that primarily speak Spanish.

She says they're also offering know your rights workshops, but in Spanish.

I'm Judith Ruiz Branch reporting.

Support for this reporting was provided by the Philanthropic Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York.

This is public news service.

It turns out SNAP benefits aren't the only form of federal aid disrupted by the federal government shutdown.

Heating assistance for eligible households is at a standstill and a Minnesota coalition hopes the state steps in until the impact subsides.

The low-income Home Energy Assistance Program distributes federal dollars to states so they can sign up energy-burdened residents for utility bill relief and furnish repairs.

Minnesota's program recently announced this winter's lump sum is delayed due to the budget impasse but is still accepting applications.

Eighteen Minnesota-based organizations, including CURE, want the state to adopt short-term fixes.

CURE's Maggie Schubert says the timing is critical. are having issues paying for their energy costs generally, and that is being exacerbated by rising electricity prices and natural gas prices.

In a letter to Governor Tim Walz, the group's request to mandate that all Minnesota serving utilities halt shutoffs until LIHEAP funding resumes.

I'm Mike Moen.

Next up, the Affordable Care Act enrollment period has just begun.

Montanans are learning just how much their premiums could go up in 2026.

Expanded ACA tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year.

Without them, some enrollees could see their premiums more than double.

That includes therapist, Anna Rolando, who has a private practice in Helena.

She expects her payments will rise by at least 100 percent without the enhanced tax credits, and she says it's unsustainable.

I think there's a lot of people that are either going to have to make the choice to not have health insurance coverage or to close their businesses.

And I just think it's really unfortunate.

More than 77,000 Montanans get their health insurance through Cover Montana, the state's ACA marketplace.

I'm Laura Hatch reporting.

Finally, clean energy supporters sailed to electoral victories across the country this week, including Virginia, and some consumer advocates believe that bodes well for the Commonwealth.

Former Democratic Congresswoman, Abigail Spanberger, decisively defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor, Winston Earl Sears on Tuesday race for governor.

All but a few localities in Virginia reported large swings towards Democrats compared to the 2024 election.

Democrats also won a commanding majority in the Virginia House of Delegates.

David Kiva with EDF Action says efforts to scale back clean energy expansions by the Trump administration have ended up hurting consumers.

He's been working as hard as he possibly can to snuff out investments in clean energy just because he doesn't like windmills or solar panels.

And that's hurting the American people and causing all of our bills to go up. and they said something about it really, really loudly on Tuesday night.

President Donald Trump has argued that increased use of fossil fuels and oil will create energy independence in the U.S.

He has previously blasted solar and wind energies as scams.

I'm Zamone Perez.

On The July 28, 2025 episode Economist Christian Briggs joins News Today to break down President Trump’s historic $2 trillion trade deal with Europe, calling it the most consequential agreement yet.

At the time of the episode’s release, the landmark accord outlined $750 billion in American energy exports paired with $600 billion in foreign investment directed toward U.S. infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean energy projects. Briggs explains how this framework is designed to stimulate domestic production, reduce European dependency on Russian energy, and generate sustainable employment across multiple industries.

“I think it's going to be a trillion dollar win”, said Briggs. “Not just from the selling of the product, but from the direct investments over the next 3 to 5 years.”

Briggs details how the policy could add over 200,000 new high-wage jobs through expanded LNG terminal construction, transportation upgrades, and advanced manufacturing initiatives. The episode also addresses macroeconomic outcomes, including projected GDP growth, supply chain resilience, and strengthened U.S. leverage in global energy markets.

The discussion highlights how the deal’s structure enhances American competitiveness while reinforcing strategic independence from adversarial energy suppliers. Briggs characterizes the move as a calculated economic and geopolitical masterstroke that will bolster U.S. industrial strength and long-term prosperity.

The partnership now includes Samsung SDI, marking a new phase in validation and production.

Solid Power’s large-format ASSB cells have now been integrated into a BMW i7 technology test vehicle, signalling further progress towards introducing the technology into evaluation vehicles for broader testing.

Developing solid-state battery technology

Solid Power is set to supply a sulphide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI, a material designed to replace the liquid electrolytes used in conventional lithium-ion batteries. The electrolyte helps enable solid-state batteries, which use solid materials instead of liquids to transport ions between electrodes during charging and discharging.

Samsung SDI will integrate the electrolyte it into the separator and/or catholyte. The resulting battery cells are then subject to technical performance evaluation under joint criteria set by Samsung SDI and BMW.

John Van Scoter, President and CEO at Solid Power, comments: “We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries. Our solid electrolyte technology is designed for stability and conductivity and, by working closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”

The aim is to prepare ASSB cells for integration into a next generation of BMW evaluation vehicles.

Targeting energy density and vehicle range

BMW says the partners believe in the potential of “genuine ASSB technology and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials"".

This shift could increase the energy density of batteries, which refers to the amount of energy stored per unit of volume or weight. A higher energy density may translate to extended range for electric vehicles without increasing the size or weight of the battery pack.

This view is echoed by Stella Joo-Young Go, Samsung SDI’s Executive Vice President of the ASSB Commercialisation Team: “Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately lead to innovation in electric vehicles. Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercialising ASSB.”

BMW’s battery development journey

BMW has worked with Solid Power since 2016 through a long-term Joint Development Agreement. This included a financial investment from BMW into Solid Power in 2021.

In 2022, BMW took the collaboration further by operating a prototype solid-state battery cell production line at its Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf, Germany. This setup is based on a R&D licence and leverages Solid Power’s manufacturing expertise.

BMW’s approach to battery technology extends back to 2008, when the company began developing its in-house capabilities in battery cell research. Since 2019, these efforts have been consolidated at the Battery Cell Competence Centre (BCCC) in Munich. The facility spans the full battery cell value chain, from design and development to manufacturability.

Martin Schuster, Vice President of Battery Cell and Cell Module at BMW Group, says: “With Samsung SDI joining our partnership with Solid Power, we gain significant momentum on our path advancing the development of new battery cell technologies. This global collaboration is another proof point of our overarching goal: to be always in a position to offer our customers state of the art battery technology.”

Through the BCCC, BMW gains access to innovative battery cell research across the globe. The auto giant states: “This strategically strong position in the value chain ensures the BMW Group access to all new and innovative battery cell research solutions worldwide.""

The Prime Minister said the global fight against climate change could not wait, warning that delay would only deepen the world’s economic and security risks.

“Can energy security wait too? Can bill-payers wait? Can we win the race for green jobs and investment by going slow?” he asked delegates. His answer was blunt: no.

Starmer said global unity on climate action had weakened and urged nations to rediscover their common purpose.

He spoke of the mounting dangers of floods, food price shocks and migration pressures driven by climate breakdown.

He used the summit to pitch Britain as a clean energy powerhouse, claiming his government was delivering “the largest investment of clean energy in British history and the biggest nuclear building programme in a generation.”

The Prime Minister highlighted new offshore wind farms from Yorkshire to Belfast, major battery sites in Greater Manchester and fresh investment in ports like Great Yarmouth. He said these projects form part of a £50 billion plan to create 800,000 clean energy jobs by 2030.

Starmer told delegates the UK would not cling to the old model of growth.

“You don’t meet a challenge like climate change by standing still. You do it by embracing change and doing it together,” he said.

He announced the relaunch of the Global Clean Power Alliance to unlock investment in developing countries and strengthen international supply chains.

He said the UK would share expertise and financing to speed up the global shift away from fossil fuels.

Starmer also promised that the transition at home would mean “cheaper bills, good jobs and long-term security” for working families, arguing that clean power is not a cost but “an immense opportunity to be seized.”

Dive Brief:

The U.S. installed nearly 26 GW of new generation capacity between January and August 2025, up slightly from the approximately 23 GW installed over the same period last year, according to the most recent monthly infrastructure report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

As it has for most of the past two years, solar continued to dominate new generation resources, accounting for 2.7 GW out of 4 GW brought online in August alone, and 19 GW — about three-quarters — of generation capacity additions this year.

The report also says FERC reissued a certificate for Williams Companies to construct and operate its Northeast Supply Enhancement Project. That expansion of the Transco gas pipeline from New Jersey to New York was revived following talks between President Donald Trump and Gov. Kathy Hochul in May after the Trump administration briefly froze the Empire Wind project. The White House and the developer of the wind project have told journalists the two sides reached a gas-for-wind deal, while Hochul has denied striking such a bargain.

Dive Insight:

The report shows momentum for renewables continuing, despite the federal government’s emphasis on fossil fuels and nuclear. FERC lists 136 GW of “high probability additions” through August 2028, with renewables, led by solar and followed by wind, accounting for nearly 84%. Natural gas accounts for about 15% of high probability additions.

“Notwithstanding impediments created by the Trump Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, solar and wind continue to add more generating capacity than fossil fuels and nuclear power,” the Sun Day Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong said in a statement. “And FERC foresees renewable energy’s role expanding in the next three years while the shares provided by coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear all contract.”

Large renewable projects that began operating in August include Hecate Energy’s 517-MW Outpost solar and storage project in Webb County, Texas; Gibson Solar’s 280-MW project in Gibson County, Indiana; and expansions at the Roadrunner Crossing Wind Farm in Eastland County, Texas, totaling 254 MW.

Investors viewed the project as risky because of speculative offtake agreements and Air Products’ plan to retain responsibility for CCS and ammonia synthesis.
Air Products is expected to make a decision to go ahead with the project before the end of 2025.
Menezes told investors if Air Products is able to adequately de-risk the project, it could add up economically.
The jeopardy comes as Air Products looks to cut its capital expenditure by over $1bn to $4bn in 2026 before getting to around $2.5bn by 2028.","Air Products believes it could still proceed with its paused $4.5bn blue hydrogen plant in Louisiana, US, according to its CEO.

Speaking during the industrial gas firm’s Q4 results, Eduardo Menezes said although the development would not go ahead without an offtake agreement, there may be a way to make the project bankable.

The Louisiana development was announced in 2021 with plans to produce up to 1,700 tonnes of blue hydrogen per day and convert it into ammonia.

Investors viewed the project as risky because of speculative offtake agreements and Air Products’ plan to retain responsibility for CCS and ammonia synthesis.

After Menezes became CEO earlier this year, Air Products paused spending on the development in May as it explored options to de-risk it by firming up offtake and looking to offload the CCS and ammonia operations.

Air Products is expected to make a decision to go ahead with the project before the end of 2025.

The CEO told investors the firm was looking to transform the project into a “regular” hydrogen and air separation project by handing off the CCS and ammonia elements.

“We’re evaluating proposals to divest the carbon sequestration and ammonia production assets,” he said. “We will only go forward with this project if we can sign firm offtake agreements for hydrogen and nitrogen from the facilities that will be owned and operated by Air Products.”

He indicated the firm was “very advanced” in those negotiations.

Menezes told investors if Air Products is able to adequately de-risk the project, it could add up economically.

“When you look at the natural gas price, the infrastructure that we have in place, and the 45Q [carbon capture incentive], it is the right place to install blue ammonia projects,” he said.

“Even our competitors that are doing similar projects in Texas and Louisiana and saying exactly the same thing: that you can be competitive even against grey ammonia in Europe.”

“If I really didn’t think we have a chance to have something, it would be much easier for me to say that today. But we still believe we can find an interesting solution for this project.”

However, if a solution can’t be found, Air Products would look to minimise its losses.

“If we decided not to go forward, of course, we still have this asset that is the floor space that we can try to monetise in the market,” Menezes said.

The jeopardy comes as Air Products looks to cut its capital expenditure by over $1bn to $4bn in 2026 before getting to around $2.5bn by 2028.

The decision will play a key role in how the company balances growth in low-carbon hydrogen with tighter capital spending targets.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/01/Image-courtesy-of-Air-Products-and-Chemicals-Inc-Air-Products-SMR-Convent-Louisiana-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-11-07 11:09:10.544195

Are you thinking about buying an electric vehicle?","Tesla has listed 30 new jobs at its Austin location in anticipation of a ramped-up production process for its buzzworthy self-driving taxi.

As reported by the Austin American-Statesman, the electric vehicle manufacturer is currently hiring for roles at Gigafactory Texas to begin Cybercab production, with ""volume production"" potentially starting in 2026.

Most of the new roles are directly related to manufacturing and include engineering and equipment technicians for areas such as the drive units, battery packs, and general assembly. These new listings indicate the company is rapidly accelerating its hiring efforts ahead of the large-scale rollout of the Cybercab.

As noted by the Statesman, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously alluded to the fact that the Cybercab will become the company's ""highest-volume vehicle"" yet, with a target of producing around two million units annually. Musk has stated that its manufacturing process will be significantly different from traditional car lines, resembling a high-speed consumer electronics assembly.

While the promising production speed is tantalizing, Musk has made several promises about various Tesla vehicles that have come up short, including the production of the Cybertruck. The EV manufacturer created a post-launch goal of 200,000 to 250,000 units per year, based on the original high demand for the electric truck.

However, since its launch in 2023, the Cybertruck has failed to live up to expectations, posting disappointing sales numbers over the last two years. This has matched with the company's overall sales struggles in the EV marketplace, especially across several countries in Europe, where Tesla is being outpaced by rival manufacturers.

Although the Cybertruck has failed to live up to the hype, Tesla has certainly sparked widespread interest in EVs. More people than ever are making the switch from gas-powered vehicles and taking advantage of the fewer maintenance requirements of EVs and their long-term value.

Drivers can increase their savings even more by opting to charge their EV at home. Home charging stations are significantly cheaper than using public chargers, offering hundreds of dollars in annual savings. Qmerit is helping homeowners who are interested in installing Level 2 EV chargers by providing free, instant installation estimates.

EV drivers can take those savings to another level when pairing their home charging station with the installation of solar panels. Charging your EV with your own energy is cheaper than using public charging stations and can be more dependable than relying on the grid. EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

Energy Transfer has been developing the 16.5 million metric tons per annum LNG export facility and has sold most of the expected production to long-term customers, but has faced rising project costs and wants to share the risk with equity partners.

“Our projects need to meet certain risk-return criteria, and we’re not there yet on LNG,” co-CEO Tom Long said.

“We are hoping that these equity partners will step up by the end of the year and get us to where we want this kind of risk profile, in the space we want this project,” he added.

The company earlier this year signed a non-binding agreement with MidOcean Energy to jointly develop the Lake Charles LNG export facility.

MidOcean is expected to pay for 30% of the construction costs of the facility and receive 30% of the LNG production, or roughly 5 million tons a year.

Without these projects, our nation is staring down the barrel of a less reliable energy system and more expensive energy.","After decades of stagnant growth, the demand for energy in America is surging again.

A major driver is the return of manufacturing, after decades of offshoring, thanks to President Trump negotiating new trade and investment deals with other countries. An even bigger reason is America’s determination to win the global race for dominance in artificial intelligence (AI).

The rise of AI and the growing use of cloud computing by businesses and individuals is fueling a boom in data center construction across the country. In the short term, all those new data centers will need a staggering amount of electricity to power their operations — roughly 150-400 terawatt hours per year by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

In practical terms, that could mean building more new power plants than currently exist in California, Oregon and Washington state in the space of just a few years.

The construction of data centers, power plants, transmission lines, pipelines and other kinds of energy infrastructure could be a game changer for the U.S. economy, and especially rural America.

But none of it — none — can happen without every individual project and piece of infrastructure getting a federal permit of some kind.

And there we have a problem. Despite several attempts at reform, America’s permitting system for major construction projects is still woefully inefficient. It’s even been weaponized by fringe activist groups to block commonsense infrastructure projects that would be permitted in a heartbeat by other countries.

There are many cases where permitting reviews that could be completed in months but are taking years instead, and it’s destroying our ability to stay ahead of countries like China. Just look at the 15 years it took to permit the 700-mile TransWest transmission line. The madness has to stop.

This is why the work of Republican Congressman Gabe Evans of Colorado, a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives, deserves to be highlighted.

Congressman Evans worked with three other members of the caucus from California, Pennsylvania and New York to develop a series of reforms to the U.S. permitting system that are badly overdue.

Some highlights of the Evans framework for permitting reform include:

• Speed up permitting through clear and enforceable deadlines for agency decisions and court challenges.

• Replace outdated paper systems with centralized digital platforms and online portals, which will reduce delays and increase public transparency.

• Eliminate duplicative environmental reviews and court challenges for pipeline and transmission line projects that ask and answer the same questions over and over.

• Take politics out of cross-border infrastructure projects — like the Keystone XL pipeline, which was killed by former president Joe Biden on his first day in office — by removing the White House from the formal approval process.

The framework isn’t about reducing environmental safeguards — it’s about giving those safeguards a chance to actually work by allowing well-designed and environmentally responsible projects to enter construction.

“We have to make sure that we can navigate our own regulatory environment to be able to build these things here in the United States with some of the best and most environmentally and socially responsible guidelines, really anywhere on the planet,” Congressman Evans told Colorado Public Radio.

The new reality of American energy demand will require every energy technology we can muster, including solar, battery storage, natural gas turbines, geothermal, wind and nuclear — and the reforms being pushed by Congressman Evans and his bipartisan allies will help all of those energy sources move through the permitting process faster.

Without these projects, our nation is staring down the barrel of a less reliable energy system and more expensive energy. That’s bad enough on its own, but failure to build will also hand victory in the global AI race to China, which is notorious for building things fast with few, if any, safeguards.

Like it or not, whichever nation wins the AI race will have the best weapons and control the flow of information in an increasingly digital world. Losing is not an option, and as a country, it’s time we started acting like it.

A demand air pocket

Rivian's quarterly strength was helped by U.S. buyers rushing to capture federal EV tax credits before they expired on Sept. 30. In other words, there was a significant pull-forward in demand. To this end, management expects a huge step down in deliveries for the final quarter of the year; the mid-point of the company's full-year vehicle delivery guidance range implies about 10,000 deliveries in Q4, down from just over 13,200 in Q3 and about even with the year-ago period -- not the sort of growth profile you want from a company operating with massive losses.

So, is the stock's big gain the beginning of a longer-term upward move? While there's no way to know what a stock will do in the future, I personally wouldn't bet on good returns from here. The stock's nearly $19 billion market cap, even as Rivian burns through cash, just isn't a compelling investment thesis. Indeed, given the capital intensity of its business, it wouldn't be surprising to see losses accelerate as production of a lower-priced model ramps up next year.

With all of this said, I would consider changing my mind if sales growth begins accelerating on a more consistent basis next year. But I'd need to see signs of significant improvement in profitability, too. Additionally, I might consider the stock if it were cheaper; to convince me to invest in a risky, capital-intensive operation, I'm going to need a really good deal.

In the statement, the company noted that its inaugural EMPower Network Program will see former veterans undertake 12-months of formal training, accredited qualifications, rotational placements, and mentoring from experienced professionals.

“Participants will gain hands-on experience across the business, developing the technical and leadership skills needed to thrive in one of the UK’s most critical industries,” ScottishPower said in the statement.

EMPower joins a suite of pre-employment programs offered by ScottishPower, including initiatives for young people, career returners, and graduates, the company highlighted in the statement, adding that, “together, these programs form a cornerstone of the company’s approach to inclusive recruitment and long-term talent development”.

ScottishPower said in the statement that the launch of the EMPower Network Program “marks a major milestone” in its “broader strategy to invest in people and skills as the energy system undergoes its most significant transformation in decades”.

The company revealed in the statement that it is “recruiting at a record rate as it builds its workforce to deliver the biggest rewiring Britain has seen”. ScottishPower said it will create 300 jobs by the end of the year alone and another 2,000 jobs by 2027.

Veterans joining EMPower will be based across Central and Southern Scotland, North West England, and Mid/North Wales, with roles tailored to their aspirations and strengths, ScottishPower said in the statement.

“Research shows that over 80 percent of former military personnel believe their skills are transferable to civilian roles, yet many report struggling to find long-term employment or to maintain confidence in their capabilities,” ScottishPower noted in the statement.

“EMPower aims to bridge this gap by giving veterans the tools, knowledge and confidence to take on roles in one of the UK’s most critical industries,” it added.

“With the energy sector undergoing rapid transformation to meet electrification, the initiative is a key step in future-proofing the grid and building a more diverse, resilient workforce,” it continued.

In the statement, Nicola Connelly, CEO of SP Energy Networks, said, “we’re proud to welcome the first cohort of veterans to the EMPower Network Program”.

“This is a significant moment - not just for those starting their journey with us, but for the energy sector as a whole,” Connelly added.

“Veterans bring resilience, adaptability and leadership, and the EMPower Network Program is about recognizing that value and giving them the opportunity to build meaningful careers while helping us deliver the infrastructure Britain needs,” Connelly continued.

UK Minister for Veterans and People, Louise Sandher-Jones, said in the statement, “the EMPower Network Program provides a clear pathway for veterans to transition these skills into meaningful careers in one of our most critical industries - helping them to maximize their potential whilst contributing to our Plan for Change to make Britain a clean energy superpower”.

“Programs like this and the government-funded Career Transition Partnership and Op ASCEND employment support service will help ensure no veteran falls through the cracks, and that the energy sector benefits from the outstanding talent our Armed Forces community has to offer,” the minister added.

UK Minister for Industry Chris McDonald said in the statement, “having employed veterans myself, I know that they already have the expertise to take advantage of the thousands of well-paid clean energy jobs that are being created across the country by our clean energy superpower mission - including upgrading Britain’s electricity grid”.

Ex-serviceman Barry McIntosh went on to note in the statement, “I’m excited to begin this new chapter with the EMPower Network Program”.

“Joining SP Energy Networks means more than a job - it means being part of something that powers communities and drives our green future forward,” he added.

“The same commitment, teamwork and resilience I learned in the forces will now help me support Scotland’s energy transition and build something lasting. This isn’t just a change of uniform - it’s a new purpose, a new mission, and I’m ready for it,” he continued.

In a statement posted on its website back in September, ScottishPower said it welcomed its largest ever cohort of early career professionals.

“A record 338 graduates and trainees have joined the company this month, kicking off their careers in roles that span engineering, cyber security, project management and more,” ScottishPower said in that statement.

“It’s the largest early careers intake ScottishPower has ever welcomed - and it includes a 59 percent jump in apprentices and a 47 percent rise in graduate hires compared to last year,” it added.

“The company has significantly ramped up its investment in talent, reflecting the growing demand for skilled professionals across its businesses signaling the company’s commitment to building the workforce of the future,” it continued.

The two-year graduate program and hands-on trainee schemes are designed to fast-track careers while giving participants the chance to work on major infrastructure and energy projects across the UK, ScottishPower noted in that statement.

ScottishPower is part of the Iberdrola Group, which the statement describes as one of the world’s largest integrated utility companies and a global leader in electrification. ScottishPower noted in the statement that it is “the only vertically integrated energy company in the UK with businesses that operate from power to plug”.",,N,,2025-11-07 11:05:51.355840

Today, as a professor at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, McElroy studies how affective polarization — the growing dislike and distrust of people with different political views — affects the workplace.
Especially since nearly 75% of employees are having politically charged conversations in the workplace, according to McElroy.","The summer before his senior year of high school, Terence McElroy found himself in an unexpected place: a leadership camp at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He was there to prepare for his new role as captain of the cross-country team.

“It was a place I never could have imagined myself,” he admits.

Despite growing up just 60 miles south of West Point, McElroy had few connections to the military. But something about the structure, the discipline, and the drive of those around him — people striving to be their best mentally, physically, and academically — resonated deeply. So much so that he applied to West Point for college and got in.

That first summer of training, though, was a shock.

“I was not a very good cadet at first,” he says, chuckling. “But I adapted, and by the end of freshman year, I loved it.”

With his family just 45 minutes away, McElroy often brought fellow cadets home during school breaks. The mix of his West Point peers and high school friends sparked lively — and sometimes tense — conversations.

“There would always be tension and conflict,” he says. “When you’re 21 years old and having all these late-night discussions about life, politics inevitably came up. I always found myself as more of a peacemaker, seeing the good points made by both sides.”

Those moments stuck with him. Today, as a professor at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, McElroy studies how affective polarization — the growing dislike and distrust of people with different political views — affects the workplace. He also explores how multicultural experiences shape leadership.

“I think a lot of the lessons I learned in the military translate nicely into the business world,” he says.

From the Army to academia

After graduating from West Point in 2010, McElroy became a field artillery officer and completed airborne school at Fort Benning, Georgia. Then, he became a U.S. Army Ranger, completing tours in Afghanistan and Italy.

“Being 23 years old and leading soldiers — many of whom were older than me — was a huge challenge and a very humbling experience,” McElroy shares. “You’re leading people from all walks of life, and I quickly realized that I couldn’t communicate with everyone the same way.”

Eager to improve his leadership skills, McElroy enrolled in an MBA program at the University of Virginia after completing his service in 2016.

“It was really my MBA experiences that shaped my interest in pursuing topics related to our cultural differences and figuring out moments where we could bridge divides,” he says.

One professor recommended he read “The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion” by Jonathan Haidt. The book, which explores moral foundations theory — a framework co-developed by Haidt to explain the psychology of morality — struck a chord.

Inspired, McElroy decided to pursue a PhD focused on political ideology in the workplace. At the time, few business schools were exploring the topic, and he wasn’t sure it was the right path.

Then, fate intervened.

He saw Haidt on a train in New York City. The renowned social psychologist encouraged McElroy to pursue the research — and even offered to help with his PhD applications.

“I was blown away by his generosity,” McElroy says. “He reviewed my materials and encouraged me to pursue my interests during a time I was unsure I could even talk about politics at a business school. Without that, I don’t know if I’d be where I am.”

Culture, conflict, and connection

McElroy was drawn to Kenan-Flagler’s PhD program by faculty like William Maddux, whose research delves into how cultural experiences shape creativity, leadership, morality, and decision-making in the workplace. Their shared interests made Maddux a natural fit as McElroy’s advisor.

McElroy focuses his research on countering affective polarization — the tendency to view those with opposing political beliefs as fundamentally different or threatening. He argues that this misperception is fueled by extreme views amplified through social media, partisan news outlets, and political rhetoric.

His findings suggest that multicultural experiences such as studying abroad often lead to more open-minded perspectives, a deeper understanding of personal identity, and a greater ability to form meaningful connections with others.

“When people go abroad, they’re immersed in a new culture, surrounded by a different language, and forced to adapt,” McElroy says. “They’re outside their comfort zones. Many return as better leaders because they’ve faced challenges and succeeded. It changes people.”

McElroy also suggests that embracing contradictory beliefs — rather than trying to change someone’s mind — may be a powerful strategy for reducing polarization and cultivating empathy across ideological lines. Especially since nearly 75% of employees are having politically charged conversations in the workplace, according to McElroy.

“We know these conversations are happening,” he says. “We want to provide managers with a framework to foster a culture where people feel safe expressing differing views.”

One practical approach? Teaching leaders to be listeners. McElroy sees the impact firsthand with his executive MBA students. In one coaching session, students bring in real leadership challenges they’re facing.

“There’s often a lightbulb moment,” he says. “We focus on truly understanding the problem, actively listening — and they start solving it themselves just by talking through it.”

He believes this same approach can transform political conversations. When people listen with the intent to understand rather than debate, they’re better positioned to resolve conflict and build trust.

“I’d love to live in a world where we could talk about our experiences and our beliefs from a place of curiosity,” he says. “That’s the direction I hope my research continues to explore.”",https://research.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/terence-mcelroy-lead.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:08:53.341755

Despite the challenges of running a business, Sonnenberg finds joy in the human connection it allows.","DETROIT LAKES — At 15-years-old, Emily Sonnenberg opened Ideal Thrifts . Since, it has become her full-time job. In addition to providing the lakes area resident with a career, it has also kept vintage clothes in circulation.

It was January 2021 when Sonnenberg began selling clothes online. Growing up around the area, the rural Frazee resident shopped second-hand for affordability, often thrifting for clothes and getting everyday items from garage sales. She became aware of how others were selling their finds online and it sparked an entrepreneurial interest in her. From her childhood bedroom, she opened her online clothing store.

Since the inception of her business, Sonnenberg has found high-quality, vintage items second-hand and then rehomes them.

“I saw other people making an income doing this thing that I already do and I love, so I thought, ‘Why don’t I pick up things for other people to rehome?’” she said. “Growing up, we shopped second-hand just because it's more affordable, but as my passion for it grew, you kind of get addicted to rehoming these pieces.”

Her business began with Instagram story sales, regularly posting products as part of “Story Sale Sundays.” Now, at 20 years old, over the last four years, she has expanded to Poshmark , eBay and Whatnot , a live-selling platform.

This past summer, she participated in the most in-person markets she has ever done, including booths at WE Fest and Shady Hallow Flea Market. She even hired her first-ever part-time assistant, Clodarl Seeman of Perham, who she met when Seeman was a customer of hers.

“That’s where my passion lies, in the human interaction, connecting with people in person,” she said.

The transition back to school after COVID was difficult, she said. She ran the business throughout high school and graduated from an online program. She also attended college-level courses online and secured an entrepreneurship certificate from M State. Sonnenberg said the decision to go to school online allowed her to focus on running her business while keeping up academically.

“I’ve always been someone who can keep myself accountable for my work,” she said.

Reclaiming a love of thrifting by making an income isn’t what drives Sonnenberg. She aims to reduce the amount of clothing that ends up in landfills and counteract a culture of consumerism. She wants to be conscious of the environmental impacts of the fashion industry.

“I think that's just important to a lot of our generation,” she said, adding that second-hand fashion is more ethical and sustainable. “It’s not just creating, and creating and creating… a lot of big corporations do not have ethical procedures in place.”

Social media also helped her learn more about the fashion industry’s hidden consequences, and she encourages people to educate themselves.

“I learned through other people the problems that not everybody talks about — we’re not always conscious of how the fashion industry, the new fashion industry, is harmful,” she said.

Sonnenberg encourages people to think critically about consumption. She said that she focuses on high-quality materials and natural fibers whenever possible.

“They’re quality, but they can also decompose, so like, if something happens, they're recyclable, unlike polyester elastic,” she said.

Fast fashion, defined as trendy, inexpensive clothing designed for short-term wear, has significant environmental impacts. The fashion industry contributes 2-8% of global greenhouse gas emissions . By rehoming clothing, Sonnenberg reduces the demand for new production, which lowers consumption, emissions and textile waste. Conscious purchasing and brand research are ways consumers can mitigate these impacts.

The biggest growth, Sonnenberg said, came from diversifying sales platforms, but she also has plenty more ideas for the future.

“Because we're partially in person and partially online, it can look so many different ways. And I'm only 20, and I'm not sure how I want it to look, but I'm always gonna toy with the idea of having a brick and mortar,” she said. She hopes to expand her team next summer and collaborate with other small businesses, especially women.

Despite the challenges of running a business, Sonnenberg finds joy in the human connection it allows. She loves seeing customers light up when they find something they’ve been looking for. For her, the curation process is a form of creative expression.

“Everything that running your own business encompasses, I don't want to take away the creative aspect of it. I don't create my products, but it's a curation … when people find things through me, it's an expression because it's unique — they see themselves in it,” she said.

Sonnenberg has a particular passion for 1990s vintage fashion. She prefers sourcing originals over reproductions, noting that many modern brands, including Urban Outfitters and Brandy Melville, take inspiration from previous decades.

“I want the real thing,” she said.

She emphasizes patience as a key lesson for entrepreneurs. Growth comes organically, and it’s important not to force it — and most importantly, she said, if you have a passion for something, it will work out.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/175fc43/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x2455+0+0/resize/1313x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcc%2F66%2F0d7a6afa443a9b0b53eb110f47d6%2Fimg-2714-2.jpeg,N,,2025-11-07 14:06:46.074957

Ensuring cuts in emissions can completely transform the climate crisis that the world is being subjected to. Now, it has emerged that the DNV, a global independent assurance and risk management provider, has noted that the renewable energy sector will account for over 25% of emission reduction levels in the Asia-Pacific region, with hydrogen, ammonia, and emerging fuels playing a critical role.

New Energy Commodities (NEC) will be essential to reducing emissions in APAC

DNV has become a global leader in the analysis of the emission goals of the world. The Asia-Pacific region, known most of the time as APAC, will see its New Energy Commodities playing a crucial role in cutting emissions in the region, with hydrogen, ammonia, and emerging fuels playing a major role in reaching APAC’s emission goals by 2050.

According to a new report from DNV, NECs will account for roughly 25% of APAC’s emission reduction over the next decade or so, as the sector has seen significant growth in the region and further afield over the past few years. Reducing emissions will allow the planet to recover from generations of abuse from the fossil fuel sector, with NECs playing an essential role in APAC specifically, as noted by DNV’s leadership.

““Reaching net zero won’t be possible without NECs, especially in Asia-Pacific where diverse solutions are needed due to the region’s geography. Hydrogen, ammonia, sustainable fuels, and carbon capture are essential for industries that are hard to decarbonize. Without expanding NECs, these sectors risk falling behind. – Brice Le Gallo, Vice-President and Regional Director, Asia Pacific, Energy Systems at DNV

DNV published its report at a recent renewable energy summit in Singapore

During the recent Asia Clean Energy Summit (ACES), held in conjunction with Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2025, DNV released its report titled The role of new energy commodities in decarbonizing Asia Pacific. The report finds that NECs will account for approximately 25% of APAC’s emission cuts over the next few decades as the world turns to the renewable energy sector.

Furthermore, the report finds that several APAC nations will see increases in NEC consumption, with Japan, South Korea, and Singapore expected to become top consumers of the NEC sector, although it should be noted that they will mostly rely on foreign imports. Certifying low-carbon energy is the name of the game for DNV. Europe has also seen its Parliament approve a new framework for low-carbon hydrogen certification, pointing to the role that hydrogen will play in the global energy sector over the next few decades.

DNV’s management has noted the importance of decarbonizing several sectors in APAC, with the organization’s leadership lamenting the slow adoption of the NEC sector.

“Within the region’s diverse range of countries, six key industries (aviation, maritime, steel, power, industrial chemicals and cement) will depend heavily on NECs to achieve deep decarbonization.” – Thomas Koller, Regional Hydrogen, Ammonia and Sustainable Fuels Lead, Asia Pacific, Energy Systems at DNV

According to the USGS’ report on silicon, there are currently four companies that produce polysilicon in the US.

In that report summary, several examples of companies building a silicon-based solar supply chain are highlighted without naming any companies, however some of the examples can clearly be referenced to Qcells—with mention of its vertically-integrated facility in Georgia—and REC Silicon, with the mention of production of its electronic-grade polysilicon ceasing in Montana.

Moreover, the summary, which can be accessed here, highlights that nearly 80% of the global estimated production of silicon materials—not just for solar products—in 2024 came from Chima.

In the case of tellurium and its use in CdTe thin-film solar technology, First Solar is the most well-known company using this technology. The company recently unveiled plans to build another manufacturing facility in the US next year, which will have an annual nameplate capacity of 3.7GW, once it reaches full capacity in the first half of 2027.

The USGS’ list of critical minerals help determine which minerals are considered essential for the economy of the US, its national security and if its supply chains can be vulnerable to any disruption. In the case of silicon, most of the solar manufacturing capacity across the entire supply chain is still concentrated in China, especially at the wafer level.

The addition of silicon and the continued inclusion of tellurium have been welcomed by trade body the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, which had called for the inclusion of silicon and maintaining tellurium in the list last September.

“The US leads the world in CdTe innovation and manufacturing, and this continued recognition will help strengthen domestic supply chains for tellurium refining and recovery, supporting growth of American solar manufacturing and innovation,” said Mike Carr, executive director at the SEMA Coalition.

The addition of silicon to the list comes only days after the US solar industry celebrated the reshoring of the entire supply chain with Corning’s ingot and wafer plant beginning operations in the third quarter of 2025.

“Together, these inclusions signal the administration’s recognition that energy security depends on the strength and resilience of the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished solar modules. We look forward to working to ensure these critical designations translate into meaningful policy tools that derisk supply chains, create American jobs, and bolster American energy dominance,” added Carr.

However, solar manufacturing using silicon remains scarce in the US, with insufficient polysilicon and wafer manufacturing annual nameplate capacity to meet current market demand, which is expected to be less than 50GW in 2025, according to recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20071029151252_08_Polysilicon_solar_cell.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:04:21.784009

New federal data show that nearly 70% of the mileage on the ten longest U.S. interstates now lies within 10 miles of a fast electric vehicle charger.

Expanding access, lingering doubts

According to an analysis by the Associated Press using data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, more than 12,000 new fast-charging ports have been installed within a mile of U.S. highways this year alone—about one-fifth of all quick chargers currently in service.

Despite that growth, range anxiety remains widespread. A new AP-NORC and University of Chicago survey found that four in ten adults still cite charging access or range as a major reason not to buy an electric vehicle. Only about two in ten say they are very likely to choose an EV as their next car.

Advocates like Daphne Dixon, who leads a nonprofit promoting clean transportation, are working to change those perceptions. Dixon has driven cross-country in an EV every year since 2022, documenting her experience online in hopes of showing that charging infrastructure is already strong enough for long trips.

“Range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” she said. “A lot of people still fear there aren’t enough chargers, but new ones are being put in every single day.”

Charging the interstates

Drivers on Interstate 80, which stretches from New York to California, now find few segments farther than 10 miles from a fast charger between New York City and Des Moines, Iowa. Out west, coverage remains patchier, but it has improved sharply—up 44% since 2021.

Nationwide, nearly 70% of the ten longest interstates are now within 10 miles of a high-speed charger, up from about half five years ago. These stations can recharge a depleted EV battery in 20 minutes to an hour, compared to four to ten hours for slower home chargers.

Even so, some rural regions still lack access. In Connecticut, for example, the only charger along part of scenic Route 7 had been out of service for years. Local officials say new federal funding—about $1.3 million—will add eight fast plugs nearby in 2026 after delays in the national EV infrastructure rollout.

Cost still the biggest barrier

While many drivers worry about charging, cost remains the leading obstacle. The same poll found that high sticker prices are the top reason Americans hesitate to switch to electric cars. Only about 20% said price was not a factor.

EVs accounted for about 8% of U.S. vehicle sales in 2024, up from just 1.9% five years earlier. Analysts note that long-term ownership costs are lower because electricity and maintenance are cheaper than gasoline, but consumers often focus on the upfront expense—especially as federal tax credits have expired, adding $7,500 to the effective price of many new models.

A gradual shift

Advocates say daily driving habits make modern EVs practical for most people. The average American drives less than 30 miles per day, well within the range of even lower-cost models.

Connecticut driver Jim Warner, who owns both an EV and a plug-in hybrid, said he has driven his Chevy Bolt about 400 miles on road trips without problems. “The first trip, I turned the heat off and stayed at 65,” he said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

As the network of chargers continues to grow, experts say the biggest challenge may no longer be infrastructure—but convincing drivers that it’s already there.

Ben Shire, director of civic partnerships at West Central Initiative, told the Moorhead Economic Development Authority that West Central is celebrating 40 years serving a nine-county region and a portion of the White Earth Nation.

""I think it's more than $13,000,000, which has come back into the city limits of Morehead since we started back in 1986,"" Shire said, describing grant and discretionary funds awarded to Moorhead organizations.

Shire highlighted a ""mayor's network"" of 10 communities installing small-scale solar on public buildings in partnership with Otter Tail Power Company and using federal tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act. He said those are typically ""40 kW or less"" projects that often cash-flow within two years and can produce decades of taxpayer savings.

Shire said the Minnesota Department of Commerce indicated it may free up state funds to leverage federal rebates to reach communities that are served by municipal utilities and are currently ineligible for some private utility rebates; Moorhead was cited as an example. ""We're having a follow-up call with them this week,"" he said.

Why it matters: The presentation underscored regional partnership models for economic and clean-energy work and asked the EDA to consider continuing Moorhead's funding support for West Central Initiative in upcoming city budgets.

Addition of uranium to the U.S. Geological Survey Critical Minerals List marks a major step toward revitalizing U.S. uranium mining and rebuilding America's nuclear fuel supply chain

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, Nov. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE American: UEC), the ""Company"" or ""UEC"") applauds the U.S. Government decision to add uranium in the U.S. Geological Survey's (""USGS"") Final 2025 Critical Minerals List, as published in the Federal Register, recognizing its essential role in America's energy and national security.

Amir Adnani, President and CEO, stated:

""We applaud the U.S. Government, particularly Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the U.S. Geological Survey, for taking this important step toward fulfilling President Trump's vision of restoring America's leadership in critical minerals and achieving true U.S. Energy Dominance. UEC is heeding that call with ramp-up and development activities at our three licensed hub-and-spoke production platforms in Texas and Wyoming. In parallel, we're advancing the United States Uranium Refining & Conversion Corp. to help restore and expand America's domestic nuclear fuel conversion capabilities.""

The Energy Act of 2020 allows the Secretary of the Interior to designate a mineral as critical when another federal agency, such as the Department of Energy or another relevant agency, determines it is strategic and critical to U.S. defense or national security. The Department of Energy recommended uranium's inclusion, citing its importance in energy production and defense applications, and the Department of Defense also emphasized its national security significance.

The Federal Register Notice states:

""Critical minerals are essential for national security, economic stability, and supply chain resilience because they underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy. The United States is heavily reliant on imports of certain mineral commodities from foreign sources, some of which are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain disruptions. The United States' dependence on imports and the vulnerability of supply chains raise the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience. The Nation possesses vast mineral resources that can create jobs, fuel prosperity, and significantly reduce our reliance on foreign nations, and the United States is taking actions to facilitate domestic mineral production. The List of Critical Minerals guides strategies to secure the Nation's mineral supply chains.""

Some states have taken action to aid and encourage clean energy development in their states.

For wind and solar energy facilities to qualify for the tech-neutral Internal Revenue Code Section 45Y production tax credit (PTC) and Section 48E investment tax credit (ITC), construction must begin by July 4, 2026, or they must be placed in service no later than Dec. 31, 2027. For facilities that begin construction or place in service by the deadline, they can claim 100% of the credit until 2033.

The states that stood to lose the most from the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act included Texas, Florida, Indiana, South Carolina and Illinois, according to June analysis by Cleanview Newsletter, a blog by a software platform that tracks clean energy data.

Julia Dinkel, associate director of public policy with Novogradac, said how much initiatives states take is often at the discretion of the political will within each state–and in its statehouse, with so-called “blue states” seemingly more amenable to accelerating green and clean energy endeavors than “red states.”

“It will largely depend on the governor,” said Dinkel. “Certainly, some Grand Old Party (GOP) governors are supportive of renewables.” They could be receptive to executive initiatives and, if bills to facilitate deployment were to come to their desk, they might be more receptive to signing them, said Dinkel.

The red/blue divide has layers. When President Donald Trump’s administration announced in early October it would terminate $7.56 billion in financial awards to more than 321 green and clean energy facilities, the impact weighed more heavily on blue states.

The U.S. Department of Energy also announced in September that it would “return more than $13 billion in unobligated funds” authorized in the IRA for clean energy endeavors.

Despite the changes, solar and wind facilities have seen the hardest push in the aftermath of OBBBA’s passage, said Dinkel.

“As we go along, I expect to see another push from states to adapt to the actual end of the credits,” said Dinkel.

Beyond state legislatures are utilities and regional organizations, said Dinkel. Three of the nation’s seven major regional transmission organizations developed and implemented or were in the process of implementing fast-tracking plans for energy resources as of September, including the country’s largest,

PJM Interconnection.

The pressure to place in service before the end of 2027 is clogging already-packed interconnection queues, said Dinkel.

“It’s a major hurdle everyone is, rightly, freaking out about,” said Dinkel, noting that solar and storage facilities make up the bulk of facilities waiting for interconnection.

At least four states–Colorado, California, Maine and New York–have already taken steps to accelerate the production of renewable energy facilities.

Colorado

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a letter in August directing state agencies to prioritize renewable energy facilities, including calling for the state to “integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible, along with any necessary electricity balancing resources and supporting infrastructure.” Polis asked all relevant agencies in the Centennial State to prioritize expeditious review of new facilities, calling out those eligible for Section 45, Section 48 and Section 25D specifically, as well as requesting consultation, permitting and pursuing flexible interconnection.

“We must provide confidence to the clean energy industry that Colorado is open for business as tariffs, shifting federal rules, supply chain crunches and market uncertainty risk delaying investment in these affordable domestic energy resources,” wrote Polis. “In addition, we have a time-limited window for procurement of tax-advantaged wind and solar. … Getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers; by maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they’re available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the state can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.”

Polis’ Aug. 1 letter also included other initiatives, including evaluating the impact on rates for Coloradans associated with tariffs and expiration of the PTC and ITC.

California

In September, the California Legislature sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a slate of energy bills, including S.B. 302, which excludes elective payment and the transfer of certain energy tax credits from California gross income to incentivize renewable energy production in the Golden State.

Others, aimed at incentivizing, through financing and other means, the pursuit of green and renewable energy. One bill, A.B. 1207, extended and renamed through 2045 the state’s Air Resources Boards’ cap-and-invest program. The piece aims to adopt greenhouse gas emissions limits and emissions reduction measures.

The state Assembly also sent to Newsom’s desk A.B. 1408, which requires electric utilities and the California Independent System Operator to evaluate, consider and integrate interconnection as part of power transmission and distribution planning.

Interconnection remains an uphill battle in California, too, with engineering, electronics and technology publication TechXplore reporting that while the state has enough potential wind, solar and battery facilities to power statewide demand, they face an interconnection queue as long as five years.

Maine

In July, state utility regulators fast-tracked energy plans for nearly 1,600 gigawatt hours of power. Developers had two weeks to submit proposals. The state sought to bring enough energy generation online to power 13% of the state’s annual electrical usage. Developments that seek to use lands contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are given priority consideration.

New York

In August, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul requested state energy regulators undertake a high-level review of budget law and its impact on residents.

It’s a challenge to move quickly, however, as investigative nonprofit publication New York Focus indicated: The Empire State has approved 28 major wind and solar facilities in the past four years, but just one was operational as of a July report. Only one other was under construction.

In July, the state’s fire prevention and building code council introduced an all-electric building standard that prohibits gas and fossil fuels in most new buildings in the state.

Powering the Future

While the OBBBA creates fresh challenges, the renewable energy tax credits community has experienced adversity in the past, from launching the lifecycles of now-standard energy systems to the extension of incentives such as the ITC and PTC.

Clean energy jobs grew more than three times faster in California than the rest of the state’s economy in 2024, raising the total number of clean energy workers in the state to more than half a million, according to the tenth annual Clean Jobs California report released today by the national, nonpartisan business group E2.

“While federal actions stymie clean energy growth, California continues to prove that strong state policy is good for the economy and environment,” said Susan Nedell, senior Western advocate for E2. “During this year’s legislative session, our members helped convince state lawmakers to pass landmark climate bills like extending the Cap-and-Invest program through 2045 and opening the door to a stronger regional grid through the Pathways Initiative.”

Jobs in batteries, energy efficiency, storage and grid, and other clean energy subsectors continued to grow faster than the broader economy, accounting for an increasingly large share of the state’s workforce. Energy efficiency hosts more than half of California’s clean energy jobs, responsible for 312,090 in 2024.

However, renewable energy generation saw a slight dip after hitting a record high of 136,591 workers at the end of 2023. Clean vehicles also took a hit across the country, along with internal combustion engine vehicles, and California saw a similar decline losing 2,822 clean vehicle-related jobs.

Though not reflected in the 2024 data, recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration — to kill projects, revoke tax credits, cancel permits and add new regulatory red tape – have already caused major job losses in the clean energy industry, with more expected to come. According to separate E2 research, since January 2025 companies canceled more than $2.2 billion in planned clean energy related factories and other projects in California that were expected to create thousands of new jobs.

As clean energy companies and investors are reeling from federal decisions to slash clean energy support, the sector’s importance to the region’s overall economy is clearer than ever. Clean energy now accounts for 79 percent of all energy and vehicle-related jobs in the state, and three percent of all jobs. Industry-wide, nearly 55 percent of the sector’s jobs (about 360,000 jobs) are in construction or manufacturing.

“Energy efficiency remains the quickest and most affordable way to address GHG emissions from our built environment, the biggest sector of California’s clean economy, and yet remains under the radar and under resourced. This is why we have just launched the CA Building Performance Hub to directly support buildings statewide in reaching their energy efficiency goals,” said Ben Stapleton, Executive Director of the U.S. Green Building Council California (USGBC-CA). “California continues to leverage its position as the world’s fourth largest economy to secure billions in community investment, lower energy costs for ratepayers, and strengthen grid reliability.”

Los Angeles County is home to more than 102,000 clean energy workers, more than any county in America. A note on demographics, veterans made up 9.4% of the state’s clean energy workforce in 2024.

Methodology

This analysis of U.S. clean energy employment is based on employment data collected and analyzed by the BW Research Partnership for the 2025 U.S. Energy and Employment Report. The USEER analyzes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to track employment across many energy production, transmission and distribution subsectors.

Tax credits to help families afford their health insurance have been around for over 10 years.
Idaho families saved an average of $700 a year, and more than 86% of Idahoans enrolled used these tax credits.
With the expiration of the ePTCs, health insurance payments are rising again.
Health insurance is not a luxury.","Open enrollment to sign up for health coverage on Idaho’s state health insurance exchange (Your Health Idaho) is underway in Idaho, running from Oct. 15 through Dec. 15, and this year comes with new challenges for thousands of Idahoans. Unless Congress acts, the enhanced premium tax credits (ePTCs) that have made health insurance more affordable will expire on Dec. 31, forcing families and small business owners to face dramatic increases in their monthly payments.

The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

Tax credits to help families afford their health insurance have been around for over 10 years. A few years ago, Congress enhanced them because families needed extra support to maintain their coverage. These ePTCs reduced what people pay each month for their health insurance and expanded eligibility so that no household would spend more than 8.5% of income on monthly payments. The “tax credit cliff” was also removed which left middle-income families paying disproportionately high premiums simply because they earned slightly above the cutoff.

The results were immediate and meaningful. Idaho families saved an average of $700 a year, and more than 86% of Idahoans enrolled used these tax credits. Subsequently we saw more people enroll, which creates stability and keeps costs lower for everyone.

That progress is at risk. With the expiration of the ePTCs, health insurance payments are rising again. For many Idaho families and small business owners, those higher monthly payments add up to thousands of dollars more a year. For others, especially those who are self-employed or running small businesses, the increase could make coverage completely out of reach.

According to recent estimates, 25,000 Idahoans are expected to drop their insurance if the ePTCs aren’t made permanent. For a family of four in Idaho, annual costs could increase by more than $6,000, forcing many to choose between keeping their health insurance and paying for other essentials like rent, childcare, or transportation. For some families, costs will triple because the “tax credit cliff” will be reinstated.

Those statistics represent real people and real sacrifices. In every part of Idaho, families are trying to make hard choices about how to balance their budgets while protecting their health. A rancher in eastern Idaho, a child care provider in Twin Falls, or a young family in Lewiston could each be one unexpected bill away from losing the security that health insurance provides.

When people can’t afford their monthly payments, they often put off preventive care, skip prescriptions, or wait until they’re seriously ill before seeking help. That leads to higher costs and worse health outcomes, not only for those families, but for the entire health system. Hospitals, health care providers, and rural clinics all feel the strain when more people go uninsured.

The ePTCs were a proven solution. They lowered costs and expanded coverage. Letting them expire undermines that progress and risks reversing the historic coverage gains we’ve seen over the past few years.

Congress has an opportunity to fix this. Lawmakers should act quickly to permanently extend the ePTCs, ensuring families, small business owners, and self-employed workers can continue to afford health insurance. This is not a partisan issue. It’s about protecting the health and economic stability of Idaho families and communities.

Health insurance is not a luxury. It’s a foundation that allows families to stay healthy and productive. Idaho families deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing they can see a doctor when they need to without wondering how they’ll pay for it. Congress should act now to make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent and keep healthcare within reach for every Idahoan.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2211388790-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:07:42.184146

That shift will hit states hardest that do not diversify their energy resources and require that a specified percentage of the electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resources.
In Oklahoma, Energy Innovation predicts that electricity rates for residential, commercial and industrial consumers will grow between 60% and 350% over the next decade.
Over-reliance on gas plants, coupled with mistaken assumptions about their reliability, is a significant grid vulnerability.
Throwing new gas plants at the problem is an ineffectual attempt to keep up with energy demand predictions.","More than 40% of Oklahoma’s energy generation comes from wind turbines and solar companies are showing increased interest in building projects in the state. Yet Oklahoma’s position as a top-tier renewable energy producer may fade following the passage of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Signed into law July 4, the megabill slashed tax incentives for wind and solar projects that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which were lauded as the U.S.’s first climate change mitigation law and passed during the Biden administration.

These cuts are expected to drive up electricity bills across the U.S., with some of the sharpest increases in Republican-led states, according to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank.

Without tax credits the cost of wind and solar plants will go up. Companies will most likely respond by building fewer of these projects, and those facilities that do come on line will be much more costly.

When that occurs, it’s expected that the country will increase generation of electricity from natural gas plants which are often more expensive to run than wind and solar operations.

That shift will hit states hardest that do not diversify their energy resources and require that a specified percentage of the electricity utilities sell comes from renewable resources.

In Oklahoma, Energy Innovation predicts that electricity rates for residential, commercial and industrial consumers will grow between 60% and 350% over the next decade. That means $100 annual increases in household energy bills by 2030 and $540 by 2035. There is also a dire forecast for decreased economic activity. Their modeling suggests that Oklahoma will lose out on significant planned private investment and suffer job losses.

These cuts along with multiple laws passed by the 2025 Oklahoma Legislature that tightened regulations on wind and solar energy will at the very least slow down if not effectively stop the state’s renewable energy development.

The One Big Beautiful Bill was signed into law about two weeks after representatives from utilities and the Southwest Power Pool warned the Oklahoma Corporation Commission that the state would see a significant energy demand that is likely to outgrow its current supply.

Clearly, our electric utilities and regulators were caught off guard by the biggest jump in demand in a generation. One of the things they didn’t properly plan for is artificial intelligence, an immensely power-hungry technology, and the accompanying explosion in data centers.

One data center today consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but some of those currently under construction will require 20 times more.

As projections soar the question about the energy sources that will power the increased demand remain unanswered.

Natural gas in Oklahoma makes up about half of its generation. But it’s unclear if an adequate number of new plants will be built in time since gas-fired turbines, which are used in a majority of the country’s facilities, are backlogged for up to seven years.

Over-reliance on gas plants, coupled with mistaken assumptions about their reliability, is a significant grid vulnerability.

Gas plant operations are particularly susceptible to damage and disruptions during extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent and severe as the climate changes. Remember in 2021 Winter Storm Uri hit the central United States and knocked nearly a quarter of the affected area’s power plant capacity offline. Gas plants accounted for most of the failed capacity.

Utilities can bolster grid reliability by utilizing clean energy solutions. Pursuing clean energy solutions instead of fossil fuels lessens not only global warming emissions but also toxic air pollutants that harm public health, particularly in communities of color where gas plants are disproportionately located. Further, these demand-side solutions can reduce the need for new infrastructure and decrease the land-use impacts that come with large-scale projects.

Ratepayers should not bear the burden of hosting dirty gas plants whose pollution puts their health at risk nor should they be responsible for the infrastructure and service costs associated with rapid load growth due to large users such as data

Our legislators, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission as well as utilities themselves should create unique electricity rate structures, or tariffs, for data centers. What this means is that data centers should be subject to rates, terms, and conditions that are more appropriate to how they use energy and their impact on the grid. Utility costs have long been assigned to the customers that cause those costs, at least in theory.

Meanwhile, utilities must prioritize the use of renewables, efficiency, energy storage, and other grid-supporting technologies to meet this demand.

Throwing new gas plants at the problem is an ineffectual attempt to keep up with energy demand predictions. We must recognize the paradigm shift that load growth from data centers represent and stop trying to solve new problems with old tools.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Evergy-Lawrence-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 06:59:16.341280

The purpose of the mayors’ summit, Khan says, is to push regional politicians, often backed by more progressive urban electorates, to go further in doing something about it.
“We get nada, nothing,” she says when asked about government funding for policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change.
It endures three heatwaves a year these days; hot days can be followed by storms, with hailstones the size of tennis balls.","Wooden stakes bearing pictures of young men were driven into the yellow sands of Copacabana beach this week, opposite Rio de Janeiro’s swanky hotels on Avenida Atlântica where 300 mayors and their entourages were staying during the C40 World Mayors Summit.

Smiling up at the mayors in their hotel suites were photographs of four officers killed in what was the deadliest police raid in Brazilian history, just a few days before the summit. A further 117 people were killed in the operation in two of Rio’s largest clusters of favelas – the Complexo do Alemão and the Complexo da Penha – in what the police said was a clampdown on organised crime.

The raid attracted timely headlines and even approval for the regional governor, Cláudio Castro, an ally of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier.

The protest was an inauspicious start to a week in which Rio was hosting not only the C40 World Mayors Summit on climate change, co-chaired by London’s Sadiq Khan and Rio’s Social Democratic mayor, Eduardo Paes, but also Prince William’s Earthshot prize event. On Monday, Cop30 climate talks will start in the port city of Belém, 2,000 miles to the north.

Last week, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, acknowledged in an interview with the Guardian that it was now “inevitable” that humanity would overshoot the target set in Paris in 2015 of limiting global heating to 1.5C (2.7F), with “devastating consequences” for the world.

Globally, despite extreme heat, floods and devastating wildfires, populist leaders, some sceptical but others in outright denial about the science, are talking up the costs of action rather than the consequences of inaction.

The purpose of the mayors’ summit, Khan says, is to push regional politicians, often backed by more progressive urban electorates, to go further in doing something about it.

Cities account for 75% of global carbon emissions, he says. It was repeatedly noted that the second-biggest delegation after the Brazilians at the summit was the US one, with about 100 mayors attending in defiance of the White House – no high-level members of the Trump administration are expected to attend the Cop30 talks.

Khan says: “Mayors across the globe, and I include London, are good examples of leaders, politicians, actually taking action.” His fellow city leaders are not just tinkering at the edges, he says, but seeking to turn the tide in the face of deniers such as Donald Trump, swirling misinformation, a doubting public and thorny, even violent, local politics.

We talk to six mayors on what they are doing about the climate crisis:

Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr

Mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone; population 1.4 million

It had been a difficult few days for Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr. Shortly before getting on a plane from Sierre Leone in west Africa to Brazil a lorry drove into her parked car on a street in Freetown, crushing the side in which she usually sits.

She was not in the car at the time but then half an hour later it emerged that her driver’s house was on fire. What caused that? “Unknown, unknown,” she says.

“But there are a few things going on: I’m running for president, and I’ve been very vocal on narcotics,” she adds, calling it: “A series of unfortunate events.”

It is not the first time she has had to face such threats but, she says: “You can’t obsess about it or you wouldn’t get anything done.”

The impact of extreme weather, landslides and flooding has led to a burgeoning population in Aki-Sawyerr’s city, as subsistence farmers have concluded that they cannot make a living off the land.

In 2015, the city’s population was just over a million. That is expected to double by 2028. One consequence is a rising number of informal settlements replacing forests on the hillsides around the capital, and ever more logging to feed the wood-burning stoves that remain widespread, adding to the city’s carbon emissions.

Aki-Sawyerr has few powers as mayor beyond sanitation. Much of her time is spent trying to use her role to get international financing for projects such as a cable car system to reduce vehicle emissions, or the planting of 5 million trees by 2030.

But how to stop people cutting those trees down? That’s where her sanitation powers come in. “We’re actually converting faecal sludge into briquettes as an alternative cooking fuel,” she says.

“It is odourless, it’s dried, it’s carbonised – and by the end of December, we will have a machine that we’re importing that will enable us to produce the briquettes at scale.

“We’ve tested in homes, we’ve put them out to communities, and they’ve been really well received. What we haven’t been able to do is to produce them at scale.”

Giuseppe Sala

Mayor of Milan, Italy; population 1.4 million

It amazes Giuseppe Sala, a member of the Italian Green party and the mayor of Milan for nearly 10 years, how little he sees of Giorgia Meloni, the far-right prime minister of Italy. She has been to the city perhaps three times in as many years, he says.

She has, however, expressed her concerns about the “ideological” nature of the European Green Deal plan to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

One of the projects Sala thinks the rest of Italy could learn from is a campaign called “I don’t waste”, which involves primary school pupils being given a reusable bag to take home any uneaten food from school lunches. City hall calculations suggest it saves approximately 10,000 sandwiches, 9,000 pieces of fruit and 1,000 desserts from being wasted every month.

He has also brought in a low-emission zone to Milan, the largest in the EU that bans non-compliant cars. Milan remains congested but the air quality is improving and after a difficult first year it has been accepted by the public, he says.

Two months ago, he banned private vehicles entirely from the roads around Via Monte Napoleone, the city’s fashion centre. “Always make step by step,” he says, though he expects the 2027 mayoral election to be dominated by the issue, with his opponents insisting: “You have the right to drive your car where you want.”

“So that will be a good moment to see if the sensitivity of the people could change,” he says.

Nick Reece

Mayor of Melbourne, Australia; metro population 5.4 million

It was when a new planning application for a £100m datacentre came across his desk that Nick Reece, lord mayor for a year in the south-eastern Australian city of Melbourne, started asking questions.

“I was asking the team: what’s the energy consumption going to be of this new data centre?” he says. The answer was that these computing facilities would account for a fifth of the city’s energy consumption by 2040.

He is now lobbying for a national and international set of rules to govern datacentres. “If we don’t get some framework in place, which means that these new datacentres are principally powered by renewable power, then we are not going to be able to achieve our carbon-reduction targets,” he says.

“We don’t want to see a race to the bottom around artificial-intelligence infrastructure.”

Reece also wants companies to consider how to best use the energy produced by the centres, such as heating swimming pools in the city, which often rely on gas-fired boilers.

“In the race to become smart cities, we don’t want to cook the planet,” he says. “That would be ironic and a tragedy.”

Kate Gallego

Mayor of Phoenix, US; population 1.6 million

Last year, the city of Phoenix, Arizona, broke its own temperature record with 113 days above 100F (38C). “We hit 110 [fahrenheit] in October, which had never happened before,” she says.

“Close to Halloween, the pumpkins that my kids had, they sort of melted. It really was very serious. The first week of school for my eight-year-old [this year], we had 118[F]; they couldn’t go outside,” she says.

“I think that has helped us with the political consensus.”

Even for Phoenix, a city in the desert, this was extreme but looking across the world it was an extraordinary year. “We talked to the UK’s fire department about how we manage heat and how we keep our firefighters safe during heatwaves,” Gallego says.

While Phoenix burns, however, Donald Trump has turned off the financial taps. “We benefited enormously from the renewable energy tax credits, so losing those has been very difficult, and makes it more complex to finance projects,” she says.

“We received a significant grant called Solar For All [for low-income and disadvantaged households], which we are losing. Our electric vehicle spending grants have been suspended.

“The change in administration has dramatically impacted the amount of federal support we received.”

The state of Arizona voted for Trump, but Gallego says the extreme temperatures meant there was significant support for policies that both reduced emissions, such as investment in a light railway, and offered some mitigation, such as coating pavements with cooling materials so they absorb less heat, lowering the temperature of the streets and ensuring fewer potholes emerge as a result of the asphalt expanding and shrinking.

Carolina Basualdo

Mayor of Despeñaderos, Argentina; population, 9,000

It is yet to be seen whether anyone from the Argentinian government will turn up in Belém for the Cop30 climate talks. Like Trump, the country’s president, Javier Milei, does not accept the scientific consensus about the human-made impact on the climate. He has called the crisis a “socialist lie”.

What this means for Carolina Basualdo, the mayor of a small city in the Córdoba region in the centre of the country, is clear. “We get nada, nothing,” she says when asked about government funding for policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change.

The impact of the crisis on her city is clear, she says. It endures three heatwaves a year these days; hot days can be followed by storms, with hailstones the size of tennis balls. Basualdo has rolled out a programme of solar panels on roofs, standardised the temperature at 24C (75F) in municipal buildings to save on energy consumption from air conditioning, and is using pruning waste from parks as an environmentally friendly source of firewood for boilers.

Plastic polytunnels used by farms for the production of fruit are recycled into bags and wallets by women at a local gender violence refuge. The mayor, with funds from Bloomberg Philanthropies, was able to help a local basketball club to replace its granite floor with one from two tonnes of plastic bottle caps collected by the community. “We’ve been working very hard,” she says.

Evandro Leitão

Mayor of Fortaleza, Brazil, population 2.7 million

“He was isolated and just did what he wanted,” says Evandro Leitão, mayor of Fortaleza, the fourth-biggest city in Brazil, known for its stifling heat. He is talking about Jair Bolsonaro, the former president who was jailed in September for 27 years for conspiring to overturn his 2022 election loss to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is in the same Workers’ party as Leitão.

Bolsonaro slashed environmental protections and promoted clearing and settling the Amazon rainforest. His administration oversaw a 60% increase in deforestation rates – the highest relative increase in a presidential term since satellite monitoring began. Lula has signalled that he wants Brazil to be a climate powerhouse, investing in renewable energy and forest conservation.

In the last 10 months that he has been mayor, Leitão has overseen the latest construction of micro-parks in his city, expanding the amount of green space by 40%, equivalent to 4,100 football pitches in five years.

There are, however, concerns being raised about the Brazilian government’s recent announcement that it is suspending the soy moratorium, which recognised deforestation as a threat posed by clearing land for the legume.

Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras has also been given permission to drill for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River. “You have to be a great balance between the development of the country, but also to preserve the green areas of the country,” Leitão said. That’s a challenge that I have to struggle with, too.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/191687dfe3e1b209f931037b474e3bd051ee6039/288_0_3348_2678/master/3348.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1122c6ab9acafdb5b18269159ca4659",N,,2025-11-07 06:59:09.203293

She also leads the Public Lands Council, which represents cattle and sheep ranchers with federal grazing permits.
“Steve’s leadership will be invaluable in managing our public lands and wisely stewarding our resources,” Senate Western Caucus Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said in a statement.
In a statement to Inside Climate News, the Trump administration doubled down on increasing oil and gas as a main goal.
“President Trump was elected with an overwhelming mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash America’s energy potential,” said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House.","President Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped a conservation critic and former oil industry executive to head up the federal agency that oversees the majority of public lands in the United States.

If approved, former U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico will lead the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for balancing conservation of public lands with human use, such as resource extraction and cattle grazing. Since January, the Trump administration has overwhelmingly prioritized the latter with the Department of the Interior—BLM’s parent agency—rapidly approving oil, gas and mining permits, including more than 600 new permits to drill on public lands since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities.

Environmental groups have spoken out vehemently against Pearce, who they say will threaten public lands and ramp up activities that fuel global warming.

A veteran and former owner of an oilfield services company, Pearce began his foray into politics as the U.S. representative for New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District from 2003 to 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019. Over his seven terms in the role, Pearce strongly advocated for ranchers and the oil and gas drilling sector, the latter of which donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns. Now, industry groups are rallying around Pearce’s nomination.

“Pearce’s experience makes him thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing,” Kaitlynn Glover with the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement. She also leads the Public Lands Council, which represents cattle and sheep ranchers with federal grazing permits.

Republican politicians from ranch- and oil-heavy states such as Montana and Wyoming echoed these sentiments.

“Steve’s leadership will be invaluable in managing our public lands and wisely stewarding our resources,” Senate Western Caucus Chair Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said in a statement. “This nomination is a major win for Wyoming and the entire west, and I’m glad to see such a crucial role filled by someone so well qualified. I urge a swift confirmation.”

Meanwhile, conservation groups argue that Pearce is not fit to lead an agency that also manages some of the most ecologically sensitive lands in the country, open spaces that support clean water, clean air and wildlife. As a congressman, Pearce introduced or supported several public-lands bills that would have inhibited conservation, supported more climate-warming oil and gas operations and limited the power of the Antiquities Act, which gives the president authority to protect lands by designating them as national monuments.

In 2014, he opposed former President Barack Obama’s designation of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico, which had widespread public support in the region. He has said that the monument, which fell within his district, was too large. The protected area is now a major driver of tourism and income for the local community of Las Cruces.

The nonprofit League of Conservation Voters, which tracks congressional voting records on environmental issues, gives Pearce a score of 4 percent—with 13 votes over his career that the group classified as pro-environment and more than 330 deemed anti-environment.

“Pearce’s entire political career has been dedicated to blocking Americans’ access to public lands while giving the oil and gas industry free rein to drill and frack anywhere they wanted,” Jennifer Rokala, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement. “Congress should quickly reject this nomination and tell the president to pay attention to what voters overwhelmingly want—public lands that are protected and managed for our kids and grandkids.”

The nomination comes seven months after Trump’s former pick, Kathleen Sgamma, the head of an oil industry trade group, withdrew from consideration following reporting that she had privately criticized Trump in 2021.

The Trump Public Lands Agenda

Democratic politicians have also expressed concern over the Pearce nomination, including Deb Haaland, the former interior secretary under President Joe Biden, who called him a “dangerous choice.”

During her four-year tenure at the Interior Department, Haaland oversaw BLM’s operations and helped enact the 2024 Public Lands Rule, which placed conservation on equal footing with uses such as natural gas drilling, mining, ranching, grazing, timber production and recreation. In September the Trump administration declared its intent to rescind the rule.

“In New Mexico we value our lands and waters, and we need a manager who would be a good steward. Steve Pearce however, has a record of threatening New Mexico’s public lands, putting profits over people, and neglecting the needs of our state,” Haaland, who is now running for New Mexico governor, said in a statement. “He is the wrong choice to serve in this role.”

Since Trump re-entered office in January, the administration has coordinated an aggressive rollback of environmental laws and policies in the United States in a push to ramp up extractive activities on public lands.

In July, the White House began the process of changing how the landmark National Environmental Policy Act is implemented across the federal government in a manner that allows the fast-tracking of fossil fuel, mining and other industrial projects. One of the first to benefit from these streamlined reviews is a gold mine project in Nevada, with far less opportunity for public comment on its permitting. Opponents fear the lack of review will threaten key aquifers and land for vulnerable animals such as the sage grouse.

Along with fast-tracking permits, the Trump administration is opening more lands for oil drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Dan Ritzman, the director of conservation at the nonprofit Sierra Club, expects Pearce would run BLM in line with this pro-extractive agenda.

“Steve Pearce is right in line with the Trump’s administration’s vision that the most important use and the people that should have the most say in our public lands are oil and gas industry executives,” Ritzman said.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, the Trump administration doubled down on increasing oil and gas as a main goal.

“President Trump was elected with an overwhelming mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash America’s energy potential,” said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House. “It’s totally logical that his nominees would align with the agenda the President was elected to implement and have a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-534007574-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:07:37.991910

Learn About: 3 Advanced Investing Moves Experts Use to Minimize Taxes and Help Boost Returns

Here are six warning signs every investor should know about Tesla stock.

1. Sky-High Valuation

This may be the biggest red flag of all when it comes to Tesla stock. The company presently has a market capitalization of $1.434 trillion. Yet, according to NPR, profits declined 13.5% in Q2. Q3 may see a surge in revenue as consumers purchased cars ahead of the expiration of electrical vehicle (EV) tax cuts, but that’s a temporary gain.

As of Oct. 10, 2025, Tesla’s profit-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was $258.73. Keep in mind that the P/E ratio is the amount investors are willing to spend for a dollar of a company’s earnings. So, Tesla investors are paying over $250 for every one dollar of earnings. By contrast, Ford Motor Company’s P/E ratio is $14.80. Even tech darling Nvidia has a P/E ratio of $55.08.

2. New Ventures

It can be challenging to compare Tesla to other companies because, while it is an auto company, it also has many new tech-adjacent businesses in the pipeline. If all of these ventures, like self-driving cars and robotics, pan out as expected, the company’s performance will likely align with expectations. But that is far from certain. The market’s willingness to price in projects that are still in development is concerning.

3. Concentrated Leadership

As Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk can be an asset and a liability. His energy and creativity have certainly brought the company to where it is today, and his words and actions can affect the movement of the stock. But there is a risk that he could lose focus by exploring too many new ventures at once, and his political stances are bound up with regulatory decisions that would affect the business.

This year also saw the Tesla Takedown boycott in response to Musk’s public persona, and a National Bureau of Economic Research study claims his public behavior has cost the company the sale of 1.25 million vehicles over the past three years. At about $40,000 per vehicle, that’s a colossal opportunity cost in the realm of a $50 billion blunder, if accurate.

4. Subsidies and Incentives

Manufacturing subsidies and incentives for consumers to purchase have greatly aided the adoption of electric vehicles. While these programs have been effective in advancing EVs’ popularity, the industry’s dependence on them in general, and Tesla in particular, is a red flag.

Programs that make it less expensive to manufacture electric vehicles include the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit, which provides a tax credit for companies that expand clean energy manufacturing and recycling capacity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at industrial facilities.

Consumer incentives, including federal, state, and local tax credits, were implemented to increase consumer adoption of electric vehicles. Some state and local incentives remain, but the federal Clean New Vehicle Credit expired on Sept. 30, 2025. If more programs like these are scaled back or eliminated, the cost of EVs will rise, which could impact Tesla’s earnings.

5. Competitive Pressures

Tesla didn’t invent the electric car — that happened in the 1800s, according to the U.S Department of Energy. But electric vehicles became mainstream around the turn of the millennium, when Toyota’s Prius and Honda’s Insight hybrids began to be sold in the U.S. When Tesla introduced the Model S, it brought luxury to the EV market, and the company quickly became the leader in the industry.

With 30 different companies now selling electric vehicles in the U.S., according to Car and Driver, competition is heating up. Automakers from Fiat to Rolls Royce have electric options, and the variety of available vehicles will ultimately lead to cost and price pressure.

6. Price Volatility

Any investor who has held on to Tesla stock for a while can vouch for how volatile it is. From the start of the year to Oct. 10, 2025, the stock is up 8.86%. Over the past 12 months, however, it’s up 84.12%. Clearly, the price spike at the end of 2024 is responsible for this discrepancy, but that’s a glaring comparison.

Another notable metric is the stock’s 52-week range of $212.11-$488.54. Analysts’ price targets are also all over the map, ranging from $120-$600 per share. The average 12-month target is $360.63, compared with the stock’s current price of $439.51.

It’s hard to say if Tesla stock is a good buy at this point — even the analysts are split pretty much down the middle. Keeping these warning signs in mind can help you make an informed choice about this stock.

Rebates for electric vehicles have already ended, but there is still time to claim home energy efficiency tax credits before they expire.

Many upgrades are still eligible for tax credits as long as the work is completed before Dec. 31.

People can claim up to $2,000 for installing a heat pump HVAC system or heat pump water heater. Insulation and weatherization projects could be worth up to $1,200 in tax credits. Homeowners can claim up to $150 for a home energy audit, which can help them create a plan for future upgrades.

Julia Kortrey with Evergreen Action says in 2023 alone, more than 158,000 Pennsylvania households claimed more than $267 million in tax credits.

She said it’s important to update the commonwealth’s old housing stock with efficiency upgrades for long-term comfort and affordability benefits. More efficient housing can also help ensure a reliable electric grid, she said.

“Now is the time to lock in savings while you still can,” Kortrey said. “Pennsylvanians deserve to keep their homes comfortable, their bills manageable, and their energy reliable long after these credits are gone.”

Dan Taylor with the labor and environmental coalition BlueGreen Alliance said, in addition to saving people money, the credits were designed to create jobs by boosting domestic manufacturing through creating demand for American-made products. He said the cuts jeopardize 338,000 jobs nationwide.

He said it’s important for as many people to take advantage of the credits while they’re still available.

“Ideally, we do want policy makers to realize the importance of tax credits like these to building out that clean energy future,” Taylor said.

He said people can turn to a trusted contractor to see if projects are eligible for credit.

At the center of this system is a $150 million “catastrophe bond,” which the country first issued to investors in 2021 and renewed last year.
The catastrophe bond market has been growing since Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992.
(The CCRIF policy pays out rapidly for a range of types of hurricane damage, whereas the catastrophe bond is only triggered by the most extreme storms.)
On Oak Island in North Carolina, for example, the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association has sponsored a catastrophe bond that includes a resilience feature.","Trelawney Parish sits in a rural, agricultural region of Western Jamaica that borders the country’s largest contiguous rainforest. Under normal circumstances, the parish is relentlessly green — covered in lush vegetation and long rows of orange trees — but the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa has “almost completely annihilated” the area, according to firefighter Ronell Hamilton. “Everything here is brown right now. It looks like California.”

The strongest storm to strike Jamaica in recorded history, Melissa arrived on the island last week as a Category 5 storm with wind speeds of 185 miles per hour. As of press time, at least 67 people had been killed — 32 in Jamaica, 34 from flooding in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and thousands of homes have been flattened. In Black River, a coastal community south of Trelawney that is being called the storm’s epicenter, an estimated 90 percent of structures were destroyed. Thirty miles north, in Wakefield, Hamilton says that even buildings built to serve as hurricane shelters, such as the school and the fire station, were severely damaged.

Climate change is making monster storms like Melissa more powerful by supercharging the meteorological elements in which they thrive: Warming ocean waters feed hurricanes, as does warming air. Studies have shown that the atmosphere can hold 7 percent more moisture for every 1 degree Celsius of warming. Elevated wind speeds allow storms to carry more moisture as well, leaving devastating flooding in their wake. A rapid analysis from Imperial College London found that climate change made a massive storm like Melissa 4 times more likely. Another report from the research group World Weather Attribution found that it increased wind speeds by 11 percent and rainfall by 16 percent relative to a world without global warming.

Early estimates indicate the storm may have caused up to $4 billion in insured losses and about $7 billion total in Jamaica alone. Much of the country is still without electricity or cell phone service and many roads remain impassable, so the full extent of the destruction has yet to be evaluated.

As wrenching as the storm has been, Jamaica is well aware of its vulnerabilities in a warming world and has spent decades carefully planning for just this kind of a scenario. As a result, it’s in a unique position to secure many of the resources it needs for its recovery. The country has built up a multi-layered system of financial protection since Hurricane Gilbert hit in 1988 and, experts say, its response could serve as a model for other island nations looking to build secure financial infrastructure that will ensure they can respond to disasters quickly.

At the center of this system is a $150 million “catastrophe bond,” which the country first issued to investors in 2021 and renewed last year. It will now be paid out in full to help support the country’s recovery. Catastrophe bonds appeal to investors because they offer a high reward in the form of elevated interest rates, in exchange for high risk — namely, the risk that the catastrophe will occur and trigger a monster payout from the investors. The bonds are generally set to expire in three to five years. If no disaster occurs during that period, the investors recover their initial investment as well as the exorbitant interest it has accrued. But if a storm does hit, all of the money goes to the affected country.

These bonds are attractive to buyers because they’re totally disconnected from the rest of the financial market; during the Great Recession that began in 2008, for example, catastrophe bonds became a popular financial instrument because they were still producing high yields even as benchmark interest rates were nearly 0 percent. And if all goes well, they can be enormously lucrative. They’re attractive to countries like Jamaica, because they can be triggered according to parametric standards, meaning once a storm hits a predefined limit, such as central pressure at or below 900 millibars, the money is automatically released.

The catastrophe bond market has been growing since Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992. At the time, it was the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history, and insurance proved unable to cover the full cost of the storm. “The idea was to then put some of that risk into the financial markets,” said Carolyn Kousky, associate vice president for economics and policy at the Environmental Defense Fund. Jamaica is unique, said Kousky, because it has “made this really beautiful stack [of financing tools] to cover disasters.”

In addition to the catastrophe bond, the country has built up its own emergency contingency budget, taken out parametric insurance with the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, or CCRIF, and prearranged for a credit line in case of emergencies. (The CCRIF policy pays out rapidly for a range of types of hurricane damage, whereas the catastrophe bond is only triggered by the most extreme storms.) This level of planning, said Kousky, grew out of a “growing recognition that relying on disaster aid is not a great strategy, because disaster aid often takes a long time to get to countries and can sometimes be ill matched to need.” A steady stream of pre-secured cash can help vulnerable nations better navigate these kinds of horrific events.

“The question is whether this would be available again,” said Sara Jane Ahmed, the managing director and finance advisor to the V20 Ministers of Finance, which represent the world’s most climate-vulnerable economies, who warned that a payout so large could scare off financial interests. Ahmed added that rebuilding with more resilient infrastructure could help make a new bond more appealing.

Investing in catastrophe bonds is essentially playing Russian Roulette with air pressure — even a storm as strong as Hurricane Beryl, which made landfall near Jamaica last year as a Category 4, did not quite meet the threshold for a payout. And as climate change causes storms to grow stronger, investors could shy away from catastrophe bonds or insist on even higher interest rates and more stringent metrics for a payout.

“People are looking for a silver bullet for all these things and everything has a tradeoff,” said Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness.

“The biggest problem with catastrophe bonds is that they come after the disaster, not before, to prevent it from happening, [which] is where the money is needed most,” he said, pointing to infrastructure upgrades, seawalls, and other hurricane-proofing measures as areas where catastrophe bond investors could also support adaptation efforts before the storm — and reduce their own risk of a bond payout in the process. “If these same companies are investing in catastrophe bonds, and they don’t want to see the payouts, then better investment in preventing the disaster to begin with is the best way to kind of protect that investment. We need it on all sides.”

The question of how to pull investors into the adaptation market is “an ongoing challenge,” said Kousky. “When you invest in climate adaptation and risk reduction … you’re reducing future losses, but avoided losses are not really a cash flow.”

Tweaking catastrophe bonds to direct a small amount of their interest back to the issuing state or country could offer one solution. On Oak Island in North Carolina, for example, the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association has sponsored a catastrophe bond that includes a resilience feature. When no catastrophe strikes and investors collect their yearly returns, a portion of their profits are put towards funding home hardening upgrades, like hurricane-fortified roofs.

“We’re always going to have disasters,” said Schlegelmilch. “But they don’t have to be as bad as they are.”

How Jamaica’s recovery will play out on the ground remains to be seen. The damages look like they will exceed even the country’s carefully planned financial safety net. A week after the storm, “there’s still no electricity, still no water,” said Hamilton, the firefighter in Trelawney Parish. “Food is running out.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hurricane-Melissa-Black-River.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-07 10:04:11.831758

Utah is well known for using a variety of methods and approaches to energy generation. Beaver and Millard counties in central Utah are a corridor for wind farms, solar plants and geothermal exploration. Those projects have garnered international attention.

But the Beehive State still relies heavily on fossil fuels as well.

The latest sustainable method the state is interested in pursuing is nuclear energy alternatives.

The new news

Millions of Americans across all 50 states have incorporated clean energy technologies into their lives, according to Clean Energy Across America,” a new report unveiled Wednesday by Environment America Research & Policy Center and Frontier Group. The report details that growth and recommends tips and policies to help more Americans adopt clean energy, even as federal tax credits phase out.

“You cannot put a lid on solar,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, Environment America Research & Policy Center.

The group has dissected the numbers to produce a dashboard: The state of renewable energy, which tracks the 10-year growth trends of six key clean energy technologies by state.

Clean Energy Across America focuses on the number of individual Americans by state who have adopted technologies such as electric vehicles, solar panels and home battery storage systems that have made their lives cleaner and better.

“Across the country, people have invested their own time and money to install solar panels on their roofs, put EVs in their driveways, make their homes energy efficient, or buy clean energy from their utilities,” said Emily Rusch, vice president and senior director of state offices of Environment America Research and Policy Center.

“Clean energy adoption in America is a movement hiding in plain sight.”

Utah, despite its reputation as a fossil fuel hungry state, has embraced solar.

The 14th annual National Solar Jobs Census by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, an independent nonprofit organization, found the United States added 15,564 solar jobs in 2023, when there were 279,447 solar workers, the highest ever recorded.

In Utah, solar jobs increased by 4% with 325 jobs added, for a total of 7,634 jobs statewide.

A difficult dance

Last year, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced the launch of Operation Gigawatt, a plan to double energy in Utah in the next decade.

It is a bold goal, and not without its critics, but Cox has put all his cards on the table.

Neumann said Utah is primed for energy innovation.

“The sun shows up every day for free,” she said, adding that Utah is among the top ranking states for its solar capacity.

According to the latest statistics, there are 78,617 solar panels in Utah. That equates to 224 panels for every 10,000 people.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/8b44cdead6d42d9cf25c5801f0626018,N,,2025-11-07 05:19:10.794693

Rising electricity prices across Europe are prompting electric vehicle (EV) owners to seek smarter, more efficient charging solutions. In January 2025, household electricity costs varied widely - from 0.091 per kWh in Budapest to 0.404 per kWh in Berlin - with the EU average reaching 0.255 per kWh. Germany recorded rates of about 0.38 per kWh, among the highest in the region. These figures underscore the growing importance of energy management in everyday EV ownership.

At the same time, solar power adoption continues to accelerate. In 2024, global solar PV installations rose by 597 GW - a 33% year-on-year increase - followed by an additional 380 GW added in the first half of 2025, representing a 64% rise compared with the same period in 2024. This rapid expansion reflects a collective move toward energy independence and cost stability through renewable generation.

As solar adoption grows, the emphasis is shifting from generation to intelligent utilisation. Rather than exporting surplus energy to the grid at low feed-in rates, households are choosing to use it directly. Smart EV chargers with solar integration, such as Teltonika EVC 2, make this possible by detecting when solar generation exceeds household demand and redirecting the surplus into an EV battery. In doing so, sunlight is transformed into measurable financial and environmental value - reducing dependence on costly grid electricity and optimising the use of self-produced energy.

Economic Efficiency of Smart EV Charging

With electricity costs high and solar capacity expanding, efficient self-consumption has become a practical necessity.

Real-world EV consumption averages approximately 0.21 kWh per km. Based on the EU's average grid electricity price of 0.255 per kWh, the cost equates to 0.0536 per km, or 53.60 per 1,000 km. Over 15,000 km of annual driving, this totals 3,150 kWh. A solar-integrated smart charging system that supplies 60% of this energy would save approximately 482 per year compared with full grid reliance.

European Incentives and Subsidies

Governments across Europe continue to promote renewable-powered EV charging:

United Kingdom: Smart charging incentives and household energy protections.

Germany: Regional support for home-based EV charging installations.

European Commission: Ongoing investment in renewable integration and sustainable infrastructure.

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed pausing or eliminating reporting obligations under the federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), a move that could affect industrial facilities, power plants and other large-emission sources across multiple sectors.

Since its inception in 2009, the program has collected facility-level greenhouse-gas (GHG) data from more than 8,000 facilities—data that businesses, regulators and safety professionals use to evaluate emission trends, exposure risks and operational impacts.

{""\u2060""}. With the proposed rule, the agency would remove reporting requirements for roughly 46 source categories and suspend further reporting obligations in other segments until 2034. This reduction in oversight may limit the availability of key data used to assess environmental and workplace risks. EPA+2EPA+2

From a health-and-safety standpoint, the change has two major implications:

Reduced transparency of emissions data — Safety managers rely on publicly reported GHG information to evaluate evolving hazards such as high-emitting processes, potential chemical releases or climate-driven heat stress conditions tied to industrial operations. Without consistent data, hazard assessments may become less robust.

Potential shift in compliance focus — If reporting obligations decline, industry programs may need to adapt. Facilities that have invested in emissions monitoring, data systems and risk reduction tied to GHG tracking could lose key metrics that helped drive preventive safety measures.

Industrial operations—particularly in sectors like manufacturing, power generation, chemical production and heavy industry—may face a strategic decision: continue voluntary reporting and integrate the data into safety and health systems, or adjust to a baseline of reduced regulatory data collection. In either scenario, safety professionals are encouraged to review their monitoring programs, integrate emissions-related data into workplace risk assessments and maintain documentation of hazard recognition, mitigation and exposure trends.

Organizations that have linked their GHG tracking systems to broader environmental, health and safety (EHS) programs may find the proposed changes trigger internal assessments of how emissions data support worker-safety protections, energy-use controls and climate-related exposure risks.

Looking ahead, the agency is accepting public comments and may revise the proposal before finalization. Companies and safety leaders should monitor developments closely, strengthen internal data-governance practices and continue embedding emissions and climate-risk intelligence into workplace-safety frameworks.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/1107EP-Greenhouse-Gases.jpeg,N,,2025-11-07 10:03:58.449740

The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to add ample storage to its grid by the end of the decade.

The public utility announced that it was targeting up to 1.5 gigawatts of battery storage — the equivalent of one its largest gas plants under construction, like the Kingston project — by the end of 2029.

“We’re trying to drive a sense of urgency with these assets,” TVA’s chief business officer Jeremy Fisher said during a board meeting Thursday.

TVA has been expanding its system this decade, mostly with new gas plants.

Battery storage can strengthen grids, whether systems are dominated by fuels or have high renewable penetration like in California and Texas.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab has described energy storage as “crucial” to developing a resilient, low-carbon power grid.

TVA considered as much as 5 GW of storage in its last long-term plan in 2019, but the utility added just 370 megawatts, or about 0.4 GW, between 2019 and 2025.

TVA has at least 38 GW of total energy capacity, between its owned and purchased power. TVA will soon release an overview of its system in its annual financial filing to the federal government this month.

In the past fiscal year, TVA’s energy use was split between 34% gas, 33% nuclear, 19% coal, 10% hydro and 4% renewables, according to TVA’s presentation to the board on Thursday. Nuclear use dropped as the utility faced outages at all seven of its reactors this past year. The lost generation was primarily replaced by fossil fuels.

Currently, storage represents a small percentage of the utility’s capacity. TVA has some battery facilities and storage through pumped hydropower.",https://wpln.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/TVA-Battery-Storage.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 06:59:20.069932

However, trade barriers are on the rise. Several prominent developing countries are considering or implementing higher import duties on cleantech products. These tariffs are driven by diverse motives: fostering local value creation, attracting foreign investment, diversifying supply chains, and addressing energy security concerns.

China’s Dominance

According to the report, China hosts at least 80% of the manufacturing capacity across major solar and battery supply chains. The country hosts over 70% of production capacity in all significant segments of clean tech equipment manufacturing except for one.

Countries including Japan, South Korea, the European Union (EU), and the U.S. comprise most of the remaining manufacturing capacity share.

Between 2022 and 2024, China’s share of global capacity increased by at least 5% across the value chain of six clean energy segments.

Steps by Developed and Emerging Countries

BNEF stated that developed nations have initiated multiple economic development strategies. Depending on the strategy, efforts to varying degrees have been focusing explicitly on building out clean-tech supply chains.

Emerging market economies, including China, have been focusing on creating domestic industrial policies to develop local cleantech manufacturing.

G20 Initiatives

G20 countries have allocated $250 billion in subsidies for clean technology manufacturing.

BNEF said it tracked subsidies for solar, battery, wind, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. It said this limited its scope to national grants, low-interest loans, loan guarantees, and tax credits.

That excludes harder-to-track forms of support, such as cheap electricity or land.

Using this methodology, the U.S. has the highest commitment in all markets, despite the revised totals following the new administration’s curtailment of previous supportive provisions.

According to the report, the earlier subsidies drove a factory pipeline worth $108 billion. However, policy changes and uncertainty have frozen several projects.

The EU has pledged $32.5 billion in support of its clean energy manufacturing, despite its ambitious targets. Much of the funding comes from repurposed programs due to limited budget.

BNEF advises member states to draw from national funds to expand their local capacities. However, it acknowledges that cheap imports, low prices, and weak manufacturers limit any impact of such initiatives.

Japan is concentrating 86% of its $30.4 billion in expected support for its battery sector to help achieve its domestic manufacturing capacity target of 150 GWh by 2030. The report stated that this goal may be difficult.

The report stated that setting up battery factories is costlier than other clean technologies. This means that even considerable government support may not result in significant manufacturing growth. Low local demand is also adding to the growth challenges.

Clean-tech manufacturing support is limited elsewhere. Multiple factors cause these limitations:

Clean-tech manufacturing often ranks low among policy priorities

Tough market conditions

High capital requirements for this segment

Average higher prices of locally produced technology compared to high-quality, low-cost imports

BNEF stated that some countries are providing relatively large subsidies for the cleantech supply chain. For example, Turkey’s $13.5 billion subsidy made up 1% of the country’s GDP in 2024.

However, emerging markets are not making significant contributions to cleantech manufacturing subsidies. This has not precluded manufacturers in China from expanding into such regions, many times without considerable local incentives.

Global Clean Tech Trade Flows

According to the report, China is the single largest clean energy component exporter. On a dollar basis, it accounted for 47% of the global solar, wind, battery, and EV exports in 2024.

The country has integrated supply chains, significantly improved economies of scale, and has intense domestic competition.

China’s export share is specifically high in the solar and battery segments, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the global total. However, its EV exports comprise only 30% of the global exports, despite significant growth.

Southeast Asia and Latin America are emerging as key exporters due to Chinese firms relocating solar manufacturing to these regions and their expansion into EV and battery production.

The U.S. and the EU are major exporters but remain net importers. They imported 47% of the worldwide total in 2024, which BNEF said explains their increasing protectionist policies.

A growing number of regions have emerged as net clean tech importers. Solar products and batteries have significantly driven imports in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)region, as well as South Asia.

Trade by Technology

Growth in trade of solar cells and modules, wind turbines and components, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, EVs, and plug-in hybrids has risen steadily in the past six years, driven by growing electric transport and Li-ion battery shipments.

Annual global imports witnessed a 126% growth between 2021 and 2024. Global Li-ion battery imports increased 96% during the same period.

Trade in such products peaked in 2023, reducing 4% to $290 billion in the following year. According to the report, this decline reflects lower equipment and EV prices instead of weaker volumes. Imports measured in unit terms rose in most cases.

However, trade in clean energy products continued to expand, contrasting the rising sentiments of protectionism and deglobalization.

Batteries and EVs make up 80% of the global clean tech value. A steep drop in module prices resulted in solar modules comprising just 18% of the total.

The report stated that shipments of wind equipment are limited. Turbine components are typically costly to transport, and a considerable amount of value addition occurs close to the demand location.

BNEF stated that solar cell and module prices have been declining due to overcapacity, particularly over the last two years. Solar cell prices dropped nearly 60% in the last year. Module prices in this period fell 44% due to extreme competition, driven by overcapacity in China, affecting the manufacturers’ margins.

In 2024, the steep price decline contributed significantly to the value of global solar shipments. However, trade of these components increased in gigawatt terms. Imports of solar modules increased 36% and those of cells rose 70% on a capacity basis.

According to the report, governments have been introducing a mix of subsidies, local content rules, and trade barriers to promote solar manufacturing. However, solar cell manufacturing takes more time to scale because it is more capital-intensive than module assemble.

EV battery prices reduced 20% over the last year. Prices for Chinese wind turbines declined 15%.

Focus on Emerging Markets

In 2025, half of China’s solar exports were destined for emerging markets. After expanding production capacity in recent years, the country’s manufacturers are increasingly targeting overseas markets to absorb their surplus output.

According to the report, defensive trade policies such as those being implemented by the U.S. could amplify these shifts.

The share of Li-ion batteries, battery EVs, solar modules, and wind turbines, described by the World Bank as “low” to “upper-middle” income, increased 27% in 2024 from 23% in 2022, reaching 31% by August 2025.

Latin America accounted for nearly 30% of emerging market clean-tech imports. It was followed by Southeast Asia, MENA, and South Asia.

Trade Barriers

According to the report, trade in emerging markets has so far been unencumbered by major tariffs.

Of the 14 markets analyzed by BNEF, the simple average import tariff on six key products in the G20, excluding the U.S., China, and Russia, as well as the African Union, was at just 9.4%.

Solar modules have the highest likelihood for exemption from tariffs, with most markets allowing duty-free imports. Effects are limited even in markets implementing tariffs. For example, Chinese modules made up 93% of the imports in Indonesia, where they qualify for exemptions.

Importers in South Africa can claim refunds on the 10% solar module duty when the South African Customs Union’s member manufacturers fall short of demand. The company has 0.7 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity, compared to 2.2 GW of new solar generation capacity added in the previous year.

For Li-ion batteries, import tariffs usually range up to 10%. Argentina, India, and Turkey are exceptions to this. Turkey’s 33% tariff on non-EV batteries is the highest. However, the tariffs’ impact is limited as components for most energy storage projects in the country are exempted from import duties.

Imports from China typically face higher tariffs in the U.S., Canada, and the EU. The implementing governments justify these tariffs by invoking the need to protect domestic industries from what they describe as excessive subsidization and unfair trade practices by Chinese firms.

BNEF stated that in the U.S., the Trump administration’s frequent tariff changes have caused sharp swings in solar products and non-EV batteries. Rates have risen under multiple measures over the last nine months.

These measures include the 10% blanket reciprocal tariff introduced on April 5, the higher market-specific reciprocal tariffs implemented on August 6 after repeated delays, and a series of country-specific actions targeting China, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and India since the year’s beginning.

The new measures add to an existing list of tariffs implemented in earlier administrations, starting from 2012, when the first duties were imposed on solar products from China.

Nairobi (Kenya) - The new Emissions Gap Report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) shows that global climate goals are increasingly slipping out of reach. Despite updated pledges by governments, the path to limiting global warming to 1.5°C appears increasingly unattainable - with serious consequences for the economy, the environment, and society.

According to the UNEP report, the planet is projected to warm by 2.3 to 2.5°C by the end of the century - even with the latest climate plans. Methodological adjustments disguise the lack of real progress. Particularly concerning: many countries are not on track to meet their climate targets. A lack of ambition and concrete action is bringing the world ever closer to breaching the 1.5°C threshold.

Little Progress Despite New Pledges

In its Emissions Gap Report 2025, titled Off Target, UNEP warns that current national climate pledges show little effect. The projected global warming by the end of the century now stands at 2.3 to 2.5°C, compared to 2.6 to 2.8°C last year. If only existing policies were implemented, warming could reach up to 2.8°C.

About 0.1°C of the apparent improvement is due to methodological adjustments - one-third of the total gain - and UNEP notes that the upcoming withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement will offset another 0.1°C. This means that the new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) have made almost no real difference. Countries remain far from the goal of keeping warming “well below 2°C” and ideally limiting it to 1.5°C.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned: “ Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees is now inevitable – starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. And the path to a livable future gets steeper by the day. But this is no reason to surrender.“ He urged nations to dramatically raise their ambitions: “1.5 degrees by the end of the century remains our North Star.”

UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen also criticized the lack of speed: “Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target.” Progress exists, she noted, but it is far too slow: “We still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop.”

Emissions Keep Rising - Geopolitical Challenges Slow Climate Action

By the end of September 2025, only 60 parties to the Paris Agreement - responsible for 63% of global emissions - had submitted or announced new climate targets for 2035. Global greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise in 2024, reaching about 57.7 gigatonnes of CO? equivalent, an increase of 2.3% over the previous year.

To stay on a 2°C pathway, emissions would need to fall by about 25% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels - and by around 40% or more to keep the 1.5°C target within reach. However, the current national contributions would only achieve about a 15% reduction by 2035 - far below what is required.

A major obstacle remains the geopolitical environment. Conflicts, economic uncertainties, and insufficient financial support for developing countries are hampering progress. The G20 nations, responsible for 77% of global emissions, are particularly under scrutiny: they collectively continue to miss their own targets, with their emissions rising by 0.7% in 2024.

At the same time, the report points to existing solutions: „Proven solutions already exist. From the rapid growth in cheap renewable energy to tackling methane emissions, we know what needs to be done. Now is the time for countries to go all in and invest in their future with ambitious climate action – action that delivers faster economic growth, better human health, more jobs, energy security and resilience,” Andersen emphasized.

Conclusion: The Window of Opportunity Is Closing Fast

The UNEP report paints a clear picture: without immediate and deep emission cuts, the world will overshoot the 1.5°C target by a wide margin. While countermeasures remain technically feasible, the political and economic window is rapidly narrowing.

The report shows that a scenario of “rapid mitigation from 2025 onward” could limit the 1.5°C overshoot to about 0.3°C and enable a return to 1.5°C by 2100. Every fraction of a degree avoided matters - for the stability of the climate as well as for the global economy.

The Office of Climate and Energy and Office of the Environmental Justice Public Advocate in the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) began the program in October 2024 with equitable clean energy nonprofit partners Elevate Energy and the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition.

The original yearlong mission was to support 25 selected community-based organizations (listed below) working for enduring and environmentally just climate action in frontline communities across Michigan. Frontline communities are often historically disadvantaged locations that tend to face the impacts of climate change “first and worst.”

Now, instead of winding down, the Community Accelerator will extend programming for continuing cohort members through 2026 – shaped by feedback from participating organizations and the changing policy and funding landscape for climate and environmental justice work.

The group gathered in Lansing recently to celebrate wins, compare notes, and look ahead. Cheering on their work was Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II.

“This is the room in which there will be brainstorming. This is the room in which we will challenge one another, and we will pull the best ideas out of one another,” Gilchrist said. “What will not change is this administration’s commitment to making progress on environmental justice.”

In its first year, the accelerator provided each cohort member with $25,000 in participation funding, one-on-one technical assistance, peer-to-peer learning, statewide networking, and more. Participants set goals, tapped into resources, and built partnerships across Michigan communities and sectors. Among successful outcomes, cohort members received over $4.5 million total in public and private grant funding. In all, they applied for more than 55 grants to build their organizational capacity and advance their community visions for workforce development, energy efficiency, resilience hubs, agriculture and food justice, and climate action planning.

Projects ranged from electric vehicle ride share infrastructure, food support, energy efficient home development, and youth engagement and training programs.

The new name reflects the state’s ongoing commitment to community-led climate action and environmental justice. Dedication to the Justice40 commitments outlined in the state’s Michigan Healthy Climate Plan (MHCP) continues, ensuring that at least 40% of state funding for climate and water infrastructure benefit Michigan’s historically disadvantaged communities.

Here’s a look at how four cohort organizations have put their accelerator learning to use:

Growing Hope, Inc., Ypsilanti

Executive Director Julius Buzzard said it’s doubtful his organization would have successfully applied for federal funds or met its capital project goals in 2025 without the accelerator.

The organization grows food with and for the community on its 1.5-acre Growing Hope Center and Urban Farm, supplying free produce and inviting people to “get their hands in the dirt” as they build more just and joyful relationships with the food system. It also runs the Ypsilanti Farmers Marketplace and Growing Hope Incubator Kitchen that has supported about 70 entrepreneurs and fledged 15 businesses in four years.

Growing Hope’s $1.2 million budget in 2025 was the largest since its founding in 2003. The group employs about 22 staff, 12 of whom are local teens.

The accelerator and additional investment from private and federal sources helped fund building renovations, an energy audit, and plans to install and upgrade solar power and outfit a second building with a kitchen. A consultant provided coaching to help level up fundraising efforts.

“You have to have money to make money,” Buzzard said. “The capacity that’s required to apply for public dollars is more than somebody could do if they don’t have a team or don’t have any support.”

BASS, Inc. (Building Assets to Strengthen Society), Highland Park

With a name pronounced like ""base,” BASS, Inc., has a core mission of economic development, affordable housing, community engagement and support for youth and young adults ages 7-24 with partner programs My Sister’s Keeper and My Brother’s Keeper.

The accelerator has boosted the reach of BASS’ three-person staff, contractors, and volunteers.

“This cohort has been a phenomenal opportunity for us,” said Program Director Tanesha Windom. “We feel like we’ve been resourced and fueled to carry our projects to completion.”

That includes the group’s three-year Green Revolution youth environmental leadership project, supported by a $500,000 EGLE grant. The three-pronged effort includes workshops, community green spaces, and development of a 5,000-square-foot resilience hub on Woodward Avenue.

The accelerator has helped secure architectural and contracting expertise for a green rooftop meant to mitigate the climate and health impacts of 40,000 vehicles a day traveling on Woodward.

In the year ahead, Windom sees opportunities to give back to the cohort: “as we learn, sharing what we learn.”

Four County Community Foundation (The Hispanic Service Center of Imlay City), Romeo

Since 1987, the foundation has provided more than $14 million in grants and scholarships for food security, public transportation, economic development, and more in Lapeer, St. Clair, Oakland, and Macomb counties.

Executive Director Kathy Dickens said she enjoys bringing communities together around emerging needs. The accelerator and its peer-to-peer sessions have expanded her horizons.

“It has allowed me an opportunity to reflect on the larger network across the state – all of our cohort partners who are doing great work and have envisioned projects that I should probably be considering,” she said. “I’ve gained a lot of insight and connections and partnerships.”

The foundation leveraged its accelerator grant to hire grant-writing consultants and enable at least one new project already.

Dickens said the cohort has done a great job of addressing issues based on community thoughts and needs.

“It’s important to realize the needs that are out there because of human behavior over years, to recognize what our community problems are, how we’ve arrived at that point, how we remedy them, and how we prevent it from happening again,” she said. “I’m able to think bigger, broader, deeper about community problems.”

Friends of Rouge Park, Detroit

The City of Detroit’s century-old Rouge Park covers nearly 1,200 acres with diverse ecosystems and environmental challenges. Luckily, it also has a growing support system of more than 200 Friends of Rouge Park members, plus hundreds of additional volunteers and partners.

“The challenges in the park are many, but the ecological, nature-based solutions also have so much potential,” said Executive Director Lindsay Pielack.

Stewardship Manager Antonio Cosme applied to join the accelerator before Pielack started in January 2025 as part of its new management structure.

Pielack said the accelerator has built capacity as the organization grows in size and budget. Technical assistance dollars helped her attend an intensive accounting workshop in Chicago, and the group conducted its first audit this year.

“I think the real benefit to this program has been the connection with the really wise and accessible staff of the program to help us know what we don’t know and have a really open door to ask the questions,” she said. “It’s not about knowing all the answers.”

While California’s emissions go down, its economy continues to expand. Today, the state released data through the California GHG Emissions Inventory showing a 3% drop in statewide emissions in 2023 — the third-largest annual percentage decrease since tracking began in 2000. The decrease is equivalent to removing more than 2.6 million gasoline-powered cars from California’s roads for one year.

Over the total period since 2000, greenhouse gas emissions in California went down by 21% — even as the state’s economy increased 81% in that same time period. California has reached this progress, despite Republican and industry attacks on the state’s efforts.

The 21% emissions decrease since 2000 is equivalent to removing the annual emissions from 22.9 million cars. The latest data underscores a continued trend of steady emissions decline even as the economy continues to grow.

“The latest data show that science-driven policy and innovation are moving California closer to our climate goals,” said California Environmental Protection Secretary Yana Garcia. “Emissions are down; cleaner trucks are on the road and communities are breathing healthier air. Access to reliable data isn’t just the foundation of progress. It’s how we hold ourselves accountable and make smart choices for the future. As the Trump Administration moves to weaken national emissions reporting, California will continue to lead with transparency, integrity and results.”

California’s climate leadership

California stands as a world leader in addressing the climate crisis. The climate crisis transcends every border and boundary, and does not recognize partisan lines. Extreme weather will continue to threaten lives. California is leading the charge, taking decisive action and creating strong results to help ensure a healthier future for all.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the state continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available — and is the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Recently, California announced record-breaking sales of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV). Consumer demand for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) is surging, even despite federal attempts to derail the Golden State’s pursuit of a 100% clean energy future, with a record 29.1% of all new cars purchased in the third quarter of 2025 were ZEVs.

Highlights from today’s report

Emissions from cars and light-duty pickup trucks reached an all-time low as fossil fuel use continued to fall. This drop occurred despite a 1% increase in vehicle miles travelled. Emissions from the state’s heavy-duty diesel vehicles also declined.

California has decreased the carbon intensity of its economy by 57% since 2000.

The electricity sector had its lowest carbon intensity since 2000. Wind and solar represent over 30 % of generation and in-state solar increased by 8 % from 2022, driven by requirements under the state’s Cap-and-Invest Program (formerly known as Cap-and-Trade) and the Renewables Portfolio Standard.

Industrial sector emissions declined by 5 % due to reductions from refineries, oil and gas extraction, cement manufacturing, cogeneration facilities, and other fossil-fuel use.

Livestock emissions, which are responsible for 71% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions, peaked in 2012 and continued to decline in 2023. The decrease is driven by use of methane digesters at dairies funded by Cap-and-Invest auction money and incentivized by the Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

The residential and commercial sector had a rise in emissions, largely because of an increase in residential fossil gas use which was likely due to a colder winter in 2023.

An early estimate of 2024 data, based primarily on reported and third-party verified data for the state’s largest emitters, shows that emission reductions will continue to trend downward. The 2024 inventory data is not yet final and will not be released until 2026 once all data sources are updated and incorporated.

About the inventory

The statewide inventory relies on data from the Mandatory Reporting Regulation, which counts emissions and reductions from about 80% of California’s sources of human-caused climate emissions. It uses data from other state and local agencies to round out that picture.

The announced plans to end federal monitoring of greenhouse gases will not affect California’s inventory.

Standing up for science, creating strong climate solutions

Illegal federal attempts to derail California’s clean vehicle standards will have some impact on the state’s ability to reduce the negative health and environmental impacts of climate change. But California remains committed to addressing harmful pollution and the impacts of climate change. This includes:

Moving forward on the next round of light-duty vehicle emissions standards for the 2030s and beyond. A workshop was held on October 21.

Amending the state’s Cap-and-Invest Program to help achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. A workshop was held on October 29.

Formalizing rules for carbon management. A nationwide list of carbon capture, utilization, and storage projects was posted last month and rulemaking is expected to be finalized next year.

Updating the Landfill Methane Regulation to reduce emissions from solid waste landfills. The Board will consider adopting the amendments on November 20.

Finalizing rules for corporate emissions reporting, which requires companies to publish biennial climate-related financial risk reports. The Board is expected to consider an initial rulemaking early next year.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/World-leading-economy-and-climate-solutions-Californias-emissions-drop-in-2023-driven-by-clean-transportation-SEO-GFX.png,N,,2025-11-07 04:57:22.293668

PPAs are often used to fund renewable energy projects and allow companies to buy energy directly from clean sources without developing their own generation facilities.
The 16 MW renewable electricity commitment in South Korea directly contributes to the Scope 2 target and reduces reliance on fossil-powered grids.","Merck agrees a new 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with South Korean energy supplier SK Innovation E&S, marking its longest renewable electricity contract in the Asia-Pacific region.

The agreement delivers 16 megawatts of clean energy capacity to power operations at Merck’s life science manufacturing facilities in Daejeon and Songdo, South Korea.

The deal secures approximately 21,000 megawatt-hours of renewable electricity each year starting from December 2027. That covers about three-quarters of the electricity used across Merck’s South Korea life science sites.

""This agreement reflects our long-term commitment to manufacturing sustainability,"" says Tim Jaeger, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer for Merck's Life Science business.

""By adding renewable electricity to the grid for our operations in South Korea, we are taking further measures to reduce our environmental impact and enabling our customers do the same.""

The contract builds on Merck’s global renewable energy strategy, which includes virtual PPAs in Europe and North America as well as on-site installations across its facilities worldwide. For South Korea, this agreement does more than offset emissions – it adds capacity directly to the local electricity grid.

How PPAs reshape supply chains

A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a fixed-term contract between a power provider and a customer that sets a price and guarantees a long-term supply of electricity. PPAs are often used to fund renewable energy projects and allow companies to buy energy directly from clean sources without developing their own generation facilities.

Merck’s deal with SK Innovation E&S represents a physical PPA, where the renewable energy physically reaches the regional grid. This stands apart from virtual PPAs, where companies purchase renewable energy certificates without drawing actual power from the source.

The key advantage of Merck’s model in South Korea is ""additionality"" – meaning the project adds new renewable capacity to the grid rather than just shifting existing clean energy from one buyer to another.

By taking this route, Merck aligns its procurement strategy with growing industry expectations around value chain responsibility. Sourcing renewable electricity directly connected to the grid enhances transparency, supports local infrastructure and improves the environmental integrity of supply chain operations.

With a target of fully integrating sustainability into its value chains by 2030, Merck is applying pressure not just internally but also across suppliers and partners. This includes expectations around energy sourcing, product design and packaging. For example, the company aims to cut packaging weight by 10% per unit of sales and commits to circularity principles in all new packaging designs.

Beyond packaging, Merck is also pushing its suppliers to lower emissions through Scope 3 accountability. Merck targets a 30% cut in Scope 3 emissions by 2030 based on 2020 levels.

However, while Scope 1 and 2 emissions (direct operations and purchased electricity) show a 43% drop so far, Scope 3 progress remains slow, down just 2%.

Targeting 2030 climate goals through procurement

Merck’s South Korea PPA supports its broader 2030 target of sourcing 80% of its purchased electricity from renewable sources.

The firm sets that benchmark as part of a wider climate framework introduced in 2020 and aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The strategy includes three headline commitments: improving lives through sustainable science, embedding sustainability in all value chains and achieving climate neutrality by 2040.

As part of this, Merck also aims to halve its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and cut Scope 3 by 30% by the end of the decade. The 16 MW renewable electricity commitment in South Korea directly contributes to the Scope 2 target and reduces reliance on fossil-powered grids.

Energy procurement plays a central role in Merck’s climate approach, but it's only one part of a larger sustainability toolkit. Through its SHAPE framework and the DOZN green chemistry tool, Merck also evaluates the environmental profile of its chemicals and products.

By 2030, it wants 10% of its portfolio to qualify as ""Greener Alternative Products"".

SK Innovation E&S brings the infrastructure and technical expertise to realise this project in South Korea, while Merck leverages the deal to strengthen its regional supply chain sustainability credentials.

With €21.2bn (US$24.4bn) in global revenue across 65 countries and more than 62,000 staff, Merck’s operational footprint spans life sciences, electronics and healthcare.

Moves like this South Korea PPA show how energy sourcing decisions connect directly to its supply chain strategy – both in reducing carbon and in demonstrating leadership on procurement standards.

By tying electricity supply to physical generation in the region, Merck secures a stable, clean energy flow for its operations and lays the groundwork for future supply chain transparency. The result is a more robust and measurable approach to climate targets and a model other multinationals may follow.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/025de102bcf1626d8d953541ca991d55:d863549405f2ed962fdc753512285fef/merck-s-deal-with-sk-innovation-e-s-will-secure-75-of-the-german-firm-s-energy-needs-in-south-korea-for-the-next-10-years.png.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 04:57:31.872986

Clean Energy Fuels Corp. sold 61.3 million gallons of renewable natural gas (RNG) during the third quarter, up 3% when compared to the same period of last year, according to information released by the company on Nov. 4.

During an earnings call, Clean Energy President and CEO Andrew Littlefair reported that the company’s two largest dairy projects—one in Texas and one in Idaho—have recently begun initial operations. With those two projects now online, Clean Energy has eight projects in operation.

The company also broke ground on three additional RNG projects during the third quarter under its joint development agreement with Maas Energy Works. The three projects span six dairies located in South Dakota, Florida and New Mexico. Once fully operational, the plants are expected to produce approximately 3 million gallons of RNG annually.

While renewable identification number (RIN) prices under the Renewable Fuel Standard have stabilized, Littlefair noted California Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit prices continue to have some headwinds that are impacting profitability of the company’s RNG segment. LCFS program changes, however, are expected to tighten the market and support gradual price improvement in 2026 and beyond, he added.

Littlefair also noted that the 45Z clean fuel production credit is an important driver of diary RNG development. Clean Fuels will begin to monetize its 2025 45Z credits once Treasury finalizes its guidance.

Clean Energy reported revenue of $106.1 million for the third quarter of 2025, up from $104.69 million during the same period of last year. Net loss was $23.8 million, or 11 cents per share, on a GAAP basis, compared to a loss of $18.2 million, or 8 cents per share, reported for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBTIDA was $17.3 million, down from $21.3 million.

In the lead-up to the 2022 election, the $2.5 million commitment for a renewable energy training centre at TAFE was one of my key election commitments, along with the $10 million commitment for the Energy Future Skills Centre at the University of Wollongong.

But even I could not have envisaged just how amazing these classrooms and mobile vans would turn out.

And I want to say a very big thank you to Andrew Martin from TAFE and to Ty Christopher from the University of Wollongong for the thought and the design and just the ingenuity that has gone into these mobile training centers.

It is so vital for our local workers to have access to the skills and training that they need for the clean energy jobs of the next generation. And I really want to thank our third-year apprentices for coming along today to be part of this exciting announcement.

And with that, I'll hand over to Minister Giles.

ANDREW GILES, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Alison. It's really great to be here. It's a pretty amazing thing to have four ministers standing here.

So, I'm really pleased to be here with Paul, with Ryan, and of course with Steve, who I work with incredibly closely in our partnership between the Albanese Labor Government federally and the Minns Labor Government here in New South Wales, to make sure that every person in every corner of New South Wales has every opportunity to get skills they want to do the jobs we need.

And when I think about the jobs that we need, I think about the electrical workforce where we know we need tens of thousands more sparkies right now.

And today, this commitment, which really is all about the initiative [indistinct] incredible but now shy local federal member, Alison Byrnes, something that you fought for to ensure that more people can get the same opportunity for a fantastic career contribution, just like these electrical apprentices we've been talking to today.

I've got to say that the facilities here are amazing, this container behind us and the two trucks over there.

It's one thing to read about a proposal on a bit of paper; quite another to see it physically.

And to think about the impact this is going to have on both the training journey, but also inspiring more people, more young people and more people thinking about upskilling and reskilling to be part of the clean energy opportunities.

There's been a lot of talk about net zero in the Commonwealth Parliament over the last two weeks. A lot of talk in the Liberal Party room as they talk about themselves.

What is clear though is that they've got very little to say to the Australian people, net zero ideas when it comes to skills and training.

But today is all about a really significant investment, here in Wollongong but right around regional New South Wales, to bring training to where people are.

Not to expect people to come to the facilities, but to reach out, to break down every single barrier that's holding people back from fulfilling their potential and making a really big contribution.

Every day that I get up, I try and play a role in achieving just those goals for individuals and for our economy, and I'm really proud to be able to do that work in partnership with my friend, Steve Whan.

STEVE WHAN, NSW MINISTER FOR SKILLS, TAFE AND TERTIARY EDUCATION: Thanks, Andrew. And it is great to be here with everybody today. I want to really thank the Federal Government, Alison and Andrew and the Federal Government, for the funding that's helped us to get these.

We've got some very active local members here who pushed us to get a manufacturing centre of excellence here in Wollongong and to work with the University on projects like this.

This is important for a couple of reasons. Regardless of the political debate going on that Minister Giles was just talking about, we're already out there building the power lines, building the solar farms, building the wind farms to actually take us to net zero.

That work's happening, but it's only happening if we can actually supply the workforce. And what these mobile units are doing for us is two things.

Firstly, they're helping us to get out into the high schools and to the people who might be the potential workers of the future to let them know the exciting opportunities that are there, the sort of opportunities that our apprentices who've joined us today are seeing.

And then, they also help us with the mobile training units to go to locations where we may not have that infrastructure on the ground to actually help us with the training. So, it's really important to be able to do that.

One of the units will be operating here in the Illawarra. It’s started here. One's going to head off to Tamworth and help us in the Central West as well. So that's a really important part of helping communities to see the benefit that the REZs can bring to them, local jobs that help us to reach net zero.

And I'm really proud of the role that TAFE plays in this, in delivering these services. Really thankful for the role that Wollongong University’s played and really importantly, the Federal Government's played in funding it.

So, thanks everyone, and great to be here to see the product of your election commitment actually roll out the door. It's great.

“It does require some effort to get people to start to think about how they might be impactful in this space,” he said.

A significant amount of the new funding will go toward CHeRI’s annual “Big Idea” symposiums beginning in January. At these symposiums, faculty and graduate students will present ideas for research and compete for funding based on set criteria. Unlike other research symposiums, participants will present proposals for ideas without a set research team or plan.

“It’s a little reverse from what we would normally do because it's really just: ‘What's your idea? What's your concept? What's the thing you want to study?’” Tighe said. “Then we'll sort of figure out the team that can help support you and help to flesh out the idea.”

The new funding also allows CHeRI to support existing research projects including investigating how fungal growth, spores and toxins, in the wake of Hurricane Helene, are impacting human health in western North Carolina as well as studying how wildfire smoke affects immune response.

Tighe became particularly interested in the intersection of climate change and health after witnessing how rising temperatures and increased exposure to air pollution impacted the prevalence of lung disease in patients. Climate change has upended the progress achieved by recent regulations, Tighe said.

CHeRI’s roots trace back to March 2024 after Mary Klotman, executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine, tasked Tighe with leading a strategic working group to identify research topics focusing on climate change and health as part of the University’s broader Climate Commitment. After six months, the group outlined certain areas for research and subsequently applied for funding through the Duke Endowment.

Climate and health is one of the Climate Commitment’s focus areas for research which inspired CHeRI’s creation, explained Toddi Steelman, vice president and vice provost for climate and sustainability.

“As the world warms, all of us will be affected by rising temperatures and that gets down to basic biology and physiology of heat in how we react as humans,” Steelman said, adding that climate change could cause health problems like fungal infections, kidney failure, mosquito-borne diseases.

Researchers expect some communities will be more adversely impacted than others. The funding announcement specifically mentioned that the grant will go toward “identifying the groups most vulnerable to climate and health impacts in North Carolina and South Carolina,” particularly individuals living in low-income or rural communities. Steelman emphasized this focus is in line with the Climate Commitment.

“We know that the most vulnerable in our society, whether that's here in the United States or globally, will be more severely affected by a changing climate because there are fewer resources to mitigate the risks that vulnerable populations will face,” Steelman said.

For both Steelman and Tighe, it was important that CHeRI was an interdisciplinary initiative to ensure that faculty and students involved in both health and environmental studies could combine their knowledge to conduct effective research.

“Climate change is sort of the mother of all collective action problems,” Steelman said. “… There's a whole variety of disciplines that I think naturally start to coalesce if you are focused on real-world problems related to climate change and health.”

Tighe hopes that CHeRI’s interdisciplinary approach will ensure that researchers can quickly identify climate and health-related problems and discover solutions given the urgency of climate change.

“We don't have 30 or 40 years to sort of go down the normal process of discovery that eventually leads to something. These are things that are happening right now,” he said.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dtc/038a7c5f-15ef-4157-a273-921c98452908.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&ar=16%3A9&crop=faces%2Cedges,N,,2025-11-07 01:04:31.168776

Given this lack of progress, we need a better way to actually begin this needed transition from fuel taxes to mileage-based user fees.
Drivers also view mileage fees as double taxation or a new tax that they’d pay in addition to the current fuel tax.
Cost of collection: The cost of collecting fuel taxes for personal vehicles is about 2% of the revenue collected.
Reason Foundation has recommended this as the best way to jump-start the transition from per-gallon fuel taxes to per-mile charges.","Most transportation professionals are convinced that paying for America’s highways through per-gallon fuel taxes is no longer sustainable. While the transition to electric vehicles has slowed somewhat, hybrids increasingly contribute to lower fuel-tax revenues, and federal new-car fuel efficiency requirements are now the largest factor in projected decreases in gas-tax revenues.

Over the past nine years, Congress has funded a growing number of state mileage-based user fee (MBUF) pilot projects, which have had generally positive receptions from the very small fraction of a state population that participated. But state and federal elected officials are all over the map on how to replace fuel taxes, with some calling for a new federal vehicle registration fee and others wanting electric vehicles to pay twice as much per mile as petroleum-fueled vehicles pay today.

In the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Congress authorized a national road user charge (RUC) pilot project that would charge real fees. It asked the Biden administration to appoint a steering committee to design and oversee that program. The Biden White House dithered but eventually appointed that committee last year, but failed to announce the members. It has not convened, and so it has not defined the national pilot project. The Trump White House has said or done nothing about it. So there will be no results from a non-existing national pilot project to provide lessons learned for next year’s surface transportation reauthorization bill, as originally intended.

Given this lack of progress, we need a better way to actually begin this needed transition from fuel taxes to mileage-based user fees. That requires figuring out a workable approach for large-scale per-mile charges, including the rates to be charged to various types of vehicles, as well as affordable technologies.

However, to win political and popular support, transportation policymakers must also address the very real concerns of motorists, truckers, and elected officials. The most important concerns and issues about mileage fees are:

Privacy: People fear the government—“Big Brother in your car”—tracking everywhere they go.

Drivers also view mileage fees as double taxation or a new tax that they’d pay in addition to the current fuel tax.

Transportation officials are concerned about the high cost of collection compared to the gas tax.

Several years ago, I suggested that instead of beginning with some type of vehicle (e.g., EVs), we should begin with one type of roadway. My suggestion is to begin this transition with Interstates and other limited-access highways, using all-electronic tolling. This first step would address all three of the above concerns.

Privacy: The only miles recorded would be from on-ramp to off-ramp, so there would be no data suggesting the trip purpose. Millions of people drive on tolled Interstates and turnpikes today, and the electronic tolling does not seem to raise privacy concerns.

New tax: The answer to concerns about double taxation is to provide refunds of the fuel tax paid for the miles traveled on the newly priced highways. That’s a simple calculation that both the Massachusetts Turnpike and the New York Thruway have been doing for many years for truck fleets using those toll roads.

Cost of collection: The cost of collecting fuel taxes for personal vehicles is about 2% of the revenue collected. With all-electronic tolling, the cost is as low as 5% of the revenue. By contrast, consulting firm WSP last year estimated the cost of collection for scaling up technology used in recent state mileage fee pilot projects as between $4 and $9 a month per vehicle. That is clearly not ready for prime time. So we should start where it is feasible to use relatively inexpensive all-electronic tolling.

Starting the transition to per-mile charges with limited-access highways should not be mandated by Congress. But it should be allowed by Congress in the 2026 reauthorization. Reason Foundation has recommended this as the best way to jump-start the transition from per-gallon fuel taxes to per-mile charges. If all U.S. limited-access highways were converted, that would be more than one-third of all vehicle miles of travel.

The bill should make use of an existing but never-used federal program: the Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program (ISRRPP). Instead of being open to only three states, the program should be open to all 50 states. And instead of allowing a participating state to convert only one Interstate, it should be able to convert any or all of them.

Potentially more controversial, but crucially important, is refunding fuel taxes for the miles driven on newly priced highways, to avoid double taxation. This is actually a good deal for state transportation departments because the rate charged on tolled Interstates is typically at least twice as much per mile as what is paid in fuel tax for driving the same highway. That’s because the toll rate must cover the capital and operating costs of the more costly limited-access highway. The state DOT would be freed from devoting any of its fuel tax money to those expensive Interstates, so those dollars would be available to do a better job of sustaining and improving state highways. (I crunched the numbers on this in a peer-reviewed paper in the Transportation Research Board’s journal, Transportation Research Record, in 2023.) A similar proposition is potentially true for federal fuel taxes, whose proceeds would no longer be needed for Interstates that transitioned to per-mile charges.

While this program would begin as a pilot test of the concept, there is good reason to expect several states to volunteer as early adopters. Over the last decade or so, the following states have commissioned detailed studies of the feasibility of converting some or all of their Interstates to toll financing: Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In addition, four states took part in a federally funded Corridors of the Future study that would have allowed rebuilding I-70 with toll financing and dedicated truck lanes (Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio). After participating in two of these studies, Indiana this year became the first state to pass legislation for converting its Interstates to toll financing.

The first few states to take part in this mileage fee program will serve as role models for others, just as California, Florida, and Virginia have done for express toll lanes. Over the next decade or two, as states transition their limited-access highways to per-mile charging, the tech industry may develop low-cost, privacy-respecting technology for per-mile charges on all other types of roadways. And that would be the beginning of converting the other two-thirds of vehicle miles traveled to paying by the mile, rather than by the gallon.",https://a8d50b36.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/dreamstime_xl_389505521-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 01:04:38.684038

Re “Gates Says That Climate Change ‘Will Not Lead to Humanity’s Demise’” (news article, Oct. 29) and “Gates Has a Point on Climate Change,” by Stephen Lezak (Opinion guest essay, Nov. 4):

It might very well be true, as Bill Gates recently wrote in a public memo, that even as our climate evolves into a more brutal assault on every aspect of our environment, it won’t “lead to humanity’s demise.” At least not in an instant.

It should be clear to Mr. Gates that the demise of one aspect of the environment can have a negative impact on another. The demise of one area, like the Amazon rainforest, can have a negative impact on others areas. The net result over time is that we humans lose more and more control over our sphere of existence.

Consider forest fires: The aftereffects — smoke, hazardous pollutants, cloud cover, changes in water quality and temperature — travel vast distances to affect neighboring countries, other continents and oceans. The same goes for coal gases from smokestack emissions. Mining and burning coal in West Virginia or Wyoming or China do not affect those places exclusively. Climate matters universally. And dying piecemeal is still death.

I consider Mr. Gates’s declaration a significant retreat from the established beliefs that every part of our universe is interdependent. It is distressing to anticipate that his pronouncements will add fuel to the army of climate deniers who will insist that all is fine, because, after all, our golf courses are still very green and bottled water is plentiful and we didn’t have to skip a meal.

To the Editor:

Bill Gates offers a rare global perspective shaped by his work in health, education and poverty alleviation — along with his leadership in climate innovation and investment. His recent memo, “Three Tough Truths About Climate,” deserves attention.

Mr. Gates argues in his memo that the “doomsday” view of climate change as the end of humanity is a strategic mistake; that the strict focus on reducing emissions should be broadened to help reduce the human suffering caused by climate change; that rapidly rising global temperatures should be met with zero-carbon solutions; and that the “Green Premium” (the cost gap between clean and dirty technologies) should be reduced or eliminated with new technologies to speed this change.

Mr. Gates is right that climate action must enhance human welfare, not just reduce emissions. Innovation and equitable policies are essential, as poverty and disease still claim far more lives than rising temperatures. Growth, health and adaptation must advance together.

Bravo to a world climate leader.

Susan Atkinson

To the Editor:

I disagree with Stephen Lezak on the risks of climate change. Certainly, global warming will affect poor communities in coastal Alaska or in countries such as Bangladesh. But climate change-worsened flooding and fires have already devastated middle-class and wealthy communities in North America: Fort McMurray, Alberta; Superior, Colo.; Asheville, N.C.; and Altadena and Pacific Palisades, Calif.

In the past, communities such as these have relied on home insurance to recover after the disasters. But with compounding disasters in our warming world, insurance companies are not renewing policies or are pulling out of states such as California and Florida. If homeowners can get insurance, it’s often subpar, failing to cover losses.

Dr. Lezak writes that “the affluent typically can afford to flee a disaster and rebuild a damaged home.” That will become less typical as more well-off areas are inundated and incinerated and insurance is insufficient or unavailable.

To the Editor:

In his essay, Stephen Lezak notes, like Bill Gates, that climate change “will not be the end of civilization” and that our alarm and despair may keep us from improving lives in the here and now. While there is a kernel of truth in this message, it also grossly misrepresents the science.

Without removing legacy carbon dioxide pollution from our atmosphere and curtailing current carbon dioxide levels, our planet will be permanently changed in the coming years. Are Dr. Lezak and Mr. Gates arguing that this change needs to be civilization-ending before we worry?

Climate scientists have long predicted the outcomes: Excessive heat will gradually render huge portions of our planet unlivable (leading to nation-scale migration) and rising oceans will drown island nations and swamp many of the world’s most populated areas (including much of the United States’ Eastern Seaboard).

Our oceans, already acidifying, will become inhospitable to life. Our forests will burn off and permafrost melt, adding even more greenhouse gasses to our atmosphere, which will cause global temperatures to rise even higher.

Is “don’t look up” going to be our new climate policy normal? Or can we muster the honesty and courage to work together to save our planet?

Interfaith Connections

Our institutions and social media platforms are feeding these divisions. Online, we’re siloed into echo chambers that harm our already fragile democracy and deepen the isolation so many Americans feel. The types of argumentative theatrics that get more clicks and keep people scrolling are antithetical to the connection people actually crave.

America’s religious traditions teach us that connection doesn’t require full agreement on every single issue. It calls us to listen openly, honestly and respectfully when we disagree or don’t understand. We need more spaces for those kinds of conversations to learn how to live side by side, even with those who vote or worship differently than we do.

Year-to-date income up 20%, partly on higher electric and gas rates.

0

Zero change in weather-normalized electric sales over the 12-month period that ended on Sept. 30.

11.5 GW

Large-load service inquiries up 22% from the previous quarter, with about 20% expected to come to fruition.

Public Service Enterprise Group reported its quarterly earnings — up 20% to $620 million from a year ago — on Monday, a day before New Jersey voters elected Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, to be the state’s next governor.

During the campaign, Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze utility rates on her first day in office. She said she would “massively” build clean power while requiring more transparency from utilities, including PSEG’s Public Service Electric & Gas Co., and the PJM Interconnection.

“Prices are spiking because of a huge power shortage — I’ll transform New Jersey’s energy picture to build new, cheaper, and cleaner energy generation, bring down families’ bills, and put the Garden State on track to hit our emissions and clean air goals,” Sherrill said.

During a call with analysts before the election, Ralph LaRossa, PSEG chair, president and CEO, said the Newark, New Jersey-based utility company was used to working with both Republican and Democratic governors.

“We stand ready to work with the incoming administration to do our part to keep rates as low as possible in the short-term and work on longer-term solutions to add supply,” he said.

PSEG’s potential willingness to work with the Sherrill administration and the New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities to support customer bill affordability — through mechanisms such as extending cost recovery timelines — could help establish regulatory and policy support for PSE&G to participate in rate base initiatives as the state’s energy construct evolves, equity analysts with Jefferies said in a note on Thursday.

PSE&G has the highest electric bills in New Jersey, with a roughly 36% increase last summer compared to a year earlier, not counting the benefit of temporary rate credits, the analysts with the investment bank noted. “We expect management to offer rate concessions,” they said.

Potentially, PSE&G could increase its spending on battery storage, transmission and energy efficiency to support the Sherrill administration’s energy goals, the analysts said.

Utility owned generation?

Like other utilities in New Jersey, PSE&G isn’t allowed to own generation. But in the face of tightening power supplies across PJM, that could change, according to LaRossa.

There is a “broad recognition” in New Jersey that the state, which imports 40% of its electricity, needs to add more generation, LaRossa said. Companion bills have been introduced in the New Jersey Legislature — S4306 and A5439 — that would allow utilities to own power plants, he noted.

“We are supportive of legislation that would increase competition for generation supply should New Jersey decide to pursue new in-state generation,” LaRossa said.

Utility-owned solar and storage could be options, according to LaRossa. “We’ve done large scale solar on some brownfield sites, some landfill sites, in the past,” he said. “So we could do more on the solar front. We think there’s an appetite now for some regulated storage and we’re looking forward to taking part in that.”

Data center pipeline grows

PSE&G’s “mature” data center interconnection applications grew to 2.8 GW in the third quarter from 2.6 GW, according to LaRossa. Data center development in PSE&G’s service territory hasn’t included large hyperscaler projects, he said.

As an example, PSE&G is working on the Kenilworth area data center, a “supplemental” project that was discussed at a PJM Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee meeting on Tuesday. The data center customer aims to bring the 100-MW facility online in 2027 and expand it to 300 MW two years later.

The company continues to talk with data center developers about buying electricity from PSEG Power’s 3,758-MW nuclear fleet in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, LaRossa said.

PSEG plans to add 200 MW to the 2,285-MW Salem nuclear power plant in southern New Jersey in the 2027 to 2029 timeframe, according to LaRossa.

“This kind of baseload, carbon-free dispatchable power continues to increase in scarcity value,” he said.

A zero sum game?

Bill Gates — through his philanthropic work with the Gates Foundation — has done more than almost anyone else on the planet to meaningfully improve the lives of the world’s poorest. The Gates Foundation was the founding funder of Gavi, which helped expand vaccination in the global south and drive down prices. They did key work to help eradicate polio and combat HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, as well as deliver sanitation and clean drinking water, and worked to raise smallholder farmer yields and income through access to agricultural technology.

The recent gutting of the United States Agency for International Development — and smaller reductions in aid spending by other countries — is a humanitarian catastrophe and threatens to undo much of the work that the Gates Foundation supported over the past few decades. I can see why, in light of these urgent needs, he is suggesting that resources to combat climate change be repurposed toward dealing with poverty, hunger, and disease.

But this assumes that funding for climate and development cancel each other out. Here I think that Gates errs in his analysis for a few reasons.

First, the vast majority of spending on climate mitigation worldwide is not in low-income countries, and there is little reason to assume that cutting it would free up resources for development aid. The world spent more than $2 trillion on clean energy technologies (albeit somewhat expansively defined) in 2024, but the overwhelming majority of this was spent by middle- and high-income countries (e.g. China, the U.S., the EU, the UK, India, Japan) to build domestic clean energy, build transmission, buy electric vehicles, electrify heating, etc.

The idea that spending less on domestic mitigation would create more budget space for international development is fundamentally misguided. It’s hard to imagine that the Trump administration will revitalize development spending based on savings from cutting domestic green energy subsidies. Both development aid and climate mitigation spending represent relatively small shares of GDP in higher income countries, and there is space for policy to be able to prioritize spending on both without trading them off against each other. It is much more likely that any reduction in mitigation spending will be repurposed for other domestic priorities — leaving the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world even worse off.

Second, there are a number of ways that technologies can accomplish goals of climate mitigation and development simultaneously: solar and storage for electrification of more remote areas, clean cookstoves to reduce deforestation, and technologies to reduce both outdoor and indoor air pollution that kills millions per year globally are just a few examples.

That being said, we should take a hard look at international spending priorities for programs in the poorest countries, which, in turn, are the least responsible for global emissions today. Here adaptation should be strongly prioritized, and restrictions around finance for some fossil fuels (e.g. natural gas development in Sub-Saharan Africa) that could help support greater clean energy deployment should be reconsidered. We should generally spend more than we are today on adaptation and development (though the two are strongly related), and mitigation should be less of a priority in low-income countries.

Richer countries should be the ones taking the lead on emissions reductions — and paying a premium that will help drive down the costs of clean energy technologies so that they can be adopted cost effectively by lower income countries. Indeed, that’s largely been the story of our successes here to date, with countries like China, India, and Brazil adopting ambitious net-zero goals in part because they see the cost of meeting them as modest and not trading off against their development priorities.

Third, the idea that we should “spend less” on climate adaptation is a dangerous misunderstanding of the problem. There is no world where we don’t spend money dealing with climate impacts. Rather, our choice is between spending money now, e.g. to build a seawall, or spend money later to rebuild the city after it floods. Our choice here should be guided by the fact that adaptation in advance is cheaper than adaptation after the disaster. In other words, spending money today on adaptation is the cheaper option that will better promote health and welfare of the world’s poorest citizens.

Hedging against climate risks

In his memo, Gates highlights the progress we’ve made on climate change to-date, noting that:

Ten years ago, the International Energy Agency predicted that by 2040, the world would be emitting 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. Now, just a decade later, the IEA’s forecast has dropped to 30 billion, and it’s projecting that 2050 emissions will be even lower.

Read that again: In the past 10 years, we’ve cut projected emissions by more than 40%.

This progress is not part of the prevailing view of climate change, but it should be. What made it possible is that the Green Premium—the cost difference between clean and dirty ways of doing something—reached zero or became negative for solar, wind, power storage, and electric vehicles. By and large, they are just as cheap as, or even cheaper than, their fossil fuel counterparts.

Gates is right that cheap clean energy represents a remarkable success story, and is one of the reasons why projections of future warming have fallen from around 3.5 degrees Celsius a decade ago to around 2.7 degrees today.

But focusing on these precise temperature outcomes in 2100 is problematically reductionist. Our emissions are just one of three factors that will determine the future warming of the planet. (And we should remember that current policies represent neither a ceiling nor a floor on current emissions, particularly at a time when some governments are actively rolling them back.)

Even if we knew future emissions precisely, the warming in 2100 remains highly uncertain. It depends both on the sensitivity of the climate to our increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations — the response of various climate feedbacks like clouds and surface reflectivity — and how the carbon cycle responds to both our emissions and the changing climate.

Due to the combination of these uncertainties, it’s possible that we could think we are heading for 2.7 degrees of warming and stop at 3.7 degrees (or even 4+ degrees) even if we roll 6s on the proverbial climate dice. And we won’t know precisely how sensitive the climate is (despite some recent progress) until it’s too late to avoid where we’ll end up.

This means that we should think of mitigation less as targeting (or avoiding) a particular outcome and more as hedging against risk. We should do more mitigation — all things considered — than if we had certainty in the climate response because of the high damages associated with less likely but still quite possible tail risks. Or as the late climate economist Marty Weitzman memorably put it, when it comes to climate change “the sting is in the tail.”

Gates is right to note that climate change “will not lead to humanity’s demise,” but I’d suggest that this represents a bit of a straw man. Outside a fringe community of climate doomers, there are few who think that climate change could realistically threaten the extinction of the human race (though some folks need to be a bit cautious about throwing around the term “existential threat” willy nilly). As the climate scientist Steven Schneider was fond of saying, for climate change, “the end of the world and good for you are the two lowest probability outcomes”.

But not being an existential threat does not tell us all that much, as almost nothing aside from a planet-killing asteroid or (possibly) an all-out global thermonuclear war rises to that highest of bars. Every other problem humanity deals with — war, violence, famine, poverty — is not existential but is still critically important. This is more or less Gates’ point, that climate should be treated as one of many problems we need to solve rather than an all-encompassing ur-problem. But by and large, the majority of people and policymakers have been treating it as just that.

Green premiums and brown costs

Gates posits that society can best address climate change by working to reduce the green premium associated with clean energy technologies.

The idea of the green premium is compelling. As noted earlier, a lot of the progress that society has made on reducing emissions over the past 15 years has come on the back of near-miraculously rapid declines in the cost of clean energy technologies. Cheaper clean energy in turn enables more ambitious policy adoption, as the costs of getting to net-zero emissions turn from astronomical to manageable.

But I’d suggest that it is somewhat incomplete, at least in its more straightforward interpretation. There is an idea that innovation and markets alone will necessarily solve the problem in the absence of policy interventions — that if we can just make clean energy cheap enough, the world will sufficiently decarbonize to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts from climate change.

This may be the case, but it also may not. Innovation cuts both ways — the success of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technology has drastically reduced the cost of natural gas and oil production. There are lots of resources going into producing fossil fuels more cheaply, and while I’m hopeful that the cost of solar, batteries, wind, nuclear, geothermal, and other clean energy technologies will fall faster, there is no law of physics that says it will inevitably be cheaper.

Hoping that clean energy will be absolutely cheaper than fossil fuels at a scale needed to decarbonize our energy system is a gamble — and one with loaded dice. There are real costs associated with fossil fuel use — from air pollution, from climate change, from local environmental damage. These are currently borne by the public and not by the companies producing fossil fuels. As long as the costs remain socialized while the benefits are privatized, the market alone will not lead to the optimal level of deployment of clean energy technologies.

This is where policy comes in: We either need to include the “brown costs” of fossil fuels in their market price (e.g. a carbon tax, something that has been not very politically palatable to date) or be willing to pay some ongoing green premium in cases where clean energy remains more expensive to account for the real costs of climate and pollution.

Policy also plays a key role in technology. The rapid and amazing drop in the price of solar energy over the last few decades has been driven to a large extent by government support of the technology. The free market may have done this by itself, but it would have likely taken many decades longer.

I don’t think Gates would necessarily disagree with any of this, but it’s an important rejoinder for those who assume that innovation alone is sufficient to address the problem.

The death of nuance

The reception of the Gates memo was an unfortunate reflection of our extremely polarized politics. Some climate advocates dismissed it as denialism or the second coming of Bjorn Lomborg, while those on the right (including President Trump) portrayed it as proof that the science was wrong and climate change was actually a hoax.

Gates tried at length and upfront to make his position clear that climate change is a big problem, and that his interest is on near-term prioritization of resources. But most interpreted the memo through their ideological priors (many likely without actually reading it).

To be clear: Climate change is a very important problem. It needs to be solved, along with other problems like malaria and malnutrition. Every tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.

Our inability to have nuanced discussions about these matters is detrimental to the broader societal discussion about serious issues like climate change. The portrayal of climate as an all or nothing problem, coupled with the U.S.’s thermostatic politics where control of government commonly switches between parties, is a recipe for a lack of clear long term action on climate or any other big societal problem that gets caught up in the politicized culture wars. While I don’t know how to change society to make science less politicized and to center the debate around the best solutions rather than the physical reality of the problem, a change is sorely needed.

Balancing future and present harms

Ultimately Gates’ memo is making the case that we need to set a higher priority on helping the world’s most vulnerable in a time when aid to them is being cut. I broadly agree. But deprioritizing mitigation spending is not a very effective way to accomplish that goal, outside of the relatively modest amount of money the world spends today on mitigation in the least developed countries.

When there is an option to spend money already going to these countries in a way that provides the greatest benefits for the population even if it does not reduce (or even increases) emissions, we should probably do it. But the vast majority of the resources we spend on decarbonization today in middle and upper income countries will not magically be repurposed for international development aid if we deprioritize climate change as an issue. And deprioritizing climate change as an issue risks substituting near-term benefits for long-term harms that are nearly impossible to reverse.

A world of unabated climate change will impact the poor most severely. Addressing it requires two strategies in tandem: prioritizing development and poverty alleviation to build adaptive capacity (and human flourishing), and reducing emissions rapidly in middle and upper-income countries to mitigate future climate impacts and drive down the cost of clean energy technologies so they can be more readily adopted by low income countries. Perhaps I’m unduly optimistic, but I think that society should be able to do both.

Editor’s note: A version of this article originally appeared in the author’s newsletter, The Climate Brink, and has been repurposed for Heatmap.

The world’s most important climate summit is set to begin. The first phase of the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — better known as COP30 — is slated to kick off this morning with a Leaders’ Summit that will bring together 143 delegations, including 57 heads of state and 39 ministers in Belém, a bayside city near Brazil’s northern coast. Negotiations over how to tighten ways to implement global emissions rules and hasten the speed of cuts are set to begin officially on Monday. COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago on Wednesday unveiled a $1.3 trillion climate finance roadmap to fulfill promises made at last year’s meeting in Azerbaijan, but told reporters that “there is no plan” for the roadmap even to be discussed at the summit, let alone formally adopted, according to Climate Home News.

Taking place against the backdrop of the United States’ withdrawal from climate negotiations and pullback of ambition from many other countries, the confab comes as the latest modeling from Rhodium Group consultancy shows the world is now on track to blow past the Paris Agreement’s 2-degree Celsius target but avoid the cataclysmic warming once forecast. The data projects the world will warm between 2 and 3.9 degrees above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote this week, that range is largely unchanged from Rhodium’s 2023 forecasts, suggesting that, “in the long run,” the Trump administration’s policies “might not mean much for the climate’s trajectory.”

2. Geoengineering startup Stardust has started quietly lobbying Congress

Stardust Solutions, the U.S.-based, Israeli-led geoengineering startup just raised $60 million to commercialize technology to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, has quietly begun lobbying the U.S. government for contracts. In the first quarter of this year, the company hired law firm Holland & Knight to start appealing to Congress, but didn’t disclose its efforts “due to a clerical error,” the lobbyist told E&E News on Wednesday.

To many scientists, geoengineering is too dangerous to even study, posing a moral hazard to decarbonization by offering a temporary solution to the effects of warming. But, as I reported exclusively in this newsletter in September, more than 100 scientists — including former President Joe Biden’s science adviser — signed onto a public letter calling for a publicly-accountable research program to start now in case global warming gets bad enough that a country or corporation tries to unilaterally carry out geoengineering before it’s fully understood. The emergence of a major commercial contender such as Stardust suggests the tides are turning in favor of the technology. As Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer reported last month in a scoop about Stardust’s fundraising, the company claims its technology will be ready to go by the start of the next decade.

3. Data center companies are lobbying more than ever

Meanwhile, data center companies are sparking a boom in Beltway influence-peddling. The four largest cloud providers — Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta — have all “reported tens of millions of dollars in federal lobbying in 2025 alone,” according to a new analysis from the federal records nonprofit OpenSecrets. The number of lobbyists per data center has also increased. Meta hired 21 more lobbyists this year than last year, and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI increased its stable of lobbyists nearly sevenfold since 2023.

The lobbying push comes amid mounting backlash. A Heatmap poll published in September found that only 44% of Americans would welcome a data center near their homes.

4. Taiwan inches closer to restarting its shuttered nuclear reactors

Taiwan this week took what may be its most significant step yet toward restarting its nuclear reactors. In May, the island became one of the only countries in world history to abandon nuclear power entirely after shutting down its final reactor. The move rendered the self-governing republic, which China claims as a breakaway territory despite the Communist Party never ruling there, almost entirely dependent on imported fossil fuels for its energy. Electricity prices are soaring — the domestic rates the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the country’s national industrial champion, now pays are the highest of any of its global operations — and outages have grown. Worse yet, Taiwan is now vulnerable to blockades by the Chinese military that could weaponize blackouts in much the same way Russia has against Ukraine. Despite this, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, which nominally supports independence from China, has opposed nuclear power since its inception. While Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te struggled to halt the final shutdown in the year after he took office, his administration has expressed an openness to nuclear power again.

On Wednesday, the state-owned utility Taipower submitted its assessment of how to restart shuttered reactors to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In a referendum in August on whether Taiwan should restart its most recently closed plant, a majority of voters who cast ballots approved the measure, yet the plebiscite failed because it did not attract a large enough share of eligible voters. But the United Daily News reported that Taipower’s top boss said “there are opportunities and conditions” for restarting not just that last plant but the country’s second station, too. The news comes just days after Spain, the only country still pursuing a nuclear phaseout plan, officially started the paperwork to reconsider the policy, as I reported in Monday’s newsletter.

5. The godfather of the geothermal industry is getting into storage

The new generation of geothermal startups promising to use novel drilling techniques to expand the energy source’s footprint get a lot of attention. But Ormat Technologies dominates the U.S. industry with conventional operations. In August, Ormat entered a strategic partnership with one of the next-generation companies, Sage Geosystems, in a move analysts told me at the time amounted to the giant in the space picking a “winner” among the newcomers. Yet Ormat’s latest earnings suggest it’s found a new area for growth: storage. Revenue from energy storage deals skyrocketed 108% year over year thanks to good weather conditions and higher capacity prices in the PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid. The company said it expects annual growth in the sector of up to 17% over the next three years, Utility Dive reported.

THE KICKER

Depending on how you feel about arachnids, this will either horrify you or delight you. Scientists just discovered the world’s biggest spider web, a subterranean “megacity” spanning nearly 1,080 square feet in a sulfur cave on the Albania-Greece border. Attached to a wall near the cave’s entrance, the colony — much like our own urban dwellings — has a large and diverse population. Roughly 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, known as the domestic house spider, call the web network home, along with 42,000 Prinerigone vagans spiders. Researchers believe this to be the first documented case of a colonial web formation for both species.

In a series of questions designed to draw out what limits Sauer thought existed on executive power, Gorsuch asked, “Could the president impose a 50% tariff on gas-powered cars and auto parts to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat from abroad of climate change?” (This echoed the language of the statute the Solicitor General cited to justify the tariffs.)

“It’s very likely that could be done,” Sauer conceded.

“I think that would have to be the logic of your view,” Gorsuch replied.

“Obviously this administration would say that’s a hoax, this is not a real crisis,” Sauer said.

“I’m sure you would,” Gorsuch said to chuckles.

“But that would be a question for Congress, under our interpretation, not the courts,” Sauer said.

Gorsuch’s questioning touched on the “major questions doctrine,” first propounded in the court’s 2022 opinion in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency. In that case, which resulted in the court striking down the Obama-era Clean Power Plan power plant regulations, the conservative majority argued that “given both separation of powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative intent, the agency must point to ‘clear congressional authorization’ for the authority it claims,” which it claimed the rules lacked.

In a note to clients following the emissions rules case, the white shoe law firm Davis Polk wrote that the majority opinion “does not provide guidance for applying the major questions doctrine in future cases,” but noted that a concurrence authored by Justice Gorsuch “attempted to provide such guidance for future cases.” In said concurrence, Gorsuch wrote that the major questions doctrine could be invoked when the executive branch is dealing with a question of “great political significance” or “a significant portion of the American economy.”

Hmm!

Some progressives flagged this aspect of the tariffs case as it worked its way through the courts, pointing out that it could call into question powers that future presidents may want to use to implement expansive industrial policy, including climate policy. Some of the broader legal arguments against the tariffs, Todd Tucker of the progressive Roosevelt Institute wrote in a brief, “tilt the scales overwhelmingly against progressive priorities.”

“Limits on Trump today will bind future presidents tomorrow. This could include centrists, progressives, MAGA types, or traditional conservatives, who will need or want robust executive tools to address ruinous competitiveness or climate emergencies.”

But in pursuit of their clients’ interests, advocates for striking down the tariffs were more than happy to pick up the thread dropped by Gorsuch to make libertarian-leaning arguments about presidential powers.

“It is simply implausible that in enacting” the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law Trump has used to justify his retributive import taxes, “Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff system and the American economy in the process, allowing him to set and reset tariffs or any and every product from any and every country at any and all times,” Neal Katyal, the lawyer arguing on behalf of a beer and wine distributor and a longtime figure in Democratic legal circles, said in his oral argument.

Perhaps seeking to appeal to the Republican majority on the court, Katyal returned to Justice Gorsuch’s climate change example, arguing that “if the government wins, another president could declare a ’climate emergency’ and impose huge tariffs without floors or ceilings, as Justice Gorsuch said.”

“My friend’s answer,” Katyal said, referring to Sauer, “is, ‘This administration would declare it a hoax.’ The next president may not quite say that.”

Many legal experts thought that the administration got the worse of the oral arguments and questioning of the attorneys, with conservative Justices Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts all asking skeptical questions of Sauer, while Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito repeatedly threw the White House argumentative lifelines, including, in Alito’s case, suggesting other laws that could justify the tariffs.

Alito even gently mocked Katyal, a Democrat who served as acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, for blatantly using conservative-tinged legal arguments about the scope of executive authority over the economy.

“I wonder if you ever thought that your legacy as a constitutional advocate would be the man who revived the non-delegation argument,” referring to the idea that certain powers are too much akin to lawmaking to delegate to the executive branch, which in theory could vastly restrict the authority of regulators.

But Katyal resisted the implied contradiction and persisted in targeting the right wing of an already conservative Supreme Court.

“Heck yes,” Katyal said. “I think Justice Gorsuch nailed it on the head when saying that when you’re dealing with a statute that is this open-ended — unlike anything we’ve ever seen.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTk4ODY4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwMDQ4NjkwN30.45KFjHyQ-4stKugU9GOAzGtcfgoNdKtal8t_RxC9sUY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-06 22:58:33.662469

Nothing in this communication should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking statements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking statements will be achieved.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)

This release includes various financial measures that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe these measures provide important supplemental information to investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results. We use these measures, together with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"" or ""U.S. GAAP""), for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations, that when taken together with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that we also provide, give a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We strongly encourage you to review all of our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not solely rely on any single non-GAAP financial measure.

Non-GAAP financial measures are limited as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP results. The Company expects to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures, adjusting for the items described below (and/or other items that may arise in the future as the Company's management deems appropriate), and the Company expects to continue to incur expenses, charges or gains like the non-GAAP adjustments described below. Accordingly, unless expressly stated otherwise, the exclusion of these and other similar items in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent, or non-recurring. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measure as indicators of operating performance. Moreover, because not all companies use identical measures and calculations, the Company's presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. We strongly encourage you to review all of our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not solely rely on any single non-GAAP financial measure.

Adjusted EBITDA

To supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses a non-GAAP financial measure that it calls adjusted EBITDA (""Adjusted EBITDA""). This non-GAAP financial measure adjusts net income for interest and financing expense, net, net income attributable to non-redeemable non-controlling interests, depreciation, amortization and accretion, adjustments to reflect Adjusted EBITDA from equity method investments, fair value changes and non-recurring charges, Stock-based compensation, major maintenance on Renewable Power, RNG development costs, and ITC proceeds, net.

Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information about the Company's performance, for the following reasons: (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to assess the Company's operating performance and make financial and operational decisions; (2) the measure excludes the effect of items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company's core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business; (3) the measure better aligns revenues with expenses; and (4) the measure is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's business. In future quarters, the Company may adjust for other expenditures, charges or gains to present non-GAAP financial measures that the Company's management believes are indicative of the Company's core operating performance.

The following table presents the reconciliation of our net income to Adjusted EBITDA:

11/06/2025 - 10:10 PM

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OPAL Fuels (“OPAL Fuels” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: OPAL) today announced financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

""Third quarter results were in line with our expectations,"" said Adam Comora, Co-Chief Executive Officer of OPAL Fuels. ""RNG production continues to increase, up 8% sequentially and 30% when compared to the third quarter of 2024. We are pleased operationally with the progress made in the third quarter and we expect full year results to be within our 2025 guidance range, despite a lower D3 RIN price environment. We continue to execute on our strategic growth objectives having placed our Atlantic RNG Project online last month and today announce our CMS RNG Project in North Carolina has entered construction representing 1.0 million MMBtu of annual design capacity net to OPAL Fuels. We continue to see a positive policy environment where RNG receives bipartisan support. In the quarter, we completed our fourth sale of IRA Investment Tax Credits with aggregate total gross sale proceeds greater than $40 million this year and expect to begin recognizing 45Z production tax credits in the fourth quarter.""

""Our annual design capacity is now at 9.1 million MMBtu across twelve operating projects, our vertical integration with the marketing and distribution of RNG and CNG as a transportation fuel continues to contribute to our growth,"" said Co-Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Maurer. ""We are building an energy infrastructure platform to address heavy-duty transportation, historically a hard to de-carbonize sector. At present, RNG and CNG are the most attractive alternatives to replace diesel for the Class 8 trucking market. We are positioned to lead faster adoption in this market which is building long-term and sustainable intrinsic value for OPAL shareholders.”

Financial Highlights

Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, was $83.4 million and $249.2 million respectively, a decrease of (1)% and an increase 13% respectively, compared to the prior-year period.

Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, was $11.4 million and $20.2 million respectively, compared to $17.1 million and $19.7 million in the same periods last year.

Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado.
The legislation seeks to promote prescribed burns, expand the state-federal Good Neighbor Authority program, increase collaboration among fire agencies and improve reforestation efforts after fires.

The Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate in April and co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado.

The legislation seeks to promote prescribed burns, expand the state-federal Good Neighbor Authority program, increase collaboration among fire agencies and improve reforestation efforts after fires. It also makes some rule changes that could impact how areas designated as high fire danger are managed and how projects in those areas proceed.

“Better stewardship of our forests is not a partisan issue; it’s an imperative to securing a stronger economy, healthier forests, and safer communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I’m proud to see the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act move forward in the legislative process, and I’ll continue fighting alongside my colleagues to enact commonsense reforms that ensure proper forest management, unleash the resource economy, and protect American communities from the threat of wildfire.”

The governors of those four states, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, signed on to a letter in support of the legislation in late October. The bill has already worked its way through the U.S. House, though doesn’t include new appropriated funds.

The legislation has received some support from environmental and outdoor advocacy groups, with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership calling it a “comprehensive” approach to tackling forest health and wildfire issues. The Nature Conservancy and the National Audubon Society is also in support of the legislation.

But there has also been some concern with it, namely around how it could change the process of forest projects, especially those in a declared “emergency fireshed management” area. That’s a Biden-era designation which essentially prohibits projects from exploring alternatives on forestry projects — the only options are what’s called an “action” or “no action.” It essentially shortens the review period for projects within that designation.

Forestry actions falling within that designation are usually small in scope, but the federal legislation would push that number to include projects as large as 10,000 acres.

Even with the renewed interest in prescribed burns and other forestry projects to help with forest health, there’s still a lack of action, said Riva Duncan, the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group made up of former firefighters.

According to Forest Service data, hazardous fuels reduction work across their lands was down 38% in 2025 when compared with the same period during the previous four calendar years.

Federal cuts and Department of Government Efficiency actions caused chaos last winter and some mitigation projects never happened or were delayed. Between the cuts and needs for firefighters around the country, the work just isn’t getting done, she said.

And while DOGE actions mostly spared firefighters, supporting positions around fire mitigation work were not.

“There’s a huge network of specialists and biologists and things behind the scenes that do the environmental work to allow these fuels projects to continue,” Duncan said. “And so they were hit really hard by (DOGE cuts) and by the deferred resignations and things like that. A lot of issues are exacerbated by this administration, who has been very open about not supporting a Federal workforce.”

Prescribed burns can help mitigate risk by removing fuel that otherwise might add to the intensity of a fire. During the last 100 years the Forest Service has consistently embraced suppression as its main method of fire defense.

Land management policies “vilifying” fire have led to overgrowth and climate change continues to impact forests, Duncan said, adding suppression has been a renewed focus this summer. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough.

“Every year the Chief of the Forest Service puts out their fire season letter, and it made pretty clear that suppression was going to be the primary focus,” Duncan said. “And I think when you look at the chief and his background coming from the timber industry, there are a lot of people who have commercial timber lands, commercial timber interests, who don’t like fire, who still will not recognize the value it brings. All it does is hurt their bottom line, right?”

Duncan also pointed out not all logging is necessarily fuel mitigation work and added she’s not specifically against logging; however, saying logging alone will solve the issue is disingenuous.

“A lot of people who want us to log more, want more trees to come off national forest lands, will try to make that argument,” Duncan said. “Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not. Often it’s not.”

Grassroots Wildland Firefighters did submit a comment on the Fix Our Forests bill and she said it’s an acknowledgment that more fuel work needs to be done.

“Fire is non-partisan. It doesn’t recognize boundaries or recognize if it’s private or federal land, if it’s commercial versus being managed for ecological reasons,” Duncan said. “And so we need a comprehensive solution with everybody at the table who has a stake, and everybody has a stake.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Windy-Rock-Fire-Peelee-Aug-30-3Medic.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 06:59:12.397730

Clean Energy Fuels Corp. posted revenue of $106.1mn for the third quarter of 2025, a slight increase from $104.9mn in the same period in 2024. The company sold 61.3 million gallons of renewable natural gas (RNG), marking a 3% increase year-over-year. However, it reported a net loss of $23.8mn, compared to $18.2mn a year earlier.

Margins affected by contractual incentives

Results were significantly impacted by a non-cash charge of $16.8mn related to sales incentives granted to Amazon under a fuel supply agreement. These charges, up from $15.8mn in the previous year, weighed on the company’s financial performance. In parallel, adjusted EBITDA declined from $21.3mn to $17.3mn, reflecting increased pressure on operating margins.

The impact of the Alternative Fuel Tax Credit (AFTC), which expired at the end of 2024, was also evident, with no contribution in 2025 versus $6.4mn in the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, revenues from environmental credits (RIN and LCFS) fell to $11.4mn from $13mn year-on-year, primarily due to lower market prices.

Strategic investments and production capacity expansion

Clean Energy invested in Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions, an early-stage company offering low-emission leasing solutions for North American fleets. The company also broke ground on three new RNG production sites through a joint venture with Maas Energy Works, aiming for a combined annual output of three million gallons once operational.

Total fuel volume sold reached 76.6 million gasoline gallon equivalents (GGE), up from 73.5 million in Q3 2024, driven by higher sales of conventional natural gas. Revenue from operations and maintenance services remained stable at $14.6mn.

2025 outlook and exposure to exceptional charges

For full-year 2025, Clean Energy expects a net loss between $212mn and $217mn. This projection includes $55mn in accelerated depreciation tied to the removal of liquefied natural gas (LNG) stations, as well as a $64.3mn goodwill impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated between $60mn and $65mn.

According to company data, the fuel distribution segment represents the bulk of adjusted EBITDA, estimated between $72mn and $74mn for the year. In contrast, upstream RNG activities remain loss-making, with adjusted EBITDA projected between -$12mn and -$9mn.

According to PEER, two EPA publications on its website contain erroneous information about PFOA:

“EPA Questions and Answers About TSCA,” Q8 states: “[Is] … perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and other long-chain [per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)] still being manufactured or imported into United States?” According to EPA’s answer, “[t]he manufacture and import of PFOA has also been phased out in United States as part of the PFOA Stewardship program.

According to PEER, these statements are inaccurate, incomplete, and misleading.

The nation's largest public utility generates electricity for 10 million people in seven Southeast states, but it only has around 210 customers, split between 153 local utilities and dozens of large companies and agencies that buy power directly. Around 90% of its power sales are to local utilities that distribute the electricity to their residential and commercial customers.

TVA's revenue was $960 million higher than budgeted, TVA Chief Financial Officer Tom Rice told the board of directors at a quarterly meeting in Mississippi on Thursday.

Fuel costs included on power bills accounted for $636 million of the increase as TVA relied on coal and natural gas plants to fill a gap left by unplanned nuclear outages. TVA burned 389 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 14 million tons of coal during the year.

The operating revenue is the highest in TVA history, according to financial reports the company has filed since 2006. The revenue is twice TVA's revenue of $6.8 billion in 2002, the earliest year included in the reports. Congress created the company during the Great Depression to bring affordable electricity and jobs to the rural South.

TVA's average electricity rate for the year was 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the national average across all sectors of 14.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The TVA board of directors met for the third time this year without a minimum quorum of five members to vote on new business. Three directors — Bobby Klein of Chattanooga, Chair Bill Renick of Mississippi and Wade White of Kentucky — were able under the TVA Act to approve three items to ensure continued operations.

President Donald Trump has fired three members since March who were nominated by then-President Joe Biden. At least four of Trump's five nominees to the board are likely to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn in by the next meeting in February.

The board has been unable to approve a new long-term energy plan for TVA, which released a draft of the plan in 2024.

Here are major actions taken and numbers shared at the meeting.

SALES GROW

The nearly $1.4 billion growth in revenue in one year was caused primarily by two factors, Rice said. More people are moving to Tennessee and parts of six other states that distribute TVA power, and data centers are using more power.

TVA invested nearly $4.7 billion in its system of power plants and transmission lines over the past year, with enough assets under construction to generate power for 2 million homes. It plans to invest $11 billion over the next three years, CEO Don Moul said.

The company played a role in attracting $6.6 billion of investment in the region and entered several partnerships for new nuclear projects this year.

""The biggest theme heading into 2026 is more energy,"" Moul said at the meeting.

The utility met its highest all-time demand in January and tied a record for 23 days straight of demand above 30,000 megawatts over the summer. The utility added more than $2.5 billion to its debt, ending the year with $23.8 billion of debt.

""The financial community believes in our plan, believes in our ability to execute it,"" Rice said, referring to investors in TVA bonds.

TVA must work under a $30 billion debt limit set by Congress in 1979 and not adjusted for inflation.

COSTS CUT

As sales rose, TVA's operations and maintenance were $209 million less than budgeted. The company is two years into a three-year effort to cut $950 million in planned spending.

The effort is on track after around 600 employees took a voluntary buyout earlier this year, Rice said. The Knoxville-based utility has more employees in Chattanooga than any other city. TVA is the fifth largest local employer, with 3,857 employees in the area in 2024, according to the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce.

TVA's net income was $1.4 billion, which it can use to invest back into its system. The income is what's left of TVA revenue after it pays employees, buys fuel, maintains plants, purchases electricity from other companies and pays interest on debt.

The income was $739 million higher than TVA budgeted.

THREE VOTES

Three directors unanimously approved end-of-year payouts for employees and executive awards, based on performance goals.

""These plans are a key part of maintaining operational alignment and ensuring the ongoing execution of business,"" Rebecca Tolene, the top lawyer at TVA, told the board.

TVA employees exceeded targets for three of five goals: safety, power operations performance and operations spending. They fell below target on transmission and below threshold on nuclear operations, both because of unplanned outages.

""TVA's incentive plans are intended to motivate and reward employees for achieving goals that are aligned to TVA's missions and values,"" Klein said. ""This at-risk pay is only earned when performance meets the goals.""

After an extended outage at the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant in Soddy-Daisy ended in July, TVA generated more power from its three nuclear plants in September than any month in its history, Chief Nuclear Officer Matt Rasmussen said.

Employees will get most of the total possible award after directors approved the payouts. Executives will get much of their long-term incentive payout after a separate board vote. The payouts will be detailed in an annual financial report to be released later in November.

The board kept CEO compensation the same, with a target direct pay of around $6 million for Don Moul, who became CEO in April. Moul's compensation is lower than pay for his predecessor, and falls at the bottom of CEO pay for 28 private, investor-owned utilities in a peer group.

In a third vote, directors approved contracts for up to 1,500 megawatts of battery storage based on the utility's long-term plan and a previous request for proposals from developers.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/11/07/103842336_082725c01-sequoyah018_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-11-06 23:18:17.909158

Instead, many customers switch from grid power to local backup sources, such as batteries.

Then, in May, NRG Energy said it had reached an agreement to buy assets from LS Power, including 18 power plants and CPower.
CPower’s competitors include companies that either specialize in demand response or offer it as part of a larger selection of goods and services.","When electricity supplies are tight, being able to flip a few switches and save 38 gigawatt-hours is a pretty cool trick.

CPower Energy said this week that its customers reduced their grid electricity usage by that amount from January to September, which is enough to power about 8 million houses during a grid emergency.

The energy savings were more than double what the company’s customers recorded in all of 2024.

CPower is a leading vendor of demand response services, which means that it organizes large groups of clients who agree to reduce their energy use during periods of high demand. This is a resource whose value is increasing as utilities struggle to build power plants fast enough to keep up with the rising need for electricity for data centers and other large users.

I spoke with Mike Smith, CPower’s CEO, this week to understand how demand response works. His Baltimore-based company has about 200 employees.

“We’re a shock absorber,” he said. “We are there to turn down our collective usage, and that is the usage of our customers in response to the grid’s need.”

CPower’s clients operate businesses in 23,000 locations across the country, and they have the potential to reduce their electricity use by up to 6.7 gigawatts. The bulk of that capacity comes from large manufacturers that are flexible in how much power they need from the grid.

In exchange for cutting their energy use, the customers receive compensation from the grid operator, with $1.2 billion paid since 2015.

While 38 gigawatt-hours is a large number, most of that energy savings happened during a few hours on a few days. About half of the total happened during brief periods of the June heat wave, which led to tight electricity supplies in the PJM Interconnection and ISO New England grid regions, Smith said.

I asked Smith how his customers get the message to turn down their power, imagining that he has a central controller and pushes a few buttons. He explained that the process varies depending on the client, with some agreeing to have their power demand reduced remotely by CPower, and others wanting to receive a phone call, text message or email so they can make the adjustment themselves.

Turning down the power may conjure images of dimming lights and idled assembly lines, but it often doesn’t work that way. Instead, many customers switch from grid power to local backup sources, such as batteries.

Nick Heiny, vice president and general counsel for Metal Technologies of Indiana, is a CPower customer. I asked him how he would explain demand response to somebody unfamiliar with it.

Demand response “is similar to deciding to wait a few hours to leave for a road trip the day before Thanksgiving after a foot of fresh snow has fallen and all highways are jammed,” he said in an email.

It’s also a way to be a good neighbor, he said. His plants are large power users, so when they reduce their use, it frees up capacity for others on the grid and helps to reduce the risks of brownouts. His company operates metal casting plants in Indiana, Michigan and Mexico.

Industry analysts often categorize demand response as a form of a virtual power plant, a term that describes when many customer-owned power sources work together to mimic the effect of large power plants.

The U.S. market for virtual power plants, including demand response, is 37.5 gigawatts, an increase of 14 percent from last year, according to the research firm Wood Mackenzie.

Demand response “is receiving unprecedented attention” because of the urgency that utilities and grid operators are feeling to have enough power to serve data centers, said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie.

He said the challenges to growth in demand response are almost all regulatory, including utilities that have caps on participation and grid operators that have not yet found ways to fully integrate these systems. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sought to accelerate the use of demand response and other customer-owned resources with a 2020 order, but implementation has been slow.

CPower was founded in 2014 under the ownership of H.I.G. Capital, a private equity firm.

In 2018, H.I.G. sold CPower to LS Power of New York, an independent power company. Then, in May, NRG Energy said it had reached an agreement to buy assets from LS Power, including 18 power plants and CPower. The deal is contingent on regulatory approval, which is still pending.

CPower’s competitors include companies that either specialize in demand response or offer it as part of a larger selection of goods and services. This includes Enel X and Siemens, among others.

One upshot of the NRG acquisition is that CPower may now have greater access to sell its services to companies that already buy power from NRG, said Hertz-Shargel.

But CPower’s market is poised for growth regardless of who owns it, thanks to the need to accommodate the substantial power needs of data centers.

Smith, the company’s CEO, said data centers have become a larger share of his customer base. This ties into a recurring theme this year as researchers and grid operators recognize that data centers need to be adaptable in their power use, or else there won’t be enough electricity to go around.

“Everybody in the data center space, no matter what the use case, is looking at becoming more and more flexible, and we’re running right along beside them,” Smith said.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

Democrats Sweep Election Day: Voters chose Democrats in all major contested races on Tuesday, a result that the party is interpreting as a rebuke of the Trump administration and an encouraging sign for next year’s midterm elections. A key issue was energy prices and utility bills, as Marianne Lavelle reports for ICN. Democrats did especially well in Virginia, winning the governor’s race and gaining seats in the House of Delegates, as Charles Paullin reports for ICN.

Democrats Take Two Seats on Georgia Utility Regulatory Board: On a good night for Democrats nationwide, the party gained two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, ousting Republican incumbents amid public dissatisfaction with high utility rates, as David W. Chen reports for The New York Times. Republicans will still hold a 3-2 majority on the panel, but the results indicate the public was receptive to Democrats’ campaign messages about reducing utility rates and a willingness to invest more in renewable energy.

Illinois Passes a Major Energy Bill: Illinois legislators passed a bill that increases incentives for battery energy storage, geothermal power and virtual power plants, as Kari Lydersen reports for Canary Media. Gov. JB Pritzker has said he will sign the measure, which is one of the most significant state-level clean energy bills to pass this year. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act says the state will procure 3 gigawatts of energy storage by 2030, among other provisions.

Can Cows and Solar Coexist? I went to Kentucky to visit a farm where sheep graze alongside a utility-scale solar array, and I found that the future of this so-called solar grazing is in cattle. My story for ICN provides a first look at CattleTracker, a system from the solar developer Silicon Ranch that is customized to operate in environments with large, often clumsy animals in the vicinity. If solar developers can convince cattle ranchers to install solar, there is an opportunity to deploy this energy hardware on some of the vast amounts of land used for cattle grazing.

Asked whether the openness to compromise extended to the Senate RGGI bill, Bradford acknowledged two areas where his caucus would not budget.","A compromise that sacrifices Pennsylvania’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to end the commonwealth’s four-month budget stalemate would be shortsighted and harmful, environmental and clean energy advocates say.

Gov. Josh Shapiro and lawmakers negotiating a spending plan are tight-lipped about what is and isn’t on the table. But Republicans, who control the state Senate and have rejected Democratic budget proposals, have staunchly opposed the carbon reduction program.

Now, environmentalists claim, Senate Republicans are refusing to act on a budget as schools and social programs desperately wait for state funding until Shapiro and Democratic lawmakers agree to repeal the regulations entering Pennsylvania into RGGI.

“As the governor himself has often said, this is a false choice between a healthy environment and our economy, and now our environmental champions in Harrisburg, many of whom are standing behind me today, must resist,” Molly Parzens, executive director of Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, said at a news conference Thursday.

A spokesperson for Shapiro said Thursday his office would not comment on budget negotiations. Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman’s (R-Indiana) office did not respond to a request for comment.

RGGI aims to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by requiring the companies that own them to invest in clean energy projects. The multi-state program has been in place in about a dozen mid-Atlantic and northeastern states for more than a decade.

It has cut carbon emissions from power plants in half by placing an enforceable declining cap on the amount of climate pollution that fossil fuel power plants are allowed to emit. Participating states have seen more than $9 billion in investments and it’s projected that consumers will save $20 billion in energy costs as a result.

Former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf entered Pennsylvania into the program in 2019 by executive order. Republicans, who controlled both chambers of the General Assembly at the time, argued it infringed on their legislative authority and argued it amounts to an illegal tax on energy.

The state Supreme Court heard arguments last May from the Shapiro administration that controlling carbon emissions is within the state Department of Environmental Protection’s broad authority to control air pollution. Lawyers for Senate Republicans said the regulations encroach into policy decisions about the state’s energy economy that are the domain of lawmakers, not the executive branch.

A decision in the case could come at any time.

Robert Routh, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said at the news conference in Philadelphia that withdrawing from RGGI before the court’s decision would be shortsighted, as the decision will not abrogate the administration’s ability to regulate emissions.

“Regardless of how the court rules, the Supreme Court decision will affect how Pennsylvania can design rules to control climate pollution under the Air Pollution Control Act, not whether the state can do so,” Routh said.

“And there is, of course, the possibility that the court finds in favor of RGGI, upholds the constitutionality of the rule as currently designed, and delivers a massive victory for Pennsylvanians that will lower costs, cut pollution and create jobs,” Routh said. “I urge people to recognize that giving away this possibility at the goal line would be a costly mistake.”

On the 100th day of the impasse last month, House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told reporters that budget discussions were outside the realm of economic reality in Pennsylvania. GOP lawmakers have objected to Shapiro’s proposal to spend down the state’s budget surplus and dip into its $7 billion rainy day fund, arguing that doing so ignores a structural deficit.

To avoid that, the state needs sustained economic growth, and Topper argued the way to achieve that is by unleashing Pennsylvania’s fossil fuel resources.

“What we have underneath our feet in terms of natural resources would make any state in the union green with envy, and yet we continue to miss our opportunities,” Topper said, arguing that RGGI is the cause of instability in the state’s energy markets.

“We have to get out of RGGI once and for all,” he said, noting House Republicans planned to file a discharge motion to force a floor vote on the Senate’s bill to repeal RGGI regulations.

The same day, House Democrats ratched up pressure on Senate GOP leaders before passing a $50.6 billion spending plan, in a response to the Senate’s flat funding proposal in July. Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) told reporters that Democrats were willing to compromise on “every single issue.”

“There are 102 Democrats that would be heartbroken by almost every one of those compromises, but we will do them because government must be open and it must work,” Bradford said.

Asked whether the openness to compromise extended to the Senate RGGI bill, Bradford acknowledged two areas where his caucus would not budget. One, he said, was taxpayer funded private school tuition vouchers.

The other: “No, we’re not getting out of RGGI without taking care of our environment, period full stop.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dsc_9445-1024x6831762476414.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=zwt-EzqM,N,,2025-11-06 21:01:29.233189

Visit the website of most large oil companies, and you're likely to find a prominent section about sustainability and environmentally friendly practices.","One of Europe's biggest oil companies has had to make major changes to its public messaging after a court found it misled consumers about its supposedly eco-friendly practices.

What's happening?

On Oct. 23, a Paris court found that TotalEnergies, a massive oil and gas company based in France, had overstated its commitment to helping the environment and preventing global temperatures from continuing to rise.

As Mongabay reported, this is believed to be the first time an oil company has been found legally liable for this practice, commonly known as greenwashing.

In 2021, the company changed its name from Total to TotalEnergies and launched a campaign that included goals such as shifting away from dirty fuels to renewable energy projects and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.

But the following year, several environmental advocacy groups filed a lawsuit against TotalEnergies. Among the evidence they showed the court was that TotalEnergies had continued to pursue gas and oil projects across Europe and Africa, despite its eco-friendly messaging.

The court mandated that TotalEnergies remove all misleading claims from its website and had to display the court's ruling prominently for six months, or face a daily monetary penalty.

""It sends a signal globally that the oil and gas industry's common transition claims are misleading,"" Johnny White, a lawyer representing the consumers, told Mongabay. ""From now on, when companies pursuing fossil fuel expansion use this type of narrative, it is neither credible nor legally safe.""

Why is this important?

Unfortunately, greenwashing is a common practice among large companies, particularly those involved with dirty fuels.

Visit the website of most large oil companies, and you're likely to find a prominent section about sustainability and environmentally friendly practices. But the reality is that these companies are among the world leaders in burning dirty fuels and releasing the heat-trapping pollution that has increased global temperatures.

ExxonMobil recently came under fire for presenting a plan to trap and store carbon, as the claims didn't hold up to much scrutiny. In Canada, two large dirty-fuel companies face a complaint over ""widespread inaccurate"" claims about clean-energy practices.

This isn't even TotalEnergies' first foray into greenwashing. Earlier this year, one of its social media advertisements promoting wind energy was banned after authorities found the company didn't properly disclose that it primarily dealt in dirty fuels.

What can I do about greenwashing?

The first step is to understand what greenwashing is and how companies do it. From there, it's easier to spot when a company is doing this performative tactic, and to spend time researching a company's actual practices, before giving them your hard-earned money.

Of course, there are companies that do walk the walk when it comes to protecting our planet. By supporting these eco-friendly brands, you can feel good knowing that your money is going toward those who want to make the Earth a cooler, better place.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TYvck..glA_O4H_sja72lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Nzg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/cabf47db13d0d6e34547e6cd0ea0d099,N,,2025-11-06 22:58:37.886782

Natural gas is the most dominant fuel in the country’s energy mix, accounting for 40% of total electricity generation.
Rio Grande’s Train 4 has LNG production capacity of ~6 mpta, bringing the plant’s total capacity under construction to 24 mpta.","Democrats' pitch on reining in energy prices helped them handily win Tuesday’s elections, with several candidates promising to freeze utility rates. Democrats also notched seats in Georgia’s utilities commission for the first time in nearly 20 years, a clear rebuke of the Georgia Public Service Commission after it hiked electricity rates six times over the past two years. Georgia Power residential customers are now paying an extra $516 per year on their electric bill from two years ago. But Georgia is hardly alone. Surging electricity costs have become a major flashpoint for U.S. consumers across the country, with more than 60% of Americans reporting utility bills as a leading source of financial strain.

After years of relatively stable prices, U.S. electricity prices have climbed significantly, amplifying financial stress for millions of consumers who have been grappling with inflation for years. U.S. electricity prices have surged 36% since 2021, averaging annual increases of about 7% and triple the 12% increase from 2009 to 2020.

But here’s the kicker: U.S. electricity prices are set to continue climbing, with the EIA predicting that residential prices will hit 17.7 cents per kilowatt-hour by 2026, up from 16 cents in 2024.

There’s a method to the madness though, with a sudden increase in power demand largely responsible for higher power prices. After nearly 14 years of stagnation (from roughly 2008 to 2021, with an average annual growth of just 0.1%), U.S. electricity demand rose by 3% in 2024, the fifth-highest annual increase this century.

The surge was largely driven by new data centers in ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) and PJM regions. Last year, the power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies published a report titled “The Era of Flat Power Demand is Over,” which pointed out that United States grid planners--utilities and regional transmission operators (RTOs)--had nearly doubled growth projections in their five-year demand forecasts. For the first time in decades, demand for electricity in the U.S. is projected to grow by as much as 15% over the next decade thanks to the proliferation of AI data centers, electrification of the transport and heating sectors, battery production and high-tech manufacturing in semiconductor fabrication.

According to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), data centers will gobble-up up to 9% of total electricity generated in the United States by the end of the decade, up from ~1.5% currently thanks to the rapid adoption of power-hungry technologies such as generative AI.

Second, America’s heavy reliance on gas-powered electricity generation has exposed the country to higher power bills. Natural gas is the most dominant fuel in the country’s energy mix, accounting for 40% of total electricity generation. U.S. gas prices have been surging, with Henry Hub prices up nearly 60% over the past year to $4.33 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). The EIA has predicted that U.S. gas prices will continue rising, with Henry Hub spot prices averaging $4.90/MMBtu in 2026, up from $4.00/MMBtu in 2025 thanks to robust LNG export demand coupled with flat domestic production growth. U.S. LNG exports are projected to continue growing significantly, with capacity projected to grow by about 75% by 2030 from sanctioned projects alone. U.S. LNG capacity is expected to increase from around 17 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) currently to about 30 Bcf/d in 2030.

And, the large increase in U.S. LNG output might eventually help to tame surging power costs.TotalEnergies’ (NYSE:TTE) CEO Patrick Pouyanné recently warned of a looming LNG supply glut in the United States, shortly after Texas-based NextDecade Corp. (NASDAQ:NEXT) announced it has made a positive final investment decision (FID) on Train 4 at its Rio Grande LNG liquefaction plant with a planned total capacity of 48 million tonnes per annum (mpta).

Pouyanné says the U.S. is building too many LNG plants, which could trigger a long-lasting glut if the projects come online as planned. Pouyanné might have a valid concern. Rio Grande’s Train 4 has LNG production capacity of ~6 mpta, bringing the plant’s total capacity under construction to 24 mpta. Meanwhile, NextDecade has revealed that Train 5 is nearing a positive FID while Trains 6-8 are currently in the development and permitting process. Project costs for Train 4 are expected to total ~$6.7 billion, financed with 40% equity and 60% debt. TotalEnergies holds a 10% stake in Rio Grande LNG.

The Interior Department's list guides federal investments and permitting decisions and helps shape the government's broader minerals strategy.

The administration is expanding the list amid efforts to boost domestic mining and cut reliance on imports, particularly from economic rival China.

LIST GUIDES FEDERAL INCENTIVES

The list serves as a blueprint for Washington's push to secure supplies of materials needed for defense, manufacturing, and clean energy technologies. It determines which projects qualify for federal incentives, informs national stockpiling and research priorities, and signals to private investors where the government sees long-term strategic value.

Officials and industry leaders say strengthening domestic production could help insulate the U.S. from potential supply shocks or export restrictions imposed by competitors like China, which dominates global refining of many critical minerals.

The Interior Department said critical minerals ""underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy.""

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer with seven mines and control of one of the country's two smelters, said this year it could generate more than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act if the red metal were declared critical.

The Phoenix-based company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits, in Freeport's U.S. mines is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. the company's least profitable region. That fact largely explains why Freeport pushed for the designation.

""We're not looking for handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic (copper) production, it's important to recognize that the U.S. doesn't have the same grades that we have internationally,"" Freeport CEO Kathleen Quirk told Reuters in March.

Putting met coal on the list aligns with President Donald Trump's support of fossil fuels. Some U.S. met coal mines have shut in recent months amid ample supply and a reduction in exports to China, which put an additional 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coal this year.

Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said it will continue to seek the expansion of the list to ""ensure that the U.S. has the abundant domestic resources it needs, when it needs them.""",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/White_House_3.JPG,N,,2025-11-06 20:02:48.325039

The changing energy demand landscape and concerns about resource adequacy have prompted some utilities to reconsider or revise prior decisions to retire fossil generation, APPA noted.

As a result, extending the 2024 ELG compliance deadlines will prevent the power sector from rushing to make significant investments in zero liquid discharge (ZLD) wastewater treatment technologies while the Agency reconsiders the ZLD requirements and cost assumptions.

""We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles,"" a government spokesperson told the BBC.
""We will look at further support measures to make owning electric vehicles more convenient and more affordable,"" they said.
Shadow chancellor Mel Stride disagreed with the plan to tax EV drivers and said now was not the time for ""another tax raid"".
The Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT) said a pay-per-mile tax on EVs would be ""the wrong measure, at the wrong time"".","Drivers of electric vehicles (EVs) could face the prospect of a new tax in this month's Budget.

With pressure on the chancellor to find tens of billions of pounds in additional revenue, the BBC understands there have been ""conversations"" within government about the possibility of a new levy on EVs.

A government spokesperson told the BBC: ""Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there's no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.""

The statement follows a report in the Daily Telegraph that the Budget would include a new pay-per-mile charge for electric vehicles from 2028, following a consultation.

According to the Telegraph, EV drivers could be charged 3p per mile, on top of other road taxes, amounting to an extra £12 on a journey from London to Edinburgh. Drivers of hybrid cars would also be charged, but at a lower rate.

The paper says the idea is that owners would have to estimate, and pay for, their road usage for the year ahead. If, at the end of the year, they had driven fewer miles they would have a credit to carry over, but if they had driven more they would face a top-up charge.

Drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles pay fuel duty, so the transition to electric vehicles leaves a shortfall in government revenues, which are already under significant pressure.

Since April of this year, electric cars stopped being exempt from vehicle excise duty, due to a change made in the 2022 Budget.

""We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles,"" a government spokesperson told the BBC.

""It is right to seek a tax system that fairly funds roads, infrastructure and public services,"" they added.

However, the government was still backing the transition away from petrol and diesel, they said, pointing to £4bn in support already given, including grants to cut upfront costs by up to £3,750 per eligible vehicle.

""We will look at further support measures to make owning electric vehicles more convenient and more affordable,"" they said.

Shadow chancellor Mel Stride disagreed with the plan to tax EV drivers and said now was not the time for ""another tax raid"".

""It would be wrong for Rachel Reeves to target commuters and car owners in this way just to help fill a black hole she has created in the public finances,"" the Conservative MP said.

There has been growing concerns about the emerging ""tax gap"" from more petrol and diesel cars coming off the roads, as a growing share switch to EVs.

That has put pay-per-mile systems in the spotlight, but there has been push back from some quarters.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT) said a pay-per-mile tax on EVs would be ""the wrong measure, at the wrong time"".

""Introducing such a complex, costly regime that targets the very vehicles manufacturers are challenged to sell would be a strategic mistake,"" they added.

Edmund King, AA president, said while the government was losing fuel duty revenue, it should ""tread carefully unless their actions slow down the transition to EVs"".

He added car sales indicated that the government's own zero emissions target would not be met this year, and the detail of the proposal was needed ""to ascertain whether these new taxes will be equitable or a poll tax on wheels"".

Car-selling platform Autotrader said the government needed ""to use more carrot and less stick"" regarding take-up of EVs.

Its chief executive Nathan Coe said any introduction of pay-per-mile taxes on EVs would increase their running costs, so was likely to affect demand.

""At the moment, one of the big differences is that whilst EVs do cost a little bit more up front, they are much cheaper to run. This kind of takes some of that benefit away.""

A corresponding increase to fuel duty, that would hit petrol and diesel vehicle owners would ""obviously help"" uptake of EVs, Mr Coe said.

Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: ""It beggars belief that in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis and in the face of air pollution and rising respiratory diseases, the government is looking to hit people with an electric car tax.""

She added: ""Minsters should be making it easier to have an electric car by rolling out more charging infrastructure across the country not penalising drivers with this unfair and short-sighted measure.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IRHb8O3W5sm7QloerGhOnw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/0b5cdf53715fade34439a113f65a9aa1,N,,2025-11-07 00:19:27.778071

At a Tuesday APHA 2025 session, “Meeting the Moment in Environmental Health,” environmental health advocates and leaders shared how they are moving forward with work in their communities.

Denae King, associate director in the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at Texas Southern University, said funding cuts have hindered the center’s partner work.

“Our community partners really developed their capacity,” she said. “They were ready, they were working. … Now everyone’s asking, ‘what do we do next?’”

Despite resistance from the Trump administration, King emphasized that this vital work must continue. Efforts to document and remember the rollback of environmental and public health protections are essential.

“Showing up now is so important because we need people who understand why we did all of that work,” she said.

Challenges to public health and environmental justice are especially daunting for students like recent graduate Saswait Upadhyay. “This is a terrible time to be an early-career scientist ... but I still believe in hope and resilience,” she said.

Updadhyah has found hope and resilience through volunteering at nonprofits. In July, she launched the podcast “In Her Element: Unfiltered Stories of Women Finding Their Voice — and Their Power” to amplify women in science, health, policy and the arts.

Addressing environmental justice also means championing widely supported causes such as clean air and water, said Denise Patel, director of National Organizing for WE ACT for Environmental Justice.

Almost three-quarters of Trump voters and 80% of all voters support increasing federal funding to communities disproportionately harmed by air and water pollution, a November 2024 poll from the Environmental Protection Network found.

Despite what is said in the media, environmental justice policies still have strong public support, Patel said. “People care about clean air and clean water.”

John Balbus, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office of Climate Change and Health Equity, pointed to emerging patterns. First, while many health care and mission-driven organizations are holding firm on their climate and health pledges, others are retreating under political pressure. Fear of legal repercussions and the loss of nonprofit status have prompted some to cancel initiatives, scrub websites or shift focus away from climate, justice and health equity work.

However, the institutions that made climate and health pledges aren’t backing down, he said. They are standing firm because their missions, not politics, drive their work.",https://www.apha.org/getContentAsset/eafc1028-cb7c-4600-bf98-9716ec44e66c/118e6d3e-fe3b-44b1-aca1-a3c96c7e9b93/Teen_environment_2025_375.jpg?language=en,N,,2025-11-07 01:04:26.615963

(Reuters) — U.S. pipeline operator Energy Transfer will not give its Lake Charles liquefied natural gas export facility in Louisiana a financial go-ahead until 80% of the project has been sold to equity partners, company executives said on Nov. 5 on a post-earnings call.

Energy Transfer has been developing the 16.5 million metric tons per annum LNG export facility and has sold most of the expected production to long-term customers, but has faced rising project costs and wants to share the risk with equity partners.

MidOcean is expected to pay for 30% of the construction costs of the facility and receive 30% of the LNG production, or roughly 5 million tons a year.

Energy Transfer is also looking to position itself to further benefit from booming power demand from data centers, mulling the conversion of one of its natural gas liquids pipelines to natural gas.

Blog finds that climate risk rarely causes ECB collateral to be downgraded

In a Friday blog post, the ECB stated that the European Central Bank already factors climate-related risks into the assessment for collateral used when borrowing money from the bank. However, this rarely results in credit rating changes. In its 2021 climate action plans, the ECB made the integration and assessment of climate risks a priority. The bank also expects that climate risk will be factored in to the credit ratings of assets provided by banks when borrowing from the central banking. The blog post, which is not necessarily the ECB, argued that ""while climate risks are widely acknowledged, they rarely result in rating changes."" ""Several persistent obstacles still limit the full integration of climate risk into credit rating."" Both the ECB's own internal credit assessment systems as well as external rating agencies are used to assess climate risk, but neither has had a significant impact on collateral value. The blog stated that when using its own system, the percentage of credit ratings that are affected by climate risk is less than 4%, and most adjustments only affect one rating grade. The blog post stated that in the case of external agencies environmental, social and governance factors account for approximately 13% to 20% of all rating decisions across the major agencies. However, climate change-specific ratings are only 2% to 7 percent of the total. The blog stated that while actual risk might be higher, it is difficult to assess because banks may mask the vulnerability of certain debtors. Risk mitigation strategies can also reduce their perceived risk. Rating horizons tend to be short and medium term, but climate risks are usually long-term. It argued that ""Furthermore reliable, granular data on climate change remain scarce,"" especially for smaller issuers. Reporting by Balazs Coranyi Editing Tomasz Janovowski

Commissioner: EU must protect the car industry against Chinese competitors

In an interview published Friday, the European Union's chief of industry said that it must defend its auto industry against Chinese competition. This includes reassessing its zero-emissions target for new cars, vans and trucks by 2035. Stephane Sejourne stated that the EU also needs to diversify its exports, and create new rules for protecting production in Europe. ""We need to be less naive and bring ourselves up to the level of the major economies around the world."" The former French Foreign Minister told Italian newspaper La Stampa that we are the only continent lacking strategic thinking in industrial policy. He warned ""if we don't intervene, the number of cars sold and produced in Europe in ten (millions) years will drop from 13 to 9 million"". He said, ""We must be flexible in our goal to eliminate all internal combustion vehicles by 2035."" In response to automakers who claimed that a complete switch to electric vehicles is no longer possible, the EU will review the target before the end of this year. Sejourne stated that European automakers should look to new markets and reduce bureaucracy. He said earlier this week that the European Commission intended to announce a new category affordable small electric vehicles to counter Chinese competition, and to revive the internal markets, as part a broader strategic plan to be announced on December 10. The Industry Commissioner also hinted that measures would be taken against Chinese production facilities in Europe. In Spain and Hungary, there are now manufacturers who assemble Chinese vehicles in Europe using Chinese components and Chinese staff. Sejourne stated that this was unacceptable. Sejourne, when asked whether Europe should adopt protective measures, said that ""it is important to introduce conditions for foreign investment in Europe"", and added that tariffs would however create trade tensions as well as hurt production. He said that to reduce the dependence on China, Europe must look at new suppliers, such as Brazil, Canada, and African countries. It should also introduce restrictions on the use of rare earth minerals and increase recycling.

Stocks are impacted by fears of an AI rally and China's trade woes

Investors worried about the sustainability of an artificial intelligence rally led to a fall on Friday in tech-heavy markets. The fact that China's trade data was weaker than expected also shows how much President Donald Trump has been hit by his tariffs. STOXX, a benchmark index of 600 large European companies, fell 0.17% early Friday morning. Meanwhile U.S. stocks were set to open brighter with S&P futures and Nasdaq futures both up 0.3% after a Nasdaq drop of 1.9% on Thursday. The world's largest tech index has fallen 2.8% this week, and if that trend continues, it will be the biggest drop in a single week since April when tariffs were first announced. Since then, the Nasdaq index has increased by more than 50%. China's exports fell by 1.1% in October. This is the lowest performance since February. It has chilling effects on Asian markets, as it reminds them of China's dependence on American consumers. Both the Shanghai Composite Index and China's blue chip CSI300 Index finished Friday 0.3% lower. Japan's Nikkei dropped 1.2%, resulting in a loss of 4.1% per week, the biggest since April.

India's Hindalco exceeds its quarterly profit forecasts on the back of higher commodity prices

Hindalco Industries, India's largest industrial company, beat its quarterly profit expectations on Friday after higher commodity prices offset the pressure from tariffs at its U.S. subsidiary Novelis. Aditya Birla Group, which owns one of India's largest aluminium and cobalt producers, reported a 21.3% increase in its consolidated net income to 47.41 billion rupies ($539.4 millions) for the quarter ended September 30. LSEG data shows that analysts estimated a 45.65 billion-rupee amount. In the quarter reported, benchmark three-month copper and aluminium prices rose by 8.2% and 5.6%, respectively, year-on-year amid uncertainty about U.S. tariff policies. The increase in aluminium prices led to a 15.1% rise in revenue from Novelis, Hindalco’s aluminium recycling division that is slated to be listed and contributes about 60% of its top line. The margins were still under pressure due to the high scrap costs and U.S. Tariff-related headwinds. However, demand was strong, with strong aerospace and automotive orders. A fire at a factory during the quarter also resulted in a charge of $21 million. The domestic demand was boosted by a strong manufacturing sector. Hindalco India's copper segment has seen a 11% increase in revenue, while the aluminium downstream and upstream businesses have grown by 10% and 20% respectively. Total expenses increased 13%, while revenue from operations rose 13.5%. The company has also approved a 102.25 billion-rupee investment to increase capacity at its aluminum plant in Odisha, a state located in eastern India.

China’s proposed emission reduction exceeds the combined reductions of Europe and the United States during the same historical period, he said.
That in turn has made it likely that China’s emissions peak will happen well ahead of its “before 2030” goal.","BEIJING — China is likely to overdeliver on the modest goals the government has set to cut carbon pollution, experts say. The question is whether that will be enough to help the world curb warming?

That’s important ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference, known as COP30, which is being hosted in Brazil and gets underway this week. China’s 2035 goals, a 35-page document submitted Monday, adds detail to the broad targets announced by leader Xi Jinping in late September.

All countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate are required to update their goals, called “Nationally Determined Contributions,” every five years. China’s goals are particularly important for two reasons: It is the world’s largest producer of emissions, which are the main cause of climate change, and it’s the global leader in the production of green technologies from wind and solar power to electric vehicles.

Experts say reduction target is too low

For the first time, China set a specific target for reducing emissions. However, it falls short of what analysts say is needed to meet the Paris goal of limiting average global temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and ideally to 2.7 Fahrenheit, compared to the 1850s.

Xi announced in a video message to a U.N. climate meeting in September that China would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035, and would strive to do even better than that.

Modeling by multiple climate experts shows that China would need to cut emissions by around 30% for the world to be on track to the Paris goal.

“This is disappointing as China has the opportunity to decarbonize faster,” Norah Zhang, an analyst at Climate Action Tracker, said after Xi’s announcement.

Previously, China had not pledged to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. Instead, it promised to reduce its emissions relative to the size of its economy — so they could still grow but at a slower pace than the economy. Its goal has been to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030.

Expansion of green energy is a major focus

Beyond reducing emissions, China’s other 2035 targets include:

Raise the non-fossil fuel contribution to energy consumption from 20% to 30%.

Reach 3,600 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity.

Make electric vehicles the mainstream mode of transportation.

Expand its emissions target to include all greenhouse gases, not just CO2.

Chinese expert says goals are appropriate

Chai Qimin, a member of the group that developed China’s latest goals, says the criticism ignores the difference in development stage between rich nations and China.

“No major economy in history has reduced its emissions by more than 10% within five years after peaking,” he told China Environment News, a news outlet under the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

China’s proposed emission reduction exceeds the combined reductions of Europe and the United States during the same historical period, he said.

The 7%-10% reduction range covers both the best and worst-case scenarios, taking into account growing trade restrictions, threats to energy security and the possibility of slower-than-expected technological progress.

China has exceeded targets before

There is reason for hope. China has a track record of setting relatively conservative goals and far surpassing them.

The rapid deployment of wind and solar energy blasted through a target of 1,200 gigawatts six years ahead of schedule and reached 1,680 gigawatts as of July, according to the National Energy Administration, giving China the world’s largest renewable energy capacity.

That in turn has made it likely that China’s emissions peak will happen well ahead of its “before 2030” goal. Analysts say it could even happen this year.

The one area where it may fall short in is its emissions of CO2 relative to the size of the economy. That figure did fall 48% from 2005 to 2020, exceeding a promised 40%-46% reduction.

But progress has slowed, and current trends suggest it won’t reach its target of reducing the intensity by 65% by 2030.

Reliance on coal is a major question mark

The goals don’t include anything on coal power capacity or generation, noted Ryna Cui, an expert on coal phase-out strategies at the University of Maryland. She said that coal is the likely driver of China’s overall emissions.

The targets do say China will “strictly control fossil fuel consumption” and promote the upgrading of coal power to make it more efficient and flexible and reduce its emissions.

The government has been unwilling to give up on coal, which it sees as a more reliable source of energy, and has even encouraged coal plant construction in recent years.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/11/China.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 08:18:45.569204

The campus, located in the Camp Hall Commerce Park and extending over 600 acres, will process end-of-life batteries and manufacturing scrap to extract metals like lithium, nickel, cobalt and copper for reuse in battery-grade materials.

The facility is strategically designed to support the electric vehicle supply chain, championing a circular-economy approach by reclaiming key inputs traditionally sourced via overseas supply chains. Redwood says the campus will be powered entirely by clean energy, with no fossil-fuel line drawn to the site—a configuration intended to lower the carbon footprint associated with battery-material processing.

By locating the campus in Berkeley County, near Charleston and rail/port infrastructure, Redwood taps into the growing battery-materials ecosystem in the U.S. Southeast and positions the facility to meet rising demand for advanced-battery components.

(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Mark Porter)","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) — A U.S. senator from Indiana on Thursday was among a group of eight Republicans who applauded President Donald Trump’s decision to continue denying China access to Nvidia’s most advanced artificial intelligence chips.

The letter comes a day after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the Financial Times that China was likely to beat the U.S. in the global AI race, later adding on X that “America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.”

Huang has repeatedly made the case that keeping China’s massive base of AI software developers using American chips is key to U.S. success.

Ahead of a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, concern had mounted among China hawks in Washington that Trump would allow Nvidia to sell a version of its flagship “Blackwell” chips in China after Trump said the chips would be part of the talks.

U.S. lawmakers from Trump’s Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party had urged Trump not to allow Chinese access to the chips. Trump ultimately did not lift any export control restrictions on Nvidia.

“We applaud your foresight and wisdom in continuing to withhold America’s most advanced semiconductors from Communist China, which includes Nvidia’s Blackwell,” the group of Republican senators wrote. “As you have said, America is the country that started the Al race, and this decision will help ensure America wins that race.”

The lawmakers who signed the letter were: Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, Sen. Jim Banks of Indiana, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee.

The Interior Department's list guides federal investments and permitting decisions and helps shape the government's broader minerals strategy.

The administration is expanding the list amid efforts to boost domestic mining and cut reliance on imports, particularly from economic rival China.

The list serves as a blueprint for Washington's push to secure supplies of materials needed for defense, manufacturing, and clean energy technologies. It determines which projects qualify for federal incentives, informs national stockpiling and research priorities, and signals to private investors where the government sees long-term strategic value.

Officials and industry leaders say strengthening domestic production could help insulate the U.S. from potential supply shocks or export restrictions imposed by competitors like China, which dominates global refining of many critical minerals.

The Interior Department said critical minerals ""underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy.""

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer with seven mines and control of one of the country's two smelters, said this year it could generate more than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act if the red metal were declared critical.

The Phoenix-based company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits, in Freeport's U.S. mines is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. the company's least profitable region. That fact largely explains why Freeport pushed for the designation.

""We're not looking for handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic [copper] production, it's important to recognize that the U.S. doesn't have the same grades that we have internationally,"" Freeport CEO Kathleen Quirk told Reuters in March.

Putting met coal on the list aligns with President Donald Trump's support of fossil fuels. Some U.S. met coal mines have shut in recent months amid ample supply and a reduction in exports to China, which put an additional 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coal this year.

Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said it will continue to seek the expansion of the list to ""ensure that the U.S. has the abundant domestic resources it needs, when it needs them.""",https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-productionv3-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F8%2F0%2F2%2F3%2F11663208-2-eng-GB%2F168bd9a9372b-2016-04-22T120000Z_1767782483_GF10000391013_RTRMADP_3_CHILE-COPPER-SMELTER.JPG?width=1260&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms&format=auto&height=630,N,,2025-11-06 19:19:21.163428

Texas Gas has a pending rate case before the Texas Railroad Commission requesting a revenue increase of about $41.1 million, proposing to merge several of its service areas across the state. Under the proposal, the West Texas, Central Gulf and the Rio Grande Valley areas would fall into a single statewide rate structure.

The commission, which regulates the utility, held a hearing on the request Tuesday in Austin.

Railroad Commission staff – who recommend decisions to the RRC’s three elected commissioners – supported the consolidation. If approved, household gas rates would decline significantly for customers in other parts of south Texas while increasing for El Paso households.

“El Paso customers face a 27% rate increase to subsidize rate reductions elsewhere,” the city’s lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the RRC.

Texas Gas Service said in filings submitted to the RRC that having a single statewide service area would make it cheaper to file for rate increases instead of having to seek three separate rate hikes.

Texas Gas Service is asking the RRC to approve a 10.4% shareholder profit margin; RRC staff suggested a 9.5% margin while the city of El Paso’s lawyers said the company’s shareholders should only be allowed to earn a profit of 9%.

Texas Gas Service’s rate increase requests “result in rate shock for the residential and commercial customer classes,” Marzi Bolhassani, a financial analyst with the RRC, wrote in testimony.

Parties in the rate case, including the city of El Paso and other municipalities as well as Railroad Commission staff, will submit briefs arguing for or against the rate increase in the coming weeks and the RRC is expected to issue a decision in late January.

SEE ALSO: As El Paso Electric rate increase looms, some say utility is seeking to make too much profit

Texas Gas Service is proposing to raise household bills by between 25% for “large” residential customers and by 27% for “small” households. The company classifies residential customers as small if they use less than 330 cubic feet of gas annually and large if they use more than that.

The El Paso City Council directed the utility to take additional steps to ensure transparency and provide opportunities for meaningful community engagement, the city said in the news release.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerability of long, global supply routes.
For foreign brands that wish to compete in the fast-growing EV market, the logic is straightforward: build where you sell.
The expansion of global brands has heightened the debate around labor rights, economic equity and the role of government incentives.","Subscribe to our free newsletter today to keep up to date with the latest manufacturing news.

For decades, many Americans associated imported vehicles with long shipping routes, overseas factories, and badge recognition that began far from Detroit. But today, that dynamic is shifting. Global carmakers are expanding their presence on American soil, not merely as sales markets but as full-scale production hubs. This trend, led by Japanese, Korean and European brands, is redrawing the lines of what “made in America” means for the automotive industry.

The shift is driven by more than consumer demand. It’s shaped by geopolitics, supply chain recalibration, government incentives, and the growing necessity to localize electric vehicle (EV) production. As international automakers deepen their investment in the US, they are reshaping not only their own strategies but the broader industrial landscape that supports them.

The scale of the transition

Foreign automakers now produce nearly half of all vehicles built in the United States. According to the latest AN 100 report, ten of the top fifteen automakers by US production are global brands, including Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, BMW and Volkswagen. Toyota alone built more than 1.8 million vehicles across its US plants in 2023, surpassing most domestic producers.

These companies have steadily scaled their manufacturing operations across Southern and Midwestern states. Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas have emerged as major hubs for international automotive production. Hyundai and Kia continue to grow their investment footprint in Georgia and Alabama, while BMW’s sprawling Spartanburg facility has become a global supply node for sport utility vehicles.

More recently, investment in EV production has accelerated the trend. Hyundai is building a $7.6 billion electric vehicle and battery complex in Georgia, scheduled to begin operations by 2025. Toyota has committed $13.9 billion to a battery plant in North Carolina, while Honda and LG Energy Solution are co-developing a $4.4 billion battery facility in Ohio.

Key drivers of expansion

Much of this manufacturing growth is a direct response to evolving supply chain imperatives. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerability of long, global supply routes. Semiconductor shortages and shipping disruptions pushed automakers to rethink their distance from key markets. U.S. assembly plants offer proximity to suppliers, reduced shipping costs and greater resilience.

The Inflation Reduction Act has added financial motivation. It links EV tax credits to domestic manufacturing and North American battery sourcing. For foreign brands that wish to compete in the fast-growing EV market, the logic is straightforward: build where you sell. This incentive has become a powerful lever, pushing companies to localize more of their operations in order to qualify for buyer incentives.

Tariff risks have also influenced the pivot. Political volatility, especially between the U.S. and China, has injected new uncertainty into global trade. Establishing U.S. plants allows automakers to hedge against future import taxes and avoid complex customs regimes.

Workforce access and political alignment also matter. Southern states often offer right-to-work environments and attractive subsidy packages. Local and state governments actively court foreign investment with land grants, tax relief and infrastructure support. In many cases, these incentives tilt the calculus toward building new rather than expanding existing overseas facilities.

Implications for US manufacturing and industry structure

The rise of foreign automakers as U.S. manufacturers is not simply a reshuffling of logos, it represents a structural transformation of the country’s industrial ecosystem. Thousands of jobs have been created not just on assembly lines, but throughout local supplier networks, logistics firms and technology partners.

Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers are following these brands to new production regions, building out materials, components and subassembly capacity. Battery plants, chip fabs and software engineering hubs are clustering near new auto plants, giving rise to a next-generation manufacturing corridor.

This growth also forces a rethink of competitiveness. Legacy domestic manufacturers now face foreign rivals with U.S. footprints and deep operational efficiencies. Brands like Toyota and Honda, long viewed as import challengers, now compete on home turf with homegrown operations.

At the same time, local communities benefit from investment, infrastructure and employment—though sometimes with wage structures below traditional union benchmarks. The expansion of global brands has heightened the debate around labor rights, economic equity and the role of government incentives.

Risks, challenges and outlook

Even as momentum builds, the path forward carries complexity. New investment may be slowed by macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and material shortages. Battery supply chains remain under pressure, especially around raw materials like lithium and nickel.

There is also growing political scrutiny. Trade tensions, especially with China, could trigger restrictions that affect multinational operations. Meanwhile, rising skepticism toward globalization in some corners of U.S. policy may challenge the durability of tax incentives and regulatory predictability.

Still, most indicators suggest that the localization trend will continue. Consumer preferences for EVs, corporate commitments to sustainability, and competitive pressures all point toward deeper roots in U.S. soil. For international automakers, being “foreign” increasingly means operating next door to their American customers, not across an ocean.

This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

US Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race in New Jersey on Tuesday, running on a platform of keeping electricity prices down. Environmental groups see Sherrill’s election as a triumph for the Garden State’s struggling offshore wind sector.

Sherrill, a four-term Democrat and a US Navy veteran, arrived on the political scene in 2017 and advocated for offshore wind projects on Capitol Hill. As a gubernatorial candidate, she was one of only three Democrats who explicitly endorsed offshore wind on campaign websites early in the race.

Her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, ran on a promise to ban future offshore wind development. His campaign website sells ​“stop offshore wind” tote bags, t-shirts, stickers, and beverage koozies. Sherrill handily beat Ciattarelli, winning 56 percent to 43 percent at press time.

“In-state produced power through offshore wind and other renewable technologies is the only path forward to ensure carbon reduction while prioritizing price stability, economic growth, and resource adequacy,” said Paulina O’Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, an advocacy group whose work is funded in part by wind developers.

Sherrill will take office next year without any offshore wind projects operational or under construction along the state’s roughly 130 miles of coastline. That’s in stark contrast to the other East Coast states that, like New Jersey, have incentivized offshore wind development through tax breaks and have planned grid and clean-energy goals around the sector’s growth. Massachusetts, Virginia, New York, and Rhode Island all have installations completed or currently underway.

New Jersey’s incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, was once a fierce proponent of offshore wind, but has ostensibly distanced himself from the sector in recent months as President Donald Trump’s war on offshore wind proved, in some ways, insurmountable for a lame-duck governor.

The Trump administration has frozen the permitting pipeline for all of New Jersey’s earlier-stage offshore projects. Atlantic Shores, the state’s only fully approved wind farm, had one of its federal permits revoked in March by the Environmental Protection Agency. Shell, the project’s codeveloper, officially withdrew from the project last week.

As governor, Sherrill’s ability to counter federal anti-wind policies will be limited. But she can make sure the state remains a player in the industry, which is still advancing in nearby New York. In that state, one project, South Fork Wind, is fully operational, and another, Empire Wind, is under construction.

Sherrill, for example, could expand funding for programs that train workers for wind jobs. She could increase legal pressure against the Trump administration for obstructing certain projects, as Rhode Island and Connecticut have done. New Jersey’s Attorney General Matthew Platkin, along with 17 other attorneys general, is already suing the Trump administration over its broad-reaching executive order that froze federal permitting for wind power.

Her campaign promise to freeze New Jerseyans’ utility rates through a State of Emergency declaration on Day 1 and to push back on federal overreach signifies a willingness to come out fighting.

“Governor-elect Sherrill campaigned on the need for bold action to reduce family energy costs. [The American Clean Power Association] welcomes the Governor-elect’s recognition that clean power is key to meeting demand and keeping costs low,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the trade group, in a statement released shortly after Sherrill’s acceptance speech.

In January, Sherrill will take the reins from Murphy, who set New Jersey on a path to building a zero-emissions power grid by 2035 but ultimately failed to generate any new offshore wind power. New Jersey voted on Tuesday for a candidate who aims to keep the state’s climate ambitions alive.

By Harun Kutbe

BELEM, Brazil (AA) - Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said Thursday that Türkiye has formally announced its candidacy to host the COP31 climate summit in 2026 while expressing the country’s determination to strengthen the global climate agenda and serve as a bridge between the Global South and North in tackling climate change.

Speaking at the opening session of the leaders’ general assembly during the COP30 Leaders Summit in Belem, Brazil, Yilmaz said the world is going through a period marked by growing geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, intensifying climate impacts, persisting global inequalities and shrinking development aid and climate finance.

He emphasized the urgency of resolving humanitarian crises, notably the situation in Gaza, as essential for strengthening global justice and sustainable development.

“Climate change is no longer just an environmental issue but a complex global challenge threatening the gains achieved toward sustainable development goals. Overcoming this global problem depends on strong international cooperation,"" he said.

He noted that the “Baku to Belem Roadmap” and the full and timely implementation of the COP29 finance agreement are key to aligning national energy and development strategies with climate goals.

Yilmaz said Türkiye remains committed to turning its ambitious climate pledges under the Paris Agreement into concrete action, adding that the country has adopted a net-zero emissions target by 2053 and continues its green transformation in key sectors.

“As of this year, the share of renewables in our total installed capacity has exceeded 60%. While boosting renewables, we are also improving energy efficiency, promoting low-carbon technologies and circular economy practices in industry, prioritizing rail transport, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles, and expanding the Zero Waste Initiative both nationally and globally,” he said.

Yilmaz recalled Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s announcement in New York that Türkiye aims to reduce its emission target from 695 million tons by 2030 to 643 million tons by 2035 under its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

He also highlighted that Türkiye’s parliament passed the country’s first Climate Law this year, paving the way for the launch of an Emission Trading System, a Green Finance Strategy and a National Green Taxonomy.

“Türkiye has expressed its candidacy to host COP31 to demonstrate its commitment to strengthening the global climate agenda,” Yilmaz said.

“We are ready to assume a bridging role between the North and the South in the fight against climate change and will continue our cooperation with all parties to build a fairer, more resilient and greener world.”

TRENTON, N.J. (November 6, 2025) – Last week, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) Board approved tax credit awards under the Aspire Program to a residential project in Paterson and a commercial project in Secaucus. The two awards represent a collective investment of $93.1 million.

“Under Governor Murphy’s leadership, the Aspire Program continues to advance New Jersey’s broader economic development strategy by addressing critical financing gaps and supporting projects that strengthen communities and drive inclusive growth,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “Through meaningful investments in Paterson and Secaucus, today’s approvals expand access to housing, create good jobs, and build more resilient communities that will spur economic vitality for generations.”

The Carroll Street Houses Project, the proposed development in Paterson, will include the rehabilitation of 88 fully affordable residential rental units across 10, two-story buildings. The rehabilitation of the units also includes Project-Based Section 8 contracts for rent subsidies. The redevelopment will also consist of exterior building and interior common area upgrades, as well as the replacement of kitchens, bathrooms, and flooring. This project is Paterson’s first approval under the Aspire program.

Rising Dove Carroll Street Houses, LLC (RDCSH), a co-applicant, will also provide a number of services to residents, including housing assistance and referral services, employment assistance, computer classes, case management, and assistance with food programs.

Carroll Street Houses was approved for an award of up to 85 percent of the project cost, not to exceed $36.6 million. This project is also supported by Low-Income Housing Tax Credits through the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.

“Today’s approval of the Carroll Street Houses project under the NJEDA Aspire Program marks a major milestone for Paterson. This investment will revitalize fully affordable homes, create opportunities for our residents, and provide essential services that strengthen our community,” said Andre Sayegh, Mayor of Paterson. “I’m proud that Paterson is taking a leadership role in building resilient, inclusive neighborhoods that benefit families for generations to come.”

Meadowlands Logistics Center, LLC was approved for an award of up to 50 percent of the total project cost, not to exceed $56.5 million for the development of a modern warehouse facility in Secaucus. The warehouse will include a 40-foot clear ceiling height, 232 trailer parking spaces, 96 loading docks with capacity for an additional 89 docks if needed, four drive-in entrances, 570 parking spaces, and integrated office space. Planned uses for the development include warehouse operations, light industrial manufacturing, logistics and distribution, cold storage, import and export port services, e-commerce fulfillment, and a data center. The project will also include community amenities such as a public walking trail, a scenic overlook with dedicated parking, expanded sidewalks, and a bus shelter to enhance accessibility.

The property, located at 100 Paterson Plank Road, is identified on the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)’s Known Contaminated Site List. Under the recently amended Aspire Program Rules, the development qualifies as an eligible warehouse project, meaning the project is comprised of industrial space that is predominantly used for warehouse distribution or fulfillment centers for which the developer incurs eligible project cost of at least $10 million in environmental remediation costs.

“Today’s approval of the Meadowlands Logistics Center under the NJEDA Aspire Program represents a new era of growth for Secaucus,” said Michael Gonnelli, Mayor of Secaucus. “This investment will not only create jobs and drive economic growth, but also enhance our community with new walking trails and improved public spaces. I’m proud that Secaucus continues to lead the way in developing modern facilities that support both our economy and our families.”

Aspire is a place-based economic development program created under the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 (ERA) to support mixed-use, transit-oriented development with tax credits to commercial and residential real estate development projects that have financing gaps. All residential Aspire projects must include at least 20 percent affordable housing. As a performance-based program, projects must certify that all commitments established at time of approval have been met before receiving their first disbursement of tax credits.

Platkin and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette announced five new environmental enforcement actions in communities considered overburdened under New Jersey’s Environmental Justice Law and the settlement of two previous environmental justice lawsuits.

The latest lawsuits are against three gas stations in South Jersey, one gas station in North Jersey, and one gas station in Central Jersey, who failed to abide by their environmental obligations set forth in prior administrative orders. The two settlements resolve complaints DEP filed against Sigma Realty, Inc. in 2022 and Martin Service Center Corporation (MSCC) in 2023, owners of gas stations in Ewing and Union City, respectively.

Gasoline is a pervasive pollutant in the soil and groundwater around fuel stations, threatening the environment as well as human and animal health. This contaminant is dangerous for humans, plants, and animals. Human exposure can cause dizziness, headaches, lung irritation, nervous system disruptions, and even damage organs and the central nervous system.

“Gasoline contamination of our soil and groundwater has unfortunately become a ubiquitous issue for property owners across New Jersey, affecting rural communities, suburbs, and cities,” said Attorney General Platkin. “My team is proud to work with DEP Commissioner LaTourette and his staff on these important cases affecting overburdened neighborhoods, and we are thrilled that we have been able to protect the public’s health and care for the environment through these and other cases.”

“The DEP remains committed to ensuring that those who have created an environmental injustice in overburdened neighborhoods, posing risks to human and animal health, are held accountable,” said Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. “Low-income and minority communities have long borne the brunt of these injustices, which is why my DEP colleagues and I thank Attorney General Platkin and his team for their partnership to remedy these wrongs.”

Including the complaints filed today, the Office of the Attorney General and DEP have filed 80 civil environmental enforcement actions in overburdened communities since 2018, under the Murphy Administration. More than three dozen have settled or resulted in favorable court judgements, obtaining more than $31 million in monetary damages and penalties for the State. Most of the remaining actions remain in pending litigation.

Settled Cases

Sigma Realty

Sigma Realty and its officers, Simon and Aglaia Siliverdis, acquired a former Ewing gas station in 1993, and failed — for more than two decades — to remediate known petroleum contamination. That prompted DEP to issue an Administrative Order and Notice of Civil Administrative Penalty Assessment (AONOCAPA) for violations of the Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act) and Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act (Brownfield Act) in 2020. DEP sued in 2022 to enforce the AONOCAPA, which included a penalty of $105,000. In July 2025, Sigma sold the property to a third party, which signed a separate agreement with DEP to complete the remediation and pay outstanding fees. Sigma and its owners then resolved this lawsuit by paying a $117,500 civil penalty to DEP.

MSCC

DEP sought to enforce prior orders, issued in 2020 and 2022, to remove three non-compliant underground storage tanks (USTs) at 417 12th Street in Union City. Soil and groundwater contamination caused by a gasoline discharge persisted on the commercial site for over two decades. Under a court-approved settlement, MSCC and its owners agreed to remove the USTs, remediate the contamination, and pay $125,000 in civil penalties for violations of the Underground Storage of Hazardous Substances Act (UST Act), the Spill Act, and the Site Remediation Reform Act (SRRA).

New Lawsuits

Maybach Assets LLC, 556-564 Springfield Avenue, Newark, Essex County

Before Maybach Assets purchased this property in 2023, it entered into a pre-purchase Administrative Consent Order (ACO) with DEP in which it agreed to remediate the contaminated soil and groundwater known to be at the property. But it has failed to do so. Shortly after receiving title to the property, Maybach stopped responding to DEP and the agreed-upon deadlines for remediation were missed.

The lawsuit seeks to force Maybach to comply with the ACO, remediate the hazardous substances that discharged at the property, and pay overdue fees and civil penalties.

McFarland and Sons, 555 West Union Avenue, Bridgewater Township, Somerset County

In 1993, DEP discovered floating free-phase gasoline product and gasoline-related contaminants in groundwater monitoring wells at the property. After McFarland & Sons’ remediation efforts stalled and DEP incurred costs associated with remediating the property itself, in 2008 the parties entered into an ACO requiring McFarland & Sons to remediate the contaminated site in accordance with the Spill Act, Brownfield Act, and other laws. However, McFarland & Sons has failed to do so, and DEP has continued to incur costs associated with remediating the property. This lawsuit seeks to compel McFarland & Sons to comply with the ACO and fulfill the outstanding remedial requirements in accordance with the SRRA.

This lawsuit also seeks to enforce civil penalties against McFarland & Sons, the company’s owner and president, and a former owner of the property for failing to maintain the on-site UST systems in violation of the UST Act. From 2005 through 2017, DEP issued these Defendants three separate enforcement documents, which were uncontested and became final agency orders. While the Defendants have since complied with the UST Act, they continue to owe penalties totaling $91,200.

ARFA Enterprises,109 Delsea Drive, Sewell, Gloucester County

In 1996, three 12,000-gallon USTs were removed from the property, revealing soil contaminated by leaked gasoline. In 1997, ARFA Enterprises, Inc. (ARFA) purchased this gas station, which had been operating at the site for more than 50 years, and ARFA knew of its responsibilities to clean up the property under New Jersey law. ARFA had begun to do the work when it sold the property to its current owner in 2016. However, its remediation work then stopped, prompting DEP to sue ARFA in November 2017. ARFA soon settled that lawsuit by entering an ACO requiring it to complete remediation by May 2024. ARFA has missed this deadline, completed little additional work since DEP’s first lawsuit, and incurred more than $17,000 in unpaid fees.

DEP is suing to enforce ARFA’s obligation to remediate the property and the areas off-site where contamination has migrated, recover its unpaid fees and costs incurred, and collect additional civil penalties for ARFA’s violations of its previous agreement.

Johnny’s Atlantic, 159 Bridgeton Fairton Road, Fairfield Township, Cumberland County

DEP first became aware of the contamination in January 2000, when soil analysis conducted during the removal of nine petroleum USTs revealed that gasoline had leaked from two of the tanks and from two associated above-ground dispensers. Soil samples contained concentrations of benzene and xylene-group chemicals found in gasoline above the State’s soil cleanup criteria. In June 2000, DEP advised the service station owner at the time, Howard Henigan, that the Spill Act required him to take action to remediate the contaminated soil, which he began, but did not complete.

Thirteen years later, in 2014, Henigan sold the property to Wayne Griner. In January 2016, with the soil still contaminated, DEP filed a complaint against Griner in Bridgeton Joint Municipal Court. The parties resolved the case in June 2016 by executing an ACO requiring Griner to remediate the soil, pay past-due fees of $3,830, and make an additional settlement payment to DEP of $5,200. Since that settlement, Griner has failed to fulfill all of his obligations under the ACO.

DEP is suing to enforce the ACO, asking the court to compel Griner to remediate the property, pay past-due fees, and pay civil penalties.

US Gas, 903 East Chestnut Avenue, Vineland City, Cumberland County

In 1997, gasoline contamination was discovered in the soil at the property surrounding three USTs that were owned by Ross Fogg Fuel Oil Co. Monitoring wells were subsequently installed and groundwater contamination in excess of applicable standards was discovered. After Arshi purchased the property a few years later, a second discharge of gasoline from the USTs occurred. Ross Fogg Fuel Oil Co. and Arshi have failed to remediate the contamination from both discharges. Earlier in 2025, DEP secured judgments in municipal court proceedings finding Arshi and Ross Fogg Fuel Oil responsible for the remediation and ordering civil penalties.

Additionally, in 2023, DEP issued an AONOCAPA against Arshi; Surjeet Sawhney, who owns Arshi; Guru Enterprises, which operated the USTs; and Karamjeet Sodhi, who owns Guru. The AONOCAPA cited these individuals for various UST violations and assessed a $72,400 penalty. It was uncontested and became a final agency order. While the UST violations have been resolved, the $72,400 penalty remains unpaid.

DEP is suing to enforce the AONOCAPA and compel Arshi and Ross Fogg Fuel Oil to clean up the property, as well as any contamination spread off-site from the property, and to pay penalties associated with their failure to perform the remediation.

The company Tuesday released its financial results for the quarter, featuring growth in revenue but also in its quarterly losses. But the company said it is laser-focused on preparing the launch of a new vehicle model called R2 next year.

“We look forward to 2026 and remain steadfast in our belief that R2 and our technology road map will be truly transformative for our growth and profitability,” Claire McDonough, Rivian’s chief financial officer, said on a third quarter investor call.

The fourth quarter is also shaping up to be pivotal for Rivian, which announced a large round of layoffs last month and is grappling with a fast-changing EV demand landscape after federal consumer tax credits were revoked.

Here is what you need to know about the company’s third quarter:

Financial stakes

Rivian’s balance sheet includes increases across the board — a sharp uptick in revenue but also expanded losses.

During the third quarter, Rivian posted total revenue of $1.6 billion, a 78% increase from the same time in 2024. The automaker also posted a loss of nearly $1.2 billion, a 6% increase from the same time last year.

The automaker ended September with nearly $7.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, about $349 million more than a year ago.

Rivian’s reserves are bolstered by a joint software venture worth an estimated $5.8 billion with German auto giant Volkswagen. McDonough said Rivian expects to receive $2 billion from that partnership next year.

Demand shift

The automaker delivered 13,201 vehicles during the third quarter, the most of any quarter this year.

EV demand spiked across the industry as consumers capitalized on federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 before they expired at the end of September. Rivian expects deliveries to decrease in the fourth quarter.

Rivian adjusted the guidance for how many vehicles it expects to deliver in 2025, the second time this year it has altered that figure. The company said it now expects to deliver between 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles, while the company started the year aiming for up to 51,000 deliveries.

In addition, Rivian has had several quarters in prior years where it delivered more vehicles, peaking two years ago with 15,564 deliveries.

The lack of steady growth for Rivian’s flagship — and more expensive — R1 pickup truck and SUV models is why company leaders say the forthcoming launch of a cheaper SUV called R2 is the automaker’s best chance to capture mass market appeal.

Producing focus

During the third quarter, Rivian produced 10,720 vehicles at its sole factory in Normal, Illinois. It’s an increase from the second quarter but less than many quarters in 2023 and 2024.

The factory underwent a 1.1 million-square-foot expansion to prepare for R2 manufacturing, which company leaders said partially led to lower production figures than prior quarters. Executives also cited tariff impacts on supply chains.

R2 will launch in the first half of 2026, and the Illinois factory will have an annual R2 capacity of up to 155,000 units. At a starting price point of $45,000, R2 will be below the average new vehicle purchase price, which is $50,000.

“We’re really bullish and really confident on R2 and what that represents for us as a business,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on the call.

Peach State progress

The bet on R2’s popularity is fueling Rivian’s decision to move forward with its planned $5 billion Georgia factory.

Rivian officials and state leaders, including Gov. Brian Kemp, held a ceremonial groundbreaking in September on the nearly 2,000-acre site in southern Morgan and Walton counties. Vertical construction will begin next year, according to Rivian.

The Georgia factory is expected to be built in two phases, each with a total manufacturing capacity of 200,000 vehicles. R2s, alongside a smaller variant called R3, are expected to start rolling off assembly lines by 2028.

Scaringe said there’s plans to export some of the Georgia factory’s output through the Peach State’s ports.

“We haven’t announced European timing yet, but it’s a really core part of the program,” he said. “It was also a key element to the decision that we made to set up the plant in Georgia, given its ease of export for vehicles going to Europe.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/3e/93e9aa33-36dc-43ba-a583-681baf57a417/690cc74d12e19.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-06 18:18:42.403015

Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado.
But there has also been some concern with it, namely around how it could change the process of forest projects, especially those in a declared “emergency fireshed management” area.
During the last 100 years the Forest Service has consistently embraced suppression as its main method of fire defense.
Land management policies “vilifying” fire have led to overgrowth and climate change continues to impact forests, Duncan said, adding suppression has been a renewed focus this summer.
“Every year the Chief of the Forest Service puts out their fire season letter, and it made pretty clear that suppression was going to be the primary focus,” Duncan said.","A bipartisan piece of legislation that could have big impacts on the nation’s forest land continues to move quickly through Congress, pushing through a Senate committee last month.

The Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate in April and co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado.

The legislation seeks to promote prescribed burns, expand the state-federal Good Neighbor Authority program, increase collaboration among fire agencies and improve reforestation efforts after fires. It also makes some rule changes that could impact how areas designated as high fire danger are managed and how projects in those areas proceed.

“Better stewardship of our forests is not a partisan issue; it’s an imperative to securing a stronger economy, healthier forests, and safer communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I’m proud to see the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act move forward in the legislative process, and I’ll continue fighting alongside my colleagues to enact commonsense reforms that ensure proper forest management, unleash the resource economy, and protect American communities from the threat of wildfire.”

The governors of those four states, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, signed on to a letter in support of the legislation in late October. The bill has already worked its way through the U.S. House, though doesn’t include new appropriated funds.

The legislation has received some support from environmental and outdoor advocacy groups, with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership calling it a “comprehensive” approach to tackling forest health and wildfire issues. The Nature Conservancy and the National Audubon Society is also in support of the legislation.

But there has also been some concern with it, namely around how it could change the process of forest projects, especially those in a declared “emergency fireshed management” area. That’s a Biden-era designation which essentially prohibits projects from exploring alternatives on forestry projects — the only options are what’s called an “action” or “no action.” It essentially shortens the review period for projects within that designation.

Forestry actions falling within that designation are usually small in scope, but the federal legislation would push that number to include projects as large as 10,000 acres.

Even with the renewed interest in prescribed burns and other forestry projects to help with forest health, there’s still a lack of action, said Riva Duncan, the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group made up of former firefighters.

According to Forest Service data, hazardous fuels reduction work across their lands was down 38% in 2025 when compared with the same period during the previous four calendar years.

Federal cuts and Department of Government Efficiency actions caused chaos last winter and some mitigation projects never happened or were delayed. Between the cuts and needs for firefighters around the country, the work just isn’t getting done, she said.

And while DOGE actions mostly spared firefighters, supporting positions around fire mitigation work were not.

“There’s a huge network of specialists and biologists and things behind the scenes that do the environmental work to allow these fuels projects to continue,” Duncan said. “And so they were hit really hard by (DOGE cuts) and by the deferred resignations and things like that. A lot of issues are exacerbated by this administration, who has been very open about not supporting a Federal workforce.”

Prescribed burns can help mitigate risk by removing fuel that otherwise might add to the intensity of a fire. During the last 100 years the Forest Service has consistently embraced suppression as its main method of fire defense.

Land management policies “vilifying” fire have led to overgrowth and climate change continues to impact forests, Duncan said, adding suppression has been a renewed focus this summer. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough.

“Every year the Chief of the Forest Service puts out their fire season letter, and it made pretty clear that suppression was going to be the primary focus,” Duncan said. “And I think when you look at the chief and his background coming from the timber industry, there are a lot of people who have commercial timber lands, commercial timber interests, who don’t like fire, who still will not recognize the value it brings. All it does is hurt their bottom line, right?”

Duncan also pointed out not all logging is necessarily fuel mitigation work and added she’s not specifically against logging; however, saying logging alone will solve the issue is disingenuous.

“A lot of people who want us to log more, want more trees to come off national forest lands, will try to make that argument,” Duncan said. “Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not. Often it’s not.”

Grassroots Wildland Firefighters did submit a comment on the Fix Our Forests bill and she said it’s an acknowledgment that more fuel work needs to be done.

“Fire is non-partisan. It doesn’t recognize boundaries or recognize if it’s private or federal land, if it’s commercial versus being managed for ecological reasons,” Duncan said. “And so we need a comprehensive solution with everybody at the table who has a stake, and everybody has a stake.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/windy-rock-fire-peelee-aug-30-3medic-1024x6491762466026.jpg?h=16f2671a&itok=wscHaFA5,N,,2025-11-06 18:04:10.824749

For multiple high‑priority substances, the EPA has issued legally binding occupational exposure limits—Existing Chemical Exposure Limits (ECELs), and, in some cases, EPA Short‑Term Exposure Limits (EPA STELs)—that are significantly more stringent than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) long-standing Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) and Short‑Term Exposure Limits (STELs).

Where a WCPP applies, owners and operators must ensure that exposures do not exceed the EPA’s limits, even if they are far below OSHA’s regulatory values. As a result, employers may be obligated to implement engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to achieve exposure levels well beneath OSHA’s PELs/STELs.

Quick Hits

The EPA’s Workplace Chemical Protection Program under Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act has introduced stringent occupational exposure limits for certain chemicals that are significantly lower than OSHA’s permissible exposure limits and short-term exposure limits. Employers must comply with the EPA’s limits.

The WCPP framework includes comprehensive requirements, such as exposure monitoring, establishment of regulated areas, development of exposure control plans, and specific respiratory and dermal protection protocols. These requirements are codified in chemical-specific TSCA risk-management rules and operate in conjunction with OSHA standards.

Employers must identify applicable TSCA Section 6 risk management rules, compare EPA limits to current exposure data, and implement necessary controls and monitoring to comply with the stricter EPA standards. Failure to comply with the requirements can result in significant enforcement actions and penalties.

The Legal Architecture: TSCA Section 6 and the WCPP

Under TSCA Section 6, the EPA evaluates existing chemicals and, if an unreasonable risk is found, must promulgate risk management requirements. For several chemicals, the EPA has chosen to authorize ongoing industrial or commercial uses only under a WCPP—a comprehensive framework that includes:

ECELs (eight‑hour time‑weighted averages), and, where warranted, EPA STELs (fifteen‑minute TWAs);

initial, periodic, and additional exposure monitoring—based on personal breathing zone sampling and specified accuracy criteria;

the establishment and demarcation of regulated areas where ECEL/EPA STEL exceedances are likely or possible;

an Exposure Control Plan documenting the hierarchy of controls and demonstrating that feasible controls have been considered and implemented before reliance on personal protective equipment (PPE);

respiratory protection and dermal protection requirements aligned with OSHA programs, but sized to measured concentrations against EPA limits; and

training, notification, and recordkeeping obligations.

These WCPP requirements are codified in chemical‑specific TSCA risk-management rules. They do not supplant OSHA standards; they operate alongside them. Where the two regimes diverge, employers must comply with both—practically, that often means achieving the lower EPA limits while continuing to meet OSHA programmatic requirements (e.g., respiratory protection under 29 C.F.R. 1910.134, PPE under 29 C.F.R. 1910.132, hazard communication under 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200).

ECELs and EPA STELs Versus OSHA PELs: The Emerging Pattern

The EPA’s recent TSCA risk-management rules demonstrate that ECELs and any EPA STELs can be an order of magnitude (or more) below OSHA’s PELs/STELs. Illustrative examples are provided in the chart below.

The EPA’s selection of ECELs/EPA STELs is grounded in current risk evaluations and is aimed at eliminating unreasonable risk to “potentially exposed persons,” a term broader than OSHA’s “employees.” In addition to workers, it encompasses volunteers, self‑employed persons, and some state and local government workers outside OSHA plan coverage. This broader scope helps explain why WCPP limits may be lower and why a facility in full compliance with OSHA could still have obligations to further reduce exposures under TSCA.

How the WCPP Imposes Obligations Below OSHA Limits

Even where OSHA PELs are higher, the WCPP makes the lower EPA values controlling for ongoing uses authorized under TSCA. In practice, this results in several concrete obligations:

Monitoring against EPA limits. Initial monitoring must establish a baseline relative to the ECEL and any EPA STEL using personal breathing zone sampling, specified accuracy tolerances, and a representative sampling design. Monitoring results at or above the ECEL “action level” (typically one‑half the ECEL) often trigger more frequent periodic monitoring and other ancillary controls—even though the action level is not itself an exposure limit.

Regulated areas keyed to EPA limits. Employers must establish and demarcate regulated area(s) wherever airborne concentrations exceed, or may reasonably be expected to exceed, the ECEL or EPA STEL. Access controls, signage (often multilingual), training, and PPE/respirator prerequisites must be enforced for entry.

The Exposure Control Plan and hierarchy of controls. Employers must develop and implement an Exposure Control Plan demonstrating consideration and implementation of feasible elimination, substitution, and engineering controls, followed by administrative/work practice controls. Reliance on PPE is permitted only after feasible higher‑tier controls are considered and implemented. The plan must be reviewed and updated, typically at least every five years, and be made available to potentially exposed persons.

Respiratory and dermal protection scaled to EPA limits. Where monitoring shows exposures above an ECEL or EPA STEL pending implementation of feasible controls, respiratory protection must be provided based on measured concentrations vis‑à‑vis EPA limits. For some chemicals (e.g., methylene chloride), only supplied‑air respirators are permitted due to cartridge service‑life concerns. Direct dermal contact controls and selected chemical‑resistant PPE (e.g., gloves with demonstrated resistance) may also be required.

Training, notification, and recordkeeping. Employers must notify potentially exposed persons of monitoring results, explain exceedances and corrective actions, and document training, exposure data, program implementation, and plan updates. Records are typically retained for five years (longer periods may also apply under OSHA).

These obligations apply regardless of OSHA compliance. For example, a methylene chloride user who reliably maintains exposures below OSHA’s 25‑ppm PEL and 125‑ppm STEL may still be out of compliance under TSCA if exposures exceed the EPA ECEL of 2 ppm (8‑hr TWA) or the 16‑ppm EPA STEL (15‑minute TWA).

Dual Compliance and Enforcement Alignment

The EPA’s WCPP rules expressly acknowledge that they do not supersede OSHA. Employers must comply with both. Notably:

OSHA remains the programmatic benchmark for respiratory protection and PPE programs, medical evaluations, fit testing, and training. WCPP rules generally align with 29 C.F.R. 1910.134 and 1910.132, but the trigger for PPE/respirators is the EPA’s stricter ECEL/EPA STEL.

The EPA and OSHA have formalized coordination for Section 6 chemicals. Information sharing is intended to improve implementation and enforcement and to minimize gaps for worker populations not covered by OSHA.

As a practical matter, employers can expect EPA inspections and information requests keyed to WCPP elements and OSHA to consider the EPA’s limits and findings in relevant contexts. Where the EPA discovers exceedances of ECELs/EPA STELs or deficiencies in Exposure Control Plans, regulated areas, or monitoring, TSCA’s enforcement tools—including daily civil penalties—may apply.

Action Items for Employers

Employers might consider the following guideposts to better effectuate compliance:

Identifying whether any TSCA Section 6 risk-management rules with WCPP requirements apply to chemicals and conditions of use, including upstream processing and downstream use

Comparing EPA ECELs/EPA STELs to current exposure data, recognizing that compliance with OSHA PELs/STELs alone may be insufficient

Planning and executing initial monitoring in the manner and by the deadlines required, using personal breathing zone sampling and specified accuracy requirements, using the results to set periodic monitoring cadences

Establishing regulated areas and access controls based on EPA limits and ensuring entry prerequisites, signage, and multilingual communications are in place

Developing or updating Exposure Control Plans to document feasibility analyses and implementation across the hierarchy of controls, avoiding overreliance on PPE where feasible controls exist

Aligning respiratory and dermal PPE programs to measured concentrations against EPA limits while ensuring proper respirator type selection and training consistent with OSHA standards

Implementing training, notification, and five‑year recordkeeping protocols specific to WCPP requirements

The Bottom Line

The EPA’s WCPP has ushered in a new era in occupational chemical risk management. For several high‑priority chemicals, compliance now turns on meeting the EPA’s ECELs and EPA STELs—values that frequently sit well below OSHA’s PELs and STELs. Employers that have long relied on OSHA compliance as the ceiling for exposure controls will likely want to reassess their programs. Where a WCPP applies, the controlling legal limit is the EPA’s, and the obligation to evaluate and implement feasible controls to achieve those lower limits is immediate, detailed, and enforceable.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14838_2817.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 18:04:40.471750

The agency will next turn its attention to Michigan's largest utility, Detroit-based DTE Energy, which announced a 1.3-gigawatt Oracle data center near Ann Arbor last week.
Unlike Consumers, it is requesting expedited approval of two contracts with the operator, not changes to its rate construction for certain industrial ratepayers.
""Today's Michigan Public Service Commission order adopts customer protections associated with large new loads,"" the utility said.
""Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state’s economic development.","LANSING — State regulators on Thursday approved a new rate-related structure for Consumers Energy’s huge power customers that they said strikes a balance between opening Michigan's doors to mega data centers and protecting existing ratepayers from subsidizing them or footing the bill if they go bust.

The Public Service Commission voted 3-0 to OK terms for users that consume at least 100 megawatts, including minimum 15-year contracts, minimum payments in case all of the electricity is not used, exit fees, collateral and the ability to ramp up usage over five years.

The Jackson-based utility, the state's second-biggest, has just one customer taking that much power — Hemlock Semiconductor, which is served under a special rate set by the Legislature that is not impacted by the case. But with the revised large-load tariff now in place, the company is set to soon finalize a deal with an unspecified ""hyperscale"" data center that is expected to use up to 1 gigawatt, dwarfing usage by Hemlock and other manufacturers. That would be a 13% increase in peak demand across its service territory, which covers much of the Lower Peninsula.

While the order caps a case that began in February and drew feedback from the data center industry, organizations representing business and residential customers, environmental groups and Michigan's attorney general, Consumers will have to go back to the commission for authorization to add the data center and others, which commission chair Dan Scripps said could occur via a special contract or another filing.

The agency will next turn its attention to Michigan's largest utility, Detroit-based DTE Energy, which announced a 1.3-gigawatt Oracle data center near Ann Arbor last week. Unlike Consumers, it is requesting expedited approval of two contracts with the operator, not changes to its rate construction for certain industrial ratepayers. Attorney General Dana Nessel on Thursday urged the commission to slow things down and treat DTE's request as a contested case proceeding.

Before the vote on Consumers' case, Scripps said the state has an opportunity to take advantage of opportunity posed by data centers after 20 years of limited to flat load growth, combined with the need to replace old infrastructure, have ""resulted in a significant increase in rates and affordability concerns becoming ever more front and center.""

The order, he said, ""provides an important balance in suggesting that Michigan is open for business from data centers and other large-load customers while also leveraging those potential benefits of the growth that they represent in a way that's good for all customers as well as the state as a whole.""

Commissioner Katherine Peretick said Consumers will be required to prove that any costs from bringing on a 100-megawatt-plus customer are ""paid for only by the new large load. No other other residential, commercial or industrial customer may subsidize the costs or have their electric rates raised as a result of the new large-load customer interconnecting to the system.""

Shaquila Myers, another commission member, said the agency recognizes that the data center industry is in flux and it is important to be proactive, not reactive, to ensure ""that growth occurs in a way that is responsibile, equitable and sustainable.""

The order allow the customers to seek a one-time capacity reduction of no more than 10%, with a 4-year written notice. Requests to reduce capacity by more than 10% will require commission approval.

Consumers also will be permitted to suspend service to a customer if its usage exceeds its contracted capacity.

""Today's Michigan Public Service Commission order adopts customer protections associated with large new loads,"" the utility said. ""Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state’s economic development. We continue to review today's order from the MPSC and its impact on all stakeholders.""

Scripps told reporters that commissioners had not yet decided on DTE's bid for an ex parte, or speedier, proceeding. The proposed contracts call for their approval no later than Dec. 5.

""We need to be confident that they actually meet the requirements for ex parte approval, and that involves no costs ultimately being assigned to other customers. That's sort of the threshold question,"" he said, adding the commission was working through what it would mean for the compacts if the proceeding went longer. ""We've approved contracts and regularly approve contracts on an ex parte basis. This is larger than any of those.""",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/411983435.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 01:04:15.372407

Both Consumers and DTE, the state's two major regulated, investor-owned utilities, have fielded inquiries from data center developers.
Their executives have floated the potential that data center development could lead to the significant expansion of their electric service.
Tariff case sets course for data centers The Consumers tariff case MPSC decided Thursday was seen as a chance for regulators to set the course for data center development in Michigan.
In contrast, he said commissioners missed an opportunity to require that utilities and data centers undertake early, proactive clean energy planning.","Michigan energy regulators on Thursday approved Consumers Energy's request to develop terms that would apply to data centers and other very large electric users, while the state's attorney general objected to DTE Energy Co.'s request for fast-track approval of its plans to power a data center in Saline Township.

The terms would include provisions to protect people from subsidizing data centers by ensuring the facilities pay for the cost of energy generation sources and transmission infrastructure needed to serve them, the Michigan Public Service Commission said in a press release.

Commissioners approved provisions including requiring a 15-year minimum contract term, exit fees if customers shut down before their contract ends, collateral equal to half of the customer's exit fee and more.

Those measures are designed to help avoid a scenario in which Consumers builds out its grid to service a data center that only operates for a year, leaving the company with ""stranded assets,"" or infrastructure that nobody needs but everybody has to pay for.

Consumers officials are reviewing the order, spokesperson Matt Johnson said in an email.

""Consumers Energy intends to work hard to continue to attract new businesses, including data centers, to Michigan, in a way that benefits everyone and fuels the state's economic development,"" he said.

Environmental groups who intervened in the case said commissioners prioritized consumer protection but did not require Consumers to do clean energy planning specific to data center customers.

""We feel like the commission missed an opportunity to endorse and promote a proactive approach to renewable energy,"" Daniel Abrams, senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center.

Data centers are collections of computer systems that power online activies such as web browsing and movie streaming. Technology companies are racing to build more data centers to supply the expansion of artificial intelligence.

Some have set their sights on Michigan. Both Consumers and DTE, the state's two major regulated, investor-owned utilities, have fielded inquiries from data center developers. Their executives have floated the potential that data center development could lead to the significant expansion of their electric service.

DTE announced last week it would serve a 250-acre ""hyperscale"" data center campus in Saline Township under development by OpenAI, Oracle and a real estate development company tied to billionaire Stephen Ross.

The campus could open in 2026. DTE has asked MPSC to fast-track approval for the data center, which would require 1.4 gigawatts of power, roughly the amount of power it takes to supply 1 million homes.

Some lawmakers have objected to the company's request to bypass the public hearing process.

Michigan Attorney Dana Nessel filed a notice to intervene in the case Thursday, in a press release citing ""significant unknown details surrounding the project and the potential financial risks to utility ratepayers across DTE's service territory.""

""A public hearing is the only way to ensure transparency, give customers all the facts, and confirm DTE's proposal truly protects Michiganders before any approval is granted,"" Nessel said in a release.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, state Sen. Jeff Irwin, and state Rep. Morgan Foreman, all Democrats from Ann Arbor, wrote a letter to MPSC Chair Dan Scripps on Thursday encouraging commissioners, DTE and developers to be transparent about the facility's water usage, infrastructure needs and impacts on DTE customers bills and its renewable energy transition.

""This project represents a major opportunity for Michigan's economy and workforce, but it is important that the community remains fully informed, receives all pertinent information, and has a seat at the table as it moves forward,"" they wrote.

Tariff case sets course for data centers

The Consumers tariff case MPSC decided Thursday was seen as a chance for regulators to set the course for data center development in Michigan.

""While noting that the additional demand represented by data centers and other customers could potentially benefit all customers by spreading out the fixed costs of the utility's electric grid over a larger amount of grid usage, the Commission found that additional protections were necessary to leverage these potential benefits in a way that was good for all customers and the state as a whole,"" an MPSC press release states.

Environmental groups who weighed in on the case had argued for stronger assurances that data centers would be powered with clean energy, Abrams said.

Abrams said the MPSC's order included strong consumer protection provisions by requiring Consumers to model the cost of servicing a data center and show how the facility will bear those costs, not ratepayers.

In contrast, he said commissioners missed an opportunity to require that utilities and data centers undertake early, proactive clean energy planning. The Environmental Law and Policy Center wanted commissioners to require utilities to show more about which renewable power sources will serve specific data centers and meet the state's clean energy requirements.

""At this huge scale for a large customer, if they have clean energy goals, if the state has clean energy goals, locking in their power to be solar, wind and batteries is huge,"" he said.

Lee Shaver, senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which also intervened in the case, said commissioners also missed an opportunity to prioritize large electricity users that are willing to be flexible in the amount of energy they use depending on available supply.

""The process should prioritize flexible loads and customers that bring their own renewable energy,"" he said. ""By taking these factors into account, the interconnection process can ensure a clean, reliable, and more affordable electricity system.""

The project’s focus is on the safe handling and processing of damaged battery materials, underscoring the company’s commitment to protecting human health and the environment. American Battery Technology Company (ABTC) has made significant enhancements to its facility in Nevada in order to process these damaged battery materials and has been receiving large-scale shipments of this material for the past several weeks.

Following a fire at a grid scale battery energy storage system (BESS) facility in Northern California in January 2025, up to approximately 100,000 lithium-ion battery modules require specialized handling, packaging, transportation, and recycling in accordance with procedures being overseen by the U.S. EPA. In Spring 2025, ABTC underwent an arduous audit and review process and successfully received formal approval from the U.S. EPA for its battery recycling facility in Nevada to receive waste material under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). ABTC is now EPA approved as one of the only battery recyclers in the Western U.S. capable of receiving batteries that have been damaged and classified as CERCLA waste, such as battery materials that have been involved in large-scale BESS thermal events and fires.

""This unprecedented cleanup effort highlights the critical importance of building and deploying advanced domestic critical mineral recycling infrastructure capable of addressing the growing challenges of managing damaged lithium-ion batteries in a safe and responsible manner,"" said Ryan Melsert, CEO of ABTC. “We are proud that we have established ABTC as one of the only recyclers in the Western US to be capable of receiving CERCLA materials, and that we have already been processing truckloads of CERCLA material from this project for the past several weeks. This effort is not just about safely recycling damaged batteries—it’s about answering President Trump’s call to action for implementing Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production through demonstrating how U.S.-based infrastructure can rise to return these critical minerals back to the domestic manufacturing supply chain.”

This project demonstrates the critical importance of domestic battery management and critical mineral recycling infrastructure as energy storage systems for datacenters supporting artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity expand across the United States. ABTC's internally-developed recycling technologies can recover valuable critical materials including lithium, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, steel, and copper from damaged batteries, preventing these resources from entering landfills while supporting the establishment of a closed-loop U.S. critical mineral manufacturing supply chain.

The EPA is overseeing the complex logistics of battery characterization, transportation, and delivery to ABTC's Nevada facility. The damaged batteries vary in condition, from intact units to severely compromised materials requiring immediate processing to ensure safety compliance. At current market prices, if ABTC were to process all of the battery materials from the site, the value of recycled products generated from these materials is estimated at approximately $30 million.

This unprecedented operation highlights the growing need for specialized battery recycling capabilities as electric vehicles, grid storage systems, and consumer electronics continue proliferating. The work being done on this clean-up between industry leaders and regulators is establishing safety and materials management standards for future large-scale battery facilities while demonstrating the viability of domestic recycling solutions for critical battery materials.

The United States is ungovernable. Half the population wants a country in which rich white men hold all the power, women stay home to raise babies and bake cookies, and everyone else is ignored or deported. The so-called Red States are so emboldened that they accuse anyone who disagrees with them of racketeering when they suggest that humans should reduce their use of fossil fuels in order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

The current administration is so besotted by its quest for power that it is sending some Americans dressed in full battle armor with masks over their faces to arrest other Americans and throw them into detention centers with not enough beds or toilets and keep them there incommunicado for days, weeks, or even months. Clearly this is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they drafted the Constitution, and would be appalled by what they see if they were alive today.

So let’s start with the premise that the American Experiment has failed, that We The People have in fact been unable to keep the republic we were given by Benjamin Franklin and his compatriots when they wrapped up their deliberation in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787. Let’s put aside all the talk of healing America’s wounds and admit the country is broken. Fine, now that that’s out of the way, where do we go from here?

Popular Sovereignty

I have a few modest suggestions, starting with a short discussion of the transition from monarchs to what has come to be called “popular sovereignty.” In the briefest terms, popular sovereignty is based on the idea that a nation can govern only with the consent of the governed. This was a radical idea in Europe, where entire nations were deemed to be the property of monarchs.

The reason a hungry peasant could be imprisoned for eating an apple plucked from a tree was because all the trees — and their fruit on them — belonged to the ruling monarch. Therefore, eating that apple was stealing from the monarch and needed to be severely punished. That notion was the basis of the infamous Potato Famine that led to the suppression of the people of Ireland by the British.

All potatoes belonged to the King and his minions dutifully harvested all the good potatoes, leaving the rotted, shriveled ones in the ground for the peasants to eat. Those who stole the King’s potatoes were hanged or banished to a penal colony in Australia. For more on this topic, I recommend reading The Fatal Shore by Robert Hughes. It is a history of the founding of Australia, which is fascinating, but the first third of the book describes the horrors the British crown visited on its own citizens in defense of its claim to own everything and everyone in the British Isles.

The United States was founded on the idea of “popular sovereignty.” It is right there in the beginning of the very first sentence of the Constitution — We the people of the United States…..” The people are the owners of the new country, not a monarch, and the government exists only with the consent of the governed. So, does that mean the people — or some of them — can withdraw their consent? Arguably, the answer is yes.

May Consent Be Withdrawn?

Let’s run with that idea for a while. If the people of certain states decided to withdraw their consent to be governed by the central government, they should be free to do so, shouldn’t they? Otherwise, the notion of “popular sovereignty” is just a fiction, is it not? Can consent, once given, ever be withdrawn? Should the consent conferred by our ancestors bind US all forever and ever?

These are not easy questions to answer. Clearly Rhode Island should not be able to withdraw from the Union on Monday and jump back in on Friday. These are momentous decisions that have consequences that will ripple though history for centuries and are not to be made lightly.

For the sake of discussion, let’s assume all the states were given a do-over. Stay or go? Which do you choose? We can assume Texas would choose to be its own country — it pretty much is already anyway. We can imagine that most of the South would agglomerate into a reprise of the confederacy. An argument can be made that perhaps the southern states should have been allowed to secede when they wanted to, instead of wasting all that treasure and human life on the Civil War.

The question is, how far north would the new confederacy go? South Carolina would surely associate with the new confederacy but would North Carolina or Virginia? Out west, California, Oregon, and Washington would form their own nation. As long as we are speculating, would British Columbia affiliate with the new west coast nation? Alberta would be thrilled to align itself with Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. Northern Idaho would want in on that deal, while the southern part of the state might prefer to affiliate with Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and maybe New Mexico.

Oklahoma, Missouri, and Kansas could affiliate with Tennessee and Kentucky into their own nation. The New England states would affiliate with New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. Having lived for a time in Nova Scotia, I heard a lot of people there express a desire to be part of New England as they feel largely ignored by their central government. New Hampshire would be free to affiliate with Florida as the citizens of both states have similar values. Pennsylvania would probably cast its lot with the Tennessee and Kentucky, while Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa likely would do so as well.

Aloha, Hawai’i. Hello, Puerto Rico

Hawai’i, which has chafed at being part of the US for generations, would be free to strike out on its own or join the west coast group as it sees fit. Alaska? Who knows? Could it exist on its own? It would struggle without federal subsidies. Puerto Rico would be welcome to join the northern states, unless it decides to go back to being a Spanish possession.

Is there anyone I haven’t offended yet? Oh yes, the upper Midwest. Could Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin get along enough to function as their own country? And what about Washington, DC? What happens to it? With no United States left, there would be no need for a nation’s capitol. Tear down all the government buildings and give the land back to the states who donated it. It seems the only fair thing to do.

Cry Havoc!

All these realignments would play havoc to many institutions, from the military to the courts. It would also disrupt a lot of trade and diplomatic relations, which would create consternation and confusion among other nations. But what is the upside?

First, the Supreme Court would be no more. The South would be free to appoint a group of Orval Faubus admirers if it wanted to. Everyone there would be free to walk around strapped and blow away anyone who disagrees with them. There would be no school lunch programs, healthcare, or unemployment benefits. Everyone would be required to attend a government-approved church every Sunday for three hours. Sweet Home Alabama would be the official anthem of the New South. Sounds like paradise, doesn’t it?

Progressive states would be unshackled from the Electoral College, which means taker states would have to stand on their own two feet for a change and stop sucking on the government tit. Those progressive states could keep their own money and spend it for the common good as they see fit instead of shoveling it to states where the average level of education is the same as it is for third graders in Finland.

They would also be able to write modern constitutions that enshrine the ideals they hold dear for themselves and future generations. Renewable energy would grow exponentially so that an era of free electricity arrives for the benefit of all residents. Nothing says freedom like controlling your own energy supply and not paying for expensive boondoggles like nuclear power plants that always costs more and take longer to construct than expected.

Stable Government

Perhaps the biggest advantage of a political realignment would be an end to the “push me/pull me” form of policymaking that has been the hallmark of governance in the US for the past 50+ years. China is eating everyone’s lunch because it has stable policies designed to reach long term goals successfully. The US keeps taking one step forward and two steps back with every election cycle.

That may be the primary reason why the country is floundering. Its people have a shorter life expectancy than the citizens of many other countries. Its education system is producing more poorly educated young people every year and upward mobility is just a distant dream.

If the people have the power to choose their own form of government — which is the bedrock foundation for the America — then let them choose to adjust their sovereignty to adapt to a changing world. The system we have now was perfect for 1787 but it is hopelessly outdated for the world today.

Let those who choose a progressive lifestyle design a government that fits their vision, and let those who do not associate freely with those who prefer the good old days. Then check back every 50 years or so and decide who the winners and losers are and make adjustments accordingly. Should freedom involve the ability to choose your form of government? If so, let’s get started.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-5-2025-07_18_49-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-11-06 17:00:20.933410

In years past, buyers often engaged in such purchases on a voluntary basis to achieve their goals to use renewable energy. These days, C&I buyers are turning to direct procurement or self-supply to obtain a reliable source of energy. Sufficient and accessible energy from a local utility may not be available or may be materially delayed or trigger significant capital costs. This is a material change driven in part by increased demand for electricity, including demand from data centers, EV infrastructure and industrial development.

Because of increased demand as well as other local challenges such as limited grid capacity and interconnection delays, C&I buyers may be required to actively seek a sufficient supply of electricity for their operations. Many C&I buyers have gone farther than seeking a long-term corporate PPA and have undertaken to build their own behind-the-meter facilities to serve their needs. Often these infrastructure projects are constructed and financed independently of the operations they support. Co-located generation allows corporate buyers to bypass inadequate resources, accelerate development and construction, avoid grid congestion and curtailment and more directly manage reliability and the risk of outages. Some buyers are also engaging in strategic partnerships to develop additional generation resources to ensure access to energy for new or expanding operations.

A number of US utilities and IPPs have announced the development of additional gas-fired and renewable generation to meet additional electricity demand. Meanwhile, many C&I buyers are still focused on achieving targets for the use of carbon-free or carbon-neutral sources of supply. According to S&P, 10 GWs of the 11.5 GWs in corporate power purchase agreements executed in the first half of 2025 involve energy from wind and solar projects.1 Other corporate buyers have embraced nuclear and geothermal sources to meet their energy needs. There has also been a significant increase in the use of energy storage to manage generation using various technologies in order to enhance resiliency and try to ensure available energy during outages or natural disasters.

Whether and what types of direct procurement options exist for U.S. C&I buyers depends on a number of factors, including the location of the buyer’s physical operations. State regulatory law controls what types of energy sales outside of traditional purchases from a retail utility are permitted. In some states, such options are quite limited. Provisions allowing the corporate buyer to adopt a method of self-supply are common although not available in all states. There may also be space, physical or meteorological limitations at the applicable buyer’s location. In such circumstances, buyers may turn to virtual products or purchase and retire Renewable Energy Credits or RECs.

There have been some recent changes in state law targeting C&I buyers with significant energy needs. For example, the Power Act recently enacted in Oregon directs the local utility commission to create a new customer class for C&I buyers using at least 20 MW and requires such customers to commit to 10 years and a minimum volume of supply if seeking electricity from the local utility. Legislation seeking to address the impact of high-demand customers including data centers has recently been proposed or enacted in Texas, Illinois, Virginia, Pennsylvania and California. We expect this trend will continue based on concerns regarding the potential impact on residential customers. Utilities meanwhile are also contending with existing renewable procurement requirements.

The Lightning is produced at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.

Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.

850+ Chargers, 130+ Sites

According to the company’s Q3 2025 report, the number of available charging stalls increased from over 780 to over 850. The increase is roughly 70 stalls or 9%. The network has 131 sites in 38 states, compared to the 123 sites in 37 states reported three months ago.

Non-Rivian Charging

Simultaneously with installing additional chargers, Rivian is expanding its network to accommodate non-Rivian EVs. This requires replacing older dispensers with new ones.

Originally, the Rivian Adventure Network (RAN) was available only to Rivian EVs. In December 2024, Rivian began opening the RAN to non-Rivian customers by installing next-generation dispensers. You can check out a map of charging sites available on the Rivian Adventure Network here (the white points on the map are compatible with all EVs). The new charging dispensers support non-Rivian EVs, high-voltage battery systems, and have a power output of up to 300 kW.

This process is almost complete now. According to the Rivian Q3 2025 report, over 90% of the Rivian Adventure Network is accessible to all EVs (Rivian and non-Rivian). Previously, the share was at over 40% as of the end of Q1 2025, at 50% in late May, at 65% at the end of Q2 2025, and at 78% in mid-September.

Rivian should be able to complete the switchover to next-generation dispensers at all sites by the end of 2025

Non-Rivian Utilization: Over 40%

One of the most interesting new pieces of information is that non-Rivian EVs are already responsible for over 40% of sessions on the network: “Currently, non-Rivian utilization accounts for over 40% of sessions on the network”. That’s a major win for the company. We don’t know the exact data, but there is a chance that opening the network doubled the network’s throughput by attracting non-Rivian EVs.

NACS Connectors

In July, Rivian started equipping its chargers with NACS (SAE J3400) charging connectors. Previously, it only had CCS1 connectors.

The move follows the introduction of Rivian’s first EVs with NACS charging port (2026 Rivian R1S and R1T). Older Rivians (with a CCS1 charging port) can also use NACS chargers, although a NACS-to-CCS1 adapter is required. The new Rivian R2 features a NACS charging port as well.

The Rivian Roamer website reports that 119 out of 133 stations (89%) are open to all EVs. Among RAN’s charging stations, 20 stalls (or 2%) out of 857 feature NACS (SAE J3400) charging connectors (up from 1% in mid-September).

The company has reportedly reached a multi-billion-dollar supply agreement with South Korean battery manufacturer Samsung SDI, under which Samsung will provide battery cells to Tesla over the next three years.

The deal marks another step in Tesla’s efforts to expand its energy business, which includes products like Megapack and Powerwall that store electricity for later use. With global demand for large-scale energy storage surging, Tesla appears to be positioning itself to capture a much larger share of this rapidly expanding market.

For investors, the question now is what this development really means for TSLA stock. Will the deal reinforce Musk’s “more than a car company” narrative, or will it be overshadowed by ongoing concerns about Tesla’s core EV business? Let’s break it down.

About Tesla Stock

With a market cap of $1.48 trillion, Tesla is a prominent innovator dedicated to accelerating the global transition to sustainable energy. The Elon Musk-led powerhouse designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. It also offers maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial, and various other services related to its products. In addition, the company is increasingly focusing on products and services centered around AI, robotics, and automation.

Shares of the EV maker have gained 10% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. TSLA stock came under pressure earlier this week as Big Tech shares tumbled amid valuation concerns. News that Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, a major Tesla investor, rejected the proposed $1 trillion compensation package for CEO Elon Musk further added to the stock’s decline. Still, the stock recovered most of those losses on Wednesday as dip buyers stepped in.

TSLA stock is struggling a bit again as it has dipped a little over 3% so far today.

Tesla Reportedly Secures Major Battery Deal With Samsung SDI

On Monday, The Korea Economic Daily reported that Tesla reached a major supply agreement with Samsung SDI. The deal, valued at more than 3 trillion won (about $2.1 billion), will have the South Korean battery maker supplying cells to Tesla over a three-year period. The outlet, citing an unnamed source in the battery industry, noted that this marks the largest battery order ever for the South Korean firm.

You might assume that the agreement is related to Tesla’s electric vehicles. Not quite. This supply is reportedly intended for Tesla’s Energy Storage System (ESS) business, meaning the cells will be used in Megapack and potentially Powerwall products. ESSs are vital for storing electricity for later use, helping to stabilize power grids and balance fluctuations in energy demand.

The report highlighted that demand for ESS has been rising rapidly in North America, driven in large part by the wave of AI investments across many companies. With that, Tesla approached Samsung SDI to discuss a potential battery supply agreement. It’s worth noting that the two companies have been in talks for years, with most speculation focusing on Samsung producing 4680 cells—the cell format originally developed by Tesla. Although Samsung is expanding production of its own 46-series cells, the deal with Tesla appears to center exclusively on LFP cells for stationary energy storage applications.

The batteries will be produced at Samsung SDI’s joint venture plant with Stellantis (STLA) in Indiana, which is currently under construction, according to the report. Samsung SDI has recently announced plans to utilize a portion of the plant’s EV lines to manufacture ESS cells, aiming for a capacity of 30 GWh by the end of next year.

When asked to comment on the reported deal with Tesla, Samsung SDI initially stated that “nothing has been finalized yet,” a standard response typically given before an agreement is officially confirmed. On Tuesday, Samsung SDI confirmed that it is in discussions to supply energy storage batteries to Tesla but reiterated that the deal and its details have not yet been finalized. According to industry sources, negotiations are in the advanced stages and are likely to be finalized within the next few weeks.

Diversifying Tesla's Battery Supply Is a High Priority

The deal with Samsung SDI comes on the heels of another major ESS battery deal Tesla signed this summer with fellow South Korean supplier LG Energy Solution for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Currently, Tesla relies solely on cells from CATL and BYD (BYDDY) for its energy storage products. However, the company recently emphasized the need to diversify its supply chain in response to tariffs imposed on Chinese products. Notably, Tesla incurred about $400 million in tariff-related costs in Q3, divided between its automotive and energy segments. In April, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja noted that U.S. tariffs had an “outsized” impact on the company’s energy business.

Tesla’s energy storage division contributed roughly 12% of total revenue in Q3 and has been a rare bright spot amid challenges in its core EV business. Notably, the business is currently production-constrained, specifically in battery supply, yet it has still delivered impressive growth. In Q3, the energy division achieved record storage deployment levels, generating $3.4 billion in revenue—a 44% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Tesla also introduced the “Megablock” energy storage product during the quarter, a pre-engineered, medium-voltage battery that combines four Megapack 3s. In addition, CEO Elon Musk noted that Tesla has ambitious plans for the MegaPack 4, which will be capable of delivering approximately 35 kilovolts directly, removing the need for a 35 kV substation.

What Do Analysts Expect for TSLA Stock?

Wall Street analysts remain split on Tesla, with TSLA stock carrying a consensus rating of “Hold.” Of the 42 analysts covering the stock, 14 give it a “Strong Buy” rating and two a “Moderate Buy,” while 17 suggest holding the stock and nine rate it a “Strong Sell.” TSLA stock currently trades at a premium to its average price target of $385.26 but still offers significant upside potential to the Street-high target of $600.

Putting it all together, the recent news of a potential partnership between Tesla and Samsung SDI is a positive development for Tesla’s energy division and, by extension, for the company as a whole. Essentially, there are two ways Tesla stands to benefit directly from this. If finalized, the deal would enhance Tesla’s ability to meet the growing global demand for utility-scale energy storage. In that case, the energy business would likely continue to grow at a solid pace, accounting for a larger share of Tesla’s total revenue—further reinforcing Musk’s thesis that Tesla is far more than just a car company. The second benefit comes from reducing tariff-related costs by replacing cells sourced from CATL and BYD. This would ease pressure on the bottom line at a time when regulatory credit revenue is drying up, the core EV business is facing challenges, and the company is ramping up its investments in AI. However, it’s difficult to say whether this will have a meaningful impact on the stock, given that Tesla bulls remain primarily focused on AI, robotics, and self-driving technology.

New renewable energy tariff for data centers: Electric utilities would offer a ""renewable energy tariff"" for commercial and industrial customers, allowing businesses to source their power from new renewable energy projects while also not raising rates for other customers.","A new bill in Wisconsin aims to create stronger transparency rules for large data center projects.

The legislation would require public reporting on water and energy use and mandate more renewable energy sources.

It also seeks to protect residential ratepayers from increased costs and ensure construction jobs pay a prevailing wage.

A state lawmaker has proposed legislation to establish stronger transparency rules for massive data center projects that are becoming more common in Wisconsin and stand to transform the state's economy, natural landscapes and energy grid.

On Nov. 6, State Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin announced co-sponsorship of the Data Center Accountability Bill aimed at holding data centers and the large tech companies behind them accountable to Wisconsin workers, taxpayers and natural spaces, according to the state senator's co-sponsorship memo shared Nov. 6. State Rep. Angela Stroud is a co-sponsor.

The bill would require more transparency around water usage and energy consumption, require increased renewable energy sources across the state, prioritize good-paying, local jobs, and insulate ratepayers from the costs of these projects.

As local governments choose to engage and invest in this industry – and as digital technology, artificial intelligence, and data storage play larger roles in our lives and economy – Wisconsin needs a responsible, forward-thinking legal and regulatory framework to steward these changes, Habush Sinykin said in the memo.

The existing lack of a regulatory vacuum has contributed to growing unease and uncertainty at the local level, she said.

The new bill comes as some Wisconsinites raise concerns about energy and water use, environmental impacts and artificial intelligence

The proposed legislation is timely, as more and more people in local communities with data center project proposals are raising concerns that the enormous electricity and water needs of hyperscale data centers will strain local utilities, and drive up costs for ratepayers.

Over the last several months, Habush Sinykin has had dozens of conversations with stakeholders and heard hundreds of questions and concerns from constituents about proposed hyperscale data center projects in their communities, a spokesperson for Habush Sinykin's office said.

Hyperscalers are massive facilities built by large technology companies with vast data processing and storage needs, including Amazon, Meta, Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Recent project proposals in Wisconsin are intended to advance companies' artificial intelligence capabilities.

The flood of calls to Habush Sinykin's office is largely due to a $15 billion AI data center campus project for Oracle and OpenAI in Port Washington, which is in her district. And other areas of her district in Ozaukee and north Milwaukee counties would be home to a new, roughly $1.4 billion, 100-mile powerline project.

""I understand the worry and frustration surrounding the data center’s development in Port Washington, with many constituents feeling left out of the process,"" Habush Sinykin said in a Nov. 6 press release.

""Although the decision to build a data center originates and proceeds at the local level of government, I believe the state also has a responsibility to regulate this emerging industry,"" she said.

How does the bill increase transparency for energy and water use and protect regular ratepayers?

This undefined was developed over the course of several months alongside state environmental groups, labor unions and other key stakeholders, according to the Nov. 6 release.

According to the proposed legislation:

Energy use reporting: Energy utilities would submit quarterly reports to the Public Service Commission on each data center’s energy consumption, fuel mix, renewable generation, and renewable credit purchases. Data centers would issue public reports on water and power usage annually.

Water usage requirement: Water utilities would notify the Public Service Commission if a customer uses or plans to use an amount of water that would account for 25% of the total water usage of all the utility's customers.

Required pay rate for construction workers: In order to qualify for sales and use tax exemptions, large data center projects would need to pay at least the prevailing wage to ensure ""good, family-supporting construction jobs"" and derive at least 70% of annual electricity use from renewable sources.

Building requirements for data centers: Data center owners and operators must certify to the state that the facility has attained certification for green or energy efficient building standards.

Data center fee would fund renewable energy: Wisconsin's Department of Administration would collect an annual fee from large data centers, scaled by size, which would be split amongst state funds for renewable energy projects, energy efficiency and low-income energy assistance programs.

New energy category and rate for data centers: The Public Service Commission would need to clearly define and regulate a “very large customer” class, ensuring that significant energy users like data centers pay their fair share of electricity costs, rather than shifting costs to residential ratepayers.

New renewable energy tariff for data centers: Electric utilities would offer a ""renewable energy tariff"" for commercial and industrial customers, allowing businesses to source their power from new renewable energy projects while also not raising rates for other customers.

What have stakeholders and local groups said about the proposed legislation?

In a news release shared at the same time as the bill's announcement, the environmental policy advocacy group Wisconsin Conservation Voters expressed support for the bill, saying the organization is launching a statewide campaign to ""ensure lawmakers put Wisconsin communities ahead of corporate greed.""

“Wisconsin taxpayers shouldn’t be subsidizing massive tech companies that use enormous amounts of energy and water,” Government Affairs Director Jennifer Giegerich said.

“This is a common sense step toward fairness and sustainability,” Giegerich said. “If data centers want to call Wisconsin home, they need to play by rules that protect Wisconsin families, our environment, and our already established clean energy goals.""

Steve Kwaterski, political and communications director for the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council said, ""We appreciate the senator's leadership to address labor standards, ensure that these projects are being done with local union workers who are getting paid good wages as well as earning health and retirement benefits.""

In a statement sent to the Journal Sentinel, the Party for Socialism and Liberation in Milwaukee and Madison, which has been vocally opposed to the Oracle and OpenAI data center project at city meetings in Port Washington, also expressed support for the bill.

""Transparency from tech companies is critical, and even more important is that working people have real, democratic control over their communities,"" according to the statement. ""The state’s water and energy resources belong to and are stewarded by the people, not exploited by billion-dollar corporations.""","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/18/PMJS/86222365007-microsoft-expansion-0514.jpg?crop=2399,1351,x0,y124&width=2399&height=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-06 16:18:29.530242

""We have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center back up at the right time, but don't have an exact date at this time,"" Ford said in a statement on Thursday. The WSJ report added that General Motors executives have discussed discontinuing some electric trucks, citing people familiar with the matter. The Detroit three, which includes Ford, GM and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, have rolled back their ambitious plans for EVs in the United States, pivoting to their gasoline-powered models.

There is still a chance for the world to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown and return to the goal of 1.5C if governments take concerted action on greenhouse gas emissions, according to an assessment.

The Climate Analytics report says governments’ goals are inadequate and need to be urgently revised. It calls for the rapid scaling-up of the use of renewable energy and electrification of several sectors including transport, heating and industry.

The timing of the report is significant, as world leaders are meeting for Cop30 in Belém, Brazil, where all countries are expected to produce national climate plans under the 2015 Paris agreement. Last week, the Trump administration confirmed the US would send no high-level representatives to Cop30.

How do things stand? For the past two years, global temperatures have surpassed the 1.5C threshold above preindustrial levels set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. A UN Environment Programme report published this week said governments’ current plans would lead to devastating heating of about 2.3-2.5C.

What has Brazil’s president said? “This [summit] is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness … the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region,” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wrote for the Guardian.

Supreme court justices express skepticism over legality of Trump tariffs

The supreme court appeared skeptical of the legal basis of the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariff regime on Wednesday, after justices questioned the president’s authority to impose the levies.

Even conservative justices sounded doubtful of the strength of the administration’s position. “The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” said the chief justice, John Roberts.

What is the case about? Trump has imposed tariffs via the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions – but only during a national emergency.

What happens if the court sides against the president? It would force the White House to reconsider its aggressive tariff policy, which has strained global trade ties.

Zohran Mamdani announces all-female transition team as he prepares for New York mayoralty

Zohran Mamdani’s incoming administration began taking shape on Wednesday as the New York City mayor-elect announced a transition team to help enact what he called the city’s most ambitious policy platform in a generation.

In Queens, the 34-year-old democratic socialist revealed an all-female transition team led by Elana Leopold as executive director. It also includes the co-chairs Maria Torres-Springer, a former first deputy mayor; Lina Khan, a former federal trade commission chair; the United Way’s president and chief, Grace Bonilla; and the former deputy mayor for health and human services Melanie Hartzog.

What are Mamdani’s main campaign policies? He wants a rent freeze for stabilized apartments, free bus service, universal childcare and city-run grocery stores, all funded by increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

What obstacles does his administration face? Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani takes office. New York City’s budget for fiscal year 2026 includes approximately $7.4bn in federal funding, accounting for about 6.4% of total spending.

In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, we co-lead a group of 13 state agencies to identify actions to improve siting and permitting of clean energy projects.

The Clean Energy Council just issued a new report with recommendations for the governor and state legislature, developed with input from Tribes, industry, and interested parties. They address concerns such as limitations of the state’s electrical grid, planning for emerging technologies, and supporting Tribal clean energy projects and local government planning.

State agency actions on clean energy

Washington has already taken many strides to reach our clean energy goals. Our electricity needs are expected to double by 2050 with even more needed for large energy users, like data centers, and more action is needed. Agencies are improving customer service and providing information for developers of clean energy projects and the public on existing and new technologies.

In the past year, Washington has taken action to move clean energy forward including:

Providing funding for agencies, local governments, Tribes, and communities to work on clean energy planning, siting, environmental reviews, and permitting.

Finalizing statewide environmental studies for utility-scale solar and onshore wind energy projects and green hydrogen facilities – and providing tools to use them.

Studying rural clean energy economics.

Launching a collaborative process to identify opportunities and risks of geothermal energy.

Improving customer service and ideas for consolidating clean energy permits.

Building best practices for community and Tribal benefit agreements and developing an environmental justice toolkit for hydrogen projects.

Reporting on the emerging technologies of nuclear fusion and sustainable aviation fuel.

Recommended next steps

Building on the recommendations in the first annual report, the council developed new ideas that further advance the state’s energy policies. Recent changes at the federal level, as well as state and federal funding constraints, will affect clean energy development in Washington state.

Given the urgent need for clean energy to meet the rising state electricity demand, the council developed meaningful recommendations. These could be implemented with legislative direction or funding to enact.

The electrical grid provides clean energy to users across the state but is reaching its capacity in many places. The recommendations are to establish a state entity to develop and finance transmission projects, develop tools for siting and permitting, and improving existing electrical lines.

The council's recommendations include:

Supporting clean energy development through incentives for upgrades.

Promoting Tribal clean energy projects.

Looking at options that do not rely on the electrical grid.

Supporting Tribes with long-term funding.

Engaging Tribes early in actions that affect their resources.

Supporting local governments in clean energy planning and for dealing with emerging. technologies.

Public lands available for energy development could be assessed and tools for engaging with local communities would improve information sharing. A collaborative process for looking at risks and opportunities for geothermal energy has started, but more work could be done to gather data for these types of resources.

We believe these actions will improve siting and permitting of clean energy in Washington state and help meet our goals for a clean energy transition.

Opportunities for input

Our goals include promoting understanding, awareness, and visibility into the council's work. We hold workshops with interested parties and Tribes in the spring and fall to provide updates, hear issues and ideas, and share recommendation ideas. In the summer, we shared draft recommendations for comment and input on the annual report.

TRENTON – Governor Phil Murphy today announced the release of a strategic roadmap for building decarbonization, including recommendations for policy, legislative, and regulatory advancements, along with workforce development and funding strategies to create cleaner, greener buildings that benefit New Jersey families and workers.

The set of recommendations to meet the State’s goals for decarbonization are the culmination of a multi-year, whole-of-government approach among agency experts that included recommendations presented by the Clean Buildings Working Group to reduce the state’s second-largest source of pollution.

Governor Murphy signed Executive Order 316 in 2023, which directed the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy (OCAGE) to develop and release a strategic roadmap to building decarbonization to meet New Jersey’s ambitious goal of electrifying 400,000 residential and 20,000 commercial units by 2030.

“Over the past eight years, we have worked across government to grow New Jersey’s green economy and reduce emissions. This report is the culmination of partnerships across labor, industry, and communities throughout the State – each bringing unique insight and experience to drive the adoption of energy efficiency improvements and emissions reduction upgrades in New Jersey’s buildings,” said Governor Murphy. “Together, they have put forth a comprehensive strategy for lowering emissions as part of our all-of-the-above approach to climate action.”

“With this roadmap, we are releasing a whole-of-government approach to equitably addressing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution from the buildings sector,” said Eric Miller, Executive Director of OCAGE. “The recommendations in the strategic roadmap reflect national best practices and countless hours of work by key stakeholders and government experts to craft an actionable pathway to make progress on building decarbonization.”

The burning of fossil fuels in buildings accounts for approximately 25% of the State’s emissions. New Jersey has taken significant action to reduce emissions from this sector in order to fulfill Governor Murphy’s bold commitment to running the State on 100% clean energy.

The roadmap provides a comprehensive set of recommendations across five themes, with a focus on customer adoption, workforce development, health benefits, and equity:

Decarbonization Policies: New Jersey must accelerate electrification through innovative regulatory measures, enhanced financial incentives, and consumer education.

Utility Regulatory Evolution: Reforms in gas and electric utility regulations are necessary to align investments with decarbonization goals while ensuring affordability and reliability.

Equity and Environmental Justice: Policies and funding initiatives must prioritize underserved communities to ensure equitable access to clean energy benefits and protections.

Workforce Development: Expanding technical training and certification programs and job pathways is essential to preparing a diverse workforce for the growing demand for clean energy jobs.

Experts warn New York could face energy shortages as early as 2027.

Offshore wind offers clean, reliable power and price stability.

South Fork Wind Farm already powers 70,000 Long Island homes.

Upgraded transmission and new wind projects are urgently needed.

This fall, New Yorkers across the state showed up and spoke up to demand clean, affordable, reliable, safe and healthy energy infrastructure during the state’s energy plan hearings. Tragically, the Trump administration is wreaking havoc on our nation’s clean energy progress, making it more important than ever for New York to step up and lead the way to the sustainable, resilient system we need. Right now, we’re not on track.

The state’s draft energy plan proposes to implement a clean grid by 2040, but we need to ensure that New York can meet that reality. The proposed rollout of clean energy resources, including wind and solar, is simply too slow. Political deals could result in the exact opposite: More reliance on fossil fuels to power our homes, risking our health and environment in the process.

Just last month, a new report highlighted significant concerns about the reliability of our electric grid and warned us that we could be facing an energy shortfall as early as 2027. Long Island could face power shortages due to aging power plants, increasing energy demand and transmission constraints. The solution is to upgrade our aging transmission system with projects such as Propel and add more offshore wind to meet the growing demand.

Offshore wind is one of New York’s best resources to boost our power supply, keep energy prices stable, create high-quality jobs, and fight the devastating environmental and health harms that our fossil fuels are creating. Long Island has been breathing smog-polluted air for decades; the longer we rely on fossil fuels, the longer we’ll be making ourselves sick. Renewable energy such as offshore wind, facilitates us to get the electricity we need while protecting our health.

Offshore wind just makes sense for New York since our winds are strong and consistent, and our population centers are on the coasts making it faster and easier to deliver power from wind farms directly to our Island.

Offshore wind delivers power when we need it most. It generates energy throughout the day and produces even more in the afternoon and evening when everyone starts powering up their devices at home. During the coldest months of the year—when energy demand and our bills tend to skyrocket—offshore wind is at its most productive. That helps keep the lights on and keep us warm, and since it displaces the need for more expensive fossil fuels, it also helps keep prices stable.

Facts are important. Throughout this year, 70,000 homes on Long Island are receiving electricity from the South Fork Wind Farm. Temperatures hit 99 degrees Fahrenheit in the heat wave this past June, causing the New York City power grid to have a major emergency resulting in brown outs in Brooklyn and Queens. Thankfully, South Fork Wind Farm delivered power at nearly maximum output, averting any disaster for Long Island residents and kept the air conditioners running. South Fork Wind is proof of why wind works. Projects like South Fork Wind are crucial for a reliable grid.

To become our country’s leader in renewable energy, New York should continue their strong efforts to stand up for offshore wind. New York’s vision of 9 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity, could generate enough energy to power 5 million homes and cut 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the state’s power sector, while creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Now is the time we should be investing in clean energy, building new infrastructure and upgrading existing transmission lines.

“The latest data show that science-driven policy and innovation are moving California closer to our climate goals,” said California Environmental Protection Secretary Yana Garcia.
The 2024 inventory data is not yet final and will not be released until 2026 once all data sources are updated and incorporated.
Livestock emissions, which are responsible for 71 percent of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions, peaked in 2012 and continued to decline in 2023.
The announced plans to end federal monitoring of greenhouse gases will not affect California’s inventory.","What you need to know: The latest data shows California’s climate programs continue to push greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions down while the state’s economy grows, and they highlight the need to continue to make progress despite an unprecedented federal assault on the state's clean air efforts.

SACRAMENTO – The latest edition of the California's greenhouse gas emissions inventory shows a three percent drop in statewide emissions – the third largest annual percentage decrease since tracking began in 2000. The decrease is equivalent to removing more than 2.6 million gasoline-powered cars from California’s roads for one year.

“Today’s milestone once again confirms that bold climate action can deliver real results,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez. “California’s climate pollution is falling even as our economy grows — a powerful testament to the strength of our programs, innovation in clean technology, and the commitment of communities across the state. We’re not just investing in a healthier future, we’re actively building it.""

The drop was primarily driven by reductions from the transportation sector, specifically a dramatic 17 percent decline from heavy-duty trucks due to the increased use of biofuels driven by the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). Increased use of renewable diesel and biodiesel instead of petroleum diesel resulted in a 56% reduction of on-road diesel emissions in 2023.

The latest data underscores a continued trend of steady emissions decline even as the economy continues to grow. From 2000 to 2023, GHG emissions fell by 21 percent while California’s gross state product increased by 81 percent, pointing to the effectiveness of the state’s climate change and air quality programs.

“The latest data show that science-driven policy and innovation are moving California closer to our climate goals,” said California Environmental Protection Secretary Yana Garcia. “Emissions are down; cleaner trucks are on the road and communities are breathing healthier air. Access to reliable data isn't just the foundation of progress. It’s how we hold ourselves accountable and make smart choices for the future. As the Trump Administration moves to weaken national emissions reporting, California will continue to lead with transparency, integrity and results.”

An early estimate of 2024 data, based primarily on reported and third-party verified data for the state's largest emitters, shows that the downward trend will continue. The 2024 inventory data is not yet final and will not be released until 2026 once all data sources are updated and incorporated.

Highlights from the report

Emissions from cars and light-duty pickup trucks reached an all-time low as fossil fuel use continued to fall. This drop occurred despite a one percent increase in vehicle miles travelled. Emissions from the state’s heavy-duty diesel vehicles also declined.

California has decreased the carbon intensity of its economy by 57 percent since 2000.

The electricity sector had its lowest carbon intensity since 2000. Wind and solar represent over 30 percent of generation and in-state solar increased by 8 percent from 2022, driven by requirements under the state’s Cap-and-Invest Program, also known as Cap-and-Trade and the Renewables Portfolio Standard.

Industrial sector emissions declined by 5 percent due to reductions from refineries, oil and gas extraction, cement manufacturing, cogeneration facilities, and other fossil-fuel use.

Livestock emissions, which are responsible for 71 percent of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions, peaked in 2012 and continued to decline in 2023. The decrease is driven by use of methane digesters at dairies funded by Cap-and-Invest auction money and incentivized by the Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

The residential and commercial sector had a rise in emissions, largely because of an increase in residential fossil gas use which was likely due to a colder winter in 2023.

About the inventory

The statewide inventory relies on data from the Mandatory Reporting Regulation, which counts emissions and reductions from about 80 percent of California’s sources of human-caused climate emissions. It uses data from other state and local agencies to round out that picture.

The announced plans to end federal monitoring of greenhouse gases will not affect California’s inventory.

California continues to stand up for science and act on climate

Illegal federal attempts to derail California’s clean vehicle standards will have some impact on the state’s ability to reduce the negative health and environmental impacts of climate change. But California remains committed to addressing harmful pollution and the impacts of climate change. This includes:

Moving forward on the next round of light-duty vehicle emissions standards for the 2030s and beyond. A workshop was held on October 21.

Amending the state’s Cap-and-Invest Program to help achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. A workshop was held on October 29.

Formalizing rules for carbon management. A nationwide list of carbon capture, utilization, and storage projects was posted last month and rulemaking is expected to be finalized next year.

A single Government Publishing Office contract can run into the millions to print something fewer than 20 people will ever look at.
Abolishing the Government Publishing Office wouldn’t destroy access to information — it would enhance it.
The General Services Administration’s operating costs hover around $34 billion a year — money largely spent managing office space and billing other agencies for it.
Cheryl Kelley is a former senior government official with experience across five Cabinet agencies, including serving as director of planning, management and budget.","Imagine a family with 12 children. The parents decide fairness requires every act of help to be billed at full cost. Tying your brother’s shoe? That’ll be $2.50. Helping with algebra homework? $5.75. Folding laundry that isn’t yours? $3.25 per load.

Soon, the family has their fists full of invoices and spreadsheets, and they are waging a small war about who owes whom. They hire an accountant, then an auditor, then a collections analyst. Every good deed now requires a form. The kids spend more time billing each other than helping each other.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is how your federal government works.

We call it “reimbursable agreements.” When one agency helps another, it doesn’t just share the resource — it bills for it. If the Department of Agriculture borrows a statistician from the Department of Commerce, an interagency agreement is signed, funds are transferred, invoices tracked and audits scheduled — all to move taxpayer money from one government pocket to another.

The General Services Administration was supposed to simplify this world. Created to handle office space, supplies and fleet vehicles for everyone else, it has instead become the family’s overworked accountant — tracking who owes rent for buildings we already own, charging rent for desks that never move and sending monthly bills to agencies who, in turn, charge each other service fees to process the bills.

By conservative estimate, thousands of employees now spend their careers managing these transactions that cancel out in the Treasury’s books. They’re trapped in a system that rewards precision about meaningless nonsense. The result is a billion-dollar ecosystem of invoices with no public purpose.

Eliminating the General Services Administration wouldn’t close the office buildings or ground the car fleet — it would simply stop the pretense that agencies must charge rent for property taxpayers already bought. Imagine a single executive order: Share resources, no internal billing.

And then there’s the Government Publishing Office, a living fossil from another era. Established in 1861, it still prints mountains of documents most Americans will never see: bound budget justifications, environmental impact statements, legislative histories. In warehouses across the country, reports stack on pallets, shipped between agencies that already have digital copies online.

A single Government Publishing Office contract can run into the millions to print something fewer than 20 people will ever look at. The irony is exquisite: The agency responsible for publishing transparency is itself one of the least transparent about cost or relevance.

Abolishing the Government Publishing Office wouldn’t destroy access to information — it would enhance it. Every document it prints could just be digitally authenticated, instantly available and infinitely searchable for a fraction of the cost. The same transparency, minus the ink, trucks and 19th-century machinery.

The General Services Administration’s operating costs hover around $34 billion a year — money largely spent managing office space and billing other agencies for it.

Add the Government Publishing Office’s more than $135 million annual appropriation and the personnel hours every agency devotes to tracking, reconciling and auditing these internal transactions, and the total administrative burden easily approaches $40 billion a year in avoidable cost.

These two agencies illustrate a broader truth about bureaucracy: It accumulates, layer upon layer, like sedimentary rock. Each layer once served a purpose. But together, they have hardened into something geologic — a landscape of rules and reporting so thick that even the most dedicated public servants can’t dig through it.

Closing them would not shrink the government so much as liberate it. It would allow thousands of civil servants to return to actual public service rather than managing internal transactions or producing paper that no citizen will ever touch.

The problem isn’t government workers. It is the rituals we’ve built around them. The family can still help each other. They just need to stop sending bills.

This moratorium — combined with Texas securing primacy — effectively places a big red stop sign at Louisiana’s border for new CCS projects.
But an indefinite moratorium on CCS undermines Louisiana’s economic status as an energy leader and sets a dangerous precedent of uncertainty that could kill innovation and job creation.
It is our hope that the CCS moratorium will be lifted as soon as possible, and we can collectively get back to work on policies that maintain Louisiana’s energy dominance goals.
We must send a signal to the state and the nation that Louisiana is proud to be the heartbeat of energy security in America.","Energy security is vital to our country’s national security. America cannot, and should not, rely on foreign sources of energy if we are going to continue to be the leader of the free world.

Nowhere is this connection between energy and security clearer than in Louisiana. When America flips on the lights, Louisiana makes it possible. The Pelican State is also a leader in providing the fuel that powers the world in a safe, environmentally responsible way, and carbon capture and sequestration will play an important role in maintaining this leadership.

Unfortunately, Louisiana’s momentum is now at risk under the recent executive order by Gov. Jeff Landry to place a moratorium on new carbon capture and sequestration projects.

Louisiana was the first state along the Gulf Coast to secure primacy from the federal government to permit and regulate CCS projects, temporarily giving our state a competitive edge to review pending CCS applications with greater efficiency. However, the governor’s moratorium effectively neutralizes Louisiana’s hard-earned primacy status while Texas is securing the green light on primacy.

This moratorium — combined with Texas securing primacy — effectively places a big red stop sign at Louisiana’s border for new CCS projects.

According to Louisiana Economic Development, over $23 billion in carbon capture-related capital investments has been announced to date and over 4,500 jobs and greater tax revenues are estimated to result from CCS-related projects. These projects provide direct and indirect benefits such as job creation during construction and operation, increased property tax revenue for local governments and enhanced long-term viability for existing industries like liquefied natural gas.

It’s also important to recognize the importance of CCS to achieving a more sustainable energy future while scaling demand for American-produced energy. CCS works by capturing the carbon dioxide emissions produced from electricity generation and industrial processes, preventing CO2 from entering the Earth’s atmosphere and reducing emissions without shutting down critical operations.

In short, CCS allows us to safely store CO2 underground while simultaneously meeting global demand for energy products. CCS also strengthens our existing oil, gas and manufacturing sectors.

The current moratorium on new CCS project applications could impact existing CCS projects as well, creating regulatory uncertainty as companies navigate the already complex permitting process. Louisiana has billions in potential investment — including CCS-enabled data centers, LNG facilities and manufacturing and energy infrastructure projects — that are facing new challenges and uncertainty. For example, as companies like Meta establish large data centers across the state to support AI technology, the moratorium on CCS makes many of our private sector goals harder to achieve.

Landry just signed onto a bipartisan letter through the National Governors Association to improve federal permitting and regulatory processes. Among the policy priorities mentioned in the letter, the governors are calling on the U.S. Congress to streamline federal agency reviews, reform the National Environmental Policy Act to broaden fast-track programs and reduce legal uncertainty. Yet, a moratorium on CCS is a large dose of uncertainty for Louisiana that gives other states the lead on attracting new investments.

In closing, Landry could tackle permitting reform, streamlining and prioritization, as outlined in his executive order, without imposing a harmful, anti-business moratorium.

The American Petroleum Institute strongly shares the governor’s goal of addressing the backlog of CCS project applications and supports his efforts to streamline the permitting process around energy exploration and production. But an indefinite moratorium on CCS undermines Louisiana’s economic status as an energy leader and sets a dangerous precedent of uncertainty that could kill innovation and job creation.

It is our hope that the CCS moratorium will be lifted as soon as possible, and we can collectively get back to work on policies that maintain Louisiana’s energy dominance goals. Louisiana must remain competitive with Texas, which is charging ahead with CCS and attracting more investment during this moratorium.

We must send a signal to the state and the nation that Louisiana is proud to be the heartbeat of energy security in America.

Other key criteria include the “ease of permitting and regulatory procedures, transportation infrastructure, workforce skills and quality of life,” explains Site Selection, the publication of the Industrial Asset Management Council published by Conway Data, Inc.

“Texas once again emerges as the national champion for the top business climate in America,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement. “As the eighth-largest economy in the world, Texas offers the freedom and opportunity for companies of all sizes and all industries to thrive. Coupled with the pro-growth, pro-business laws I signed this year, Texas improved the process of doing business to help them succeed in our great state. We will continue to make strategic investments and partner with job-creating businesses to ensure that Texas remains the top state in the nation to do business.”

Abbott highlights other factors contributing to Texas’ top ranking: “the number of job-creating corporate relocation and expansion projects, a pro-growth mindset and environment where enterprise can flourish, investments in workforce development and infrastructure, access to technology and tech talent, and a predictable regulatory landscape.”

Earlier this year, he signed into law a bill that established the Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office. The law directs TREO to help state agencies identify and repeal unnecessary or ineffective rules, determine regulatory costs placed on the public, issue best-practice guidelines for how agencies adopt new rules and perform required analyses.

He appointed TREO’s first director, Jerome Greener who opened TREO last month. A new TREO website and Regulation Evaluation Portal have also been launched.

TREO will help cut red tape and root out unnecessary regulations, and “make ​state government more responsive and more efficient to serve the people and job creators of Texas,” Abbott said.

The U.S. Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database was previously managed by a team at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Since 1980, the program has been responsible for analyzing wildfires, tornados, winter storms, and other disasters that cause at least $1 billion in damage. But it was retired in May, one among several NOAA products and services to get shuttered by President Donald Trump's administration this year.

Now, a non-profit called Climate Central, which communicates climate change science and solutions, has hired the scientist who led the project at NOAA, Adam Smith, and has taken on the responsibility of compiling and releasing the latest data.

Louisiana is one of the top four states when it comes to frequency of billion dollar disasters. Since 1980, those events — mostly tropical storms — have cost over $300 billion. Louisiana was mostly spared in the first six months of 2025, but across the United States, there were 14 disasters with damages costing just over $101 billion in total. Many of them occurred throughout the Mississippi River Basin — states like Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee were among the hardest hit by severe storms and tornadoes, which caused just over $40 billion in damage.

The January wildfires in Los Angeles resulted in approximately $60 billion in damages — making it the most expensive wildfire on record.

Zachary Labe, a climate scientist at Climate Central, said they brought back the database because they “were hearing from every single sector how important this data is for decision-making and understanding areas that are increasingly at risk for billion-dollar disasters.”

Among those who have typically relied on the database are policy makers, researchers, and local communities. It’s especially important for planning disaster relief and emergency management efforts “because they can focus resources on areas that are seeing big trends in the number of billion-dollars disasters,” Labe said.

Bryan Koon, the president and chief executive officer of the consulting firm Innovative Emergency Management, said the analysis is helpful. His company works with government agencies and other organizations to help with disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.

“These kinds of data sets are very important in the broad scope, at least from my perspective, for trend analysis,” Koon said.

In states like Missouri, for example, he said his company and other interest groups can analyze previous billion dollar disaster data on tornadoes and their frequency over the past decade or two. That information can be used to inform how insurance companies write their policy, how buildings are designed, and how notification systems are structured.

“I want to make sure that we, as a nation, wrap our arms around as much information about these things as we can so that we communicate the threat of future disasters for Americans,” Koon said.

The Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative — a cooperative of more than 100 communities between Minnesota and Louisiana — pushed the Trump administration to keep the database open, according to executive director Colin Wellenkamp.

“It was a critical database that showed us where costs associated with disasters were most impactful. What sectors of the economy were hit the hardest by a disaster? Whether it be intense heat, flooding, drought, forest fire, named storm event, or otherwise,” Wellenkamp said.

From a cost-benefit analysis standpoint, said Wellenkamp, the database can tell cities, counties, and states how to spend resources on mitigation to avoid incurring similar costs from future disasters. But industries like manufacturing, construction, and agriculture also want to see the data, he said. That’s because the database’s financial impact analysis includes physical damage to commercial and residential property, losses associated with business interruption and crop destruction, damage to electrical infrastructure, and more.

Other stakeholders that see the value of the database are both the insurance and re-insurance industries.

Franklin Nutter is the president of the Reinsurance Association of America, one of the largest trade groups in the country. The goal of reinsurance is to provide insurance for the insurance companies, stabilizing the industry and playing a role in “the financial management of natural disaster losses,” according to the RAA’s website.

“It’s like an iceberg: the public is made aware of the impact of extreme weather by seeing the graphics (the tip of the iceberg) but most commercial users value the underlying data (the body of the iceberg),” said Nutter by email.

While the billion dollar disaster data is valuable to various financial stakeholders, Nutter said he believes its greatest value comes from providing “public awareness of the increasing extreme weather risk.”

There are many factors that come together to make a billion-dollar disaster — such as weather, infrastructure, population, and location. Labe said that the number of events has been increasing since 1980.

“It's very likely that 2025 will not be the costliest year on record when we look at the statistics, but it definitely falls into this long-term increasing trend,” he said.

Climate Central is not the only organization trying to pick up the pieces of a resource that was shut down by the federal government or is at risk.

Last month, amid growing concerns over the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, the MRCTI announced that it would be partnering with a non-profit called Convoy of Hope to provide aid within 72 hours of disasters for communities along the Mississippi River.

But Wellenkamp said that there aren’t many states that can afford the response and recovery efforts from a billion dollar disaster.

“These [initiatives] are not meant to be permanent solutions,” Wellenkamp said. “These are not meant to replace federal capacity. They are meant to put our cities in a relatively secure position until the federal questions are answered. And the sooner that those answers come, the better.”

For many, the answers will require data.

“Just because the federal government decided they're not going to do it anymore doesn't mean it's not worth doing,” Koon said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66d565b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7417x3894+0+234/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2F37%2F217bc8654d6fbcb76144c431d228%2F2025-billion-dollar-disasters-graphic-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 15:20:38.146409

Saline Township resident Kelly Coleman opposed the data center in her community as well as a roughly 900-acre solar project.","DTE Energy is urging the Michigan regulators to fast track approval of the Stargate data center in Saline Township by December, citing the data center’s target of starting construction by the beginning of next year.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the finalization of plans for the state’s first large data center in Saline Township last week, renewing concerns about climate impacts from the facilities’ energy demands. The Saline Township project is being developed by ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Oracle, and Related Digital.

The data center moved forward after Related Digital sued Saline Township over rezoning for the facility, and the township reached a settlement with the company Oct. 15. Municipal attorney Fred Lucas described the settlement as “the lesser of two evils” in comments to Planet Detroit.

The planned $7 billion hyperscale data center development follows the passage of state tax credits earlier this year intended to lure the power- and water-hungry facilities to Michigan.

“Given the sizable affordability benefits for our customers, as well as the economic impact the project will have, we think moving forward in this fashion makes the most sense,” DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said of the utility’s request for expedited regulatory approval of the Saline Township project.

Michigan AG: Saline data center will affect DTE ratepayers

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel intervened Thursday in the Saline Township data center case and requested it be treated as a contested proceeding, allowing for 180 days from the date of DTE’s Halloween application before a decision is issued by the Michigan Public Service Commission, or MPSC.

In the event of an expedited review, Nessel asked for at least two months for intervenors to review the case and conduct discovery.

“Any action taken in this proceeding will directly affect the economy of this state and the general well-being of residents in DTE’s service territory, and may impact the state’s ability to achieve its renewable and clean energy standards established by the legislature,” Nessel said in the filing.

In an affidavit filed by Nessel, expert witness Sebastian Coppola said it is “misleading” for DTE to state that the electric contracts tied to the Saline Township development will not increase customer rates, and said they will be affected when the contracts begin in 2027.

The contracts proposed by DTE “entail hundreds of millions of dollars of capital commitments which will affect customer utility rates over at least two decades,” Coppola said.

Additional data centers will require natural gas resources: DTE Energy CEO

On a company earnings call the same day as Whitmer’s announcement, DTE Energy President and CEO Joi Harris said “near term data center growth” will improve electricity affordability as the utility sells excess generation.

Bryan Smigielski, a campaign organizer with the Michigan Sierra Club, said DTE’s regulatory filing doesn’t show how transmission costs will be paid, nor does it account for climate impacts from power plants that supply the facility.

“We currently do not have an energy emergency, but it’s almost as if they are trying to create one by not allowing us to do the full planning for renewables,” he said.

The Sierra Club will push for full transparency around the project and potentially a contested case for DTE’s filing, Smigielski said.

Harris said on the earnings call that a data center, matching the description of the Saline Township site, would use 1.4 gigawatts of energy, equivalent to 25% of the utility’s entire energy load. DTE is in “late-stage negotiations” with data center developers that could drive a further 3 GW of load growth, with a pipeline of 3 to 4 GW beyond this.

The Saline Township project will be supported by battery storage, paid for by the data center customer, and will not require new fossil fuel generation, the DTE CEO said.

Additional data centers will require more generation, and the utility will propose the replacement of its massive Monroe coal plant with natural gas generation, she said.

“Any new data center load that we bring on after this 1.4 gigawatts will require additional resources,” Harris said, adding a project in the 1-gigawatt range would require a “combined cycle,” referring to a combined cycle gas plant.

Consumers Energy has 1-2 GW of data centers in the final stage of negotiations, 4-5 GW in “advanced” discussions, and a total pipeline of 9 GW in projects, according to a presentation from the utility’s earnings call last week.

The projects will mean “more renewables, battery storage, and natural gas generation to meet growing demand,” said Garrick Rochow, president and CEO of CMS Energy and its subsidiary Consumers Energy.

Data center demand could allow utility to ‘opt out’ of climate law

Data centers’ expected energy demands could trigger an “off ramp” in Michigan’s 2023 renewable energy law that allows utilities to keep fossil fuel generation online if there’s not enough capacity to meet demand, environmental advocates said. The climate law otherwise requires utilities to meet a goal of 100% renewable energy generation by 2040.

“If this build out of data centers happens across the state, it is going to enable companies like DTE and Consumers to opt out of clean energy standards,” Sean McBrearty, Michigan director for the nonprofit Clean Water Action, told Planet Detroit. “They’ll get to build more gas plants (and) charge Michigan ratepayers.”

The Saline Township data center and other Michigan projects have met widespread resistance over concerns the projects could hike residents’ utility bills and imperil water resources.

DTE’s Wilmot said a combined cycle natural gas plant with carbon capture and storage, or CCS, is one technology the utility was considering for future generation needs.

Consumers spokesperson Matt Johnson didn’t directly answer a question on whether the utility is considering CCS for future gas plants. Consumers will develop “new resources and technologies, and deliberate planning, all in line with Michigan’s 2030 energy law and without compromising our sustainability goals,” he said.

Michigan classifies CCS as “clean energy” if it captures 90% of gas plant carbon emissions, although advocates raised concerns with Planet Detroit about its cost, effectiveness, and safety.

How data centers could drive gas generation, pollution

The Consumers and DTE data center plans could change the trajectory of energy generation in the state and make it more cost-effective to keep fossil fuel generation online or increase production from natural gas plants, Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer at the Michigan Environmental Council, said.

Batteries at the Saline Township site will utilize DTE’s existing energy mix, including gas and coal, and could cause the company to run its Belle River gas plant more, she said. Belle River is a “peaking” power plant, meaning it operates during times of high demand.

DTE and Consumers didn’t directly answer questions on whether peaking plants will operate more often to meet data centers energy needs.

Jameson also expressed concern about the proposal to turn Monroe into a gas plant, saying it could be replaced with batteries and renewables.

Investor-owned utilities may be incentivized to build large projects like gas plants because companies can earn their return on equity on infrastructure investments. This means DTE shareholders can earn the company’s roughly 10% rate of return on a portion of the cost of these projects, which is paid by customers.

“We can’t find a bigger capital project than building a huge gas plant,” she said, adding that the company has affiliates with an interest in prolonging natural gas use.

More gas generation could increase air pollutants like nitrogen oxides, Jameson said. Nitrogen oxide exposure can aggravate respiratory diseases, especially asthma and, over long periods of time, lead to the development of asthma and increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Dr. Larry Junck, a neurologist and member of the board of directors for the group Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, told Planet Detroit that more gas generation in the state will add carbon pollution and contribute to climate change-related health impacts.

Is carbon capture a solution for data center climate concerns?

Environmental advocates question the feasibility of carbon capture and storage as a solution to the climate conundrum posed by data centers, and express concerns about its cost, efficiency, and safety.

“Permitting doesn’t account for the energy penalty of carbon capture,” said the Michigan Environmental Council’s Jameson, adding that regulators needed to consider the additional emissions created by capturing carbon from a power plant.

CCS increases the fuel requirement for a natural gas combined cycle plant by 11%-22%, according to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.

Ratepayers could also be left paying for the stranded costs of CCS gas plants if they don’t function as intended, Jameson said.

A 2023 report from the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Fiscal Analysis refers to CCS as an “expensive and unproven technology,” finding that no CCS project successfully captured more than 80% of carbon emissions.

“There’s a short track record on CCS … however, the track record that it has is pretty concerning,” said Clean Water Action’s McBrearty.

He called attention to the 2020 gas leak from a CCS pipeline in Satartia, Mississippi, which led to the hospitalization of nearly 50 people, according to a report in the Huffington Post.

Public officials could take steps to avoid the problems associated with fossil fuel use and CCS, McBrearty said.

A resolution adopted by the Washtenaw County Commission in September urges local governments to require data centers to source 100% of energy from wind, solar, battery, or geothermal sources, among other provisions.

“It’s a pretty easy fix, especially when you consider that the companies that want to operate these mega data centers are some of the most profitable companies in the world,” McBrearty said.

Building out more solar to power data centers could add to the strain in communities where some residents oppose large solar developments as well as data centers.

Saline Township resident Kelly Coleman opposed the data center in her community as well as a roughly 900-acre solar project. The developments will take up too much of the township’s agricultural land, Coleman said, adding that she would be willing to accept a smaller project.

“It’s like a giant ball that just keeps rolling and growing once you need more renewable energy for these data centers,” she said. “How many farm fields is that? How many acres is that to produce just for that one building?”

Nancy Pelosi Announces She Will Not Run for Another Term

Former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announced this morning that she will not run for a new term–essentially ending her 38-year career as a congresswoman.

The trailblazing politician made the announcement in a video titled “Dear San Francisco,” which highlighted not only her accomplishments on Capitol Hill, but how those policies reverberated in her congressional district.

Since winning election in 1987, Pelosi’s tenure is punctuated by landmark moments, like when she became the first woman to be appointed Speaker of the House, and key legislative wins, like security federal funding for AIDS and HIV research and helping get the Affordable Care Act passed in congress.

Pelosi was likely to face a number of challengers if she was seeking re-election–candidates are likely to face off against one another, now that she is retiring when her term ends.

In late October, California State Senator, Scott Weiner, announced his intentions to run for Pelosi’s seat in the 2026 mid-term elections.

This decision comes amid scrutiny from the Ways and Means Committee into whether the organization failed to operate within its stated tax-exempt purpose by illegally contributing millions to Abrams failed 2018 gubernatorial bid. In March of this year, Chairman Smith called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to revoke the organization’s tax-exempt status.

Chairman Smith said, “The entire world watched Stacey Abrams turn her twice-failed gubernatorial campaign into a grift to enrich herself in the name of Democrat ‘Get Out the Vote’ and ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ efforts. The New Georgia Project’s decision to dissolve further confirms the Ways and Means Committee and Georgia State Ethics Commission’s findings that the organization broke the law when it failed to disclose more than $7 million in illegal contributions and expenditures designed to prop up Abrams’s failed 2018 campaign.

“This decision also raises further questions about whether Abrams or other organizations she is linked to have engaged in illegal activity. The Department of Justice should take a close look at every Abrams linked non-profit, especially given recent discoveries that Joe Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency awarded $2 billion to a group with ties to Abrams.”

In addition to the New Georgia Project, the Ways and Means Committee is investigating the United States’s tax-exempt sector writ large. Last month, Chairman Smith called on the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of eight organizations the Committee’s investigation confirmed are linked to designated foreign terrorist groups or acted to fuel violence and unrest in the United States.

This Week’s Drought Summary

Heavy precipitation again doused the Pacific Northwest, especially across the northern half of the Cascades and along the Washington and northern Oregon Coast. Between 6 and 10 inches of precipitation fell on most of northwesternmost Washington, and 6 to 8 inches fell on most of the northern Washington Cascades and a few areas near the Washington/Oregon border and along the northwestern Oregon Coast. From central Oregon northward, over 3 inches fell on the Cascades and coastal areas while 1.5 to 3.0 inches fell on other locations there from the Cascade Foothills to the Pacific Ocean. Farther east, locally heavy precipitation (1 to locally approaching 4 inches) was observed in northwestern Montana and northern Idaho. Other locations from the Great Plains westward to the Pacific Ocean were much drier, with most locations recording no measurable precipitation. Across the eastern half of the country, moderate to heavy precipitation (1 to locally 4 inches) fell on most of the Northeast, with the heaviest amounts falling on northern New York and in a swath from southwestern New England and the New York City area northward through northeastern New York and adjacent Vermont. Areas around the Outer Banks of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia also recorded heavy precipitation (2 to 4 inches) while amounts ranged from 1 to 3 inches in most of central and eastern Maine, New Jersey, central and eastern Pennsylvania, parts of the Mid-Atlantic region, and across Kentucky, most of Tennessee, and the adjacent Ohio and Mississippi Valleys. The west side of the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley recorded generally 0.5 to locally 2.0 inches of precipitation, similar to totals reported across the upper Southeast, the central Carolinas, the central Appalachians, and the Upper Ohio Valley. In contrast, little or no precipitation was also observed across most of the Lower Mississippi Valley, near the central and eastern Gulf Coast, over the South Atlantic region from South Carolina through southern Florida, and through the Great Lakes region and adjacent portions of the Midwest.

These conditions led to broad areas of improvement across the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic region, most of the Carolinas, the central and southern Appalachians, the Ohio Valley, portions of the Middle Mississippi Valley and adjacent Lower Mississippi Valley, a few parts of the central and northern Rockies and southern California, and portions of the Pacific Northwest, where the heavy precipitation did not improve moisture shortages as much as might be expected due to quickly-increasing normal at this time of year. Meanwhile, after the prior week’s beneficial precipitation, low precipitation totals this past week allowed for broad areas of intensification or re-intensification of dryness and drought over most of Texas, southern Oklahoma, the northern Great Lakes, parts of the northern Great Plains, portions of the central High Plains, north-central Montana, and central Maui. A few areas of deterioration were also introduced from southern South Carolina through southern Florida and through parts of the Virginia Piedmont…

High Plains

The High Plains Region is currently the Region least-affected by dryness and drought even though coverage in sum increased slightly this past week when most of the region reported a few tenths of an inch of precipitation at best. Measurable totals were restricted to eastern Kansas and southeastern Nebraska. The dry week induced a few areas of deterioration, but even so, less than 39 percent of the Region is experiencing some degree of dryness (D0+), and only 17.8 percent is enduring drought (D1+). Precipitation deficits on most time frames crept upward Region-wide, but areas of deterioration were relatively limited given the relatively low natural and human water demand this time of year…

West

Several inches of precipitation pelted central and northern sections of the Cascades and coastal Pacific Northwest, and 1 to 3 inch totals were common across northwestern Montana and northern Idaho, as well as the lower elevations in the Pacific Northwest between the coast and the Cascades. Several tenths of an inch of precipitation were reported farther south along the West Coast and in the lower elevations of the northern Intermountain West, but most of the West Region received no measurable precipitation for the week. This prompted areas of intensification in north-central Montana and southeastern New Mexico while the heavy precipitation led to areas of improvement in the Pacific Northwest. But given how early it is in the wet season and that normals are ramping upward fairly quickly there, improvement in dryness and drought was not as widespread as one might assume. Drought coverage (D1+) in Washington was unchanged from the prior week at 94.8 percent, and the extent of the more intense drought classifications (D2-D4) declined only slightly from 65.1 to 63.9 percent. There was even less change in Oregon, although dryness there is not as widespread as in Washington. Montana reported intensification in north-central parts of the state, but a little improvement farther west, as was the case in the fringes of the D3 and D4 areas in Idaho. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, flows along numerous rivers in the West remain very low. On the Missouri River at Great Falls, MT, in early November, streamflow was observed at 3,620 cubic feet per second, well below the mean for the date since the turn of the century (4,934 cubic feet per second, ranging from 3,880 in 2021 up to 6,470 in 2010). On the Firehole River, near West Yellowstone, MT, streamflow was 212 cubic feet per second in early November, below the 2002-2024 mean of 272 for similar dates, which ranged from 236 in 2022 to 318 in 2008. These amounts are up slightly since late summer. In late August, a field measurement of 193 cubic feet per second was bested only by 192 in early August 2016…

South

Moderate to heavy rain (1 to 3 inches) doused Tennessee, portions of Arkansas, and some adjacent areas last week. Dryness and drought over western Tennessee and much of Arkansas eased a bit as a result. Most other locations across Tennessee, Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, and northern Mississippi reported several tenths of an inch of rain, and similar totals fell on isolated areas across southern Mississippi, Louisiana, and coastal Texas. The remainder of the Region, including most of Texas and Oklahoma, observed no measurable rain. After beneficial precipitation the prior week, the precipitation-free week allowed dryness and drought to re-intensify or expand over large parts of Texas and southern Oklahoma. After drought coverage (D1+) declined to about one-third of the state the prior week, coverage increased to over 45 percent this past week, which is the greatest extent since early May. Areas of late-season crop stress and some die-off has been reported across Oklahoma and Texas over the past few weeks…

Looking Ahead

Over the next 5 days (through November 10), the Pacific Northwest is expected to remain relatively wet. Between 3 and 6 inches are anticipated in parts of the Washington and northern Oregon Cascades and far northwestern Washington. Generally 2 to 3 inches are forecast through the rest of the central and northern Cascades, most of coastal Washington, and coastal areas in northwestern Oregon and northwestern California. Elsewhere, moderate to locally heavy precipitation (1 to 2 inches) is anticipated in the remaining areas from northern California to the Canadian Border. Over much of the northern Rockies, in southern Michigan, to the lee of Lake Erie, across northern New York, and over parts of New England. Totals ranging from a few tenths of an inch to about an inch are anticipated across the northern Intermountain West, higher elevations of western Wyoming, isolated parts of the northern Great Plains, portions of the Midwest, the east half of the Great Lakes, most of the Appalachians, the middle and upper Ohio Valley, the central Gulf Coast states, much of the Northeast, and southeastern Florida. Other locations are expected to receive a few tenths of an inch at best, with little or none anticipated in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain, most of interior Florida, the Lower Mississippi Valley, and from the central and southern Great Plains westward into California. Temperatures are forecast to average warmer than normal in the West and cooler than normal in the East. A shot of cold air – the coldest of the season so far – should push through the East early next week. It will not linger for long, but on one or two nights temperatures could approach freezing as far south as the central Gulf Coast, and readings in the 50’s deg. F may reach into the southern Florida Peninsula. For the 5 days overall, high temperatures are expected to average 5 to 8 deg. F below normal from the Great Lakes and Midwest southeastward into northern Florida. In contrast, daily highs from the High Plains to the Pacific Coast should average 5 to 12 deg. F above normal, with the largest departures expected in parts of the Great Basin, near the California/Oregon border, and over the northernmost Rockies.

The 6- to 10-day outlook from the Climate Prediction Center for November 11-15 favors subnormal precipitation for most areas from the Great Plains to the Atlantic Coast, except along the northern tier of the region. Odds for unusual dryness exceed 50 percent from the Lower Mississippi and Ohio Valleys eastward through the South Atlantic States outside southern Florida. Abnormally wet weather is favored from the High Plains to the Pacific Coast, with chances for unusually heavy precipitation exceeding 60 percent across central and southwestern California. Wet weather is also somewhat favored through Hawaii and over most of Alaska. Temperatures are expected to average below normal in the East from the lower Great Lakes, Middle Ohio Valley, and central Gulf Coast eastward to the Atlantic Coast. The likelihood for subnormal temperatures exceeds 70 percent from northern Florida northward along the Coastal Plain into southern New England. From roughly the Mississippi River to the Pacific Coast, warmer than normal weather is favored, with odds topping 70 percent across a broad area covering most of the central and southern Rockies and High Plains. Warm weather is also expected over most of Alaska and across Hawaii.

Just for grins here’s a slideshow of early November US Drought Monitor maps for the past few years.

November 4, 2025

This story is produced and distributed by The Water Desk at the University of Colorado Boulder’s Center for Environmental Journalism.

Heavy autumn rains brought relief to drought-plagued portions of the Southwest, but across the Colorado River basin ongoing water supply concerns still linger amid tense policy negotiations and near record-low reservoir storage.

Even after accounting for the heavy rain, 57% of the Colorado River watershed remains in severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. More than 11% of the basin is in extreme drought.

A less than average upcoming snow season combined with a dry spring or early summer in 2026 could create conditions for another low runoff year. The Colorado River’s headwaters saw a weak snowpack last winter, which contributed to one of the worst spring runoff seasons on record in 2025. Drought conditions spread and worsened into summer throughout the southern Rocky Mountains.

Peter Goble, Colorado’s assistant state climatologist, explained that the recent rainfall “certainly recharged soils,” in some watersheds.

Streamflow in the Animas River and Rio Grande increased significantly following the October rains and flooding. Rain in southwest Colorado, particularly around Pagosa Springs, brought flooding that damaged homes and downtown businesses. Rain gauges near the San Juan Mountains recorded 7 to 10 inches of precipitation from October 9-15.

“We would love to see this rain come over a more steady incremental period,” Goble said. “But oftentimes it is these flooding events that kind of put the kibosh on a drought more locally.”

The flooding erased drought designations on the Drought Monitor map in those localized areas, but basinwide drought conditions tell a different story. Dry soils, depleted reservoirs and winter weather forecasts continue to cause water managers to worry.

Even with the recent rain, soils in many parts of the Colorado River basin remain dry. Soil absorbs moisture almost like a sponge. When the soil moisture is low, spring runoff soaks into the soil, saturating the ground first. Soils that are more saturated lead to more water filtering into streams and reservoirs when runoff occurs, making the process more efficient.

“We’re still going to need a good snowpack in order to be set up nicely, but this (rain) improves our outlook for the efficiency of that snowpack,” Goble said.

Federal forecasts show the possibility of a mild La Niña through February. The climate pattern occurs when Pacific Ocean waters cool down and alter global weather conditions. La Niña patterns often impact the amount of snowpack accumulation in the coming year. The southern part of Colorado is often drier in a La Niña year while northern areas, around Steamboat Springs, typically see snowier conditions.

The stakes for an above average runoff next year are high. The two biggest reservoirs in the country, Lake Powell and Lake Mead have steadily declined over the last 25 years. Powell is currently at 29% of its capacity and Lake Mead is at 32%. A lessened runoff could push them dangerously low.

While the rain slightly alleviates local drought, it’s “only a drop in the bucket when it comes to refilling Lake Powell and Lake Mead,” Goble said. “We’re still going to see those regional water shortages persist.”

If water levels continue to decline in these larger reservoirs, the dams’ infrastructure is threatened and the hydropower turbines can’t be used. Lake Powell, for example, has different outlets installed so water can be released in low conditions, however they are not designed to be the main outlet source. New federal projections show it’s possible Powell’s levels could drop low enough to cease hydropower production as early as October 2026, if conditions remain dry.

“They could reach levels they have never reached before and potentially reach catastrophic levels,” said John Berggren, regional policy manager for Western Resource Advocates.

In response to extremely low water conditions, it’s possible water from upstream reservoirs in Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico could be released to support Powell’s hydropower turbines.

“We are seeing a new normal because of climate change, because of aridification,” Eric Kuhn said, former general manager of the Colorado River District, on the state’s Western Slope. In 2022, the basin saw similar drought conditions.

“We are back where we were just a few years later,” Kuhn said. “The system is slipping away.”

The basin states are also engaged in negotiations for new operating guidelines for the Colorado River, set to be in place by 2027. Given the ongoing drought conditions, water experts say the two reservoirs cannot wait for new guidelines.

“Don’t forget the short term problem while you are focused on a long-term agreement,” Kuhn said. A recent research paper, co-authored by Kuhn, highlights the need for urgent consumptive cuts basinwide. “We have got to figure out what’s going to happen next year if next year happens to be dry.”

The funding represents Trump’s latest attempt at coal revitalization, but updating the nation’s aging facilities would cost billions, experts say.

By Anika Jane Beamer

November 3, 2025

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

The U.S. Department of Energy has announced up to $100 million in federal funding for projects modernizing the nation’s remaining coal plants, nearly half of which were slated to close by 2030.

The investment, a fraction of what would be needed for a comprehensive upgrade, is unlikely to make coal power more affordable, energy experts and anti-coal advocates say.

On Friday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the Notice of Funding Opportunity, calling for applications to design, implement, or test refurbishments and retrofit systems that allow coal plants to “operate more efficiently, reliably, and affordably.”

The announcement outlined three key areas for development projects: advanced wastewater management systems, systems that enable plants to switch between coal and natural gas, and advanced “co-firing” systems that allow simultaneous combustion of both fuel types.

The funding comes just a month after the department announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” America’s coal industry.

That investment already included $350 million to recommission closed coal power plants or modernize plants and $100 million for the three development areas outlined in Friday’s announcement. The DOE did not respond to questions about why additional funds were announced just a month later.

Trump’s investments in coal are a drop in the bucket of what would realistically be needed to revamp the plants, said Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy research firm based in San Francisco.

“Those types of retrofits for a single plant can cost hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Solomon. “To do that for every plant in the coal fleet, you’re looking at billions of dollars. And you’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

In April, following Trump’s “Beautiful Clean Coal” executive order, the Department of Energy rolled out a series of actions intended to reinvigorate American coal production. The department reinstated the National Coal Council as a federal advisory committee, offered long-term financing for coal infrastructure, designated coal as a critical material and mineral and ended a moratorium prohibiting new coal mining leases on federal land.

“You’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”— Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation

Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.

“For years, the Biden and Obama administrations relentlessly targeted America’s coal industry and workers, resulting in the closure of reliable power plants and higher electricity costs,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the report. “Thankfully, President Trump has ended the war on American coal and is restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

Yet Trump’s attempt to save coal from the brink is unlikely to succeed.

In 2001, coal made up half of the electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States. Today, it accounts for less than a fifth of generated power; the decline reflects the changing energy landscape.

The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.

Analysis by Energy Innovation found that coal prices increased 28 percent between 2021 and 2024, while inflation rose only 16 percent in that time.

At 99 percent of U.S. coal plants—209 out of 210—it would be cheaper to replace energy with new wind and solar than to keep them operating, a 2023 Energy Innovation analysis found.

The Sierra Club has led the charge to close power plants in the U.S. through their decades-long “Beyond Coal” campaign. The new coal funding is “just the latest Trump administration action that harms people and the planet,” Sierra Club climate policy director Patrick Drupp wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News.

“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.

Trump’s emergency orders to keep operating multiple coal plants slated for retirement have cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone.

A 90-day emergency order requiring continued operation of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan has generated an additional $80 million in costs since May. The company has said that it will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest, in accordance with the cost-collection process set by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Trump has repeatedly argued that coal is critical to improving the reliability of the American energy grid amid surging power demand. But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.

Between 2013 and 2024, forced-outage rates (excluding planned outages for maintenance) for coal exceeded those for other major sources of electricity, including gas, nuclear and hydroelectric power, according to a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Most coal plants in the U.S. were built before 1990. Keeping those plants running as they age requires more and more money, leading utilities to schedule retirement dates for nearly half of all plants.

Solomon uses the analogy of car ownership to explain the decline of coal energy in the U.S. “If you have a car that has 250,000 miles on it, very little is going to bring that car back to new,” she said. “You can only do so much when the infrastructure is that old.”

Correction: This story was updated Nov. 4, 2025, to reflect that inflation rose 16%, not 6%, between 2021 and 2024, according to Energy Innovation’s analysis.

As the world’s climate warms and droughts and water shortages are becoming more common, farmers are struggling to produce enough food. Farmers continue to adapt, but there are ways for you to help, too.

For decades, farmers have sought to conserve water in agriculture, with a focus on improving irrigation efficiency. That has included decreasing the practice of flood irrigation, in which water flows through trenches between rows of plants. Instead, many farmers are adopting more precise methods of delivering water to plants’ roots, such as sprinklers and drip systems.

In recent years, policymakers, researchers and consumers have come to look more closely at opportunities to conserve water throughout the entire process of growing, shipping, selling and eating food. Working with colleagues, we have identified several key ways to reduce water used in agriculture – some of which directly involve farmers, but two of which everyone can follow, to help reduce how much water is used to grow the food they eat.

Some work for farmers

Farmers can match crops to local land, water and climate conditions to reduce stress on scarce resources and make food production more sustainable in the long run. That could include reducing the amount of alfalfa and other hay crops used to feed livestock, or swapping out wheat and sorghum and instead planting corn and potatoes.

The condition of the soil also matters. Many farmers have focused on short-term productivity, relying on fertilizers or frequent tillage to boost yields from one season to the next. But over time, those practices wear down the soil, making it less fertile and less able to hold water.

Soil is not just a surface to grow things on. It is a living system that can be built and fed or depleted. Practices such as planting cover crops in the off-season to protect the soil, reducing tillage, applying compost and rotating different types of crops can all help soil hold more water and support crops even during droughts.

A choice for consumers

Adapting on-farm practices addresses only part of the water conservation effort. While crops are grown in fields, they move through a vast network of processors, distributors, supermarkets and households before being eaten, wasted or lost. At each link in this chain, consumers’ choices determine how much agricultural water is ultimately saved.

People’s dietary preferences, in particular, play a major role in agricultural water use. Producing meat requires significantly more water than growing plant-based foods.

Per capita, Americans consume nearly three times the global average amount of meat each year.

While eliminating meat altogether is not everyone’s goal, even modest shifts in diet, whether reducing overall meat consumption or selecting proteins that use less water to produce, can ease the strain. Producing a pound of beef requires an estimated 1,800 gallons of water, compared with about 500 gallons for a pound of chicken.

Replacing all meat with the equivalent quantities of plant-based foods with comparable nutrition profiles could cut the average American’s food-related water use by nearly 30%. Even replacing a small amount of meat with plant-based foods or meats that require less water can make a difference.

While a single meal may seem inconsequential, if multiplied across millions of households these choices translate into meaningful water savings.

A second savings opportunity

Perhaps the simplest and most powerful step people can take to save water used in agriculture is to cut back on food waste.

In the United States, 22% of total water use is tied to producing food that ultimately goes uneaten.

In developing countries, losses often result from limited storage and transportation, but in high-income nations like the United States, most waste happens at the retail and household level. In the U.S., households alone account for nearly 50% of all food discarded nationwide.

This creates a major opportunity for everyone to contribute to water conservation. Understanding the water embedded in different foods can make people more mindful about what ends up in the trash.

And on top of feeling good about helping the environment, there’s a financial reward: Wasting less food also means saving the money spent on food that would have gone to waste.

Unlocking more customer flexibility and further growing VPPs will help ensure access to affordable and reliable energy.”

Many states are starting to explore VPP deployment, often seen as a cost-effective way to increase capacity. Most VPPs exist in the form of demand response programs. The Department Of Energy (DOE) released a report in 2023 stating that large-scale deployment of VPPs “could help address demand increases and rising peaks at lower cost than conventional resources, reducing the energy costs for Americans — one in six of whom are already behind on electricity bills.”

AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Superior HealthPlan and Centene Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC), today announced a strategic and timely investment aimed at addressing food insecurity across Texas. This initiative comes as millions of Americans face increasing challenges in accessing nutritious meals due to recent disruptions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), food insecurity currently affects approximately 47.4 million people nationwide, including 13.8 million children.

The $400,000 investment will help 9 food banks provide access to healthy, nutritious food in communities across Texas. This support is a continuation of Superior HealthPlan's commitment to helping those most in need and advancing long-term solutions to hunger and nutrition challenges.

""For more than 25 years, Superior HealthPlan has been committed to serving families in Texas, particularly in times of need,"" said Superior HealthPlan President and CEO, Mitch Wasden. ""Local food banks in communities across the state are doing great work every day. At the same time, we know they may be facing increased demand, so supporting them now is one of the most meaningful ways we can make a difference.""

These food banks will receive funding as part of this initiative:

Central Texas Food Bank, Austin

Coastal Bend Food Bank, Corpus Christi

East Texas Food Bank, Tyler

El Pasoans Fighting Hunger, El Paso

Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley, Pharr

Houston Food Bank, Houston

San Antonio Food Bank, San Antonio

South Plains Food Bank, Lubbock

South Texas Food Bank, Laredo

This investment is part of a $1.5 million commitment from the Centene Foundation to organizations across the country, particularly food banks and other community-based groups that are typically preparing for winter but may already be experiencing critical shortages.

""Families across the country are facing unprecedented challenges as essential nutrition programs experience strain and demand for food assistance continues to rise. Local organizations have been working tirelessly to meet these needs, and this emergency funding will strengthen their efforts — helping ensure that children and families most at risk have access to healthy meals during this critical time,"" said Centene's Chief Health Officer Alice Chen. ""Access to nutritious food is foundational to good health, and sustained investment in these programs is essential to improving long-term outcomes for vulnerable communities.""

Centene has long championed the fight against food insecurity. With more than 95% of its Medicaid plans offering food or nutrition intervention programs, which help address the social factors driving 80% of health outcomes, access to nutritious food remains a vital health priority.

In 2024, Centene invested $77.1 million toward food security. Specifically, Centene's efforts have spanned multiple states, leveraging innovative, community-based partnerships to combat food insecurity and chronic disease – from Fresh Food Pharmacies in Michigan to farmers market produce vouchers in Illinois, grocery support for diabetic members in Nebraska and maternal care food programs in Arkansas – reinforcing Centene's long-standing commitment to food as a critical driver of health.

These investments reflect Centene's broader mission to transform community health through locally driven solutions, addressing drivers like access to nutritious food and promoting long-term sustainability by integrating food access with healthcare services.

The Scottish Government’s commitment to ending our contribution to global emissions by 2045 at the latest, as agreed by Parliament on a cross-party basis, remains unwavering.

Scotland is over halfway to achieving our target of net zero emissions by 2045. The latest official statistics for Scotland showed that our greenhouse gas emissions had fallen by 51.3% between 1990 and 2023 – the largest reduction in the whole of the UK. Nearly every sector of the Scottish economy has seen substantial emissions reductions over that time.

This includes a 93.4% reduction in electricity supply emissions, from sources such as power stations; a 59.5% reduction in industrial emissions, including manufacturing and construction; and a 73.1% reduction in waste management emissions, such as landfill.

The key driver of the transition to date has been the transformation of the way we generate energy – from coal and gas to today’s thriving renewables sector. In 2023, 70% of electricity generated in Scotland was from renewable sources, and Scotland is a net exporter of electricity to the rest of the UK: in 2024, there were 19.7 TWh of net electricity exports to other UK nations.

Scotland is not alone in pursuing this energy transition – in 2024 China’s wind and solar generation rose by 25% compared to the previous year.[1] Pursuing climate goals is increasingly seen as an economic necessity worldwide. It boosts resilience in the face of shocks and reduces the variation in energy prices due to oil market fluctuations.

In the energy sector and beyond, the net zero transition can also support significant economic opportunities for Scotland. Our already thriving green jobs sector can continue to grow in regions across Scotland, while collaborative working with the private sector can boost investment in the net zero economy.

This Climate Change Plan (CCP) sets out the policies and proposals the Scottish Government will take forward to enable our carbon budgets to be met between 2026-2040. These carbon budgets have been set in line with the levels proposed by our independent advisors, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), [2] and provide a clear pathway towards Scotland achieving net zero by 2045.

Beyond the emissions reduction, this plan also sets out how these targets will be met fairly, in a way that continues to maximise the opportunities of the transition, while reducing impacts to a minimum wherever possible - this is what is known as the ‘Just Transition’.

This CCP builds upon our most recent Programme for Government, which presents Scotland’s climate ambitions over the next 20 years. It sets out that by 2045 we will have reduced emissions from our most polluting sectors without asking the impossible of people, and while building Scotland’s health and wealth. In this time, we will:

Support transport services, people, and businesses to reduce their emissions;

Promote and develop renewable energy, creating jobs and developing skills within the industry;

Tackle fuel poverty and protect those on low incomes while decarbonising heat in buildings;

Invest in nature-based solutions helping to reverse nature decline and restore and regenerate biodiversity in Scotland;

Adapt to climate impacts, recognising that warming trends for the next two decades are already set due to past global emissions, carrying unavoidable impacts for nature and the environment; and

Continue to play our role in delivering global climate justice by securing global change and fulfil the moral duty to protect and improve the lives of both current and future generations, both in Scotland and overseas.

Earlier this year, the Scottish Government introduced a new set of five-yearly carbon budget targets as part of our pathway to net zero in 2045. Carbon budgets provide a more reliable and consistent framework to measure progress to net zero and are used by other countries including Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Wales. This means reporting on progress is less prone to fluctuations than the Scottish Government’s previous approach of interim and annual targets, which could be affected by annual variations outwith our control such as extreme weather or a global pandemic.

The carbon budgets set a target for an average level of emissions reduction for Scotland over each five-year period, set at:

57% lower than baseline levels for 2026-2030,

69% lower than baseline levels for 2031-2035,

80% lower than baseline levels for 2036-2040, and

94% lower than baseline levels for 2041-2045

Each carbon budget level refers to an average reduction in emissions over a five-year period from the 1990 baseline[3] and run in parallel with Scotland’s target of net zero emissions by 2045.

Our approach to delivering these emissions reductions is broken down by the sector of the economy within which the action will be taken forward. The sectors referenced by this plan are specified by legislation:[4]

residential and public (in relation to buildings in those sectors),

transport (including international aviation and shipping),

waste management,

energy supply,

business and industrial process,

land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), and

agriculture.

Delivering the climate mitigation policies and proposals[5] across these sectors will require action from everyone across Scotland, but achieving them puts us firmly on track to delivering net zero by 2045 and reflects our continued ambition in addressing climate change. Households will also see real benefits from these actions – from warmer homes, improved air quality and access to active travel.

The policy actions set out can also protect people and communities from the health harms associated with fossil fuels and, coupled with effective adaptation, prevent many of the anticipated health impacts of climate change. Health benefits from cleaner air, warmer homes, healthier food, health-promoting natural and built environments, high quality public services and fair work in a thriving economy can be immediate. The CCP will support delivery of Scotland’s prevention-focused Population Health Framework, wider public service reform agenda and the ambitions of the Scottish Government to build a fairer, greener and healthier Scotland.

This document sets out the key actions each sector will be taking forward to deliver our carbon budgets to 2040. The sectoral annexes provide further detail on the range of policies and proposals each area will be taking forward, how these integrate with the Scottish Government’s wider vision for the sector, and actions we will take forward to secure a just transition in each sector.

There are significant uncertainties with planning actions to deliver carbon budgets over a fifteen-year time span – technological change, action from UK government in reserved areas, wider European and global developments and other factors will impact the policies and proposals set out in this document and result in other options becoming available. That is why the Scottish Government will continue to monitor and evaluate the plan itself alongside implementation of the actions set out in the CCP to advise of further actions needed in future years. The Monitoring and Analytical Annex sets out our approach to monitoring over the course of this plan.

Delivering Under Devolution

The Scottish and UK Governments’ ambitions to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, are highly interdependent: many of the critical levers required to deliver net zero in Scotland are held at the UK level; meanwhile, delivering UK wide climate targets is also reliant on Scotland achieving our net zero aim.

Scotland’s vast natural resources, from our renewable energy potential to our extensive area of peatland and forestry, are critical to climate goals for the whole of the UK.

The CCC, in their advice to the UK Government on the level of the UK 7th Carbon Budget (2038 to 2042), highlighted that over “10% of the UK-wide emissions reduction required to meet the recommended 7th Carbon Budget will come in devolved or partially devolved policy areas within the devolved nations”.[6]

Moreover, the CCC emphasises the necessity for shared delivery and collaboration between national governments as between 30-60% of the emissions reduction required in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland will be in areas of policy that are mostly reserved.

As such, action from the UK Government in key areas of reserved policy, or cooperation in areas where a joined-up approach is essential, will be crucial to achieving our climate ambitions, including (but not exclusively):

the rebalancing of prices in the electricity market to make prices more affordable;

a comprehensive four nations approach to vehicle and road taxation;

appropriate, long term, specific financial support for land-based measures including tree-planting and peatland restoration, reflecting the share of these resources in Scotland;

fair funding distribution for agriculture; and

further certainty on critical investment decisions, including a full funding package and timeline for the Acorn Transport and Storage Project.

As such, this plan sets out our specific requests of the UK Government in each sectoral annex, highlighting the need for additional collaboration, action and ambition, in line with CCC recommendations.

The Contents of this Climate Change Plan

The carbon budget levels recently approved by the Scottish Parliament represent an ambitious delivery pathway towards achieving net zero by 2045. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act requires that a plan is produced which sets out the policies and proposals which will deliver emissions reductions consistent with meeting our carbon budgets.

The actions this Government will be taking to deliver the carbon budgets in each sector is set out in this document in a summary form, with further detail provided in Sectoral Annexes. These outline how we will approach emissions reduction over the course of this plan, in line with our just transition principles and the interests of the wider sector. These annexes also provide an update on progress from the previous Climate Change Plan update.[7]

A separate Monitoring and Analytical Annex is also provided to further detail the contributions of policies and proposals to meeting our carbon budgets, along with further detail on costs and benefits.

The CCP as a whole is informed by the importance this Government places on achieving the economic opportunities of the transition, and actions we will take to ensure it is delivered in a just and fair way. The plan also recognises the important role for adaptation to the changing climate, and the critical importance of addressing nature and biodiversity loss in tandem with our approach to emissions reduction.

Further detail is set out on a range of issues in the annexes, including where the Climate Change Act specifies factors that must be taken into account when setting this plan, including:

Just Transition principles: how the policies and proposals will affect sectors, regions and jobs (Annex 1A, with specific references in each sectoral annex)

Consumption and Lifestyle: how our action will affect emissions associated with what we consume (Annex 1B)

International: how our action supports developing countries to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, and how it contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Annex 1C)

Alongside the plan documentation, there are a number of impact assessments published to help consider the impacts of this plan and its proposals.",https://www.gov.scot/assets/images/logos/SGLogo1200x630.png,N,,2025-11-06 17:20:48.433819

In the first 10 months of 2025, US LNG producers signed sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) for 29.5 million tonnes of LNG per year, more than four times the seven mtpa signed in all of 2024, data from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group shows.

The SPAs are used by project developers to raise financing by demonstrating that planned projects can generate positive cash flow with customers locked into contracts for as long as 20 years. The only time more binding agreements were signed by US exporters was in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, according to Rapidan Energy.

Many buyers seeking to diversify away from Russian energy are willing to pay higher liquefaction fees that American LNG developers charge to convert natural gas into a liquid that can be easily transported around the world in specialised ships.

Companies with LNG trading portfolios are also picking up volumes from American producers.

Growing US LNG output stokes fears of glut

President Donald Trump returned to office in January with a pro-oil and gas agenda. He has promoted LNG deals in trade talks with Europe, which agreed to buy $750 billion in energy from the US. His administration also lifted former President Joe Biden’s moratorium on new export project approvals.

A flurry of final investment decisions followed that will add new capacity totalling 61.5 mtpa of LNG to an existing export base of 120 million mtpa. Cheniere Energy, Venture Global, Sempra, Next Decade and Woodside Energy have all greenlit new facilities this year.

The US Energy Information Administration expects the country’s overall LNG capacity to double by 2029. America could export one third of global LNG by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.

Rapid expansion of US LNG could result in a global glut, with the IEA predicting lower prices.

“As new supply comes to market, notably from the United States and Qatar, it should apply downward pressure on prices - offering welcome relief for gas importers worldwide,” said IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security Keisuke Sadamori.

Similar forecasts of lower LNG prices have come from producers including Total and Shell, yet some investors in new export facilities like Woodside and Venture Global say predictions of a glut are overstated.

""We're very bullish on LNG demand for the long term,"" Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill said at an event in September. Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel predicts demand growth as data centres and more Asian countries replace coal with LNG for electricity generation. ""I think data centres are going to be a massive source of new incremental demand, but you are short today on gas production capacity,"" Sabel told Reuters.

Construction costs rising

Labour inflation caused by shortages of skilled workers and rising prices of equipment due to tariffs are increasing construction costs, according to Poten and Partners business intelligence head Jason Feer. ""Costs have increased up to 20 per cent in some instances, and it makes some project...uncompetitive,"" TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné said on an earnings call last month.

Venture Global has reported cost overruns at its 27.2 mtpa Plaquemines LNG facility, while Golden Pass, a joint venture between Exxon Mobil and QatarEnergy, is over budget and behind schedule. To keep projects economically viable, developers have been seeking, and so far getting, liquefaction fees that are up around 15 per cent on average from two years ago, Feer said.

Venture Global, considered a low-cost supplier, is charging $2.30 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for liquefaction in new contracts. The fee is higher than the $1.75 per mmBtu it charged for LNG out of Calcasieu Pass when that facility first contracted sales, two people with knowledge of its pricing told Reuters.

Cheniere Energy, the largest US LNG producer, is charging a premium of over $2.75 per mmBtu. Woodside is offering 10-year contracts coming in at around $2.90 per mmBtu, said Feer, adding that fees across the broader market had averaged $2 per mmBtu in 2023.

Higher prices not stopping buyers

The window may be closing for more LNG projects to be developed in the US at this time because of rising costs and the prospect of lower global prices, according to Rapidan Energy director of global gas Alex Munton.

""This bull run must come to an end, it cannot continue forever,"" said Munton.

Still, buyers including Eni and Petronas are snapping up new long-term contracts even in the face of higher liquefaction fees and potentially lower spot prices. JERA, one of Japan’s largest power generators, says it wants US gas to diversify and avoid an over-dependence on Australia and to meet demand growth spurred by data centres and AI.

TotalEnergies' Pouyanné said many large players are focusing on the bigger picture and locking in new volumes to trade, even if fees are rising. As the market grows, so do trading and arbitrage opportunities.

Even some easing of the market could still create opportunities for more price sensitive countries in Southeast Asia to move away from coal and boost global demand for LNG, the IEA said.

By Anika Jane Beamer

November 3, 2025

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

The U.S. Department of Energy has announced up to $100 million in federal funding for projects modernizing the nation’s remaining coal plants, nearly half of which were slated to close by 2030.

The investment, a fraction of what would be needed for a comprehensive upgrade, is unlikely to make coal power more affordable, energy experts and anti-coal advocates say.

On Friday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the Notice of Funding Opportunity, calling for applications to design, implement, or test refurbishments and retrofit systems that allow coal plants to “operate more efficiently, reliably, and affordably.”

The announcement outlined three key areas for development projects: advanced wastewater management systems, systems that enable plants to switch between coal and natural gas, and advanced “co-firing” systems that allow simultaneous combustion of both fuel types.

The funding comes just a month after the department announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” America’s coal industry.

That investment already included $350 million to recommission closed coal power plants or modernize plants and $100 million for the three development areas outlined in Friday’s announcement. The DOE did not respond to questions about why additional funds were announced just a month later.

Trump’s investments in coal are a drop in the bucket of what would realistically be needed to revamp the plants, said Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy research firm based in San Francisco.

“Those types of retrofits for a single plant can cost hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Solomon. “To do that for every plant in the coal fleet, you’re looking at billions of dollars. And you’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

In April, following Trump’s “Beautiful Clean Coal” executive order, the Department of Energy rolled out a series of actions intended to reinvigorate American coal production. The department reinstated the National Coal Council as a federal advisory committee, offered long-term financing for coal infrastructure, designated coal as a critical material and mineral and ended a moratorium prohibiting new coal mining leases on federal land.

“You’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”— Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation

Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.

“For years, the Biden and Obama administrations relentlessly targeted America’s coal industry and workers, resulting in the closure of reliable power plants and higher electricity costs,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the report. “Thankfully, President Trump has ended the war on American coal and is restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

Yet Trump’s attempt to save coal from the brink is unlikely to succeed.

In 2001, coal made up half of the electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States. Today, it accounts for less than a fifth of generated power; the decline reflects the changing energy landscape.

The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.

Analysis by Energy Innovation found that coal prices increased 28 percent between 2021 and 2024, while inflation rose only 16 percent in that time.

At 99 percent of U.S. coal plants—209 out of 210—it would be cheaper to replace energy with new wind and solar than to keep them operating, a 2023 Energy Innovation analysis found.

The Sierra Club has led the charge to close power plants in the U.S. through their decades-long “Beyond Coal” campaign. The new coal funding is “just the latest Trump administration action that harms people and the planet,” Sierra Club climate policy director Patrick Drupp wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News.

“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.

Trump’s emergency orders to keep operating multiple coal plants slated for retirement have cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone.

A 90-day emergency order requiring continued operation of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan has generated an additional $80 million in costs since May. The company has said that it will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest, in accordance with the cost-collection process set by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Trump has repeatedly argued that coal is critical to improving the reliability of the American energy grid amid surging power demand. But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.

Between 2013 and 2024, forced-outage rates (excluding planned outages for maintenance) for coal exceeded those for other major sources of electricity, including gas, nuclear and hydroelectric power, according to a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Most coal plants in the U.S. were built before 1990. Keeping those plants running as they age requires more and more money, leading utilities to schedule retirement dates for nearly half of all plants.

Solomon uses the analogy of car ownership to explain the decline of coal energy in the U.S. “If you have a car that has 250,000 miles on it, very little is going to bring that car back to new,” she said. “You can only do so much when the infrastructure is that old.”

Austin-based Base Power just raised $1 billion to bring its massive home batteries to homes across the nation. The company has already installed more than 100 megawatt-hours of battery capacity in Texas since launching in 2023, an impressive feat in a state known for its power grid challenges.

Base Power's business model is truly unique. Instead of selling expensive systems that can cost homeowners tens of thousands of dollars, the company leases out its batteries. Customers pay an upfront fee, ranging from $695 to $995, for installation, and a small monthly payment of $19 or $29, depending on the battery size.

Those batteries aren't small, either. The 25-kilowatt-hour model is twice as powerful as a Tesla Powerwall, and the 50-kilowatt-hour option can keep an average home powered for up to 48 hours on its own.

Here's how it works: customers commit to buying their electricity from Base Power at 8.5 cents per kilowatt hour for three years. In return, the company can tap into those batteries to sell power back to the grid during peak times. This move helps stabilize Texas's often-strained power network and earns rewards from the state's utility regulator.

By working with Base Power, homeowners get reliable backup power without the costs usually associated with setting up a new system, and the company helps the grid handle demand much more efficiently. That means less reliance on dirty energy sources like gas and coal, along with fewer power outages when it matters most.

With this new round of funding, Base Power plans to expand beyond the Lone Star State and build a second U.S. battery factory. Its first facility, on the outskirts of Austin, is already under construction.

The approach follows a growing trend in clean energy tech, helping people save money and reducing pollution.

Taken together, these developments suggest that energy costs could be moving the political needle in ways that other issues, like climate change, have not. And, with next year’s midterms on the horizon, it’s an issue both political parties will increasingly have to grapple with.

“When the costs of climate change become evident, there’s a political necessity to find policy that works,” said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who represented South Carolina and has become a leading conservative voice on climate change. “When people see them on their utility bills and they see them in their property tax bills, that’s when they start asking, is there any way to head this off?”

The Trump administration’s potential reversal on Energy Star is one example of the political power that energy prices can have. In May, EPA officials announced at a staff meeting that Energy Star would be “eliminated.” The backlash was swift. Within weeks, a coalition of industry groups wrote to congressional leaders in support of a program that saves Americans some $40 billion a year in utility bills. They called minimizing that financial burden “a clear priority across party lines.”

Republicans, Democrats, appliance manufacturers, and corporate giants like Home Depot lined up in defense of Energy Star and, according to the Times, the EPA is quietly backing off its plans to fully shutter the decades-long initiative, widely considered among the most successful government initiatives in modern history. Its signature blue label is now nearly as recognizable as the Nike swoosh or a Coca-Cola can.

The EPA says the future of Energy Star is still being finalized, and many of the people who work on the program have been laid off or left. But the potential walk-back is a notable change of course for a Presidential administration that has, by and large, moved to gut federal climate and environmental policies. “This is a classic Lee Zeldin leap before you look at the situation,” said Jeremy Symons, a senior advisor at the nonprofit Environmental Protection Network, about the EPA’s administrator. When industry argued that the Energy Star label helps them sell appliances, Zelden appears to have listened.

“Energy star is an American success story,” said Symons. “It’s really a no-brainer.”

Energy costs played a large role in several key political races as well, most notably in Georgia, where the campaign for public utility commission seats revolved around affordability. Republicans argued that fossil fuels offer the best route to stable and affordable power prices in the state. Democrats pointed to a string of rate increases — six in the past two years — to contend that alternatives, such as renewable energy and nuclear, are the way forward. “We need to invest in a smarter, more resilient grid that’s capable of handling the extreme weather that Georgia experiences while also expanding that access to clean energy,” then-candidate Alicia Johnson told Grist in June.

On Tuesday, Johnson and fellow democrat Peter Hubbard, who is a clean energy consultant, flipped two Republican seats by 25 point margins in a race that drew national attention and funding. The wins are the Democrats’ first statewide victories in a non-federal election since 2006.

High energy costs were also a theme of gubernatorial races inNew Jersey and Virginia. In the Garden State, Democrat Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs.” In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, also a Democrat, campaigned on a platform that included calls to expand clean energy generation and promote home weatherization to ease consumption. Despite President Trump trying to pin surging prices in those states on the Democrats, both Sherrill and Spanberger beat out Republican challengers.

In New Jersey, the local chapter of the League of Conservation Voters funded a campaign ad that attacked the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, for spiraling electricity rates. The video has 6.9 million views on YouTube and Sara Schreiber, the national organization’s senior vice president of campaigns, said internal polling showed the ad drove up Ciattarelli’s unfavorable rating among all voters by 6 percent, and a staggering 8 percent with Trump voters.

“People care about this issue, they hear what the candidates are saying, and they are siding with the candidates who are offering clean energy solutions to help lower their costs,” said Schreiber. Read Next

Dan Jasper, of the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, said it’s not surprising that framing climate as an affordability issue helps win elections. “When you say “climate,” I think that just seems too far in the future for people,” he said. “But when you put it in terms of everyday expenditures, people start to listen for sure.”

As attention turns to next year’s midterm races, election watchers say utility bills could again be a centerpiece of campaigns across the country. It’s a concern that President Donald J. Trump has already repeatedly brought up, including with promises to cut prices in half. But with energy demand on the rise for the first time in decades and prices rising twice as fast as inflation, Inglis said “I would think that Democrats should really make an issue out of that.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright acknowledged the risk in August, saying, “momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

Jesse Lee, a senior advisor with the climate-politics nonprofit Climate Power, says that the impact of rising costs is so widespread that it could become an issue almost anywhere. But he’s particularly watching states that have seen large rate increases in recent years, such as Texas, Arizona and Pennsylvania. Incumbent moderate Republicans without much a buffer could also be at risk, he said, pointing to Mike Lawler of New York as one example.

Building out the supply of clean energy in the U.S. is a clear antidote to rising demand, Lee said. While Democrats have generally embraced a path lined with renewable energy, many Republicans, including President Trump, have panned that approach.

“Anybody with eyes can see that this is a glaring vulnerability for [Republicans],” Lee said. “Democrats should be embracing it.”

The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.
The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we’re breathing.
DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.","After months of work and political wrangling over potential legal impact, a new, small network of air sensors began collecting real-time data in four Mississippi River communities and has already detected spikes in pollution since going live in September, an environmental group says.

For years, community and environmental advocates have argued that the state should require real-time, fence-line air monitoring around the state's major industrial facilities to supplement its regional network with more localized data. But the idea has faced resistance from industry, regulators and legislators over the cost, the fear of false positives and of providing fuel for lawsuits.

Located between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, new AQMesh sensors sponsored by environmental group LEAN represent a different tack, putting monitors in the community and offering, the nonprofit's officials believe, the potential to spur voluntary air quality improvements even if the sensors' data don't have regulatory teeth.

""It is our hope that by shining a light on contaminants in the air, we can show companies where their operations are having potentially adverse impacts on neighboring citizens, as well as on company workers, and can spur constructive discussions of ways to reduce emissions and lessen the health impacts,"" Marylee Orr, LEAN's executive director, said in a statement.

The AQMesh sensors can't carry the force of law because they don't meet a new state equipment standard, LEAN officials acknowledge, but they insist the accuracy is close to regulatory-level equipment.

Financed with part of a $500,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant, the four LEAN air sensors are located in Alsen, Geismar, St. James and Donaldsonville. The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.

Running since the beginning of the year, the four sensors were first calibrated for months standing next to Louisiana regulatory air monitors and were found to meet EPA thresholds for data comparability with the state equipment, LEAN's scientific advisors say.

The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. They also collect data on wind speed and direction, with the information published on LEAN's website every 15 minutes.

These pollutants are regulated by the state and federal government, have known health impacts and are common near industrial sources, but, in many cases, can come from many other sources as well.

Slawomir Lomnicki, an LSU environmental science professor who is advising LEAN, explained that the data so far are providing clear trends, including spikes in Geismar for volatile organic compounds, a class of chemicals that can be tied to toxic industrial pollution.

""When we look at the correlation between atmospherical conditions and these pollutants, in many cases, you can see a very clear correlation with the direction from where the plume is coming,"" he said.

'This is historic'

LEAN officials say they have been meeting with community members to discuss the data and then will facilitate meetings between residents and area companies ""to explore ways to correct and prevent emissions incidents.""

The arrival of the sensors has sparked a mix of praise and criticism from community groups, as well as caution from industry and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we’re breathing. And now, we—the people—can be part of the solution,"" Pastor Harry Joseph, LEAN’s local community shepherd, who oversees the air quality sensor in St. James Parish, said in a LEAN statement.

DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.

The Louisiana Chemical Association, a key trade group for river industries and outspoken critic of the cost and feasibility of public fence-line monitors, said it wants to review the findings ""to better understand"" them, ""confirm their methods and quality controls, and interpret how the results compare with reported emissions data from state and federal authorities.""

""Ambient measurements can reflect background levels and non-industrial contributors, including traffic and other businesses, so we want to ensure these are properly taken into account,"" said David Cresson, president and CEO of LCA and its sister organization, the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance.

""We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue.""

Other community groups have criticized the sensors as technologically insufficient, though those criticisms have come in the context of a parallel LEAN project still under development in St. Rose.

Four more AQMesh sensors are in place and being calibrated for future reporting in the St. Charles Parish community, where chronic smells and emissions have fueled concern over a large tank farm owned by International Matex Tank Terminals.

Those sensors come after DEQ removed one of its own community monitors a few years ago that both residents and IMTT had wanted to remain.

Though LEAN's early mobile testing didn't find St. Rose was an emissions hotspot, according to a report on that work, IMTT agreed to finance additional LEAN sensors. The data will be collected by a third party and published in real time on LEAN's website, like the current data.

Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh, who leads the St. Rose community group Refined Community Empowerment, said she didn't trust LEAN's early hotspot findings and argued the LEAN sensors won't provide specific enough information about what kinds of toxic chemicals are in the air.

Traci Johnson, IMTT's vice president for environment, health, safety and security, said the company followed LEAN's recommendations on which chemicals the sensors should test for.

'What's going on here?'

In 2024, as environmental groups began proposing their own community-based systems and conducting other efforts like mobile air monitoring, the Legislature pushed through new rules that barred data from these systems from being used for regulatory actions or lawsuits if they didn't match federal standards for regulatory air monitoring equipment.

That law is the subject of a 1st Amendment lawsuit brought in federal court by environmental groups, though not LEAN.

Larry Starfield, a retired top EPA official and lawyer who also advised LEAN, said that while the sensors are not the same as regulatory air monitors, they have seen great improvement in accuracy over the past decade and come at significantly lower cost than regulatory equipment.

Starfield, who spent his last 12 years at EPA as the principal deputy assistant administrator for enforcement before his retirement in 2023, said that LEAN's advance calibration work has shown the results ""are highly consistent with readings that would be expected using LDEQ’s regulatory monitor.""

But he added that LEAN's intended application will fit a role that EPA says is acceptable for sensors and won't violate the new state law, highlighting instead elevated emissions in the hopes of voluntary corrections, not to allege violations of law.

""Where you have people living so close to industry, having a local, real-time, every-15-minute look at what's going on in your neighborhood in terms of air quality is just unique, and so it just gives them a chance to raise a flag and say, 'Hey, what's going on here?'"" he said.

Starfield pointed out that the earlier phase of the LEAN project that used the air monitoring car found elevated emissions and a company quickly corrected the problem after it was informed. He called it a ""different way of doing business"" than more traditional, slower methods through enforcement or litigation.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/93/7930ad98-b6cf-51a7-a084-8883cd9677f7/632b8848eb495.image.jpg?crop=600%2C315%2C0%2C40,N,,2025-11-06 16:18:50.200071

(""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF"") was featured in a white paper titled, ""Unlocking the Full Value of Renewable Fuel Facilities: Powering the Future with Posh Flex Gensets"" written by Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator. As previously announced, XCF and Posh have signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to explore deploying Posh's Flex Gensets at our New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's white paper provides its economic and technical roadmap for integrating Posh Energy's Flex Gensets into SAF and renewable diesel (""RD"") facilities, such as at XCF's New Rise Reno facility. Posh's analysis shows how producers using its Flex Gensets process can convert propane-rich byproduct streams, typically ~8% of total output, into renewable electricity, transforming a flared or low-value stream into a source of zero-carbon power.

Further, the white paper demonstrates how integrating Posh Flex Gensets into SAF and RD production may be able to deliver both economic and environmental benefits today, while advancing the industry's trajectory toward eSAF and fuels with near-zero - or even negative - carbon intensity (""CI"").

From Byproducts to Profits

The white paper highlights how incorporating Posh's Flex Gensets at facilities such as XCF's New Rise Reno facility has the potential to turn SAF and renewable fuel facilities into integrated energy hubs, producing not only renewable fuel but also clean power and food-grade CO₂. The result is the opportunity to create diversified revenue streams, stronger credit generation, and measurable margin growth.

By replacing grid power with on-site renewable electricity, producers have the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon intensity (CI), boost Section 45Z and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, and strengthen energy resilience for both operations and power grids.

In addition to enhancing the value of its renewable fuels, the white paper illustrates that integrating Posh's Flex Gensets has the potential to deliver:

Improvement in operating margin, driven by electricity sales and eligibility for the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit

Additional revenue streams through the sale of biogenic, food-grade CO₂ with market prices as high as $700 per metric ton, equating to approximately $0.22 per gallon of added value

Up to 80% higher electrical efficiency and near-zero local emissions

Advancing XCF's Growth Model

The white paper builds on the LOI signed in September 2025, which outlines plans for a 100 kW pilot deployment of Posh's Flex Gensets at the New Rise Reno facility, followed by a modular scale-up to 10 MW of installed capacity.

The non-binding LOI reflects a shared vision to convert byproducts from the production of renewable fuels into zero-carbon electricity, unlocking the full value of production while advancing both sustainability and profitability goals. Execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Our potential partnership with Posh Energy to deploy Flex Gensets at New Rise Reno demonstrates how renewable fuel facilities can evolve into next-generation, integrated energy platforms. By eliminating flaring and converting propane byproducts into zero-carbon electricity, we have the opportunity to both improve margin and create a circular economy where every drop of feedstock delivers value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy, commented:

""Our Flex Gensets make the energy transition practical - turning hard-to-process waste streams into clean, reliable powerwith 80% higher efficiency. Working with XCF validates how this technology can simultaneously decarbonize operations and open new, credit-backed revenue opportunities for SAF and renewable fuel producers worldwide.""

A Broader Vision

The white paper also highlights the opportunity for renewable fuel producers to help address one of the decade's biggest infrastructure challenges - the surging electricity demand from AI and hyperscale data centers, which now account for an estimated 44 percent of U.S. electricity load growth.

Over $1 trillion is expected to be invested in new U.S. data center infrastructure by 2030, and much of that growth will be constrained by limited grid interconnection capacity. By deploying Posh Flex Gensets, SAF and renewable fuel producers can help stabilize regional grids while monetizing byproducts that were previously wasted, positioning themselves as essential players in the decarbonization of both transportation and digital infrastructure.

The non-binding LOI reflects a shared vision to convert byproducts from the production of renewable fuels into zero-carbon electricity, unlocking the full value of production while advancing both sustainability and profitability goals. Execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Our potential partnership with Posh Energy to deploy Flex Gensets at New Rise Reno demonstrates how renewable fuel facilities can evolve into next-generation, integrated energy platforms. By eliminating flaring and converting propane byproducts into zero-carbon electricity, we have the opportunity to both improve margin and create a circular economy where every drop of feedstock delivers value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy, commented:

""Our Flex Gensets make the energy transition practical - turning hard-to-process waste streams into clean, reliable powerwith 80% higher efficiency. Working with XCF validates how this technology can simultaneously decarbonize operations and open new, credit-backed revenue opportunities for SAF and renewable fuel producers worldwide.""

A Broader Vision

The white paper also highlights the opportunity for renewable fuel producers to help address one of the decade's biggest infrastructure challenges - the surging electricity demand from AI and hyperscale data centers, which now account for an estimated 44 percent of U.S. electricity load growth.

Over $1 trillion is expected to be invested in new U.S. data center infrastructure by 2030, and much of that growth will be constrained by limited grid interconnection capacity. By deploying Posh Flex Gensets, SAF and renewable fuel producers can help stabilize regional grids while monetizing byproducts that were previously wasted, positioning themselves as essential players in the decarbonization of both transportation and digital infrastructure.

These are scant in chemical engineering needs, and if they do need chemical engineers, you're committing to more PhD level knowledge for the exciting high/paying jobs.
So either the public has to be willing to pay, or governments have to be willing to subsidize (which is the public paying in a round about way).
But I'm biased toward chemistry and chemical engineering.

These are scant in chemical engineering needs, and if they do need chemical engineers, you're committing to more PhD level knowledge for the exciting high/paying jobs. Nuclear is a potential option that's ChemE adjacent here.

There are millions of ideas of how to displace fossil based commodities (everything that comes from fossil sources that's not gasoline/diesel as those are presumed to be electrified). The winds are very much against this right now. They are all more expensive. So either the public has to be willing to pay, or governments have to be willing to subsidize (which is the public paying in a round about way). With current COL crises (real or perceived), this is in a major downturn in North America.

The EU is hotter, things like ReFuelEU are driving more of a market for jobs. Some people think this will stay. Some people think when the public sees 3x more expensive airline tickets at 50% PtL jet fuel mandates they'll revolt and these policies will all go the way of the dodo.

We're in an era where ExxonMobil is perceived to ""create the emissions"" and personal responsibility is out the window. Paying $100/mo for lower carbon products is out the window, but doordashing every day and burning an extra $100/wk is totally chill.

Plenty of opportunities exist in this space for both types of engineers. Something to consider is looking at the degree requirements for both degrees. Typically in the US, you have a year or two to ultimately decide between the two because the first year is core science requirements (maths, chemistry, physics) and the second year core engineering (statics, circuits, thermo). That gives you an opportunity to ask professors, alumni, and guest lecturers their perspective on your goals and your current path.

Personally, I think ChE is a ""better fit"" for understanding and supporting some technologies, like battery manufacturing or biofuels/bioplastics/bio-sourced petrochem alternatives, while environmental engineering might be better for other aspects, such as design and placement of renewable energy sources/plants. But I'm biased toward chemistry and chemical engineering.

The world is headed in a “lower carbon” direction. People and thus companies want to find ways to reduce the carbon footprint of everything. So my opinion- yes - there is absolutely a future for ChemE’s in renewables. Someone mentioned there is not a market for renewable chemicals as the moment, but it’s only a matter of time before legislation / regulations start to make them more economically viable (e.g. some type of carbon tax scheme for example). There is also a growing demand NOW for renewable fuels and that will continue. There is also a nascent class of fuels called “e-fuels” that aim to take advantage of low cost renewable electricity. So there are opportunities now, and they will grow in the coming years.

They are a minority of the jobs still in many areas and a lot of the jobs in many areas are petrochemical so you could end up doing almost the opposite if haven’t planned for it. The geographic area you live or areas you’d be open to living makes a difference for sure in # of renewable jobs. An exercise could be to look up a list of companies that are in renewables of all kinds biofuel, nuclear, etc etc and check their job postings every week. Or set yourself up as a _____ on LinkedIn and see what jobs it’s trying to feed you. You will get an idea of what types of degrees they are looking for and other requirements.

The metals are crucial for high-tech devices, including smartphones, electric vehicles, and U.S. military technology.

Trump is set to host a summit and dinner with officials from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The summit comes a week after Trump returned to Washington from a trip to Asia, where he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss the export of rare earth elements, which was a key point of friction in their trade negotiations.

Beijing recently expanded export restrictions over vital rare earth elements and magnets before announcing -- after Trump-Xi talks in South Korea -- that China would delay its new restrictions by one year.

There is a global microchip industry, but today’s cars need a highly specific product.
The chip industry doesn’t produce many of these cheap, low-power microchips based on older technology.

But China and the Netherlands are still meeting to iron out their differences, so the situation could change.","Car factories worldwide were poised to slow output or shut down over a shortage of microchips caused by a trade dispute between China and the Netherlands

China has agreed to allow chips to be exported for cars, at least temporarily averting the crisis

Car factories worldwide will operate normally for a little longer thanks to a détente in a microchip dispute between China and the Netherlands. The news comes shortly after the spat caused its first real consequences, with Nissan announcing a slowdown in manufacturing of its most popular product, the Rogue compact SUV.

CNN reports, “China has agreed to allow the export of chips critical to auto production, averting widespread shutdowns that had been predicted by the industry.”

The country threatened to pause chip exports after the Dutch government took control of a microchip company owned by a Chinese conglomerate.

That had automakers worldwide seeking alternative supplies of chips — alternatives that largely don’t exist. Reuters reported Tuesday that Nissan had plans to cut Rogue production due to a shortage of chips. It looked like the first of what could be many dominoes to fall.

The New York Times explains, “Some industry insiders have drawn parallels of the current situation to the shortages after economies around the world shut down during the coronavirus pandemic,” sending new car prices soaring.

Cars Need a Unique Type of Chip

High-tech products the world over use powerful microchips, but cars tend to use simple ones

Few companies still build the older, lower-tech chips that dominate car production

The crisis began in mid-October, when the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, a company that provides more than 40% of the microchips used in global auto production.

The government of the Netherlands reacted to concerns that the company’s Chinese owners were going to shut down chip production in Europe and move it home to China. China increasingly controls much of the global microchip trade, creating a possible chokepoint that could let it influence worldwide industries.

In response to the move, China threatened to stop the export of the chips.

There is a global microchip industry, but today’s cars need a highly specific product. The chip industry doesn’t produce many of these cheap, low-power microchips based on older technology.

Most high-tech industries today require complex, high-powered chips that can perform millions of functions simultaneously. Devices like phones and laptop computers run off just one or two of those. Cars, however, need dozens of weak, older-tech chips that each control just one or two functions, like raising and lowering windows or controlling engine timing.

Nexperia is one of the few companies still making those, which makes it a crucial cog in the global auto industry.

Automakers Moving Toward Newer Tech

In the long run, many automakers plan to move to more powerful, more common chips

The auto industry has a long-term solution to the problem, if not a short-term answer.

Startup electric vehicle (EV) builder Rivian has pioneered a leaner design approach, which uses just a handful of powerful chips like those found in phones to control all aspects of a car’s operation. Giant Volkswagen made a $5 billion investment in Rivian to get access to the technology for its own future designs.

General Motors last month announced plans for a new vehicle architecture powered by a single, ultra-powerful microprocessor.

But, today, building most cars remains dependent on a plentiful supply of 1980s-style microchips. Global trade in those will not pause in the short run. But China and the Netherlands are still meeting to iron out their differences, so the situation could change.",https://dam.coxautoinc.com/asset/7849dda9-b2fe-4821-a223-a221f4021822/OG/honda-indiana-auto-plant-2026-cr-v-and-civic-overhead.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 14:07:11.371059

(Reuters) — U.S. liquefied natural gas developers are on track this year to ink the second-highest annual number of binding sales contracts, despite industry concerns about increasing capacity and rising costs.

In the first 10 months of 2025, U.S. LNG producers signed sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) for 29.5 million metric tons of LNG per year, more than four times the 7 MMtpy signed in all of 2024, data from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group shows.

The SPAs are used by project developers to raise financing by demonstrating that planned projects can generate positive cash flow with customers locked into contracts for as long as 20 years. The only time more binding agreements were signed by U.S. exporters was in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, according to Rapidan Energy.

Many buyers seeking to diversify away from Russian energy are willing to pay higher liquefaction fees that American LNG developers charge to convert natural gas into a liquid that can be easily transported around the world in specialized ships.

Companies with LNG trading portfolios are also picking up volumes from American producers.

Growing U.S. LNG Output Stokes Fears of Glut

President Donald Trump returned to office in January with a pro-oil and gas agenda. He has promoted LNG deals in trade talks with Europe, which agreed to buy $750 billion in energy from the U.S. His administration also lifted former President Joe Biden's moratorium on new export project approvals.

A flurry of final investment decisions followed that will add new capacity totaling 61.5 MMtpy of LNG to an existing export base of 120 million MMtpy. Cheniere Energy, Venture Global, Sempra, Next Decade and Woodside Energy have all greenlit new facilities this year.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects the country's overall LNG capacity to double by 2029. America could export one third of global LNG by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.

Rapid expansion of U.S. LNG could result in a global glut, with the IEA predicting lower prices.

“As new supply comes to market, notably from the United States and Qatar, it should apply downward pressure on prices - offering welcome relief for gas importers worldwide,” said IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security Keisuke Sadamori.

Similar forecasts of lower LNG prices have come from producers including Total and Shell, yet some investors in new export facilities like Woodside and Venture Global say predictions of a glut are overstated.

""We're very bullish on LNG demand for the long term,"" Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill said at an event in September.

Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel predicts demand growth as data centers and more Asian countries replace coal with LNG for electricity generation.

""I think data centers are going to be a massive source of new incremental demand, but you are short today on gas production capacity,"" Sabel told Reuters.

Construction Costs Rising

Labor inflation caused by shortages of skilled workers and rising prices of equipment due to tariffs are increasing construction costs, according to Poten and Partners business intelligence head Jason Feer.

""Costs have increased up to 20% in some instances, and it makes some projects ... uncompetitive,"" TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné said on an earnings call last month.

Venture Global has reported cost overruns at its 27.2 MMtpy Plaquemines LNG facility, while Golden Pass, a joint venture between Exxon and QatarEnergy, is over budget and behind schedule.

To keep projects economically viable, developers have been seeking, and so far getting, liquefaction fees that are up around 15% on average from two years ago, Feer said.

Venture Global, considered a low-cost supplier, is charging $2.30 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) for liquefaction in new contracts. The fee is higher than the $1.75 per MMBtu it charged for LNG out of Calcasieu Pass when that facility first contracted sales, two people with knowledge of its pricing told Reuters.

Cheniere Energy, the largest U.S. LNG producer, is charging a premium of over $2.75 per MMBtu. Woodside is offering 10-year contracts coming in at around $2.90 per MMBtu, said Feer, adding that fees across the broader market had averaged $2 per MMBtu in 2023.

Higher Prices Not Stopping Buyers

The window may be closing for more LNG projects to be developed in the U.S. at this time because of rising costs and the prospect of lower global prices, according to Rapidan Energy director of global gas Alex Munton.

""This bull run must come to an end, it cannot continue forever,"" said Munton.

Still, buyers including ENI and Petronas are snapping up new long-term contracts even in the face of higher liquefaction fees and potentially lower spot prices.

JERA, one of Japan’s largest power generators, says it wants U.S. gas to diversify and avoid an over-dependence on Australia and to meet demand growth spurred by data centers and AI.

TotalEnergies' Pouyanné said many large players are focusing on the bigger picture and locking in new volumes to trade, even if fees are rising. As the market grows, so do trading and arbitrage opportunities.

Even some easing of the market could still create opportunities for more price sensitive countries in Southeast Asia to move away from coal and boost global demand for LNG, the IEA said.",https://pgjonline.com/media/5868/cameron-lng-800.jpg?v=1dc1b245d7ba870,N,,2025-11-06 18:05:14.293178

The rapid growth of AI is driving a major surge in electricity demand in the United States, reshaping how and where new energy infrastructure is built.

This boom risks deepening energy inequality as millions of American households already struggle to afford basic energy needs.

Effective regulation can help overcome these challenges by ensuring large energy users cover their costs, shielding low-income customers from datacenter driven rate hikes while advancing clean, equitable power.

Artificial intelligence is driving a massive technological transformation that is already reshaping many aspects of daily life. The AI industry is expected to grow a staggering 42 percent and become a $1.3 trillion market by 2030. The backbone of this boom takes the form of massive “hyper-scale” data centers that are consuming electricity on a scale that rivals entire cities. As the US positions itself as a global AI leader, US tech companies are pouring millions of dollars into new and larger facilities that can meet their growing demand. The operation of these data centers requires in turn the rapid — and expensive — expansion of ratepayer funded generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.[1]

On its own, the buildout of this energy infrastructure to supply AI might not be so controversial. But it comes at a time when more than 33 million US households — or one in four households in the US — face energy insecurity,[2] struggling to pay utility bills or to heat or cool their homes. The juxtaposition between the energy haves and have nots is glaring. Moreover, as detailed below, the buildout may exacerbate energy insecurity as some of the associated costs are passed onto households least able to afford them. This blog explores how policymakers can leverage the rapid growth of AI to improve energy equity and affordability, particularly for energy insecure households, rather than having it compound the problem of energy inequality in the US.

Rising rates and the question of how to protect consumers

The question of who should pay for the new energy infrastructure needed to meet data center demand remains an open one. Thus far, it appears that residential consumers in regions where data centers are located, including many who are already energy insecure, are footing much of the bill. In some of these regions, monthly wholesale electricity rates have increased as much as 267 percent compared to five years ago, leaving many residents struggling to understand why their bills were rising exponentially and how they would pay for it. But the lack of transparency in the ratemaking process makes it difficult to assess the extent to which residential customers are paying more than their fair share for infrastructure development that primarily benefits the data centers.

These data center–driven electricity price hikes have certainly raised eyebrows. In Virginia, for example, often dubbed the data center capital of the world, they were a major factor in this year’s gubernatorial election, and the candidate who advocated for making data centers pay their fair share — Democrat Abigail Spanberger — won by a wide margin. In many states, regulators have taken action to try to protect residential consumers. The public utility company AEP Ohio, for example, paused new data center approvals in that state until the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio can resolved who should pay for necessary transmission upgrades and guarantee payments for projected electricity demand. Yet even as states experiment with different approaches to ensure the equitable distribution of costs and burdens, the rapid pace of AI growth calls for replicable and scalable policy pathways.

Should policymakers and regulators decide to ensure that the AI boom strengthens rather than inhibits energy equity, the following four policy levers could be crucial.

1. Protect ratepayers from unfair cost burdens

Regulators can direct utilities to ensure that the costs of expanding the grid to accommodate energy-intensive data centers are distributed fairly, so that AI tech companies do not end up socializing their infrastructure costs onto residential ratepayers. Nevada offers a promising precedent. The recently approved Clean Transition Tariff (CTT) would make Google responsible for 100 percent of the costs of the new generation it requires in that state — protecting other ratepayers from higher bills. Similarly, in Pennsylvania, utilities are pushing for data centers to pay their fair share for grid usage instead of avoiding interconnection costs through co-location agreements. These approaches can shield low- and middle-income households from datacenter driven rate hikes.

2. Expand protections for low-income households

States can strengthen or adopt low-income rate classes designed to insulate vulnerable customers from rising energy costs through discounts. Those that already have such rate classes in place, such as Massachusetts, can include new protections preventing across-the-board tariff hikes driven by data center energy demand. Those that don’t have them yet can consider putting them in place in ways that account for AI-related rate hikes. This can help target energy assistance more efficiently and channel the benefits of clean energy investments through on-bill credits.

3. Ensure equitable siting and clean generation

The pace of data center construction is fueling renewed interest in gas-fired power plants and even restarting nuclear facilities. But siting new fossil fuel plants near already overburdened communities — such as those in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” or parts of Virginia — risks worsening pollution and public health disparities, and has already generated public opposition. An equity-focused siting policy begins with a simple principle: do no harm. That means prioritizing renewable energy sources, avoiding fossil development near vulnerable populations, and ensuring that new infrastructure investments do not exacerbate environmental injustices.

4. Unlock local benefits from data centers

Clean energy–powered data centers can also create shared value for surrounding communities. In Europe, companies such as Meta and Google are already doing this by, for instance, recycling waste heat from their Danish and Finnish data centers to warm nearby homes. Similar in-kind energy transfers could directly benefit underserved US communities. For example, excess heat or generated energy from data centers could be repurposed for affordable housing complexes, hospitals, or schools—providing tangible energy savings and community benefits.

The energy challenges of AI are often framed in terms of reliability and capacity — how to keep the lights on as electricity demand surges. But the deeper challenge is one of distribution: who pays, who benefits, and who is left behind? As the US positions itself as a leader in AI, policymakers and industry leaders have a unique opportunity to turn AI’s energy needs into an opportunity to promote equity, protect vulnerable communities, and accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future.

[1] For example, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) predicts that due in large measure to the expansion of data centers, Texas’ electricity demand will double by 2030, requiring it to add 67 gigawatts of generation in the next 5 years — the equivalent of powering 60 million homes.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image_How-AI-Growth-Can-Hyper-Scale-Energy-Equity-and-Affordability.png,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:48.477100

(Reuters) -The Trump administration on Thursday expanded a list of critical minerals it deems essential to the U.S. economy and national security, adding copper, ​vital to electric vehicles, power grids, and data centers, and metallurgical coal, used to make ‌coke fuel for steel production.

The Interior Department's list guides federal investments and permitting decisions and helps shape the government's broader minerals strategy.

The administration is expanding ‌the list amid efforts to boost domestic mining and cut reliance on imports, particularly from economic rival China.

LIST GUIDES FEDERAL INCENTIVES

The list serves as a blueprint for Washington's push to secure supplies of materials needed for defense, manufacturing, and clean energy technologies. It determines which projects qualify for federal incentives, informs national stockpiling and research priorities, and signals to private investors where ⁠the government sees long-term strategic value.

Officials and ‌industry leaders say strengthening domestic production could help insulate the U.S. from potential supply shocks or export restrictions imposed by competitors like China, which dominates global refining of many critical minerals.

The ‍Interior Department said critical minerals ""underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy.""

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer ​with seven mines and control of one of the country's two smelters, said this year it could generate more ‌than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act if the red metal were declared critical.

The Phoenix-based company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits, in Freeport's U.S. mines is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. the company's least profitable region. That fact largely explains why Freeport pushed for the designation.

""We're not looking for ⁠handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic (​copper) production, it's important to recognize that the U.S.​ doesn't have the same grades that we have internationally,"" Freeport CEO Kathleen Quirk told Reuters in March.

Putting met coal on the list aligns with President Donald Trump's support of fossil fuels.‍ Some U.S. met ⁠coal mines have shut in recent months amid ample supply and a reduction in exports to China, which put an additional 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coal this year.

Rich Nolan, president and CEO ⁠of the National Mining Association, said it will continue to seek the expansion of the list to ""ensure that the U.S. has the ‌abundant domestic resources it needs, when it needs them.""

Circularity is no longer optional; it's a regulatory, environmental and economic imperative,"" per a World Economic Forum report.","Finnish technology company Coolbrook has made a breakthrough in plastics recycling by using its electrified RotoDynamicReactor to crack 100% plastic-waste-derived pyrolysis oil into useful olefins such as ethylene and propylene, according to a Team 10+ report.

Coolbrook's tests were conducted in conjunction with the EU Horizon Europe program's Electro project, which looks to demonstrate new technologies linking plastic waste with the petrochemical industry to make the production of olefins used in plastics more sustainable.

The company's RDR technology is designed to achieve 100% carbon dioxide-free olefin production using renewable energy sources, which could be a game-changer for the petrochemical industry and plastics recycling.

Steam cracking is a process that breaks down saturated hydrocarbons, in this case pyrolysis oils, into smaller, often unsaturated hydrocarbons. Coolbrook says its technology does this more efficiently than traditional methods, without the need for dirty fuels, and with a higher selectivity of light olefins, which are highly valued.

Less than 10% of plastic waste is recycled, with much of it ending up in landfills that generate planet-warming methane and leach chemicals and microplastics into the environment, where they can harm plants, animals, and humans.

The Electro project uses new technology to pre-treat plastic waste, providing a feedstock for Coolbrook's RDR, which produces circular materials for reintroduction into the plastics manufacturing sector.

The scalable concept has an initial life cycle assessment showing a 90% reduction in planet-warming pollution over the best available technology being used today.

These efforts support the European Union's objective that all packaging be recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030 and decrease the use of virgin material to reach climate neutrality by 2050.

The introduction of plastic-free alternatives has already begun, but plastics have been interwoven in society enough to make their elimination a difficult task.

The automotive industry accounts for around 12-15% of global plastic demand, and the increased adoption of electric vehicles will push that figure up because of the high mechanical strength and light weight of certain plastics and fiber-reinforced composites that aid in extending vehicle range.

Because of this, the EU will require 20% recycled plastic in new vehicles within six years of the new regulation's implementation, with a bump to 25% in 10 years.

""Without scalable recycling solutions, the industry risks creating a new wave of waste. Circularity is no longer optional; it's a regulatory, environmental and economic imperative,"" per a World Economic Forum report.

Global energy storage capacity is expected to grow tenfold by the end of the decade.","Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly in advanced talks with Samsung SDI for a $2.1 billion battery deal. This shows Tesla’s push for long-term access to cutting-edge battery technology. The deal will likely focus on cylindrical battery cells. It could boost Tesla’s supply chain as the company increases electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage production.

If finalized, the agreement would make Samsung SDI one of Tesla’s key suppliers alongside Panasonic and LG Energy Solution. Samsung batteries might power the EV maker’s new models and energy storage systems, such as the Powerwall and Megapack.

Tesla’s battery demand continues to rise with expanding production at Gigafactories in the U.S., Germany, and China. The company delivered over 1.8 million vehicles in 2024. With the new mass market compact EV coming, battery demand for Tesla may hit 400 GWh each year by 2030.

Why Tesla Needs More Battery Suppliers

Battery supply is the cornerstone of Tesla’s growth. The company’s 4680 cell production is moving more slowly than expected. This limits its ability to meet internal demand fully. As a result, Tesla continues to rely on external suppliers to meet its EV and storage targets.

The chart shows the EV giant’s most recent storage deployments. It reached almost 45 GW in the third quarter of 2025.

Samsung SDI supplies cylindrical cells to BMW and Rivian. The company is also expanding its manufacturing in South Korea, the U.S., and Europe. Tesla can partner with Samsung to diversify its sourcing. This way, it can access high-energy-density, nickel-rich batteries. These batteries improve driving range and performance.

This deal would also help Tesla reduce its exposure to raw material price swings. Battery-grade lithium and nickel prices fell by over 40% in 2024. However, volatility is still high because global demand for energy storage is rising fast.

The Global Battery Boom: A Trillion-Dollar Charge

The global battery market is expanding at a record pace. According to BloombergNEF, annual battery demand could exceed 4,500 GWh by 2035, compared to around 950 GWh in 2024. Electric vehicles account for most of this growth, with stationary storage and grid applications contributing an increasing share.

China remains the largest producer, led by CATL and BYD, which together control over 50% of global battery supply. However, competition from South Korea and Japan is growing. Companies like Samsung SDI and Panasonic are investing billions in new factories in the U.S. and Europe.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been a key driver of this shift. It provides tax credits for batteries and EVs made locally. This encourages foreign suppliers to set up production in North America. Samsung SDI is already building new facilities in Indiana and Tennessee, both of which could supply Tesla in the future.

Innovation at Full Voltage: From 4680 to Solid-State

The Tesla–Samsung deal aligns with broader trends in battery chemistry. Samsung SDI is working on high-nickel NCA and NCM cells. They are also looking at solid-state batteries. These batteries could offer better safety and higher energy density.

Tesla has focused heavily on innovation through its 4680 cells, designed to lower costs by 50% per kWh and improve vehicle range. However, scaling production has been challenging. By combining internal development with supplier deals, Tesla is able to stay flexible as battery technologies evolve.

Meanwhile, global research is exploring alternatives like lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for cost savings. It’s also looking into solid-state batteries for better performance in the future.

Analysts predict that commercial solid-state cells will enter mass production between 2028 and 2030. This timing matches Tesla’s future model plans.

The Broader Battery Market: Growth and Challenges

Battery storage has become central to the global clean energy transition. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that installed battery capacity could jump from about 20 GW in 2020 to over 1,200 GW by 2030 in net-zero scenarios.

BloombergNEF expects 2025 to add 92 GW of new grid-scale storage. This shows how quickly the sector is growing. By 2030, global investment in batteries—across EVs, homes, and the grid—could exceed $1 trillion cumulatively.

Still, the industry faces several headwinds. Supply chain risks for critical minerals like lithium, nickel, and cobalt remain high. Recycling capacity also lags behind growing demand. Governments and automakers are now working to create closed-loop supply chains to recover metals and reduce environmental impacts.

In this landscape, Tesla’s influence remains large. The company’s early push for vertical integration—mining, refining, cell production, and energy storage—has set the pace for other automakers and battery firms.

Tesla’s Expanding Battery Network and Market Influence

Tesla’s collaboration with Samsung SDI is one of many major supply deals the company has formed in recent years. It has strong partnerships with Panasonic for 2170 cells and CATL for LFP batteries. These are used in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China.

In 2024, Tesla signed new deals with LG Energy Solution. These agreements provide more high-nickel cells. This supports Tesla’s expanding Megapack energy storage production in California.

Tesla’s global footprint in energy storage has also expanded sharply. The company’s Energy Generation and Storage division reported a 60% increase in deployment in 2024 than the previous year.

And as seen in the first chart above, it skyrocketed to over 40 GW in Q3 2025. Its Megapack systems are now used by utilities in the U.S., U.K., and Australia to stabilize power grids and support renewable integration.

Beyond its partnerships, Tesla plays a defining role in shaping global battery trends. Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada led the way in large-scale lithium-ion production. Meanwhile, the Texas and Berlin plants are placing Tesla at the heart of EV battery innovation in the West.

Tesla has driven scale, standardization, and efficiency. This helped make batteries cheaper for everyone. Pack prices dropped from about $1,100 per kWh in 2010 to under $140 in 2024, says BNEF.

As more nations set targets for carbon neutrality by 2050, battery demand will continue to surge. Tesla’s push to secure long-term supply through deals like the one with Samsung SDI ensures it remains a dominant force in this transformation.

The company’s reach goes beyond cars. It also impacts energy infrastructure, manufacturing systems, and the global clean energy economy.

The chart shows that global battery supply is projected to rise sharply through 2030, driven by massive factory expansions across China, the U.S., and Europe. In contrast, Tesla’s battery demand grows at a steadier pace, reflecting its focus on efficiency and diversified supplier partnerships rather than pure volume growth.

Outlook: Securing Supply, Scaling Sustainability

If the $2.1 billion deal with Samsung SDI moves forward, Tesla will strengthen its supply resilience and technological edge. The agreement shows a bigger industry trend: Automakers are forming key partnerships because demand for EVs and storage batteries is rising fast.

Global energy storage capacity is expected to grow tenfold by the end of the decade. With battery innovation speeding up, Tesla’s strategy of multi-sourcing and co-developing advanced chemistries could be key to maintaining its leadership.

Whether through partnerships, in-house innovation, or scaling renewable energy integration, Tesla continues to help define the direction of the global battery industry.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2175976435.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:25.075111

Although Denzler said the group does want to see more battery storage, the issue is how it will be financed.","Illinois’ General Assembly passed a package of comprehensive energy reforms last week that would help the state reach its clean energy goals and aims to lower prices for consumers.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act will add battery storage to community solar projects and fund improvements to energy grid infrastructure that advocacy groups say would cost-effectively help the state meet its goal of transitioning to renewable energy by 2050.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who expressed support for the bill in the past, is expected to sign it into law.

“We don’t want to be in the position that we were this year, where we were passing a bill in response to rising energy bills. We want our state to be in a position where we are adjusting energy policy along the way so that we’re not having to have those situations in the first place,” said Kady McFadden, lead strategist and lobbyist for the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, who worked with policy experts to advocate for CRGA.

The coalition includes environmental organizations, businesses and consumer advocates. Clean energy companies, consumers and other environmental groups also lobbied directly for the bill.

This summer, customers of Commonwealth Edison Co.—the largest electric utility in Illinois—faced a 10 to 15 percent rate increase following pricey energy auctions held by the regional electric grid operators that serve Illinois. Customers of Ameren, the state’s second-largest electric utility, saw spikes of 18 to 22 percent. Power-hungry data centers are helping drive that surge.

The CRGA Act was introduced during the spring legislative session by state Rep. Ann Williams, a Democrat representing Chicago’s North Side, but the bill never made it to a vote following disagreements over battery financing, data center regulations and lifting a moratorium on nuclear plant construction. Oil and gas industry groups lobbied against the measure.

But the bill reemerged during Illinois’ brief “veto session” in October. The act, which passed last Thursday, is an expansion of many of the clean energy provisions in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act that the General Assembly passed in 2021, which aim to reduce carbon emissions in the energy and transportation sectors.

Certain provisions in CRGA address energy efficiency, part of a comprehensive plan to contain demand on the electric grid. Notably, CRGA involves the development of a state integrated resource plan (IRP), which could help Illinois reduce skyrocketing wholesale power costs through rigorous energy modeling and consumer analysis.

The IRP would be overseen by the Illinois Commerce Commission in consultation with the Illinois Power Agency, Illinois Finance Authority, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and utilities. The first IRP will be due to the commission no later than Nov. 15, 2026. The second will be due Sept. 30, 2029, with subsequent plans coming once every four years after that.

“There’s no guarantee that the planning will go in favor of renewable energy,” said Jennifer Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council, which advocated for CRGA. “We think, with the data that we know is available, renewable energy is [the] most affordable source of energy when we’re thinking about new capacity. We feel pretty confident it’s going to go in our favor, but it’s not mandated to.”

Walling said the council is excited about smaller provisions of the bill as well, including a pilot for thermal energy networks that can share heating and cooling within multiple buildings; geothermal renewable energy credits; and natural gas efficiency.

Another provision of CRGA affects the Solar for All program, which gives income-eligible residents access to solar power either by subscribing to a community solar farm or, for homeowners, installing panels on their property at little or no cost.

The bill includes a number of small fixes to the Solar for All program to help it better reach eligible people, including in environmental justice communities. The changes also carve out a Storage for All program to help income-eligible residents access solar energy storage.

“One of the big parts of this bill is storage, and there’s no grid in the country in the next few years that is going to be truly resilient without battery storage,” said Kavi Chintam, campaign manager for Illinois at Vote Solar, who helped write some of the Solar for All language in the CRGA bill.

Over the past year, Chintam has worked with stakeholders and legislators to ensure CRGA provisions result in energy savings for Illinoisans, “and that we’re deploying clean energy in a way that is efficient and in a way that’s sufficient for meeting the moment right now with the increasing demand that data centers are bringing, and combating the federal attacks on clean energy that we’re seeing.”

Other components of the plan include providing ratepayers access to rebates to weatherize their homes, purchase efficient appliances and increase funds for low-income energy efficiency programs; launching a virtual power plant initiative to pool thousands of small solar and storage projects; and strengthening the power grid through improvements in infrastructure and grid-enhancing technologies, increasing the amount of clean energy that power lines can carry.

The bill’s effective date would be June 30, 2026. At that point, a short-term virtual power plant program for customers who already receive battery rebates would start up, Chintam said.

Among the bill’s detractors is the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, which said that CRGA would increase costs for consumers rather than control them, especially for manufacturers. The group particularly took issue with the IRP provision and the funding of battery storage.

“One of the fundamental disagreements that we have with advocates is they say that this is adding new capacity, and they claim that battery is capacity. Battery is not capacity, battery is not new generation, battery is storage,” said Mark Denzler, the group’s president and CEO.

Although Denzler said the group does want to see more battery storage, the issue is how it will be financed. He said that according to the Illinois Power Agency, the battery storage provision will cost an additional $7 billion, which will be paid by ratepayers. “We think when it comes to battery storage, they should use the Illinois Finance Authority, which provides low interest financing to bonds … which then doesn’t put the ratepayers on the hook, but makes the developers of battery storage have some skin in the game,” he said.

Denzler is also not happy that the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state’s utility regulator, will get through the IRP process “the ability to determine what Illinois’ energy mix will be … with really no oversight from the General Assembly.”

However, the group is happy about the CRGA nuclear moratorium provision, which lifts the remnants of a longstanding moratorium on nuclear power development. In 2023, Illinois partially repealed its long-standing moratorium on new nuclear units by allowing construction of new smaller reactors.

Denzler said the manufacturers’ association has four priorities to address energy issues: Keep the current fleets operating, extending the deadline of coal and other aging-plant shutdowns for energy transitions; add new generation, including nuclear, gas and renewable energy; invest in transmission lines; and further development of technology like battery storage and carbon capture and storage.

“We need an ‘all of the above’ approach to make sure that we have the energy to power the economy,” Denzler said. “There’s not a magic bullet that’s going to solve this problem.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-974537282.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 13:06:47.528058

Dive Brief:

The U.S. installed nearly 26 GW of new generation capacity between January and August 2025, up slightly from the approximately 23 GW installed over the same period last year, according to the most recent monthly infrastructure report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

As it has for most of the past two years, solar continued to dominate new generation resources, accounting for 2.7 GW out of 4 GW brought online in August alone, and 19 GW — about three-quarters — of generation capacity additions this year.

The report also says FERC reissued a certificate for Williams Companies to construct and operate its Northeast Supply Enhancement Project. That expansion of the Transco gas pipeline from New Jersey to New York was revived following talks between President Donald Trump and Gov. Kathy Hochul in May after the Trump administration briefly froze the Empire Wind project. The White House and the developer of the wind project have told journalists the two sides reached a gas-for-wind deal, while Hochul has denied striking such a bargain.

Dive Insight:

The report shows momentum for renewables continuing, despite the federal government’s emphasis on fossil fuels and nuclear. FERC lists 136 GW of “high probability additions” through August 2028, with renewables, led by solar and followed by wind, accounting for nearly 84%. Natural gas accounts for about 15% of high probability additions.

“Notwithstanding impediments created by the Trump Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, solar and wind continue to add more generating capacity than fossil fuels and nuclear power,” the Sun Day Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong said in a statement. “And FERC foresees renewable energy’s role expanding in the next three years while the shares provided by coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear all contract.”

Large renewable projects that began operating in August include Hecate Energy’s 517-MW Outpost solar and storage project in Webb County, Texas; Gibson Solar’s 280-MW project in Gibson County, Indiana; and expansions at the Roadrunner Crossing Wind Farm in Eastland County, Texas, totaling 254 MW.

While solar and wind made up most of the new generation added in August, a number of smaller gas generators also came online that month, totaling 888 MW. They include: Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Co’s 248-MW A.B. Brown expansion project in Posey County, Indiana; Basin Electric Power Coop’s 245-MW Pioneer Generation Station expansion in Williams County, North Dakota; and Lower Colorado River Authority’s 188-MW Maxwell Peaker Plant in Caldwell County, Texas.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fT8jCHJY2vc1CIavlSZYwb6Ntrr9NM4C9AJVy_hJqEI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UZXhhc193aW5kLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:52.309572

The transformation of America's critical minerals landscape through facilities like the Redwood Materials critical minerals plant represents both immediate strategic benefits and long-term supply chain security.","What Is Redwood Materials' South Carolina Critical Minerals Facility?

The Redwood Materials critical minerals plant has launched operations at its groundbreaking $3.5 billion Berkeley County facility, marking a pivotal moment in America's push for domestic critical minerals independence. This advanced recycling complex brings online sophisticated systems capable of processing 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, establishing a cornerstone of the nation's battery material supply chain infrastructure.

The South Carolina facility employs cutting-edge recovery technologies designed to extract lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper from end-of-life batteries with unprecedented efficiency. Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, who leads Redwood Materials, confirmed the facility's operational status whilst noting that the system has begun processing materials but has not yet reached full capacity utilisation.

Furthermore, combined with Redwood's existing Nevada operations that process 60,000 metric tons annually, the South Carolina plant elevates the company's total domestic processing capacity to 80,000 metric tons. This expansion represents one of the largest investments in critical minerals recovery infrastructure on American soil, positioning Redwood as a major force in reshaping how the United States sources essential battery materials.

Revolutionary Battery Materials Recovery Technology

The Berkeley County location provides significant logistical advantages for battery material collection and distribution throughout the southeastern United States. In addition, South Carolina's position within the automotive manufacturing corridor offers proximity to major vehicle assembly operations from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo, creating efficient collection networks for end-of-life vehicle batteries.

The facility's strategic positioning enables cost-effective transportation links to both raw material sources and end customers. Interstate highway networks, rail connections, and port access facilitate the movement of recovered materials to industrial customers across multiple sectors. This infrastructure advantage becomes particularly valuable as Redwood expands its customer base beyond traditional automotive applications.

Consequently, regional economic development benefits extend beyond the immediate facility operations. The presence of advanced battery material processing attracts complementary manufacturing operations, creating a cluster effect that strengthens the broader clean technology ecosystem across the Southeast.

How Does Redwood Materials Transform Battery Waste Into Critical Resources?

Advanced Recovery Processes and Technologies

Redwood's proprietary processing methods combine hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical techniques to achieve industry-leading material recovery rates. The company has developed specialised systems that can handle various battery chemistries, from lithium-ion configurations used in electric vehicles to stationary storage applications with different material compositions.

The recovery process begins with mechanical dismantling and shredding of battery packs, followed by thermal treatment to separate metallic components from organic materials. Advanced chemical processing then purifies the recovered metals to battery-grade specifications. Quality control systems ensure that recovered lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper meet the stringent purity requirements needed for new battery manufacturing.

However, Redwood has declined to provide specific breakdowns of individual mineral recovery volumes at the South Carolina factory, maintaining proprietary aspects of their processing capabilities. This operational secrecy reflects the competitive nature of critical minerals processing and the value of maintaining technological advantages in recovery efficiency.

Circular Economy Integration Model

The company has established extensive collection networks spanning automotive manufacturers, electronics producers, and battery pack assemblers. These partnerships create feedstock streams that would otherwise contribute to landfill waste or require expensive primary mining operations to replace.

Straubel revealed that Redwood currently sells recovered critical minerals to approximately 20 to 30 companies across diverse industrial sectors. This customer base extends far beyond the electric vehicle market, encompassing aerospace manufacturers requiring cobalt-based high-performance alloys, stainless steel producers utilising recycled nickel, and speciality chemical companies incorporating recovered materials into industrial applications.

Furthermore, the circular model includes partnerships with mining companies that further process and refine Redwood's recovered materials. These relationships create additional value streams whilst ensuring that recycled materials meet the exact specifications required by end customers in various industrial applications.

Why Is Domestic Critical Minerals Production Strategically Important?

National Security and Supply Chain Resilience

Redwood's expansion occurs within a broader context of national security priorities focused on reducing American dependence on foreign critical mineral sources. The Trump administration has emphasised onshoring supply chains for materials deemed essential to national defence, making domestic production facilities like the Redwood Materials critical minerals plant strategically valuable beyond their commercial applications.

The facility positions Redwood as the only major domestic source of cobalt, a critical element used in military aircraft engines and defence applications. Combined output from both facilities produces nickel and lithium volumes comparable to the largest traditional mining operations in the United States, significantly reducing import dependency for these strategic materials.

Supply chain resilience becomes particularly crucial when considering the geographic concentration of current critical mineral production. Many essential materials originate from politically unstable regions or countries with complex diplomatic relationships, making domestic alternatives essential for long-term security planning.

Market Dynamics Driving Domestic Production

Federal policy support has provided substantial backing for domestic critical minerals development through various mechanisms. The facility benefits from a $2 billion Department of Energy loan programme designed to accelerate domestic battery material processing capabilities. Additional support comes through Inflation Reduction Act provisions that incentivise domestic content in battery supply chains.

Industrial demand drivers extend well beyond electric vehicle applications. Data centres requiring massive energy storage systems represent a rapidly growing market segment, particularly as artificial intelligence and cloud computing drive exponential power consumption increases. Grid-scale energy storage applications similarly require substantial volumes of battery materials as renewable energy integration accelerates.

Moreover, aerospace and defence applications create additional demand streams for high-purity critical minerals. Speciality alloy applications in jet engines, military equipment, and industrial machinery require materials meeting exacting specifications that domestic suppliers can provide with greater reliability than international sources.

What Production Capabilities Does the South Carolina Plant Offer?

Current Output and Processing Metrics

Facility Location Annual Recovery Capacity Primary Materials Operational Status South Carolina 20,000 metric tons Li, Ni, Co, Cu Ramping up Nevada (Sparks) 60,000 metric tons Li, Ni, Co, Cu Full operation Combined Total 80,000 metric tons All critical minerals Active

The Redwood Materials critical minerals plant currently operates below full capacity as production systems undergo optimisation and scaling procedures. Redwood has not announced a specific timeline for reaching maximum throughput, reflecting the complex nature of scaling advanced recycling operations whilst maintaining quality standards.

Production capabilities encompass the complete spectrum of critical battery materials. The facility processes lithium for battery cathodes, recovers nickel for various alloy applications, extracts cobalt for high-performance components, and recycles copper for electrical applications. This comprehensive material recovery eliminates the need for multiple specialised processing facilities.

Manufacturing Integration and Value-Added Processing

Beyond basic material recovery, the facility incorporates value-added processing capabilities that transform recycled materials into components ready for battery manufacturing. Cathode active material production represents a key capability, allowing Redwood to supply materials directly to battery manufacturers rather than requiring additional processing steps.

However, the company has scaled back certain manufacturing plans in response to market conditions. Copper foil production, originally planned for both Nevada and South Carolina facilities, has been discontinued in Nevada and will not proceed in South Carolina. This strategic adjustment reflects changing market dynamics and customer demand patterns.

The Nevada cathode production facility, originally scheduled to open in 2024 with 100 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity, remains under construction without an announced completion date. These delays highlight the challenges of scaling battery material manufacturing operations whilst maintaining quality and cost competitiveness.

How Does Redwood's Business Model Address Market Challenges?

Diversification Beyond Electric Vehicle Sector

Redwood has strategically pivoted from its original focus on electric vehicle battery supply chains to serve broader industrial markets. This shift responds to slower-than-expected EV adoption rates and policy uncertainties affecting federal incentive programmes. The bulk of critical minerals produced now serves customers outside the automotive sector.

Industrial applications provide more stable demand patterns compared to the cyclical nature of automotive production. Stainless steel manufacturers require consistent nickel supplies, whilst aerospace companies maintain steady demand for cobalt-based alloys. Speciality chemical producers similarly offer predictable volume requirements that support consistent facility utilisation.

In addition, the company's customer base spans approximately 20 to 30 companies across multiple industries, creating revenue diversification that reduces dependence on any single market segment. This approach insulates operations from sector-specific downturns whilst capitalising on the fundamental demand for critical minerals across various applications.

Energy Storage and Data Centre Applications

Redwood has launched Redwood Energy, a dedicated division focused on converting degraded electric vehicle batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. This innovation extends battery life cycles by repurposing components that no longer meet automotive performance standards but remain suitable for stationary applications.

The company has demonstrated this capability through a 63 megawatt-hour energy storage system paired with 12 megawatts of solar generation at its Nevada campus. This installation powers a 2,000 GPU data centre, showcasing the practical application of repurposed battery technology in high-demand computing environments.

Furthermore, energy storage applications represent a rapidly growing market segment as data centres expand to support artificial intelligence workloads and cloud computing services. Redwood raised $350 million in Series E funding at a valuation exceeding $6 billion, with proceeds partially dedicated to accelerating energy storage system deployment.

What Are the Economic and Environmental Benefits?

Job Creation and Regional Development Impact

The South Carolina facility generates high-skilled manufacturing positions in advanced materials processing, contributing to the state's emerging clean technology sector. These positions require specialised training in chemical processing, quality control, and advanced manufacturing techniques, creating career opportunities in cutting-edge industrial applications.

Regional economic multiplier effects extend beyond direct employment at the facility. Supporting services, transportation providers, and specialised equipment suppliers establish operations to serve the critical minerals processing complex. This ecosystem development attracts additional investment in complementary manufacturing operations.

Consequently, the facility's presence enhances South Carolina's competitiveness in attracting battery manufacturing operations and related clean technology investments. Proximity to domestic critical minerals processing reduces supply chain risks for manufacturers considering facility locations, creating additional economic development opportunities.

Environmental Sustainability Metrics

Battery recycling operations significantly reduce environmental impacts compared to primary mining for critical minerals. Traditional lithium extraction requires extensive water usage and land disturbance, whilst cobalt mining often involves environmentally destructive practices in sensitive ecosystems. Recycling operations minimise these environmental costs whilst recovering equivalent material volumes.

The circular economy model reduces waste streams that would otherwise require specialised disposal or create long-term environmental liabilities. End-of-life batteries contain materials that can pose environmental risks if improperly managed, making recovery and recycling essential for sustainable battery deployment at scale.

Moreover, energy consumption for recycling processes generally requires less total energy input than primary extraction and processing of virgin materials. This efficiency creates carbon footprint advantages that become more significant as the electric grid incorporates higher percentages of renewable energy sources.

What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead?

Market Adaptation Strategies

Political and policy uncertainties create ongoing challenges for long-term business planning. The Trump administration's cancellation of federal grants to battery recyclers highlights the vulnerability of clean technology investments to changing political priorities. Companies must develop resilient business models that can adapt to shifting policy landscapes.

Customer diversification strategies help mitigate these risks by reducing dependence on government-supported market segments. Industrial applications for critical minerals often demonstrate greater stability than emerging technology sectors subject to policy volatility or changing consumer preferences.

However, technology scaling challenges require continuous innovation and process optimisation. Maintaining competitive cost structures whilst achieving high recovery rates and material purity demands ongoing research and development investments. Companies must balance operational efficiency with technological advancement to maintain market leadership.

Competitive Positioning in Global Markets

International competition in critical minerals processing continues intensifying as countries worldwide recognise the strategic importance of domestic supply chains. The Redwood Materials critical minerals plant must maintain technological advantages and cost competitiveness against established operations in Asia and emerging facilities in other Western countries.

Quality standards become increasingly important as customer applications demand higher material purity and consistency. Aerospace and defence applications require materials meeting stringent specifications that provide opportunities for premium pricing but demand substantial quality control investments.

Furthermore, innovation in processing efficiency and material recovery rates creates competitive advantages that are difficult for competitors to replicate. Proprietary technologies and process improvements can establish market leadership positions that generate superior financial returns over extended periods.

How Does This Impact the Future of Critical Minerals Supply?

Industry Transformation and Market Leadership

Redwood's South Carolina facility represents a fundamental shift in how America approaches critical minerals supply security. By establishing domestic processing capabilities that rival traditional mining operations, the company demonstrates the viability of recycling-based supply chains for strategic materials.

The combined 80,000 metric ton annual capacity positions Redwood among the largest critical minerals producers in the United States. This scale enables the company to serve as a reliable supplier for major industrial customers whilst maintaining the flexibility to respond to changing market demands across multiple sectors.

In addition, technology transfer opportunities exist for replicating successful processing methods at additional locations. As demand for critical minerals continues growing, proven recycling technologies can be scaled to serve regional markets whilst maintaining competitive cost structures and environmental advantages.

Long-Term Supply Chain Evolution

Integration with renewable energy infrastructure development creates synergistic opportunities as both sectors expand simultaneously. Battery energy storage systems require the same critical minerals that Redwood recovers, whilst renewable energy projects provide the clean electricity needed for sustainable processing operations.

Export market potential emerges as domestic production capacity exceeds local demand in certain material categories. American-produced critical minerals could serve allied countries seeking to reduce dependence on geopolitically sensitive supply sources, creating additional revenue opportunities for domestic producers.

Furthermore, research and development initiatives focus on next-generation battery chemistries that may require different critical minerals or processing approaches. Staying ahead of technological evolution ensures that recycling infrastructure remains relevant as battery technologies continue advancing toward higher energy densities and improved performance characteristics.

Investment Disclaimer: This analysis contains information about market conditions, company operations, and industry trends that may involve forward-looking statements and speculative elements. Critical minerals markets, battery technology development, and recycling operations involve significant risks including technological challenges, regulatory changes, and market volatility. Readers should conduct independent research and consider professional advice before making investment decisions related to critical minerals companies or related sectors.

The transformation of America's critical minerals landscape through facilities like the Redwood Materials critical minerals plant represents both immediate strategic benefits and long-term supply chain security. As the facility scales toward full capacity, its impact on domestic critical minerals availability and price stability will provide valuable insights into the viability of recycling-based approaches to strategic material security.

Together with partners around the world, We’re helping developing countries secure investment for energy transition.
And now we’re going further in unblocking clean energy supply chains too.","10 years ago, the world came together in Paris…

United in our determination –

To tackle the climate crisis.

A consensus that was based on science that is unequivocal.

And this unity was not just international –

It was there within most of our countries.

There was cross-party consensus in the United Kingdom.

The only question was how fast could we go.

Today, sadly that consensus is gone.

With some arguing this isn’t the time to act….

And saying tackling climate change can wait.

But my question is this:

Can energy security wait too?

Can billpayers wait?

Can we win the race for green jobs and investment by going slow?

Of course not.

Inaction would only deepen these problems…

Drive prices higher…

Leave the call of opportunity unanswered…

And leave our communities exposed to greater instability…

Flooding…

Rising food prices…

Growing migration flows…

And growing threats to national security.

Just look at the tragic destruction brought by Hurricane Melissa.

Lives lost.

Homes, livelihoods, entire communities destroyed…

Islands just trapped in its devastating path.

And so we say today – to our friends in Jamaica and across the Caribbean:

We stand with you.

And look, there is a better path for all of us.

We can choose to rise to this moment…

And to recognise…

That this is not just a problem to be solved –

But also an immense opportunity to be seized.

So the UK is doubling down on the fight against climate change…

As an investment in future generations, yes, of course –

But also, crucially…

As an investment in improving the lives of working people – here and now.

Our aim is very simple:

To make energy a source not of vulnerability…

But of strength.

An engine to create thousands of new jobs…

Bring down household bills…

And end once and for all…

Our exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets…

And dictators like Putin who seek to weaponise them.

Everything we’re doing here is about seizing that opportunity –

Renewing our nation to deliver for our people.

We will bring these opportunities home…

Not by lowering our ambition here –

But by raising it.

That’s why at COP last year…

I announced our world-leading Nationally Determined Contribution….

Aligned with delivering the Paris Agreement in full.

I urge other leaders to do the same…

As the best chance we have of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.

And we are following through on our commitments today.

I am proud to say…

We are delivering the largest investment of clean energy in British history…

And the biggest nuclear building program in a generation…

To take back control of our energy system…

And make Britain a clean energy superpower.

Already our clean energy sector is second only to tech in its rate of growth.

At COP last year…

I announced a £1 billion turbine contract for a wind farm blade factory in Hull.

This year, I’m pleased to announce upgrades to the Port of East Anglia

Which will pre-assemble the turbines…

Using the very same blades made in Hull…

So they can be loaded out to the offshore wind farm in the North Sea.

We’ve also got new deals…

In Belfast – to support two major offshore wind farms in the Irish Sea.

And in Manchester – where we’re building one of the UK’s largest battery sites.

And all of this is in addition to the over £50 billion of investment into UK clean energy industries announced since last year…

And 800,000 jobs expected by the end of the decade.

So from revitalising our coastal communities…

To firing up our industrial heartlands…

Our clean energy revolution…

Is powering millions of homes…

Securing thousands of skilled jobs…

And delivering energy security and national renewal.

And look, this is how we will win in the new era –

By driving forward together.

And we want you to join us.

To amplify our progress at home and around the world.

We are already investing in adaptation and mitigation…

Through our longstanding commitments on the international climate finance.

And last year President Lula and I joined forces…

To launch the Global Clean Power Alliance.

Together with partners around the world,

We’re helping developing countries secure investment for energy transition.

And now we’re going further in unblocking clean energy supply chains too.

So let me be clear –

To my mind, this is a win-win.

The greater our collective ambition…

The more progress we make in tackling the climate crisis…

And the greater opportunities that we create.

For example, just for UK businesses…

Providing goods and services for global net-zero transition could be worth £1 trillion by 2030.

So look – my message is that the UK is all in.

Because we know…

You don’t protect jobs and communities by sticking with the status quo –

You don’t meet a challenge like climate change by standing still…

You do it by embracing change…

Embracing the opportunities…

And doing it together.

This iconic setting eloquently makes that point.

The Amazon rainforest…

Helps to regulate the climate for every person on earth…

And it reminds us that this is a truly collective endeavour.

So –

As His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales said just a moment ago–

Let’s be inspired by this setting –

And let’s rise to meet this moment – together.

(Reuters) — Canada's TC Energy missed estimates for third-quarter profit on Nov. 6, but extended its current earnings growth outlook through 2028 based on what it says is increased demand from AI data centers and the LNG industry.

Robust North American energy fundamentals mean the Calgary-based company now expects earnings growth of 5% to 7% annually for the next three years, CEO François Poirier said on a conference call.

RELATED: TC Energy Puts $700 Million Wisconsin Pipeline Project in Service

""Across North America, the policy environment is becoming increasingly supportive, enabling more timely and cost-effective delivery of our projects,"" Poirier said.

Poirier added he is encouraged by the Canadian government's recent move to designate a potential second phase of Shell's LNG Canada project as being in the national interest, as well as U.S. permitting reforms that are helping to drive demand for new natural gas projects.

TC Energy operates a 58,100 mile-long network of pipelines, supplying more than 30% of the clean-burning natural gas consumed daily across North America.

The company is forecasting North American natural gas demand to increase by 45 Bcf/d by 2035, primarily driven by a tripling of LNG exports and unprecedented power demand from data centers and coal-to-gas conversions.

The company, which has placed approximately C$8 billion of projects into service so far this year, said on Thursday a steady cadence of new project announcements will continue into 2026.

The average size of new projects could grow from the current C$500 million to about C$1 billion next year, Poirier said. TC Energy may look to increase capital spending next year beyond its current C$6 billion range, Poirier added.

U.S. natural gas futures fell more than 4% sequentially in the third quarter, weighing on TC Energy's transport volumes.

Net income from the company's U.S. natural gas pipelines, its largest segment, fell to C$801 million ($571.16 million) in the third quarter, from C$1.3 billion a year ago.

The company expects adjusted core profit for 2026 to be in the range of $11.6 billion to $11.8 billion, nearly 6% to 8% growth year-over-year.

It also anticipates 2028 core profit to be in the range of $12.6 billion to $13.1 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7% between 2025 and 2028.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned 77 Canadian cents per share for the three months, compared with analysts' average expectation of 80 Canadian cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Our backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to realize from existing agreements with our customers for the sale of our battery energy storage systems and performance of services. The backlog is calculated by adding new orders in the current fiscal period to the backlog as of the end of the prior fiscal period and then subtracting the shipments in the current fiscal period. If the amount of an order is modified or cancelled, we adjust orders in the current period and our backlog accordingly, but do not retroactively adjust previously published backlogs. There is no comparable US-GAAP financial measure for backlog. We believe that the backlog is a useful indicator regarding the future revenue of our Company.

Pipeline. Our pipeline represents projects for which we have submitted technical proposals or non-binding quotes plus letters of intent (“LOI”) or firm commitments from customers. Pipeline does not include lead generation projects.

Booked Orders. Booked orders are orders where we have legally binding agreements with a Purchase Order (“PO”), or Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”) executed by both parties.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures of the Company’s calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company believes adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS are useful measures in evaluating its financial and operational performance distinct and apart from financing costs, certain non-cash expenses and non-operational expenses.

We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively may be helpful to our investors in assessing its operating performance. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, the Company’s definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Below is a description of the non-GAAP financial information included herein as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. You should review the reconciliations below but not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (net loss) attributable to Eos adjusted for interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of debt and derivatives, debt extinguishment, and other non-cash or non-recurring items as determined by management which it does not believe to be indicative of its underlying business trends. Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense change in fair value of debt and derivatives and debt extinguishment per common share.

Penn College Workforce Development offers solutions for businesses and employers, individuals seeking career advancement, educational institutions, community organizations and government agencies.","WILLIAMSPORT — Pennsylvania College of Technology’s Workforce Development division has consolidated its program units under a single, cohesive brand, a move that reinforces the department’s aim to complement and extend the mission of the college.

The rebranded Penn College Workforce Development will continue to build skills, improve processes and deliver results that drive success through an array of training programs tailored to meet the evolving needs of the workforce — but branded as one unit, rather than separate entities.

Previously, Workforce Development encompassed several distinct program areas, including apprenticeships, business/leadership, clean energy, computer, health sciences, safety & emergency services, industrial, online courses, plastics, pre-apprenticeships, and transportation, along with three named centers: the Clean Energy Center, the Apprenticeship Center and the Plastics Innovation & Resource Center.

Moving forward, these entities will be integrated under the Penn College Workforce Development brand. Seven key program areas have been reframed to better align with industry needs: building performance, business and leadership, health sciences, manufacturing, polymers, transportation, and tailored workforce solutions. Each area will continue to offer specialized services while functioning as part of a cohesive unit dedicated to delivering hands-on education and fostering strong partnerships with business and industry.

“Our mission is to complement and extend the mission of Penn College by providing needed training, consulting and product development services to improve skill levels and competitiveness for our clients,” said Alison A. Diehl, vice president for Penn College Workforce Development. “This change is a reflection of our commitment to that mission. We’re consolidating our program units under a single, cohesive brand with the college front and center — Penn College Workforce Development. In doing so, we are strengthening our connection to the college, strengthening our brand recognition, recognizing operational efficiencies and cost savings, and affording consistency across our department.”

The rebrand helps the college boost visibility, build trust, open doors and support growth by scaling and adapting to industry demands.

“Industry partnerships are truly at the heart of what we do,” Diehl said. “By working closely with employers, we’re able to design training programs that reflect the real skills and competencies needed in today’s workplaces. These relationships help us deliver meaningful results — whether we’re guiding someone toward a new career path or helping a seasoned employee grow in their role.”

And, she said, the benefits go both ways. Collaborating with businesses allows the workforce development team to gain valuable insight into emerging technologies, evolving skill gaps and the challenges employers face each day. The feedback helps with shaping career exploration for new entrants and advanced training for incumbent workers, keeping programs relevant, responsive and impactful.

In addition to Williamsport’s on-campus offices and labs, Penn College Workforce Development also operates four satellite locations. Penn College at Latrobe, Penn College at Harrisburg and Penn College at Pittsburgh all are primarily training facilities for building performance programs, while Penn College at Wellsboro is used for the practical nursing and emergency medical technician programs.

“While each location has traditionally focused on specific programs, we see an opportunity to strengthen Penn College’s presence across the region, create more meaningful local connections and ensure that all of our training resources are working together to benefit both employers and the college as a whole,” Diel said.

Penn College Workforce Development offers solutions for businesses and employers, individuals seeking career advancement, educational institutions, community organizations and government agencies. Services include consulting and technical assistance, pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship, training programs, and workforce solutions.

“This rebranding is a strategic move to better reflect the depth and breadth of workforce solutions we offer,” Diehl said. “By aligning more closely with Penn College’s brand, we’re making it easier for employers to recognize the full value of our services and strengthening our role as a trusted partner in workforce development.”

Five were investment tax credits and one was a corporate tax break for zero-emission technology manufacturers.
The federal budget released Tuesday proposes expanding the availability of the carbon capture investment tax credit, projected to cost another $3 billion between 2031 and 2035.
DeMarco notes that those two projects could double-dip in the Canada Growth Fund while also earning investment tax credits without reducing their claim amount.
“This is the only Clean Economy investment tax credit where applicants are not required to reduce their amount claimed when combining with other federal assistance,” the report says.","As Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government moves to spend billions more on tax credits to support carbon-capture and storage projects, Canada’s environment commissioner says the money already earmarked has not been spent effectively.

A new audit report released Thursday by Jerry DeMarco said government investments in projects to reduce emissions, like carbon capture and storage, have been implemented poorly, with far less uptake than predicted.

The report looked at nine measures from Canada’s 2030 Emissions Reductions Plan. Five were investment tax credits and one was a corporate tax break for zero-emission technology manufacturers. The others include the Canada Growth Fund and green bonds.

Collectively, they account for $123 billion in projected costs to taxpayers. The federal budget released Tuesday proposes expanding the availability of the carbon capture investment tax credit, projected to cost another $3 billion between 2031 and 2035.

But DeMarco’s report says there was low initial uptake of the tax measures, compared to Finance Canada’s projections.

“For example, fewer than 30 corporations had claimed the corporate tax cut for manufacturers and producers of zero‑emission technologies since 2022, which was 25 per cent of the projected uptake of $61 million,” the report says.

“For the five Clean Economy investment tax credits that we assessed, the Department of Finance Canada had initially projected that $5.2 billion would be claimed by the end of March 2025. The department’s most recent projections, published in March 2025, forecasted that $9.2 billion is expected to be claimed by the end of 2025.

“However, we found that, as of July 2025, only the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit had claims to be paid out, and those claims totalled only $22 million.”

The report did say taxpayers can still submit claims for carbon capture and storage credits until the end of the year for the previous three years — so the uptake numbers could change.

DeMarco’s report also says government investment incentives for the oil and gas sector were risky, given the uncertain future of Ottawa’s industrial carbon pricing plan.

“To be effective, investment incentives in both carbon capture, utilization, and storage and low-carbon hydrogen depend on other important climate change policies, such as the industrial carbon pricing system and the Clean Fuel Regulations,” the report says.

“As such, uncertainty in the future of the industrial carbon pricing systems and federal regulations creates risk to the financial viability of private investment in those technologies.”

The federal budget did promise to strengthen Ottawa’s industrial carbon pricing system but provided no details on how the government plans to do that.

DeMarco’s report also says that of the $2.7 billion set aside for the Canada Growth Fund, which is meant to support technologies like carbon capture and storage and low-carbon hydrogen, $1.7 billion was allocated to only two projects in the oil and gas sector.

DeMarco notes that those two projects could double-dip in the Canada Growth Fund while also earning investment tax credits without reducing their claim amount. The report doesn’t say if this has been happening.

“This is the only Clean Economy investment tax credit where applicants are not required to reduce their amount claimed when combining with other federal assistance,” the report says.

“We found that the two projects funded by the Canada Growth Fund planned to also claim the investment tax credit, resulting in the federal government covering most of the capital cost of these projects.”

DeMarco also called out the government for not publishing a complete list of its fossil fuel subsidies, which had been expected by December 2024, and for not completing the peer-review study it announced in 2018.

As The Canadian Press reported in June, Canada’s progress on the study stalled in 2023 after its partner country Argentina ceased participation, following the election of right-wing a populist leader who has referred to climate change as “a socialist lie.”

“A peer review would increase the transparency of the government’s assessment of financial measures directed at the oil and gas sector,” DeMarco’s report said.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 6, 2025.

(Reuters) -The Trump administration on Thursday expanded a list of critical minerals it deems essential to the U.S. economy and national security, adding copper, ​vital to electric vehicles, power grids, and data centers, and metallurgical coal, used to make ‌coke fuel for steel production.

The Interior Department's list guides federal investments and permitting decisions and helps shape the government's broader minerals strategy.

The administration is expanding ‌the list amid efforts to boost domestic mining and cut reliance on imports, particularly from economic rival China.

LIST GUIDES FEDERAL INCENTIVES

The list serves as a blueprint for Washington's push to secure supplies of materials needed for defense, manufacturing, and clean energy technologies. It determines which projects qualify for federal incentives, informs national stockpiling and research priorities, and signals to private investors where ⁠the government sees long-term strategic value.

Officials and ‌industry leaders say strengthening domestic production could help insulate the U.S. from potential supply shocks or export restrictions imposed by competitors like China, which dominates global refining of many critical minerals.

The ‍Interior Department said critical minerals ""underpin key industries, drive technological innovation, and support critical infrastructure vital for a modern American economy.""

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer ​with seven mines and control of one of the country's two smelters, said this year it could generate more ‌than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act if the red metal were declared critical.

The Phoenix-based company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits, in Freeport's U.S. mines is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. the company's least profitable region. That fact largely explains why Freeport pushed for the designation.

""We're not looking for ⁠handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic (​copper) production, it's important to recognize that the U.S.​ doesn't have the same grades that we have internationally,"" Freeport CEO Kathleen Quirk told Reuters in March.

Putting met coal on the list aligns with President Donald Trump's support of fossil fuels.‍ Some U.S. met ⁠coal mines have shut in recent months amid ample supply and a reduction in exports to China, which put an additional 15% tariff on imports of U.S. coal this year.

Rich Nolan, president and CEO ⁠of the National Mining Association, said it will continue to seek the expansion of the list to ""ensure that the U.S. has the ‌abundant domestic resources it needs, when it needs them.""

The company has brought a system online that’s capable of recovering 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, said Straubel. Initially founded to fill a gap in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, Redwood is in the midst of a broader shift in strategy as it navigates an expected slowdown in EV demand.

The pivot also comes at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing to onshore the supply chain for materials essential to US national security.

Taking into account Redwood’s existing recycling plant in Sparks, Nevada, which recovers 60,000 tons of critical minerals annually, the firm says it is now the only major domestic source of cobalt and produces as much nickel and lithium as the largest mines in the US.

The South Carolina facility isn’t operating at full capacity, and the company declined to set a ramp-up timeline. It also declined to provide a breakdown of how much of each mineral it’s recovering at the facility.

Redwood was founded in 2017 to recycle EV batteries and produce materials like cathodes and copper foils for anodes. The company had said in 2022 that it planned to produce enough materials for a million EVs annually by 2025 and 5 million by 2030, and it had agreements with Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo, among others.

Yet its commercial cathode production facility in Nevada, which was slated to open in 2024 and produce 100 gigawatt-hours of battery components by this year, is still under construction with no announced opening date. While the company had planned to expand copper foil production at both of its facilities, it stopped producing it in Nevada and no longer plans to do so in South Carolina.

The industry has also faced challenges from the Trump administration, which recently canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to other battery recyclers. With the administration’s attacks on EVs further impacting the industry, including winding down federal incentives in September, Redwood has increased its focus on finding other buyers. The bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the EV sector, Straubel said.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel said.

Nickel is used in stainless steel; specialty alloys, or a custom metal blend for niche applications; and industrial chemicals, while cobalt is also used in a number of high-performance alloys like those found in jet engines. While he declined to name them, Straubel said Redwood sells its critical minerals to about 20 to 30 companies, including large industrial customers using the materials in products and mining companies that process and refine them.

The company has also shifted its focus to serving data centers’ burgeoning power demand, starting a new unit this year called Redwood Energy that turns degraded EV batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. Retired EV batteries can still work for large-scale energy storage because those systems put less strain on the hardware. In June, it unveiled a modest 63 megawatt-hour system – the equivalent of about 800 EV battery packs – paired with 12 megawatts of solar on its Nevada campus, powering a 2,000 GPU data center.

Redwood raised a $350 million Series E at a valuation of more than $6 billion last month in part to speed up energy storage deployment. That side of the business is “growing faster” and is “a new focus that we didn’t really know we were going to have a few years ago,” Straubel said.

At the heart of this initiative is a proposed $2 billion Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, complemented by expanded tax credits and a network of strategic international partnerships. This concerted effort aims to transform Canada into a secure and sustainable supplier of the essential minerals vital for clean energy technologies, advanced manufacturing, and national security, significantly de-risking investments and accelerating project development across the nation.

The immediate implications of this ambitious plan are profound. With global supply chains increasingly scrutinized for resilience and ethical sourcing, Canada's proactive stance signals a clear intent to capitalize on its vast geological endowments. The infusion of federal capital, alongside significant tax incentives, is expected to unlock substantial private sector investment, fast-tracking critical mineral projects from early-stage exploration to full-scale production. This strategic pivot not only promises to create high-value jobs and foster economic growth but also positions Canada as a crucial partner for allied nations seeking to diversify their mineral sourcing away from geopolitically sensitive regions.

Unpacking Canada's Critical Minerals Offensive

The cornerstone of Canada's strategy, outlined in the recently announced Budget 2025, is the $2 billion Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund. This fund, set to be administered by Natural Resources Canada and commence operations in 2026-27, is designed to provide strategic financial support through equity investments, loan guarantees, and offtake agreements. It aims to bridge the financing gap often faced by critical minerals projects, accelerating their journey from concept to commercialization. Alongside this, the First and Last Mile Fund, committing C$371.8 million over four years starting in 2026-27, will absorb the existing Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund (CMIF) to provide up to C$1.5 billion in support through to 2029-30. This fund specifically targets the upstream and midstream development of the supply chain, focusing on crucial infrastructure for clean energy and transportation.

Further direct investments underscore the government's commitment. C$443.0 million over five years (starting 2025-26) is earmarked for Natural Resources Canada and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada to support innovative processing technologies, facilitate joint investments with allies, and establish a critical minerals stockpiling mechanism. An additional C$585 million over four years is allocated for critical minerals projects under the Climate Competitiveness Strategy, with C$39.9 million dedicated to expanding clean technology demonstration initiatives globally. The ongoing Critical Minerals Research, Development and Demonstration (CMRDD) Program also continues to provide $192.1 million in federal funding for advancing processing technologies.

Crucially, Budget 2025 proposes significant expansions to existing tax credits. The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC), a 30% non-refundable credit, will now include 12 additional critical minerals, broadening its scope to essential elements like bismuth, cesium, and tungsten. This expansion applies to eligible exploration expenditures renounced after Budget Day and on or before March 31, 2027, leveraging Canada's unique flow-through share structure. Furthermore, the Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit, a 30% refundable credit, will expand its eligibility to include antimony, indium, gallium, germanium, and scandium, particularly benefiting polymetallic deposits.

The timeline of these developments highlights a rapid progression. While Budget 2025 proposals lay the groundwork, the CMIF has already seen calls for proposals open until early 2026 for pre-construction and shovel-ready projects. A significant milestone occurred on October 31, 2025, when Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Tim Hodgson announced 26 new investments, partnerships, and measures under the G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance. These initiatives, following the G7 Leaders' Summit, are collectively aimed at unlocking $6.4 billion in critical minerals projects, involving collaborations with nine allied countries and specific offtake agreements with companies like Nouveau Monde Graphite (TSX-V: NMG) for graphite and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) for scandium.

Market Movers: Winners and Losers in the Critical Minerals Race

The substantial federal backing and strategic partnerships are set to create a fertile ground for Canadian companies involved in the critical minerals sector. Junior mining companies engaged in exploration and early-stage development are poised to be significant beneficiaries, especially with the broadened Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC). This incentive, coupled with the flow-through share mechanism, will attract crucial capital for high-risk, high-reward exploration ventures. Companies with projects containing newly eligible minerals like bismuth, cesium, or tungsten will see enhanced attractiveness to investors.

Mid-tier and major mining companies with existing critical mineral assets or those looking to expand into the sector will also find themselves in a favorable position. The Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund and the First and Last Mile Fund will de-risk large-scale projects, making them more appealing for private investment and potentially accelerating their path to production. Companies like Nouveau Monde Graphite (TSX-V: NMG), which has already secured offtake agreements with the Canadian government, Panasonic (Japan), and Traxys (Luxembourg) for its Matawinie Mine, stand to gain immensely from direct government support and international partnerships. Similarly, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), with its existing operations and a new offtake agreement for scandium, is well-positioned to leverage these initiatives. Companies involved in innovative processing technologies, particularly those that can enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact, will also be strong contenders for the C$443 million allocated for such advancements.

Conversely, companies heavily reliant on less secure or non-Canadian critical mineral supply chains may face increased competitive pressure as Canada strengthens its domestic and allied sourcing. Furthermore, companies that do not align with Canada's stringent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, which are increasingly embedded in federal funding criteria and international partnerships, may find themselves at a disadvantage. While direct ""losers"" are harder to pinpoint, the shift towards a more resilient, domestically focused, and ethically sourced supply chain will inevitably reshape market dynamics, potentially marginalizing those who cannot adapt to these new imperatives.

A Strategic Play in a Shifting Global Landscape

Canada's critical minerals investment strategy is more than just an economic stimulus; it's a profound geopolitical maneuver that fits squarely into broader global industry trends. The world is witnessing an unprecedented scramble for critical minerals, driven by the accelerating energy transition, the proliferation of electric vehicles, and the increasing demand for advanced electronics and defense technologies. Nations are acutely aware of the vulnerabilities inherent in concentrated supply chains, particularly those dominated by a single geopolitical actor. Canada's initiative directly addresses this by aiming to establish a robust, diversified, and secure alternative for allied nations.

The potential ripple effects are substantial. For competitors in the critical minerals space, particularly those in regions with lower ESG standards or less stable political environments, Canada's emergence as a reliable, high-standard supplier could pose a significant challenge. For partners like the United States, Japan, and European Union members, Canada's strategy offers a crucial pathway to reducing their reliance on existing, often precarious, supply lines, thereby enhancing their own economic and national security. This could lead to increased cross-border investment, joint ventures, and technology sharing agreements, further integrating North American and allied critical mineral ecosystems. Related industries, such as EV battery manufacturing, aerospace, and defense, will benefit from a more predictable and secure supply of essential raw materials, fostering innovation and reducing production risks.

Regulatory and policy implications are also significant. The federal government's commitment underscores a supportive regulatory environment, potentially leading to streamlined permitting processes and further policy incentives to attract and retain critical minerals expertise. The designation of critical minerals as essential to defense and security, enabling government stockpiling authority under the Defence Production Act, highlights a strategic shift towards treating these resources as national assets. Historically, Canada has been a major player in traditional mining, but this strategic pivot into critical minerals, with such comprehensive government backing, marks a new era. It echoes past national resource development initiatives but with a modern focus on sustainability, advanced technology, and global strategic alliances, differentiating it from previous commodity booms driven purely by market forces.

The Road Ahead: Navigating Opportunities and Challenges

Looking ahead, the short-term focus will be on the successful implementation of the Budget 2025 measures. This includes the establishment and operationalization of the $2 billion Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund and the First and Last Mile Fund. Investors and industry stakeholders will closely monitor the disbursement of these funds, looking for early indications of project acceleration and new partnership announcements. The ongoing calls for proposals under the CMIF, extending into early 2026, will also be a key area to watch for companies seeking immediate funding. Continued progress on the G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance initiatives, including further offtake agreements and collaborative research projects, will signal the strengthening of Canada's international position.

In the long term, Canada aims to solidify its role as a global critical minerals powerhouse, moving beyond simply extraction to encompass processing, refining, and potentially even advanced manufacturing of critical mineral-dependent products. This could lead to sustained economic growth in the sector, fostering a new generation of high-tech jobs and intellectual property. Potential strategic pivots for the industry might include a greater emphasis on circular economy principles, such as recycling critical minerals, and the development of entirely new processing technologies that are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.

However, challenges remain. The parliamentary approval process for Budget 2025 could introduce uncertainties, and the actual timelines for regulatory approvals for new mining projects can often be lengthy, despite government intentions to expedite them. Market volatility for critical mineral commodity prices could also impact the profitability and investor sentiment for specific projects. Furthermore, ensuring meaningful and equitable engagement with Indigenous communities remains paramount, requiring careful navigation and partnership building to avoid delays and ensure shared benefits. Nevertheless, the opportunities are immense: attracting significant foreign direct investment, spurring technological innovation in mining and processing, and creating a resilient supply chain that underpins the global clean energy transition.

A New Dawn for Canadian Resources: A Comprehensive Wrap-Up

Canada's comprehensive strategy for critical minerals in 2025 marks a pivotal moment for its resource sector and its role on the global stage. The commitment of a proposed $2 billion Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, coupled with expanded tax credits and a robust framework for international partnerships, underscores a deliberate and aggressive approach to securing essential resources for the future economy. Key takeaways include a strong federal commitment to de-risk investments, accelerate project development, and establish Canada as a reliable, ethical, and sustainable supplier of critical minerals to its allies.

Moving forward, the market is poised for robust growth in Canada's critical minerals sector, driven by both public and private capital. While inherent risks such as commodity price fluctuations, regulatory hurdles, and complex stakeholder engagement persist, the overarching governmental support provides a strong foundation for long-term success. This initiative is not merely about extracting resources; it's about building a strategic industrial base that supports national security, drives clean energy innovation, and fosters economic prosperity for decades to come.

Investors should closely monitor several key indicators in the coming months: the formal establishment and initial disbursements from the new federal funds, announcements of new projects receiving significant backing, further international partnership agreements, and any legislative or regulatory updates that could impact project timelines or financial incentives. The performance of key critical minerals companies, particularly those with strong alignment to the government's strategic priorities, will also offer valuable insights into the market's trajectory. Canada is making a clear statement: it is ready to lead the charge in the critical minerals revolution.

Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills.
Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.","Michigan families already know the pain of high utility bills, and unfortunately, those bills are only headed far higher.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief. Thanks to programs created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), homeowners across Michigan and the rest of the country were able to save thousands of dollars on solar, home energy efficiency improvements, and other clean energy upgrades. These incentives lowered the cost of everything from rooftop solar systems to home insulation, giving families a chance to reduce their consumption, cut their monthly bills, and insulate themselves from ever rising utility prices.

The scale of the impact was significant. In 2023 alone, more than 3.4 million American families received $8.4 billion in tax credits that reduced the cost of clean energy and efficiency improvements. And many probably don’t realize those solar tax credits pale in comparison to annual subsidies the oil and gas industry continue to receive year after year. Additionally, here in Michigan, more than 117,000 households were among the beneficiaries, collectively saving over $134 million.

These upgrades didn’t just lower bills in the short term; they created lasting savings that will continue for many years to come, along with providing significant benefits to the grid as a whole, reducing demand and helping to slow down ever increasing rate hikes for all Michigan residents.

But now, those credits are being rolled back. Under a recently passed Republican tax bill, key clean energy incentives will expire by the end of this year. Some, like clean vehicle credits worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs, have already disappeared. Residential clean energy and home energy efficiency credits will vanish at the end of December.

The result is that families who had been counting on these programs to help with the cost of upgrades will lose access altogether.

The consequences of eliminating these programs are serious. According to an Energy Innovation analysis, the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill” will raise annual energy bills by $20 billion in 2030 and $37 billion by 2035. Instead of giving families tools to lower their bills, the rollback forces them to pay more for the same energy. Experts estimate that, had the credits remained in place, Americans would have saved $38 billion on electricity bills by 2030. Now, those savings are off the table, all while oil and gas corporations will continue to receive $10-40 billion in annual subsidies.

These changes come at a time when energy costs are already rising faster than inflation. Nationally, one in six households is behind on electric or gas bills. The combination of higher rates and the loss of federal support means that more families will face difficult choices about how to cover their energy needs.

There are broader challenges on the horizon as well. Energy demand is increasing sharply, driven in part by the growth of data centers. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of U.S. data centers nearly doubled and grid operators are starting to sound alarms. PJM Interconnection, which oversees power across 13 states, warned for the first time that it may not be able to reliably meet demand in the future. If clean energy investment slows, the pressure on the grid — and on family budgets — will only intensify.

Industry leaders are also voicing concern. Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run. One clean energy CEO put it bluntly: “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

For Michigan households, the stakes are clear. Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills. Without them, families will not only miss out on upfront savings but also face higher costs in the years to come.

The coming months represent a narrowing window of opportunity. Families who were considering clean energy or efficiency upgrades need to be aware that the federal support that has made these projects much more affordable is disappearing. Once the credits expire, so will the chance to capture thousands of dollars in savings. And unfortunately for most this window has passed, as wait times and schedules for installations are pushing into the very end of the year.

The silver lining is the fact that as rates continue to climb, especially during peak demand time frames during summer afternoons, solar alone provides the best path to reduce these spiking demand charges and to be insulated from future rate increases. Because solar produces the most energy for system owners at the exact time when energy costs the most. So, as rates climb faster and faster with demand outpacing supply, solar energy systems will only get more and more valuable in the coming years.

Overall, the bottom line is simple: at a time when utilities are raising rates faster than ever and energy demand is putting pressure on the grid, cutting back on clean energy incentives will only make life harder and more expensive for Michigan families. These programs were designed to lower costs, promote energy independence, and build a stronger grid for the future. Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.

But, no matter how much pressure is applied to slow solar adoption, it cannot be stopped because the return on investment will simply be too good to overlook with rapidly rising utility rates, and it is one of the keys to unlocking a successful collective future for us all.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clean-energy-saves-money-1024x6821762445037.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=uERnppgL,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:55.296610

VSB Poland breaks ground on 303-MWp photovoltaic park

© VSB Group/Agata MajasowWroc?aw/Dresden (renewablepress) - Construction has officially begun on one of Poland’s largest photovoltaic parks, located in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. With a planned capacity of 303-megawatt-peak (MWp), the Brzezinka project by VSB Polska sets new benchmarks – also on a European scale.

The PV park, which includes an integrated 106-MW-battery energy storage system (BESS), is being developed on a site covering more than 260 hectares northeast of Wroc?aw. Full commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2027. By then, approximately 70 kilometres of underground cabling will have been laid to connect the facility to the designated grid connection point, and over 467,000 photovoltaic modules will have been installed. With work now under way on the access roads, the project has officially entered the execution phase in the municipality of Ole?nica, including the districts of Brzezinka and Syców.

The PV park with its integrated BEES unit marks the first phase of construction. Planning and approval processes for a wind farm with up to 245 MW are already in progress, paving the way for Brzezinka to become a hybrid park – one of the largest in Europe.

The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by landowners and local officials, including ?ukasz Kasprzak, Deputy Director of the Department of Economy and Promotion, Marshal's Office of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, who emphasises: ""Today's groundbreaking is an important milestone not only for the local community, but also for the entire Lower Silesia region. The Brzezinka project aligns perfectly with the objectives of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship's energy strategy, which envisages the development of modern, low-emission energy sources and strengthening the region's energy security. This investment demonstrates the significant impact that can be achieved through cooperation among the regional government, local partners, businesses, and international investors. Thanks to it, we are creating new jobs, supporting local economic development, and investing in a future powered by sustainable energy. The Brzezinka project is an example of the practical implementation of Lower Silesia's goals in climate protection, innovation, and energy transformation – a direction in which the entire region is consistently heading.""

Hubert Kowalski, Managing Director of VSB Polska, comments: “Our close collaboration with local partners and landowners shows how sustainable energy generation, economic development, and community engagement can go hand in hand to create lasting value.

Fresh water is collected as a gravity-powered siphon tube supplies water to continuously flush the salt away, preventing buildup, according to ETV Bharat.
It's cheap to make from aluminum and cloth and can purify water that contains as much as 20% salt, ETV Bharat added.
Whether in a small village or an island nation, this system could make ocean water a reliable source of fresh water,"" according to ETV Bharat.","A fascinating breakthrough from the Indian Institute of Science can make fresh water from sunlight and gravity.

It's a new take on a standard desalination system that could quench the thirst for some of the world's 4.4 billion people who lack safe drinking water. The setup is particularly effective in remote regions and can make ocean water potable, according to ETV Bharat and research published by Science.

""This system is said to perform the desalination process faster and more cost-effectively than existing methods,"" per ETV Bharat.

Common desalination kits use solar heat or another source, along with a wick, to evaporate and condense water, removing the salt that builds up and clogs the works. The systems have been hard to scale, as well.

The institute team added a siphon, leveraging gravity to aid the process. A fabric wick pulls water from a salty tank. The water is spread over a grooved, heated metallic surface (ideally heated by solar energy) and cooled on another plate just a fraction of an inch away, causing condensation. Fresh water is collected as a gravity-powered siphon tube supplies water to continuously flush the salt away, preventing buildup, according to ETV Bharat.

The setup can produce about 1.5 gallons of water per hour under sunlight, beating the performance of standard contraptions. Units can be stacked to recycle heat and maximize efficiency. It's cheap to make from aluminum and cloth and can purify water that contains as much as 20% salt, ETV Bharat added.

The U.S. Geological Survey reported that an astounding 97% of Earth's water, on and within it, is salty. About 3.5% of the weight of seawater is from the salt it contains, making desalination a vital tool to combat drought-stricken and water-poor places.

NASA has linked our planet's warming, largely due to continued fossil fuel burning, to greater risks for extreme droughts. The agency said that in this case, higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the surface, which is held in the atmosphere, and increases warming in a cycle. It's a problem also impacting the global food supply as plants shrivel.

That's why researchers elsewhere are working to perfect similar desalination concepts. Experts in Canada are developing filters to purify contaminated underground water, as another example.

Fresh water is important to ecosystems all over the planet. They not only sustain life, but also prevent erosion and even flooding, according to WWF. Staying informed about how Earth's overheating, coastal flooding, and other factors are impacting our clean water supply is important for raising awareness of efforts to conserve these resources.

Smarter water use at home can make a difference and save you money. Rain barrels collect rainwater for use in your gardens and flower beds, helping lower your water bill. Using a dishwasher can cut water use and save more than $200 a year — all while letting the machine do the work for you.

In the meantime, the research team in India intends to have a reliable way for people in remote areas to filter water so they don't go thirsty as part of potentially life-saving work.

The roadmap will form the basis of discussions of climate finance at Cop30.
Making it easier and cheaper for developing countries to gain access to private sector capital for their clean energy investments will be key, the roadmap acknowledges.
Campaigners said there was no escaping the reality that rich governments must step up to help the poor, if the world was to avoid the worst of the climate crisis.
We still need to see the money for real support to developing countries if we are serious about climate justice.”","New taxes on the super-rich, fossil fuels, financial transactions and highly polluting and carbon-intensive activities should be explored as key ways of raising the finance needed to help poor countries, governments have been told in an influential report.

The proposal is one of the top recommendations of a new blueprint for global climate finance, the Baku to Belém roadmap, drawn up by the governments of Brazil and Azerbaijan, the current and the previous president of the UN climate Cop process.

In a surprisingly strong intervention, they call for “strengthened international cooperation on taxation, and experiments with voluntary partnerships between countries on, for example, sector-based contributions, highly polluting and greenhouse gas intensive activities, financial transactions and ultra high net worth individuals”.

They add the caveat that countries should “carefully consider potential negative impacts on development priorities and trade and redistribution mechanisms”.

Campaigners welcomed the call. Rebecca Newsom, the global political expert for Greenpeace International, said: “It’s notable that the roadmap recognises new taxes and levies as key to unlocking public climate finance. Given reported profits from just five international oil and gas giants over the last decade reached almost $800bn, taxing fossil fuel corporations is clearly a huge opportunity to overcome national fiscal constraints.”

World leaders are descending on Belém, the Brazilian city at the mouth of the Amazon, for two days of talks starting on Thursday, before the UN Cop30 climate summit formally begins, and finance will be high on their agenda.

The roadmap will form the basis of discussions of climate finance at Cop30. Last year’s “conference of the parties” in Baku set a goal of £1.3tn to be provided annually to poor countries by 2035, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. But there was a bitter taste for many when rich countries pledged to stump up only $300bn of that sum, leaving the rest to come from potential new taxes and levies, the private sector, and related sources.

The Baku to Belém roadmap is an attempt to heal those divisions, by showing how the finance goal can be reached. Mukhtar Babayev, the Azerbaijani minister who was president of Cop29, said: “The roadmap shows there is a clear path to scaling up climate finance to the developing world to $1.3tn by 2035. It is possible, but political will and global action are absolutely necessary.”

He warned: “As temperatures continue to rise and countries submit their next climate plans scaling up finance is the critical factor for success. Countries simply cannot cut emissions if they cannot count on the capital they need to meet their ambitions.”

Developing countries suffering from high debt burdens also need relief, potentially through swapping some of their outstanding debt for investment in projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions or help countries adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, according to the report.

Making it easier and cheaper for developing countries to gain access to private sector capital for their clean energy investments will be key, the roadmap acknowledges. Developing countries currently pay much higher interest rates on loans and capital injections than their rich counterparts, but assistance from the World Bank and other publicly funded institutions could drastically reduce that, making it easier for poor countries to fund their climate projects.

Equity and the social impacts of the shift to clean energy must also be high priorities, according to the report. “Without careful attention to the social dimensions of this transformation, there is a risk of exacerbating inequality, undermining public trust, and slowing progress on climate action. Building fair change together with workers, women, Indigenous Peoples and local communities supported by dedicated funding windows can have catalytic effects.”

The World Bank and other multilateral development banks will also need “replenishment” – fresh capital from the governments that are their shareholders. That may be more difficult to find now that President Donald Trump has dismantled much of US overseas aid, and other countries are also cutting their aid budgets.

Campaigners said there was no escaping the reality that rich governments must step up to help the poor, if the world was to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. Carolina Pasquali, the executive director of Greenpeace Brasil, said: “The inequalities left behind by the inadequate climate finance goal agreed at Cop29 have not been resolved with this roadmap – we still need significantly more public finance for mitigation [cutting and avoiding emissions], adaptation and loss and damage.”

She added: “While the roadmap rightly recognises the gap in concessional finance, including for nature and providing direct access to Indigenous peoples and local communities, it does not go far enough in holding developed countries accountable. We still need to see the money for real support to developing countries if we are serious about climate justice.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35137542b2f13127dc328a9cbc4a5f4760a20bf6/573_0_4502_3601/master/4502.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce0aa9ad566b7b0576093c9a05a89177",N,,2025-11-06 12:08:48.022699

Copper Widely Used

Copper is used widely across the global economy in power generation, electronics and construction.

Freeport-McMoRan, the largest U.S. copper producer with seven mines and control of one of the country’s two smelters, said earlier this year it could generate more than $500 million annually in tax credits tied to the 2022 U.S. Inflation Reduction Act if the red metal were declared critical by Washington.

The Phoenix-based company was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

The average grade, or percentage of copper in rock deposits, in Freeport’s U.S. mines is lower than elsewhere, boosting costs and making the U.S. the company’s least profitable region. That fact largely explains why Freeport pushed for the designation.

“We’re not looking for handouts, but if the government is trying to incentivize domestic (copper) production, it’s important to recognize that the U.S. doesn’t have the same grades that we have internationally,” Freeport CEO Kathleen Quirk told Reuters in March.

The utility plans to build and take ownership stakes in seven planned solar projects and one battery project. It also wants to do the same with two new natural gas power plants, as well as make upgrades to existing power facilities.

Those plans need to be approved by the state Public Service Commission. We Energies says the renewable projects will send energy to the grid every day while the natural gas plants will be used primarily during peak demand times.

The solar projects together would have a generation capacity of more than 1.1 gigawatts, according to filings with the PSC. The battery project would store 180 megawatts. The natural gas projects would have a combined capacity of around 1.4 gigawatts.

For context, 1 gigawatt is enough energy to power 100 million LED Bulbs, or about half the energy generated by the Hoover Dam, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Several data center developments are either underway or planned in We Energies’ service territory in Mount Pleasant, Kenosha and Port Washington.

Data centers are energy intensive buildings, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a commercial office building. Just the first phase of Microsoft’s Mount Pleasant data center campus is expected to need more power than all of the homes in Milwaukee.

In a statement, We Energies President Mike Hooper said the new power plants will help meet that demand while strengthening Wisconsin’s workforce and energy grid.

“Together, these plants and the data centers they power will create thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of full-time high-tech and energy careers,” Hooper said. “And under our customer protection plan, we’re making sure costs to serve new data centers are not shifted to other customers.”

Earlier this year, We Energies asked state utility regulators to approve special rates for data centers that would require data centers to pay for the power they consume, as well as their share of the cost of power plants and distribution facilities built to serve them. The utility asked regulators to approve the proposal by the end of the year.

Brendan Conway, a spokesperson for We Energies, said data centers would be on the hook to pay for the share of energy they receive from a given power plant or solar farm.

“Whether it’s 70 percent of this plant (or) 20 percent here, they are paying 100 percent of their costs for everything from power generation to the poles and wires,” he said.

But Tom Content, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, said he’s skeptical that costs related to powering data centers won’t affect customers, especially because We Energies announced “a huge number of new projects.”

He said the tech companies behind the data centers may pay for all of their own power, but there’s a risk the utility could expand the system beyond what tech companies need.

“Then there’s added costs on the horizon for the rest of the We Energies’ customers. And all these projects wouldn’t be built if there weren’t this wave of data centers coming into Wisconsin,” he said. “It’s just common sense that there are concerns that costs could certainly be impacted by this.”

Beyond data centers, Conway said the plan also supports load growth from other economic development in Wisconsin.

The new proposals are in addition to two other new power plant projects the utility is pursing. We Energies received PSC approval this past spring to build two new natural gas power plants in southeastern Wisconsin.

We Energies seeks ownership stake in 7 solar projects

We Energies and Madison Gas & Electric together are seeking an ownership stake in five solar projects located in Waushara, Juneau, Oconto, Adams and Wood counties. One of those projects is located in Marquette County, Michigan. The project in Waushara County would also include a battery storage facility.

In each of those projects, We Energies would own 90 percent of the solar development and Madison Gas & Electric would own the remaining 10 percent, according to applications filed with the PSC.

The estimated cost of acquiring and constructing all five of those projects is more than $2.5 billion, according to the applications.

In a statement, Madison Gas & Electric President Jeff Keebler said the partnership will help the Madison utility meet its carbon reduction goals.

“With our current plans, by 2030, we will have added more than 40 renewable generation and battery storage projects since 2015, totaling more than 750 MW, propelling us toward our goal of net-zero carbon electricity by 2050,” Keebler stated.

We Energies and its sister company Wisconsin Public Service are looking to split ownership 50-50 for a 180-megawatt solar project in Jefferson and Walworth counties. The estimated cost of acquiring and constructing that project is $410.8 million, according to the application.

For the seventh project, We Energies is looking to purchase and construct a 100-megawatt solar farm in Jefferson County for around $276.9 million, according to the application.

The developers behind those projects range from Chicago-based Invenergy to Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources.

Dan Krueger is executive vice president of infrastructure and generation planning at WEC Energy Group, the parent company of We Energies. He said the mix of renewables and natural gas reflects the company’s “all of the above” approach to energy generation.

“That’s why we proposed that mix,” he said. “It’s to provide as much energy as we can at the lowest price possible, while making sure that everything is in place to ensure reliability does not flinch.”

According to the applications, We Energies hopes to have all seven solar projects in service by the end of 2029, though some could come into service by the end of 2028.

We Energies asks to build 2 more natural gas plants

We Energies also filed applications to acquire the Foundry Ridge Energy Center in Walworth County and the Red Oak Ridge Energy Center in Kenosha County, a pair of proposed natural gas plants being developed by Invenergy.

The cost of acquiring and constructing the 270-megawatt Foundry Ridge project is about $564.2 million, according to We Energies’ application. Meanwhile, the cost of acquiring and building the 1.1 gigawatt Red Oak Ridge project is about $1.77 billion, the application for that project states.

We Energies hopes to begin construction on both projects in 2026, with Foundry Ridge expected to come into service by the end of 2028 and Red Oak Ridge coming online by the end of 2029, according to the applications.

Krueger said We Energies and Invenergy have worked together in the past on projects like the Paris Solar Farm in Kenosha County, and have a strong partnership. He said the natural gas projects will help ensure the reliability of the energy grid.

“When there’s a gap that just can’t be met, and we need power very quickly, these plants are going to come online. They’re going to fill those energy needs and then we’ll bring them back offline as soon as possible,” he said.

Both projects faced opposition from state environmental groups. Criticisms include concern that burning more fossil fuels will worsen the effects of climate change and lead to more pollution.

Krueger said it’s not realistic for the utility to meet all of the expected demand growth purely with renewable energy.

“We can’t control when the sun shines, we can’t control when the wind blows —and we try to make the most of both of them and how they overlap,” he said. “Our first obligation to our customers is to make sure the power is always there no matter what the weather is.”

In addition to the new plants and solar farms, Krueger said We Energies is also investing in upgrades to a natural gas plant in Port Washington that will allow the plant produce more power in the summer months, and upgrading its coal-fired Elm Road Generating Station in Oak Creek to be able to run on both coal and natural gas.

It requires emissions reporting from direct emissions sources that exceed 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year.
Trade Policy and Oil and Gas Export Advantages: U.S. oil and gas producers are differentiating their products.
Differentiated Oil and Gas Exports: The oil and gas industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions.","The integrity, reliability, and continued operation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) are essential for ensuring accurate emissions data, corporate risk management, and successful deployment of federal tax incentives for key energy technologies. EPA’s proposed rule “Reconsidering the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program” (RIN 2060-AW76) would remove all but one source category from the program and would suspend reporting under the remaining category until 2034.

Reducing regulatory burdens and administrative costs should always be a priority, but the abrupt and near-complete repeal of the GHGRP would have significant negative impacts on the competitiveness of several U.S. economic sectors, including AI, oil and gas, and industrial manufacturing.

We do not discount the fact that the GHGRP can create regulatory and financial burdens for commodity and energy producers. However, in the aggregate, the GHGRP data infrastructure and EPA’s centralized repository are invaluable to American companies because of the increasing pivot towards greenhouse gas–based trade instruments in Europe and elsewhere. What’s more, entire tax credit regimes that are critical to American competitiveness in emerging technology sectors depend on the program’s administration. There’s a middle ground that requires neither business as usual nor a complete destruction of the program and its attendant benefits: a voluntary, opt-in approach to emissions reporting that maintains the trusted, consolidated platform for information. This solution would benefit those who wish to opt in without burdening those who choose not to.

Executive Summary

A complete repeal of the GHGRP and subsequent proliferation of private, state, and international regulations would lead to

1. A blunting of the United States’ competitive edge in artificial intelligence and data-center development

2. The loss of key data for efficient oil and gas production and the loss of industry’s access to global markets

3. Bureaucratic chaos for emerging energy technologies that use federal funding

4. Increased cost in exchange for lower-quality reporting for companies, including increased regulatory burdens imposed by states

Allowing companies to continue to comply with the GHGRP in some capacity would mitigate these damages and enable the continued growth of domestic energy and technology sectors.

History of the GHGRP

The GHGRP did not start as a mandate for climate regulations. Rather, it was designed under a Republican administration as a core program for information collection and transparency.

Legislative Mandate and Inception

The GHGRP was signed into law in 2007 under President George W. Bush as a voluntary program and enacted in the 2008 Appropriations Consolidation Act. The law directed EPA to establish a program for the reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions above certain thresholds across sectors of the U.S. economy. The EPA finalized the rule in 2009, and data collection began in 2010.

Program Scope: The program requires large GHG emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and injection sites to report their annual emissions. It currently covers approximately 85–90 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions from over 8,000 unique sources. It requires emissions reporting from direct emissions sources that exceed 25,000 metric tons CO2e per year. Some sources, including those involved in aluminum, cement, and ammonia production; electricity generation; and landfills, are required to report emissions regardless of the volume of emissions.

Legal Authority: As directed by Congress, in its initial rulemaking, EPA cited multiple sections of the Clean Air Act (Sections 114, 208, 821) as the legal basis for implementing the program compulsorily.

How the GHGRP Creates Value for Business

For companies with emitting facilities or covered operations in the United States, the GHGRP provides a centralized, standardized, government-backed, and cost-effective mechanism for emissions accounting, which is increasingly critical for internal management and external credibility. Over the past decade, EPA has developed rigorous technical methodologies for calculating GHG emissions from over two dozen source categories, providing a comprehensive and internally consistent accounting framework.

Verifiable Government Data and Cost-Effectiveness

The GHGRP’s utility stems from its status as a single, unified federal standard for emissions monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV).

Trade Policy and Oil and Gas Export Advantages: U.S. oil and gas producers are differentiating their products. The GHGRP provides publicly accessible, government-verified facility-level data, which can demonstrate the superiority of American energy and commodity exports without forcing businesses to develop and adopt new voluntary standards that lack the support of the U.S. government.

Advantage in AI and Data-Center Development: As the AI race ramps up, the United States has established a strong lead by making use of its robust infrastructure, policy, and resource advantages. However, as new interconnection and generation costs increase emissions and (in some cases) electricity rates, large-scale data-center development has increasingly yielded local resistance. The GHGRP provides hyperscalers a turnkey reporting framework to address transparency concerns.

Low Cost of Compliance: Compliance with the GHGRP, while requiring initial investment, is generally of relatively low cost to reporting entities compared to the burden and expense of independent third-party verification, which would otherwise be required to meet investor or regulatory demands. By providing an inherently government-verified and quality-assured dataset, the GHGRP eliminates the need for redundant, costly audits across various voluntary frameworks, thus streamlining corporate reporting and reducing administrative overhead. There is evidence and concern in the semiconductor industry that the full repeal of the GHGRP would result in the proliferation of regulations as states replace the GHGRP with their own reporting systems, which may or may not be cohesive and transferable from state to state.

Internal Emissions Management: The detailed methodologies mandated by the GHGRP help businesses track and compare emissions year over year, identify energy inefficiencies, minimize waste, and find opportunities to save money through operational improvements.

Alignment with Other Key Federal Programs: Facilities reporting under the GHGRP may also be subject to reporting under other administrative programs such as tax credits or Underground Injection Control programs. The GHGRP is intentionally designed to be coordinated with and conducive to the needs of these programs to avoid duplicative efforts and reduce administrative burdens.

Key Sectoral Importance

Oil and Gas Sector

The oil and gas sector is a primary focus of the GHGRP, mainly through Subpart RR, VV, and W (Geologic Sequestration, Enhanced Oil Recovery, Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems) emissions.

Differentiated Oil and Gas Exports: The oil and gas industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions. While the rule acknowledges that Subpart W reporting will be reinitiated in 2034 (except for the distribution segment), the GHGRP provides immense value for the oil and gas sector today beyond the future implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge. GHGRP data is vital for

Investment and Markets: The GHGRP identifies lower-emissions-intensity oil and gas products so their producers can access premium international markets that increasingly require verifiable low-carbon sourcing. The GHGRP’s granular data allows companies to benchmark their performance and demonstrate superiority over competing exporters. Without the GHGRP, American oil and gas producers will not have a rigorous and consistent benchmark against which to demonstrate their competitive advantage. Leading liquified natural gas (LNG) markets such as Japan and the European Union are implementing policies to regulate the carbon intensity of imported LNG.

Cost Savings and Increased Capacity: When they know where methane leaks are occurring, companies are better able to mitigate those leaks and ensure that methane reaches its end use in power or commodities. This increases the production and efficiency of American natural gas.

Artificial Intelligence Sector

The AI sector and its rapidly expanding need for data centers are increasingly relevant to the GHGRP.

Energy and Emissions Footprint: The vast computational resources required for training and running AI models demand massive amounts of electricity, leading to large GHG emissions from their captive power generation. Policymakers and corporate leaders mutually benefit from understanding the emissions impact of these facilities, especially as a tool to identify regions with low-carbon power, which private industry is now demanding.

GHGRP Link: Large data centers (with colocated power) and related manufacturing facilities often exceed the reporting threshold of 25,000 tCO2e under GHGRP, especially for their combustion sources (Subpart C) and industrial gas usage.

Public Acceptance: As AI’s energy demand comes under scrutiny, GHGRP data provides a credible, government-verified emissions disclosure mechanism that helps the sector manage its public perception and meet growing stakeholder pressure for sustainable operations. The GHGRP gives data-center developers, users, and power suppliers quality-assured assessments of a given operation’s full emissions impact on a power system.

The Role of the GHGRP for Emerging Technologies and Federal Investment

The GHGRP is indispensable for the operation and integrity of two major federal incentives for emerging energy technologies: Section 45Q and Section 45V tax credits. A full repeal would force the IRS to revoke and update current verification and compliance guidance for crucial innovation tax credits included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This would strain internal resources at the IRS and delay or prevent private capital from being deployed.

Section 45Q: Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit, which provides a credit per ton of securely stored or utilized carbon, depends on the GHGRP for its MRV requirements.

Projects claiming the credit for permanent geologic storage (e.g., Class VI wells) or enhanced oil recovery (e.g., Class II wells) must adhere to GHGRP Subpart RR or VV, respectively. Subparts RR and VV mandate a detailed, EPA-approved plan for monitoring and reporting.

The amount eligible for the 45Q credit is quantified and publicly reported through the GHGRP. This linkage ensures that the IRS has a validated, standardized, and transparent mechanism to verify the performance-based nature of the credit before taxpayer money is claimed, thereby safeguarding against fraud.

Section 45V: Clean Hydrogen Production

The 45V tax credit, providing up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen based on its lifecycle emissions, also relies on GHGRP’s foundational data.

Lifecycle Emissions Analysis: While 45V uses the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model for calculating lifecycle emissions intensity, the input data for the emissions associated with hydrogen production (e.g., from natural gas reformers using carbon capture or from manufacturing inputs) often draws from the verifiable facility-level data collected by the GHGRP (e.g., Subparts C and W data).

Blue Hydrogen Projects: For blue hydrogen projects (produced from natural gas), the required capture and secure storage must be reported under the same GHGRP Subpart RR standards that govern the 45Q credit, making GHGRP compliance a prerequisite for maximizing the 45V credit value.

Conclusion

The GHGRP is a crucial piece of economic infrastructure. It provides the verifiable data that underpins corporate accountability and is the cost-effective, standardized mechanism required to validate multi-billion-dollar investments in the U.S. energy economy through the 45Q and 45V tax credits. Weakening the program would undermine the integrity of these incentives and diminish U.S. competitiveness in the global energy technology landscape.

EPA should reconsider its proposed rule dismantling the GHGRP and instead pursue a voluntary, opt-in approach to the program.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/d8lrla4f/staging/ca60dde0b5d72df0c6bc75f6f4c628bd384de96b-3840x1920.png,N,,2025-11-06 12:09:00.513226

Also yesterday, SolarEdge announced a collaboration with German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon to build solid-state transformers (SST) for use in data centres. Growing electricity demand from data centres has been a key topic of conversation in the energy sector this year, but SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir said on a conference call to discuss the results that SolarEdge is looking at the collaboration “as something that is not going to be a major investment from our side”.

Responding to the US policy environment

Nir also fielded several questions on the topic of US policy, particularly on the topic of tariffs imposed on goods imported from overseas, and the tightening of foreign entity of concern (FEOC) legislation that will likely disrupt international trade further. The company’s financial results suggested that tariffs had a negative impact of 2% on gross margin, and Kir said that he expects the impact on margin in the fourth quarter to be similar.

“We are extremely focused on diversifying and optimising our supply chain to address this dynamic tariff environment,” said Nir. “At the same time, the quality of the availability of our products is very important to us. The impact also may be mitigated by some pricing actions that we may take.”

While SolarEdge has not historically hosted significant manufacturing capacity in the US—entering the space for the first time in July 2024—Nir expressed optimism that projects in the US using SolarEdge products will still be able to benefit from investment tax credit (ITC) support, despite the government’s tightening of eligibility criteria for such tax credits.

“Certain partners have safe harboured with us through the 5% method,” said Nir, referring to the fact that energy projects with less than 1.5MW of capacity can secure ITC support by spending 5% of a project’s total costs within a certain timeframe. “We designed and executed customised safe harbouring strategies [and] such transactions have several benefits. For customers, it lets them [have] quality projects over multiple years for lower capital outlay.”

For larger projects that are ineligible for this 5% spend threshold, they must pass a “physical work test” to demonstrate that “physical work of a significant nature” has started at the project. While this is a more subjective assessment, Nir said that SolarEdge has worked closely with its partners at larger projects to ensure that construction work will be completed quickly, and to a standard that will pass this assessment.

“By helping our customers safe harbour through the physical work of significant nature method, we are able to manufacture and deliver the full product closer to the time the customer needs it,” explained Nir. “Therefore, we can manage the manufacturing over time and there is no fall forward of revenue typically associated with a 5% safe harbour transaction.”

Commercial-scale inverters and storage to drive future growth

Nir also said that the company’s strengths are “even more pronounced” in the commercial and industrial (C&I) space in the US, and that SolarEdge is “the only scale player capable of delivering a non-FEOC and domestic content-compliant C&I solution.”

While the company has not published inverter sales per market segment since the first quarter of 2025, commercial inverters has historically been a significant part of SolarEdge’s sales output, as shown in the graph below.

Nir added that he expects the company to sell well in the European C&I space too, particularly for C&I BESS systems, due to the fact that the company’s distribution partners have “normalised levels of inventory” so are receptive to receiving and selling on new products.

“Due to the fact that [products] are going to be manufactured in the US and exported to Europe, this allows us to be more competitive in the marketplace without sacrificing margin necessarily and all of these reasons are giving us optimism [as] there is definitely room to grow,” added Nir.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief.
Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run.
Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills.
Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.","Michigan families already know the pain of high utility bills, and unfortunately, those bills are only headed far higher.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief. Thanks to programs created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), homeowners across Michigan and the rest of the country were able to save thousands of dollars on solar, home energy efficiency improvements, and other clean energy upgrades. These incentives lowered the cost of everything from rooftop solar systems to home insulation, giving families a chance to reduce their consumption, cut their monthly bills, and insulate themselves from ever rising utility prices.

The scale of the impact was significant. In 2023 alone, more than 3.4 million American families received $8.4 billion in tax credits that reduced the cost of clean energy and efficiency improvements. And many probably don’t realize those solar tax credits pale in comparison to annual subsidies the oil and gas industry continue to receive year after year. Additionally, here in Michigan, more than 117,000 households were among the beneficiaries, collectively saving over $134 million.

These upgrades didn’t just lower bills in the short term; they created lasting savings that will continue for many years to come, along with providing significant benefits to the grid as a whole, reducing demand and helping to slow down ever increasing rate hikes for all Michigan residents.

But now, those credits are being rolled back. Under a recently passed Republican tax bill, key clean energy incentives will expire by the end of this year. Some, like clean vehicle credits worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs, have already disappeared. Residential clean energy and home energy efficiency credits will vanish at the end of December.

The result is that families who had been counting on these programs to help with the cost of upgrades will lose access altogether.

The consequences of eliminating these programs are serious. According to an Energy Innovation analysis, the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill” will raise annual energy bills by $20 billion in 2030 and $37 billion by 2035. Instead of giving families tools to lower their bills, the rollback forces them to pay more for the same energy. Experts estimate that, had the credits remained in place, Americans would have saved $38 billion on electricity bills by 2030. Now, those savings are off the table, all while oil and gas corporations will continue to receive $10-40 billion in annual subsidies.

These changes come at a time when energy costs are already rising faster than inflation. Nationally, one in six households is behind on electric or gas bills. The combination of higher rates and the loss of federal support means that more families will face difficult choices about how to cover their energy needs.

There are broader challenges on the horizon as well. Energy demand is increasing sharply, driven in part by the growth of data centers. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of U.S. data centers nearly doubled and grid operators are starting to sound alarms. PJM Interconnection, which oversees power across 13 states, warned for the first time that it may not be able to reliably meet demand in the future. If clean energy investment slows, the pressure on the grid — and on family budgets — will only intensify.

Industry leaders are also voicing concern. Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run. One clean energy CEO put it bluntly: “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”

For Michigan households, the stakes are clear. Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills. Without them, families will not only miss out on upfront savings but also face higher costs in the years to come.

The coming months represent a narrowing window of opportunity. Families who were considering clean energy or efficiency upgrades need to be aware that the federal support that has made these projects much more affordable is disappearing. Once the credits expire, so will the chance to capture thousands of dollars in savings. And unfortunately for most this window has passed, as wait times and schedules for installations are pushing into the very end of the year.

The silver lining is the fact that as rates continue to climb, especially during peak demand time frames during summer afternoons, solar alone provides the best path to reduce these spiking demand charges and to be insulated from future rate increases. Because solar produces the most energy for system owners at the exact time when energy costs the most. So, as rates climb faster and faster with demand outpacing supply, solar energy systems will only get more and more valuable in the coming years.

Overall, the bottom line is simple: at a time when utilities are raising rates faster than ever and energy demand is putting pressure on the grid, cutting back on clean energy incentives will only make life harder and more expensive for Michigan families. These programs were designed to lower costs, promote energy independence, and build a stronger grid for the future. Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.

But, no matter how much pressure is applied to slow solar adoption, it cannot be stopped because the return on investment will simply be too good to overlook with rapidly rising utility rates, and it is one of the keys to unlocking a successful collective future for us all.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clean-energy-saves-money.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 12:08:23.105388

Furthermore, the budget allocates C$585 million over four years under a new Climate Competitiveness Strategy to support various critical minerals projects.
This funding is intended to support processing technologies, joint investments with allied nations in Canadian projects, and the stockpiling of critical minerals to reinforce both Canadian and allied national security.
Expansion of Exploration Tax Credits and Industrial Incentives In an effort to stimulate exploration, the government plans to broaden the eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC).","Canada’s Liberal government on Tuesday proposed a C$2 billion ($1.4 billion) sovereign fund for critical minerals, alongside hundreds of millions in new mining industry spending and an expansion of exploration tax credits, according to the federal budget released on April 1. The initiative aims to bolster domestic supply chains, attract global investment, and strengthen national security by securing a reliable supply of critcal minerals essential for defense, semiconductors, and clean energy technologies.

Core Budget Measures Target Critical Minerals

The centerpiece of the plan is the Canada Critical Minerals Investment Fund, which will be managed by Natural Resources Canada and is designed to provide equity investments, loan guarantees, and offtake agreements for eligible critical mineral projects and companies. Budget documents indicate Natural Resources Canada will receive C$50 million over five years to facilitate the fund's establishment.

An additional key investment vehicle, the First and Last Mile Fund, is earmarked for near-term critical minerals projects to expedite their transition to production. This fund will receive approximately C$372 million over four years, starting in fiscal year 2026-27, and will absorb the existing Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund, utilizing its existing funding envelope to provide up to C$1.5 billion in support through 2029-30.

Furthermore, the budget allocates C$585 million over four years under a new Climate Competitiveness Strategy to support various critical minerals projects. Another significant expenditure is C$443 million over five years to be shared between Natural Resources Canada and the department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development. This funding is intended to support processing technologies, joint investments with allied nations in Canadian projects, and the stockpiling of critical minerals to reinforce both Canadian and allied national security.

Expansion of Exploration Tax Credits and Industrial Incentives

In an effort to stimulate exploration, the government plans to broaden the eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC). This expansion will now include 12 new minerals crucial for various strategic sectors: bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten. The CMETC expansion applies to specific exploration expenditures for these minerals and complements Canada’s existing flow-through share structure, a mechanism often used to channel capital from investors into junior mining companies.

The government is also moving to replace the existing industrial emissions cap with a new industrial emissions price, which will be set by Ottawa in consultation with the provinces and territories. This measure is intended to align with Canada's broader goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Moreover, the budget proposes new incentives designed to reduce the tax on capital spending, such as on buildings for a critical minerals’ processor, potentially lowering it to 0.4%. This compares favorably to a 12% tax rate in the United States on similar infrastructure spending, according to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), a move aimed at recouping manufacturing jobs lost to south of the border.

Industry Reaction and Market Context

The mining sector quickly welcomed the government's commitment. Pierre Gratton, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), stated that the budget confirms the federal government's “unwavering commitment to the Critical Minerals Strategy released three years ago.”

“These measures, taken together, send a powerful signal to the mining industry, global investors and Canada’s allies that Canada is very serious about improving the competitiveness of Canada’s mining industry,” Gratton said in a statement. He later added that the proposals promise to ""usher in a new era in mining investment,” creating high-paying jobs and boosting exports.

The new spending and incentives are framed within a broader global context of intensified competition for critical minerals, which are vital inputs for the electric vehicle battery supply chain and renewable energy infrastructure. By strengthening its domestic mining and processing capabilities, Canada aims to establish itself as a reliable, Western alternative to supply sources currently dominated by other nations.

The overall federal budget forecasts a C$78.3 billion deficit for the fiscal year ending March 31, with a plan to cut 40,000 public sector jobs by fiscal year 2028-29. The budget requires approval in Parliament, where Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government holds a minority of seats, necessitating support from opposition lawmakers for passage.

30%: At Tesla, It's Elon's Way Or The Highway

2026 Tesla Model 3 Standard

At Tesla’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, on Thursday afternoon, the company will release the results of the long-awaited shareholder vote, which determines whether Musk continues to lead the company or leaves to pursue his AI ambitions elsewhere.

Given Musk’s immense sway over his fan base, analysts widely expect the vote to pass in his favor. If it does, he’ll need to hit a series of ambitious performance targets to unlock the payout. That includes deploying one million robotaxis and delivering 20 million vehicles over the next decade.

Musk will also have to prove his worth by driving Tesla’s market capitalization to $8.5 trillion in 12 separate tranches over time. And as Reuters reported earlier, Musk gets paid billions even if he misses targets, and just attains some smaller goals in the short term.

But not all shareholders share the same view. Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, is one of Tesla’s top shareholders. The group said this week that it was voting against the pay package. Here’s what Norges said in a statement:

While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation.

And some analysts are skeptical of the pay package as well. Here’s more from CNBC:

Shareholder advocate and governance expert James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, is also opposing the plan. The company needs to address a number of risks, he said, especially around demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits that have long incentivized purchases.

“Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,” McRitchie said. “There’s a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.”

Sooner or later, Tesla will have to face reality. Its stock has soared largely on hopes and dreams, while the robotaxis still rely on human drivers to supervise and intervene as the vehicles break traffic rules. And sales keep sliding in every market where Tesla operates.

Tesla’s core profits still come from its passenger car business, which it seems to be sidelining as it pivots towards humanoid robots and AI. Eventually, the company will need to confront the limits of those dreams and find a more sustainable path forward.

60%: Lucid Cuts Production Target For This Year

Wall Street wasn’t happy with the earnings EV start-up Lucid Motors reported on Wednesday, despite its third-quarter revenue jumping 68% year-over-year to $336 million. The company also lowered its 2025 production target to 18,000 units, according to Reuters. It was between 18,000 and 20,000 units before.

But let’s ignore the Street for a moment, because young start-ups don't really deliver the quarterly miracles investors are hoping for. (Not in the automotive space, anyway.)

The good news is that Lucid delivered a record number of EVs in the third quarter during the surge in sales due to the end of the $7,500 federal tax credits. Production of the Gravity SUV is ramping, and the company’s mid-size electric SUV, aimed to lock horns with the Tesla Model Y and the Rivian R2, is still on track for launch late next year.

Plus, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has agreed to extend its $750 million loan to $2 billion, injecting another lifeline into the company to help it scale. The next few quarters could be rough, but don’t write the company off just yet.

The company said that the U.S. already sits on a vast and untapped stockpile of lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese that’s locked inside the electronics and EVs Americans use every day.

Recovering and recycling those materials could make the country more self-sufficient while sharply cutting the environmental cost of mining, Redwood said.

Redwood Materials Inc., a battery recycling venture led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel, has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply badly needed critical materials.

The company has brought a system online that’s capable of recovering 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, said Straubel. Initially founded to fill a gap in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, Redwood is in the midst of a broader shift in strategy as it navigates an expected slowdown in EV demand.

The pivot also comes at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing to onshore the supply chain for materials essential to national security.

Taking into account Redwood’s existing recycling plant in Sparks, Nevada, which recovers 60,000 tons of critical minerals annually, the firm says it is now the only major domestic source of cobalt and produces as much nickel and lithium as the largest mines in the U.S.

The South Carolina facility isn’t operating at full capacity, and the company declined to set a ramp-up timeline. It also declined to provide a breakdown of how much of each mineral it’s recovering at the facility.

Redwood was founded in 2017 to recycle EV batteries and produce materials like cathodes and copper foils for anodes. The company had said in 2022 that it planned to produce enough materials for a million EVs annually by 2025 and 5 million by 2030, and it had agreements with Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo, among others.

Yet its commercial cathode production facility in Nevada, which was slated to open in 2024 and produce 100 gigawatt-hours of battery components by this year, is still under construction with no announced opening date. While the company had planned to expand copper foil production at both of its facilities, it stopped producing it in Nevada and no longer plans to do so in South Carolina.

The industry has also faced challenges from the Trump administration, which recently canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to other battery recyclers. With the administration’s attacks on EVs further impacting the industry, including winding down federal incentives in September, Redwood has increased its focus on finding other buyers. The bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the EV sector, Straubel said.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel said.

Nickel is used in stainless steel; specialty alloys, or a custom metal blend for niche applications; and industrial chemicals, while cobalt is also used in a number of high-performance alloys like those found in jet engines. While he declined to name them, Straubel said Redwood sells its critical minerals to about 20 to 30 companies, including large industrial customers using the materials in products and mining companies that process and refine them.

The company has also shifted its focus to serving data centers’ burgeoning power demand, starting a new unit this year called Redwood Energy that turns degraded EV batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. Retired EV batteries can still work for large-scale energy storage because those systems put less strain on the hardware. In June, it unveiled a modest 63 megawatt-hour system – the equivalent of about 800 EV battery packs – paired with 12 megawatts of solar on its Nevada campus, powering a 2,000 GPU data center.

Redwood raised a $350 million Series E at a valuation of more than $6 billion last month in part to speed up energy storage deployment. That side of the business is “growing faster” and is “a new focus that we didn’t really know we were going to have a few years ago,” Straubel said.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-11/Redwood-1200.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 12:09:58.524771

Agradeço ao Presidente Lula, ao Presidente da COP, e ao Governo e ao povo do Brasil pela calorosa hospitalidade em Belém.

Muito obrigado pela vossa liderança e firme compromisso com o multilateralismo – num momento em que o nosso mundo está em jogo.

President Lula, you have called this the COP of truth.

I could not agree more.

The hard truth is that we have failed to ensure we remain below 1.5 degrees.

Science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5 limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable.

We need a paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down.

Even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences.

It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unlivable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security.

Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible.

This is moral failure – and deadly negligence.

Yes, the newly submitted Nationally Determined Contributions represent progress – but they still fall short of what is needed.

Even if fully implemented, they would put us on a pathway well above 2 degrees of global warming.

Meanwhile, the climate crisis is accelerating.

Record-breaking wildfires, deadly floods, super storms… shattering lives, economies, and decades of progress.

Last year, emissions reached another record high.

And today, as we have seen, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed that emissions continued to rise this year.

Let us be clear: the 1.5°C limit is a red line for humanity.

It must be kept within reach.

And scientists also tell us that this is still possible.

If we act now, at speed and scale, we can make the overshoot as small, as short, and as safe as possible – and bring temperatures back below 1.5°C before century’s end.

Small – by peaking global emissions immediately; cutting them deeply this decade, accelerating the phase out of fossil fuels, slashing methane, and safeguarding forests and oceans – nature’s carbon sinks.

Short – by reaching global net zero by 2050 and moving swiftly to sustained net-negative emissions afterwards.

Safe – by drastically increasing investments in adaptation and resilience, and delivering Early Warnings for All by 2027.

Excellencies,

The United Nations will not give up on the 1.5 degrees goal.

Because another truth is evident:

we have never been better equipped to fight back.

A clean energy revolution has taken hold.

Solar and wind are now the cheapest sources of power – and the fastest growing sources of electricity in history.

Last year, almost all new power capacity came from renewables.

The clean-energy economy is creating jobs and driving development.

It is reshaping geopolitics – delivering energy security and price stability.

And it is connecting millions to clean and affordable energy for the first time.

The economics have shifted.

In 2024, investors poured 2 trillion US dollars into clean energy – 800 billion more than fossil fuels.

Clean energy is winning on price, performance, and potential – offering the solutions to transform our economies and protect our populations.

What’s still missing is political courage.

Fossil fuels still command vast subsidies – taxpayers’ money.

Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation – with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress.

Too many leaders remain captive to these entrenched interests.

Too many countries are starved of the resources to adapt – and locked out of the clean energy transition.

And too many people are losing hope that their leaders will act.

We need to move faster – and move together.

This COP must ignite a decade of acceleration and delivery.

First – countries must agree on a bold and credible response plan to close the NDC ambition gap to 1.5 degrees.

Common But Differentiated Responsibilities must apply, but that should not be an excuse for any country not to assume its fair share.

This means supercharging renewables, electrification, and energy efficiency;

Building modern grids and large-scale storage;

Halting and reversing deforestation by 2030;

Cutting methane emissions;

And setting near-term, 1.5-aligned coal phase-out schedules.

I have consistently advocated against more coal plants or fossil fuel exploration and expansion.

At COP 28 in Dubai, countries committed to transition away from fossil fuels.

No more greenwashing.

No loopholes.

We must turn that commitment into action – while supporting low- and middle-income developing countries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels.

We must also dismantle structural barriers and provide the conditions for developing countries to deliver and exceed their NDC commitments.

Trade and investment policies must support climate ambition, not undermine it.

Second – we must demonstrate a clear and credible path to reaching the 1.3 trillion US dollars a year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, as agreed at COP 29 in Baku.

Developed countries must take the lead in mobilizing 300 billion dollars annually – delivering affordable, predictable finance at the agreed scale.

All providers must show they will contribute to meeting the 300 billion and 1.3 trillion milestones.

It’s no longer time for negotiations.

It’s time for implementation, implementation and implementation.

With independent tracking, faster disbursement, and terms that reflect climate vulnerability – including debt relief.

And third – developing countries must leave Belém equipped with a climate justice package that delivers equity, dignity, and opportunity.

That means a concrete plan to close the adaptation finance gap:

Ensuring that developed countries honour their pledge to provide 40 billion US dollars adaptation finance by the end of this year;

And giving confidence that affordable adaptation finance will be scaled up beyond 2025 – and delivered swiftly to the communities on the frontlines.

It also means placing justice at the heart of the transition.

With concrete measures to support developing countries to navigate it – protecting workers, empowering communities, and creating new opportunities;

And significant contributions and simplified access to the Loss and Damage Fund.

A just transition also means Indigenous Peoples leading the way.

Their knowledge and full participation light the path to a livable planet.

Excellencies,

You can count on the United Nations.

Through our Climate Promise, over a hundred developing countries received support in the preparation of their new nationally determined contributions.

I have directed the United Nations Development Programme to build on this architecture and work across the system to support developing countries during the implementation plan.

The challenge is immense.

But the choices are clear.

No one can bargain with physics.

But we can choose to lead – or be led to ruin.

Choose to make Belém the turning point.

Stand with science.

Stand for justice.

Stand for future generations.

Thank you.

Excellencies, Excelências,

I would like to thank President Lula, the COP President, and the Government and people of Brazil for their warm hospitality in Belém.

,North Carolina Clean Energy,2025-11-06 15:33:04+00:00,World Socialist Web Site,"Australia: Rio Tinto threatens to close Tomago Aluminium smelter, destroying over 1000 jobs",Not Available,,,,,https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/11/06/alkr-n06.html,"Last week, Tomago Aluminium announced it is preparing to shut down its smelter, north of Newcastle, by the end of 2028, destroying more than 1,000 jobs and devastating the region.
The Tomago plant operates around the clock, consuming roughly 10 percent of the entire NSW electricity grid.
The threat of closure is being used by Rio Tinto to leverage further concessions from the Australian government.
Workers at Tomago should place no faith in Rio Tinto, the state and federal governments or the unions, whatever the immediate outcome of the present discussions.
Moreover, to wage a fight against global corporations such as Rio Tinto, workers need to think and act globally, establishing ties with workers around the world hit by its continual restructuring in search of greater profits.","Last week, Tomago Aluminium announced it is preparing to shut down its smelter, north of Newcastle, by the end of 2028, destroying more than 1,000 jobs and devastating the region. Management insists the plant cannot remain viable once its 40-year electricity contract with AGL’s Bayswater power station expires, pointing out that power makes up more than 40 percent of total costs.

Located about 160 kilometres north of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales (NSW), the threatened closure could result in a further 5,000 job losses through flow-on effects to local businesses and manufacturing. The regional economy has already been gutted by decades of industrial closures and layoffs.

Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest mining conglomerates worth around $180 billion, holds the majority stake in Tomago through a joint venture with CSR Limited and Hydro Aluminium, a subsidiary of Norway’s state-linked Norsk Hydro.

Tomago’s chief executive officer Jerome Dozol said “consultations” with workers had already begun over the possible closure, declaring that “all market proposals received so far show future energy prices are not commercially viable” and there was “uncertainty about when renewable projects will be available at the scale we need.”

Aluminium smelting is among the most electricity-intensive industrial processes. The Tomago plant operates around the clock, consuming roughly 10 percent of the entire NSW electricity grid. It produces around 600,000 tonnes of aluminium each year, some 37 percent of Australia’s total output, worth an estimated $2 billion annually.

The threat of closure is being used by Rio Tinto to leverage further concessions from the Australian government. A joint federal–state Labor offer of $1 billion has been rejected by the company, with Dozol indicating that only a long-term deal that secured cheaper power prices would be accepted.

The company has already extracted substantial concessions from the Labor government. In January, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese unveiled a $2 billion Green Metals Fund to provide tax credits to subsidise aluminium and steel produced with renewable energy.

The Fund is one aspect of the government’s limited program to address climate change, which aims to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050—a goal that climate scientists warn will not address the serious consequences of global warming.

The Fund’s announcement was staged at Tomago, where Rio Tinto Australia chief executive Kellie Parker hailed the initiative as securing “a future” for the plant and praised it as “the best smelter in Australia.” She said the new Green Metals Fund would help secure its business for decades to come. Less than a year later, the company is demanding billions more in subsidies to lock in low-cost electricity beyond 2028.

In March and April, amid strikes over an enterprise bargaining deal, the company also pressured workers to accept lower wages, supposedly to guarantee the future of the smelter. In a media statement, Tomago declared its wage offer was made amid “rising energy costs and our long-term investments to decarbonise our plant so that we can continue operating far into the future.”

In response to last week’s announcement, Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres declared that the government was “open to every option” to keep Tomago open, including changes to ownership and further subsidies. Labor clearly fears a further collapse of support in the region, which has already been hit hard by closures and job losses.

Ayres appeared at a press conference alongside four Labor MPs from the Hunter region, assuring workers that the Albanese government was “committed to keeping the plant operating.” Asked how much taxpayer money would be provided, he said he would “exhaust every opportunity,” adding that the process of making Tomago “self-sustaining” would involve government support “for years.”

The trade unions have joined hands with the company in pressuring the federal government to meet the company’s demands. Leigh Shears, secretary of Hunter Workers, the region’s umbrella union organisation, urged the government to “use its balance sheet to secure Tomago the power it needs at the price it needs.”

Brad Pidgeon, state secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union, described the company’s announcement as “very disappointing.” Effectively accepting the closure as inevitable, he said it “validates the sad news that’s going to occur.”

As Pidgeon admitted, the unions, along with the state and federal governments, have engaged in discussions with Tomago management behind closed doors for months and kept workers in the dark as to the threats of closure. None of the union bureaucrats has so much as hinted at any fight to prevent the shutdown.

As for the company, Dozol declared Tomago was still working with the government and was “very open to have an innovative solution to find a pathway moving forward.” But he emphasised that “a significant change” would be required to prevent the closure—in other words, meet our demands or we will close.

Last year, Rio Tinto strong-armed the Queensland Labor government into a “partnership” agreement to keep its Boyne Island aluminium smelter open on the basis of subsidised renewable energy from 2029. The cost was not disclosed, but it will be borne by the working class through cutbacks to essential services including education and health, as well as the jobs, wages and conditions of public sector workers.

What is happening at Tomago follows a well-worn pattern. For decades, major corporations have used the threat of closing down and moving their operations elsewhere to extract government subsidies and financial assistance to the tune of billions of dollars, and, in league with the trade unions, to demand ever-greater productivity from fewer and fewer workers in the name of “international competitiveness.” It is a never-ending process that has ultimately ended in devastating closures and job losses.

In the Hunter region, the most dramatic example was the closure of the Newcastle steelworks. The Hawke Labor government, with the backing of the unions, drew up the 1984–88 Steel Industry Plan, which provided BHP with $800 million in subsidies and tax concessions, (worth roughly $3.1 billion today), to “save” the industry. In return, the unions enforced mass sackings and wage restraint.

Steel employment in Newcastle was more than 12,000 in the early 1980s, but was slashed again and again over the next decade and a half. Despite years of public subsidies, BHP finally shut the steelworks in 1999, destroying the remaining 2,500 jobs overnight and wiping out tens of thousands indirectly.

The same pattern was repeated in the car industry under the Labor government’s Button car plan. For decades, Ford, Holden, Toyota and Mitsubishi extracted billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks from successive Labor and Liberal governments, while the unions helped slash jobs and conditions. As profit margins fell, however, all four companies shut their Australian plants, destroying the whole car industry and leaving entire working-class communities in ruins.

Workers at Tomago should place no faith in Rio Tinto, the state and federal governments or the unions, whatever the immediate outcome of the present discussions. To fight the closure, workers need to establish a democratically elected rank-and-file committee, independent of the trade unions, to discuss, plan and execute their own industrial and political campaign.

An immediate task should be to reach out to the thousands of workers in other plants who are facing similar threats, including in this region the closure of Bayswater power station and Molycop steelworks. More broadly, workers at Glencore’s Mt Isa copper mill, the Whyalla Steelworks, Nyrstar’s zinc and lead smelters and Rio Tinto’s Bell Bay aluminium plant all face the same tenuous future, after these companies have been handed huge government subsidies that will only keep operations going in the short term. Moreover, to wage a fight against global corporations such as Rio Tinto, workers need to think and act globally, establishing ties with workers around the world hit by its continual restructuring in search of greater profits.

A new political strategy is also needed. The trade unions all declare that nothing else can be done but to bow to the profit-driven demands of these major corporations and the anarchy of the capitalist market.

In September, Centrus Energy announced a plan to significantly expand its uranium enrichment plant in the town of Piketon.

More details: DeWine announced these plans in partnership with JobsOhio—a private nonprofit economic development corporation that focuses on bolstering a variety of Ohio industries—at the Ohio Business Roundtable CEO Summit last week.

There, he laid out that the fund would provide grants and low-interest loans to help offset natural gas– and nuclear power production–related costs. He also specified that the funding will work to ensure that Ohio has “the supply we need for current and future demand, which will help keep costs reasonable.”

The announcement laid out four pillars of funding:

Engineering, right-of-way, and construction for new and existing natural gas infrastructure.

Site preparation for SMR generation.

Advanced workforce training and the creation of a “nuclear energy center of excellence” around employment.

Incentives for attracting supply-chain companies for SMR manufacturing and production.

Amir Vexler, president and CEO of Centrus Energy, said that DeWine’s focus on new workforce development will be particularly critical for facilitating Centrus’s expansion plans.

In his remarks during the Roundtable event, DeWine added that this funding slots in with his broader, ongoing work to accelerate natural gas and nuclear deployment in the state. He specifically called out his signing of H.B. 15 in May as critical legislation to expedite new projects and pointed to his collaboration with PJM to create a separate, prioritized review queue for natural gas and nuclear projects that takes precedence over renewable projects.

The Middle East region is perfect for hydrogen production.
The Middle East boasts significantly lower hydrogen production costs than other regions of the world The substantial advantages that the Middle East has in hydrogen production mean that it can safely and efficiently produce hydrogen for far less than other regions.
That does not mean, however, that Europe has given up on its hydrogen ambitions, as Spain has allocated millions for hydrogen production.
Europe is falling behind the Middle East in embracing the hydrogen sector","The global energy community has turned the page on the conventional sector and has welcomed the next chapter in the energy transition. For far too long, the world has relied on the traditional power of oil and gas; however, the renewable energy sector has made leaps and bounds in recent years in advancing technology and commissioning huge renewable projects that promote clean energy. Now, the myriad of Middle East nations are turning to the hydrogen sector, with plans for the region to become a global leader in hydrogen exports.

The Middle East has big plans for the hydrogen export sector in the not-too-distant future

Hydrogen has emerged from the sea of renewable energy resources as an overlooked energy generation tool. However, recent trends in the energy market have forced nations to reconsider their energy portfolio if they plan to meet their clean energy and emissions targets by the end of the decade, which we don’t need to remind you is only a few short years away.

New reports from credible sources have indicated that several Middle Eastern nations are hoping to become hydrogen hubs and export vast amounts of the renewable energy resource to the world. The recent sanctions on Russian energy, inflation, and the overall performance of the global economy have placed increased pressure on the energy market to diversify its energy portfolio.

The Middle East is set to become a global leader in the exporting of hydrogen

With the exceedingly cold winter approaching in the Northern hemisphere, many nations are contemplating new energy projects that may alleviate pressure on their energy sectors. Hydrogen requires vast amounts of natural resources like sun and wind power, and does not rely on the conventional oil and gas sectors to operate; hence, the world, and more specifically the Middle East, is turning to hydrogen as the fuel of tomorrow.

Several Middle Eastern nations have established hydrogen initiatives

Countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have substantial schemes in place to promote hydrogen and clean energy overall. The Kingdom has its Saudi Vision 2030, and the UAE has established the National Hydrogen Strategy. Both aim to promote the sector and foster international investments in their hydrogen production plans.

The Middle East region is perfect for hydrogen production. With its vast natural resources, like consistent sunshine and heavy winds, along with its established infrastructure and abundant undeveloped land, it’s as if the Middle East was designed for hydrogen production. The UAE can boast the largest and most technologically advanced city that is set to be powered entirely by hydrogen, NEOM.

The Middle East boasts significantly lower hydrogen production costs than other regions of the world

The substantial advantages that the Middle East has in hydrogen production mean that it can safely and efficiently produce hydrogen for far less than other regions. The region boasts hydrogen production costs between $6.54 and $12.66 per kilogram, compared to $9.88 and $14.31 in Europe. That does not mean, however, that Europe has given up on its hydrogen ambitions, as Spain has allocated millions for hydrogen production.

“Zohran was talking about climate action in a way people could understand, and people were able to see the impacts of this climate action in their everyday lives,” Denae Ávila-Dickson, Sunrise’s communications and political manager, told New York Focus.
Across the country, one thing was clear: Wallet-friendly climate policies — and candidates presenting themselves as helping people pay their bills — won.
“Climate change isn’t at the forefront of every election, but at this point, every election is a climate election,” Jasper of Project Drawdown said.
“‘Climate action equals affordability’ seems to be the winning message of the day.” Emily Jones contributed reporting.","Tuesday was a great day at the ballot box for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide.

In races from New York to Georgia to Washington, voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit — and the people promising to deliver those policies. On the whole, the results suggest Americans are pushing back against President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back climate action.

“This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump Administration’s ban on clean energy, multi-million dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher,” Sara Schreiber of the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

One of the day’s biggest wins came in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race in a landslide victory called just 35 minutes after polls closed. More than two million New Yorkers voted, the most in a mayoral race since 1969. Although Mamdani, who at 34 will be the city’s youngest mayor in more than a century, made affordability the predominant focus of his campaign, he garnered an endorsement from the youth-led climate organization Sunrise Movement. Many saw his campaign promises, which included calls for free mass transit and the greening of public schools, as the seeds of a populist climate movement.

“Zohran was talking about climate action in a way people could understand, and people were able to see the impacts of this climate action in their everyday lives,” Denae Ávila-Dickson, Sunrise’s communications and political manager, told New York Focus. Dan Jasper, of the nonprofit group Project Drawdown, said Mamdani’s transit proposal “is not as sexy as something like solar. But these are the exact type of policies we’re going to need to actually address climate change, because it addresses people’s standards of living.”

Mamdani’s challenge will be assembling the coalition needed to make those policies happen. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has also promoted a municipal green new deal agenda, may not have similar difficulty. Yesterday, Wu’s City Council allies retained their seats, giving her a fighting chance at success.

As far as statewide elections go, Georgia was a point of contention: There, electricity prices were on the ballot. Democrats won two of the five seats on the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees utilities and has approved six bill increases in three years.

Democrats have not held a seat on the board since 2007, but clean energy consultant Peter Hubbard and anti-poverty advocate Alicia Johnson tapped voter outrage over climbing prices and notched upset victories over Republican incumbents, who had embraced fossil fuels and backed away from clean energy at a time when demand for power is rising.

“I think for a lot of folks who have felt powerless over rising utility bills, especially in a state like Georgia where they’ve gone up for the average household by more than $500 in just the last couple of years, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that potential change is coming,” said Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy nonprofit PowerLines.

Rising energy bills emerged as a top issue in other races, too, including the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. For political scientist Leah Stokes, who studies public opinion around climate change, Tuesday’s results weren’t unexpected.

“I think yesterday was a repudiation of the idea that Americans don’t care about energy or climate and these are losing issues, which is what all of these pundits have been going on and on about for about 9 months now. That’s really wrong,” Stokes said. “Everyday people understand that clean energy is cheap energy — they can easily make those connections.”

In New Jersey, governor-elect Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs” on her first day in office. She plans to roll out expanded generation capacity, including rooftop solar and battery storage, and “immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity.”

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s seat on a platform that included data center operators paying for their own electricity costs in a region that currently hosts over 13 percent of the world’s data center capacity. Her “Affordable Virginia” plan included calls to expand wind and solar power, promote home weatherization to ease power consumption, and streamline permitting and other requirements for expanding generation.

To the west, California voters approved Proposition 50, which will allow the state’s Democratic majority to sidestep the statewide redistricting commission and redraw congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The move was designed to give Democrats as many as five more seats in Congress in an effort to, among other things, combat further dismantling of climate and environmental policy. Governor Gavin Newsom and a slate of prominent Democrats nationwide championed the proposal as a counterbalance to Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas, where a similar effort earlier this year carved out 5 new seats for the GOP.

In a speech Tuesday night, Newsom said California voters approved the measure “to send a message to Donald Trump. No crowns, no thrones, no kings. That’s what this victory represents. [It] is a victory for the people of the state of California and the United States of America.”

Climate-friendly policies — those centering on transit, in particular — won on a local scale, too. Voters in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which includes the city of Charlotte, handily approved a 1 percent increase in the sales tax to finance nearly $20 billion in transportation improvements. Although 40 percent of the additional revenue will be allocated to roads, some of that funding will support new bike lanes and sidewalks. Another 40 percent will go toward rail, and the remainder will be dedicated to buses and microtransit. In Ellensburg, Washington, 65 percent of voters approved a permanent 0.2 percent sales tax to fund the municipal bus system.

Across the country, one thing was clear: Wallet-friendly climate policies — and candidates presenting themselves as helping people pay their bills — won. “Climate change isn’t at the forefront of every election, but at this point, every election is a climate election,” Jasper of Project Drawdown said. “‘Climate action equals affordability’ seems to be the winning message of the day.”

The main point of the town hall was to answer union members' questions and to discuss plant closures across the nation, along with a contract with Volkswagen.

One of the plants discussed included the Ultium Cells plant in Lordstown.

It was announced on Wednesday, October 29, that several thousand jobs would be cut at Ultium Cells locations throughout the country.

Some cuts included the Ultium Cells plant in Lordstown, cutting 550 jobs, with an additional 850 positions planned to be laid off.

The Ultium Cells plant, a joint venture between GM and Ultium Cells, manufactures battery cells to be used in electric vehicles.

The decision to cut jobs and plan further layoffs is a move by General Motors (GM), reportedly aiming to adjust its electric vehicle (EV) capacity in response to a slowing demand for electric vehicles in the United States.

During the virtual town hall, Fain recognized that the EV industry is weaker than before, with certain decisions made in Washington, D.C. He shared some statistics on three of the top vehicle manufacturing companies profit expectations, including Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.

Fain went on to state that GM just raised its expectations of profit for the 2025 year.

""GM just raised [its] operating profit expectations for the year to $13 billion... So, as we've said for years, the money's there. We just need to fight for our fair share,"" said Fain.

Fain continued,"" Just last week, as you all know, General Motors, when they announced profits for the quarter that exceeded expectations, at the same time, they announced over 3,000 layoffs at six facilities.""

Fain goes on to say that the union has been in conversations with GM, who say they do not plan to give up the EV business.

Fain went on to reiterate his earlier point on the GM company raising profit expectations for the year, while also announcing over 3,000 cuts to jobs across several Ultium Cells facilities.

""It tells me that layoffs are a choice. As long as they're making money, as long as their CEO is getting paid, as long as they're paying off Wall Street - it's a choice they're making as a company,"" said Fain.

For employees affected by the cuts and layoffs, a job fair is planned to help connect area employers to prospective employees.

The job fair will be held on November 18 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the library on Kent State University's Trumbull County campus.

A heat pump can warm or cool a home, and a heat pump water heater warms water. The technology has been around for decades: most refrigerators are heat pumps. The appliances work by capturing heat and moving it to where it’s needed to do its job.

“Heat pumps provide heating and cooling in one appliance,” said Laura Wilson, director of marketing for The Switch Is On, a website and campaign that educates and helps homeowners transition to electric appliances.

Heat pumps are far more efficient than gas furnaces and can significantly cut a home’s carbon pollution as compared to gas furnaces.

30% off solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters and back-up batteries

This category includes rooftop solar panels and plug-in solar, which allow you to generate some of your own energy.

Back-up batteries store electricity either from the grid or solar panels. You can use that energy to power your home when the power goes out, or in the case of solar panels, at night when your solar panels are not generating electricity. Batteries must store at least three kilowatt-hours, which could power a home anywhere from 1–6 hours, to qualify.

Geothermal heat pumps heat and cool homes through a loop of piping buried underground or submerged in water, like a pond. Liquid circulates through the loop, absorbing heat from the ground in winter to warm your home and releasing heat back into the ground in summer to keep it cool.

The commercial partnership between Copec WIND Ventures and Moment will deploy gigawatt-hours of second-life battery energy storage projects across Latin America and Europe as part of purportedly one of the largest EV fleet repurposing initiatives outside China.

Moment and Copec will repurpose batteries from Chile’s electric bus fleet—the second-largest globally—to deploy 45MWh of near-term projects across commercial and industrial applications, with an additional 300MWh to follow.

Moment Energy has raised almost US$60 million to date, it said, including investments from the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Voyager Ventures and now Copec WIND Ventures, along with more than US$30 million in non-dilutive funding from the US and Canadian governments.

The Copec WIND Ventures funding is intended as a step towards establishing a domestic second-life battery supply chain in Latin America and Europe.

Brian Walsh, head of Copec WIND Ventures, said the firm sees a “looming supply gap” for energy storage as lithium-ion manufacturing is focused on EVs.

In July of this year, Moment Energy’s second-life battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing hub in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, reached full-scale production. The company said it will deliver 5.6GWh across North America.

The facility produces Moment’s Luna BESS, a 400kWh/1MWh unit that can be scaled into 10MWh, which the company said is the first repurposed battery system to achieve all key safety milestones: the UL 1973, UL 9540 and UL 9540A certifications.

In 2024 he opened a franchise of Filta Environmental Kitchen Solutions serving Berks, Chester, and Lancaster counties offering a specialized cooking oil micro-filtration process.

“After 27 years with Comcast Cable I was let go three years ago, and I just didn’t want to go back into corporate America,” O’Connor said. “I looked into franchises, and this was brought to me. I liked that it was a service industry and doing something good for the environment.”

Since he started the business, O’Connor said he has helped to recycle over 164,400 pounds of oil across local institutions like Kutztown University, West Chester University and Penn State Health – allowing them to reduce costs and improve the quality of the oil they use in their fryers.

O’Connor described the process as dialysis but for cooking oil where his staff goes into universities, hospitals and restaurants to micro-filtrate cooking oil to extend its lifespan and make food taste better.

Then when the cooking oil has reached the end of its reusability, Filta ultimately recycles that cooking oil into biodiesel fuel.

He said at Kutztown University, for example, he is contracted to filter 16 fryers in different parts of the campus that are run by Aramark food service.

There the fryers are cleaned once a week, but some customers have Filta come in two or three times a week based on their need.

What his staff does is basically filter, drain and dump. Oil is sucked into a three-filter machine while they scrub and clean the fryer.

“This practice elongates the life of the oil,” O’Conner said. “Oil is expensive and we offset that with our service.”

For oil that can no longer be used for cooking, staff take the oil back to the warehouse for storage where it is ultimately sold to be used as biofuel.

O’Connor said Filta’s local work alone has kept thousands of gallons of waste oil out of landfills. He makes sure all clients are aware of the ultimate environmental impact of using his service, by providing them with an environmental impact and sustainability report.

The report shows the customers such things as their carbon offset and packaging and transportation savings.

Cárcamo says that, historically, “energy projects in Honduras have been done without any respect for the local communities.","CHOLUTECA, Honduras — Under the slogan “Without human rights, there is no energy sovereignty,” more than 100 community members and activists gathered in mid-July at the Casa Real Hotel in Choluteca, a city in southern Honduras near the Nicaraguan border. At the event, participants — a mix of nonprofit leaders and community members — questioned the fairness of large-scale renewable energy projects in their territories, claiming the projects leave them without water and forests, and exposed to extreme heat. Yet reliable data on the impacts of renewable energy projects in southern Honduras remain scarce.

In Honduras, where fossil fuels account for about 38% of the electricity supply, and where the World Bank estimates that about 1.4 million people lack access to electricity, experts told Mongabay that there’s an urgent need for an energy transition. That need will grow as the climate warms and national energy demand rises by a projected 39% from 2025 to 2035.

Yet, community members in southern Honduras say large renewable energy projects come at the expense of the environment and of their well-being. They blame solar, wind and hydroelectric projects for deforestation, droughts and floods, and describe unbearable temperatures near solar farms. Some who have opposed the large-scale renewable energy projects have been threatened, displaced or even killed. Families living adjacent to solar projects in Choluteca report still lacking access to electricity. Many say they don’t feel the benefits of the energy transition; they either pay high prices for power or remain without, while the jobs and income promised by companies have failed to materialize.

One of the projects facing resistance is the Choluteca solar park, less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Choluteca city. Long stretches of solar panels are laid out in rows across dozens of hectares. The solar park has three solar photovoltaic power plants with total generating capacity of 81.7 megawatts, equivalent to about 5% of Honduras’s peak electricity demand. The $146 million project was developed by U.S. company SunEdison Inc. in 2014 and funded through loans from multilateral bodies. The project is now operated by the Guatemalan multinational Corporación Multi Inversiones, after SunEdison filed for bankruptcy in 2016.

Energy woes in the south

Located in Central America’s Dry Corridor, Choluteca is one of the Honduran departments increasingly affected by drought and severe water stress. Historically, the south has always been drought-prone, but the situation has worsened with the loss of tree cover and intensifying impacts of climate change, according to Laura Palmese, executive director of the Environmental Law Institute of Honduras, a local NGO.

Choluteca and other departments in Honduras’s poorer south supply most of the electricity that flows to the country’s industrial northwest, to cities like San Pedro Sula. Just 18 of 259 municipalities account for about 80% of the country’s electrical consumption. Meanwhile, many citizens in the rural south live in energy poverty. While 98% of urban households have electricity, in rural areas only 69% are connected to the grid, while 22% have no electricity at all.

“The energy produced in the south is not for the local communities, rather, it is sent north,” says Mónica Torres, a project coordinator at the Honduras office of German nonprofit Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung.

Solar energy from Choluteca costs about 15 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour, as stipulated by the 2014 contracts with solar companies; the regional average in Latin America is about 11 cents/kWh.

Gonzalo Fernández Ortiz de Zárate, coordinator of the Observatory of Multinationals in Latin America (OMAL), attributes the higher electricity prices in part to the 23 solar contracts awarded in 2014, which locked state-owned electric utility ENEE into paying some of the highest tariffs in the region, contributing to the company’s mounting debt problem. In 2024, the Honduran government renegotiated 18 of the contracts to bring prices down, but some affected companies refused to renegotiate and instead took the Honduran government to international arbitration using a controversial investor dispute settlement mechanism to claim compensation. Corporations’ claims from the electricity sector alone amount to more than $1.6 billion. However, in late October, Norwegian solar companies dropped some of the arbitrations against the Honduran government. The reasons for discontinuing the arbitrations are unknown, but cause concern amongst some activists, sources tell Mongabay.

“The problem in Honduras is not about production, it’s about distribution,” says Lucía Vijil, adviser on environmental and ecological justice at Center for the Study of Democracy (CESPAD) at a meeting in Tegucigalpa, the country’s capital.

Honduras’s energy system is also highly inefficient; in 2022, 38% of all energy produced was lost, compared to losses of 10% in El Salvador that same year, or 14% in Guatemala in 2021.

“The solar energy from the south can still not enter the system,” Vijil says.

Experts say high transmission and distribution losses further contribute to high prices.

Jorge Cárcamo, national director of energy planning and sectorial energy policy at the Honduran Ministry of Energy, agrees that low energy efficiency and a poor transmission network are among the main challenges in Honduras’s energy system.

“The current transmission grid in Honduras is extremely obsolete. It has been many decades since it was built, and the investment … in its maintenance and updating has been, at best, negligent,” he tells Mongabay in a video call. He adds that in 2021, the government created an educational program to improve citizens’ energy efficiency, and in 2022, rolled out a national program to reduce energy losses.

By 2038, the Honduran government aims to boost the share of renewables in electricity generation from about 60% to 80%. Between 2010 and 2021, the share of electricity from solar power went from nearly zero to 19%. Cárcamo says Honduras has a very high potential for renewable energy generation, especially from solar, wind and hydropower.

“The south of Honduras has the highest solar energy potential in all of the country,” he adds.

Despite renewable energy projects taking off in the past decade, some experts and activists say there’s no energy transition in Honduras.

“We cannot talk about having a policy for green transition,” says Palmese from the Environmental Law Institute. Instead, she says, the government continues to bet on oil extraction as a form of development. In 2023, about 38% of Honduras’s electricity was generated by fossil fuels. OMAL’s Fernández Ortiz de Zárate agrees, saying the government “is betting as much on fossil fuels as [on] renewables,” and that there’s no real planning to phase out the former in favor of the latter.

Community concerns

“In 2014, machinery came in and destroyed our flora and fauna. We didn’t know why,” says Jorge Maradiaga, a community leader in La Fortunita del Carrizo, a municipality in Choluteca.

That marked the arrival of one of the many solar projects in the Choluteca department. Since that solar farm was installed, Maradiaga says, the creek in his community has been drying out due to higher temperatures and water use. His community has grown almost unbearably hot and humid, he adds. But while temperatures tend to be higher near solar farms, experts point out that Choluteca is part of Central America’s Dry Corridor and that rising temperatures are part of a regional trend, not attributable to solar parks.

In southern Honduras, “there is a lack of water, there is a lot of drought, there is extreme heat and floods, but not because of renewable energy projects,” says Alejandra Gabriela Ramírez, an environmental engineer based in Tegucigalpa. “Extreme heat has increased due to climate change.”

Maradiaga says the solar companies promised jobs and development, but hired few locals. Instead, he says, the solar projects have wiped out a key source of income: calabash trees (Crescentia cujete) and their fruits.

“We want to cultivate, but we can no longer do that due to the high temperatures. It’s so dry, the crops don’t grow anymore.” Maradiaga adds the solar companies are “enriching the ones who already have money, not our communities.”

Companies often tell local communities that their renewable energy projects will generate jobs and cheaper energy for them, says Germán Chirinos, coordinator of the Southern Social Environmentalist Movement (MASSVIDA), a grassroots advocacy group in southern Honduras. “How is it possible that here in Choluteca there are so many projects of solar, wind and other renewable energy projects, and yet we have such expensive energy and some people don’t even have access to it?” he says.

Communities along Honduras’s Caribbean coast share similar frustrations.

“The transition has not been fair, nor democratic,” says Rony Castillo, a member of the executive team at the Honduran Black Fraternal Organization (Ofraneh), a grassroots group defending the rights and territories of the Garífuna people. “We thought renewable energy was going to be cheaper, better for the environment, and that we would have access to energy. But we don’t have energy, we have more killings and more criminalization.”

Cárcamo, from the energy ministry, says the current situation, where some communities living next to big energy projects don’t have access to electricity, “is illogical.” He says the government is trying to expand its distribution network to those communities or help them build micro networks to produce and consume electricity locally. He also says the government is exploring ways to require new energy projects to ensure access for local communities.

Community members often feel excluded and lack both information and a voice in decisions, according to Chirinos. Honduran law requires that local communities be consulted before the start of projects that could degrade the environment, but community activists say such consultations are often incomplete or poorly implemented. Maradiaga says that in his community’s case, they asked the solar company to show the record of prior socialization, “and they had nothing”.

Gabriela Ramírez says there’s a lot of misinformation in local communities about the impacts of renewable energy projects. She adds that “communities need to be taken into account and properly informed about the renewable energy projects.”

A consultant who worked on environmental evaluations and engagement with communities for a large renewable energy company in Honduras, and asks not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak on behalf of the company, says communities often “generalize and confuse companies.”

The consultant says their company complies with regulation, “even though the government doesn’t audit us [companies] as it should. The government doesn’t demand from us what it should in terms of complying with the law.” The consultant says community councils often sign agreements in which they agree to the renewable energy projects without consulting with their own community members, contributing to social conflict. The consultant suggests having representatives from the municipal or departmental governments present at meetings could help legitimize the processes, but notes that local governments often don’t have the funds to send representatives to attend such meetings.

Cárcamo says that, historically, “energy projects in Honduras have been done without any respect for the local communities. This has brought a lot of problems today, because they no longer trust in the government.”

Maradiaga says he worries about what will happen 20 to 30 years from now, when the solar panels reach the end of their lifespan. “Where will all these materials that they no longer use go?” he says.

Torres, from Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, says that “what is left is the trash, not the benefits.”

When community members resist large energy projects, they risk being threatened or even attacked, according to human rights defenders. Maradiaga says he’s experienced this firsthand, in the form of anonymous calls telling him to accept money and stop resisting a local solar project. According to advocacy group Global Witness, six environmental defenders were killed in Honduras in 2024 for their work, making it the sixth deadliest country in the world for such defenders.

“There is no rule of law” in Honduras, says Ligia Ramos, a Honduran congresswoman. She says it’s important to strengthen Honduras’s justice system to protect environmental defenders.

Environmental impacts

At the community event in Choluteca, most locals complain about the deforestation of their territories to make way for the renewable energy projects. A 2014 environmental impact assessment by the Honduran renewable energy company Soluciones Energéticas Renovables S.A de C.V. prior to the start of the Choluteca II project says it was established on lands that were already deforested. But testimonies from local experts and community members paint a different picture.

“There is just no way that they didn’t cut down trees, I just don’t believe that,” says Karen Spring, a coordinator for the Honduras Solidarity Network, about the claims that solar projects in Choluteca didn’t involve deforestation. She adds that while poor people risk arrests or fines for cutting trees illegally, companies that come in and cut trees are treated very differently.

“I know there’s been deforestation, of course they had to remove everything that was on the ground,” says Palmese about the renewable energy companies that operate in Choluteca and other parts of southern Honduras. “It is very difficult to find an area where everything is ready [for renewables], where there wasn’t anything at all.”

Torres and CESPAD’s Vijil say there’s a big data problem in Honduras, where local testimonies are often the only evidence to support claims of environmental harm. “Presenting the evidence could be a death sentence,” Vijil says, and “institutions provide no support.”

Fernández Ortiz de Zárate says that although there’s a direct link between deforestation and renewables, the latter isn’t the main driver of Honduras’s deforestation. Between 2001 and 2024, Honduras lost nearly a fifth of its forest cover, according to Global Forest Watch. The biggest driver by far is permanent agriculture (88.6%), followed by shifting cultivation (4.7%) and wildfires (4%). According to Fernández Ortiz de Zárate, using wood to generate energy – as it’s often the case in Honduras – is much worse for forests than using solar panels. However, mega projects like the ones in Choluteca will always imply some tree cutting, he says.

Rafael Gómez, a project director at Honduras’s National Institute of Forest Conservation (ICF), says solar farms need to be built on flat land, and therefore usually occupy spaces that have already been deforested. He says renewable energy projects “are not significant” as a driver of deforestation in Honduras.

“We cannot compare it with the advancement of livestock farming. Nor can we compare it with the progress of migratory agriculture. Likewise, we cannot compare it with the growth or development of communities — cities and towns continue to expand into forested areas,” Gómez says.

Renewable projects in Honduras often lack not only prior social consultations, but also proper environmental impact studies before they’re developed, according to Palmese. Honduran national law defines four types of projects, only one of which requires an environmental study. Palmese says this “is very concerning.” She says the legal regime has been made more flexible without the necessary controls to ensure that renewable projects don’t harm the environment.

Palmese also says environmental impact studies and social consultations, when they’re done, are often unreliable. She points out that the consultants who carry out the studies are paid directly by the project developers and thus have an interest in downplaying negative impacts in order to allow for new projects.

A different energy transition?

Despite the challenges, an energy transition in Honduras and other Central American countries is necessary to mitigate the climate crisis and because fossil fuels will run out, says Fernández Ortiz de Zárate. But he adds it’s also necessary for the world to find ways to use less energy and materials.

He says frequent blackouts and a mismatch between supply and demand have created an energy emergency in Honduras. As one of the poorest countries in the region and with a history of elite capture and political corruption, it’s particularly hard for Honduras to push the energy transition, Fernández Ortiz de Zárate says.

He adds the question for Honduras isn’t whether there should be an energy transition, but how it should be done. He criticizes mining and renewable mega projects that he says are done without prior consultation, by appropriating lands and water, degrading ecosystems, and without agreement from local communities, who instead are criminalized or even killed.

Fernández Ortiz de Zárate says Honduras should instead focus more on small-scale renewable projects that align with community needs. Spring says she agrees, adding that “renewables on a small scale would be fantastic, like installing 4-5 hectares [10-12 acres] of panels next to poor communities.”

“We need an energy transition, but not one that will compromise people’s daily lives,” says Ramos, the congresswoman.

According to Gómez, Honduras should make regulations that counteract the impacts of the growing number of solar farms. He suggests that all owners of solar farms set aside areas for forest conservation. He also calls for regulating permits and environmental licenses to require renewable companies to plant trees.

“For example, if we are going to grant you permission to develop a certain area of solar panels, you must triple that area in forest management within the country or within the same zone where the project is located. That could be one of the actions,” Gómez says.

Multilateral development lenders like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Inter-American Development Bank currently support various large-scale renewables projects across Central America.

“It is hard to understate the role of development finance institutions like the IFC in funding and creating legal frameworks that move countries like Honduras in the so-called energy transition away from fossil fuels towards solar, wind, hydro and biothermal,” Spring says.

The IFC and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE) helped finance the Choluteca Solar I and II projects. According to Spring, the IFC also helped create the legal framework for large-scale private sector projects to be implemented in Choluteca and other parts of southern Honduras.

Ramos says it’s important to push for diligent environmental impact studies and prior consultation and involvement with local communities. Experts say there’s also a need to strengthen Honduran institutions to build the capacity to review and investigate large-scale renewable energy projects properly before they start.

Ratifying the Escazú Agreement, a Latin American treaty on environmental rights and defender protection, could be part of the solution, according to Palmese, Vijil and Torres. They argue that its ratification would oblige the Honduran government to make information on renewables projects and their environmental impacts publicly accessible. It would also help protect Honduras’s environmental defenders. Palmese says given the difficulty of accessing information in Tegucigalpa, the capital, “then I don’t imagine how difficult it can be in Choluteca.”

In a recent bipartisan letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) urged the agency to reconsider its pending repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

EPA’s proposed rule, released in September, would remove all the emissions reporting requirements under the GHGRP, except for those subject to the methane emissions tax starting in 2034 as codified in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Eliminating this reporting requirement would make it more difficult to enact informed public policy and could further complicate the federal government’s ability to determine eligibility for certain tax credits.

Introduction

In a recent bipartisan letter to the Environmental Protection Agency, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Kevin Cramer (R-ND) urged the agency to reconsider its pending repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The senators highlighted the importance of ensuring sufficient and accurate emissions data gathering, noting: “[W]e support the collection of information that improves the global competitiveness of American industry.”

EPA’s proposed rule, released in September, would remove all the emissions reporting requirements under the GHGRP, except for those subject to the methane emissions tax starting in 2034 as codified in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). This action is part of the Trump Administration’s broad energy agenda to boost U.S. oil and gas production by declaring a national energy emergency, removing regulating barriers, and expediting permitting approvals for fossil fuel projects. The EPA estimated that the proposed rule would save $303 million per year from 2025–2033, totaling about $2 billion over 10 years for businesses that are required to report to the program

Eliminating this reporting requirement would make it more difficult to enact informed public policy and could further complicate the federal government’s ability to determine eligibility for certain tax credits.

Overview of the GHGRP

The GHGRP, which went into effect in 2009, mandated certain manufacturing facilities to report their GHG emissions annually and follow monitoring, verification, and recordkeeping requirements. It covers GHG emissions from 47 source categories across about 8,000 facilities in the United States and publishes emissions data in October each year.

EPA’s website states that the data collected through the program “can be used by businesses and others to track and compare facilities’ greenhouse gas emissions, identify opportunities to cut pollution, minimize wasted energy, and save money. States, cities, and other communities can use EPA’s greenhouse gas data to find high-emitting facilities in their area, compare emissions between similar facilities, and develop common-sense climate policies.”

Under the program, facilities are required to submit information on their emissions if:

A facility emits more than 25,000 metric tons of CO2e annually;

Supply of certain products would lead to over 25,000 metric tons of CO2e if those products are released, combusted, or oxidized; or

A facility receives 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e for underground injection, which is the final step in carbon capture and sequestration.

EPA’s Proposal To Cancel the Program

On September 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a proposed rule to remove the GHGRP’s emissions reporting requirements, except for those subject to the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC). The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) set the WEC, a tax on methane emissions, to begin in 2024, but the 2025 OBBBA postponed the implementation of the tax until 2034. This action is part of the Trump Administration’s broad energy agenda to boost U.S. oil and gas production by declaring a national energy emergency, removing regulating barriers, and expediting permitting approvals for fossil fuel projects.

EPA’s press release on its decision to repeal the program states the following:

“Unlike other mandatory information collections under the CAA, the GHGRP is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites.”

The EPA estimated that the proposed rule would save $303 million per year from 2025–2033, totaling about $2 billion over 10 years. Of the cost savings, more than 80 percent is associated with a reduced burden on the petroleum and natural gas industry, with the rest benefiting carbon-intensive manufacturing industries.

Implications of Removing the Program

While the EPA’s proposed cancellation of the GHGRP would significantly reduce costs for businesses that are required to report to the program, there are some potential downsides to the action.

Repealing the GHGRP would deprive U.S. policymakers of critical emissions data for designing decarbonization policies. Lawmakers and the federal government rely on economic data such as employment and manufacturing statistics to make important economic policy decisions. Similarly, they depend on the GHGRP’s regularly updated and comparable emissions data to learn about the emissions trajectory of various sectors in the economy. Absent a government accredited repository of emissions data, the private sector would have to fill in the gap. But there are limits in the scope and quality of the data collected by the private sector given constrained resources.

Scrapping the GHGRP would also create challenges for taxpayers to claim the OBBBA’s carbon sequestration tax credits since the program’s emissions data is used to determine eligibility. Although the OBBBA repealed about 60 percent of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits, it retained the carbon oxide sequestration credit. Senators Whitehouse and Cramer’s letter to the EPA stated: “Repealing [the GHGRP reporting requirements] without a clear alternative in place will put existing investments in flux and stymy future American leadership in [Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage] deployment.” Other senators have raised this issue. For example, Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said in an interview: “If you’re really taking advantage of tax credits, you have to have measurements, and they have to be accessible. That’s unclear at this point.”

Further, rolling back the program would restrict U.S. exporters’ access to facility- and industry-level emissions data, leaving them at a disadvantage as more countries start to adopt carbon border adjustments—a policy that aims to address emissions embedded in internationally traded goods. For example, the European Union (EU) will start to implement its carbon border adjustment mechanism to levy a tax on certain imported goods based on their associated carbon emissions. If the GHGRP is eliminated, U.S. exporters subject to the regulation would need to switch to other credible entities to have their emissions data validated. Some U.S. legislative proposals that have carbon border adjustment components, such as the Clean Competition Act and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act, also rely on the GHGRP to calculate covered goods’ emissions.

Finally, canceling the GHGRP would remove a credible emissions measuring and reporting standard applicable to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters. Oil and gas companies worldwide regularly measure and estimate the GHG emissions associated with their production to comply with different jurisdictions’ emissions regulations. For example, in January 2027 the EU will start enforcing its methane regulation requiring methane monitoring, reporting, and verification on the gas sold to the EU market. Some hope this regulation would exempt U.S. LNG exporters since they are subject to the GHGRP standards. With the GHGRP on the chopping block, however, U.S.LNG exporters would have to incur additional costs to conform to the EU standards.

In this article, we model two hypothetical infrastructure development plans for the Appalachian Basin—northward pipeline expansion and southward pipeline expansion—and compare them to a baseline scenario.
One scenario explores pipeline expansion northward (toward the Boston and New York areas), and the other southward (toward the Atlantic corridor urban centers and the USGC).
Natural gas pipeline expansion is a critical tool for meeting the dual goals of supplying growing demand for gas and maintaining downward pressure on pricing.
Will gas pipeline infrastructure expansion bring a reliable supply to the emerging data center demand in the Northeast (for example, Virginia)?","Over the past decade, North America’s shale revolution unlocked vast reserves of low-cost natural gas. While these supply sources are spread out across the continent, roughly 75 percent of natural gas production growth in 2014–24 came from three basins: Appalachia (Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia), Haynesville (North Louisiana), and Permian (West Texas).

This growth was enabled by midstream players constructing pipelines to link these supply basins with demand centers, effectively stabilizing Henry Hub prices between $2.50 and $3.00 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) (see sidebar “Sources of North America’s historical natural gas supply growth”).

However, this era of rapid midstream infrastructure growth has come to an end, especially in the US Northeast, at a time when natural gas demand is projected to rise significantly. Our analysis suggests that US demand (including domestic consumption and net exports) could potentially reach 125 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) by 2030, an increase of 14 percent compared to 109 bcfd in 2024, driven by increased power demand due to electrification, the rise of data centers, and a growing global liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry. These same factors are expected to further increase demand throughout the 2030s.

With the gas distribution network already constrained, the US gas market could face supply bottlenecks, price volatility, and a growing dependence on higher-cost supply basins. US operators would need to expand the current natural gas infrastructure network to overcome these challenges.

In many regions of the United States, project execution is a considerable challenge. In particular, the Appalachian Basin contains an abundant, low-cost dry gas supply but faces severe pipeline bottlenecks that limit the flow of gas to high-demand markets. Expanding infrastructure in the basin could materially help maintain affordable prices and meet future demand, but would have a range of implications for different stakeholders, from producers to consumers.

In this article, we model two hypothetical infrastructure development plans for the Appalachian Basin—northward pipeline expansion and southward pipeline expansion—and compare them to a baseline scenario. We explore the implications of both scenarios on regional pricing and shifts in gas flows to understand how the value chain might be impacted under each scenario.

Pipeline projects adjacent to the Appalachian Basin could debottleneck parts of the system

Between 2010 and 2024, approximately 15,800 miles of incremental onshore gas pipelines were built across the United States. Of this build-out, only around 18 percent was in Appalachia (Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia)—in contrast to 36 percent in Louisiana and Texas. The majority of the build-out occurred before 2018, slowing as key gas corridors became more concentrated and saw increased density.

This slowdown in infrastructure build-out has constrained gas export capacity from the Appalachian Basin and the ability for operators to increase gas production volume. Over the past decade, a number of regional pipeline projects have been proposed with the goal of improving gas flow to local urban demand centers or to the US Gulf Coast (USGC). While most of these proposed projects were not successfully completed, the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), which began construction in 2018, came online in June 2024 (see sidebar “The Mountain Valley Pipeline”).

Although MVP provided a new outlet for gas production and has been operating at more than 80 percent capacity since completion, its broader regional impact on flows and pricing has been mixed because of downstream constraints on the interconnecting Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) (Exhibit 1). For example, at the closest demand market to MVP—Transco Zone 5 in Virginia—gas prices rose immediately prior to MVP being built, then fell straight after the pipeline’s start date, reflecting the anticipation and realized deliveries of new supply volumes.

However, other markets further downstream in the Northeast, such as Algon Gates (Boston) and Transco Zone 6 (New York), continued to follow historical pricing trends, implying that MVP had little to no effect on these markets. Additionally, total natural gas production and prices at supply hubs in the Appalachian Basin remained relatively unchanged in the year after MVP was completed. This indicates that although MVP helped alleviate a local supply constraint (Transco Zone 5), it has not significantly changed the broader regional infrastructure constraints that exist downstream of MVP that lead to higher natural gas prices in cities, such as Boston and New York.

By comparison, other pipeline projects that have successfully debottlenecked supply basins have shown more widespread and sustained impacts on pricing and gas flow. For example, in 2019, gas prices in Waha, the West Texas Permian gas supply basin hub, fell substantially relative to gas prices at Henry Hub, the main USGC demand market hub.

These five months of widening differentials (the difference between demand and supply node prices) were caused by increasing production volumes of associated gas that were unable to leave the basin as existing pipelines were already fully utilized. Gas production continued to grow, even though absolute Waha prices became negative, with some producers having to pay to have their gas volumes taken away (see sidebar “Factors influencing associated gas volumes”).

To alleviate this issue, the Gulf Coast Express (GCX) Pipeline was built to connect Waha to Agua Dulce, a demand market in south Texas near Corpus Christi, adding two bcfd of egress capacity. Immediately after GCX started service in August 2019, Waha pricing increased and the Waha-to-Agua Dulce differential shrank by 55 percent ($1/MMBTU), reflecting the value of Permian producers being able to structurally bring stranded gas volumes to market (Exhibit 2). This pricing effect is typical evidence of a pipeline project’s ability to resolve structural regional imbalances, stabilize prices for end consumers, and improve the business case for producers.

The cycle of pipeline additions in the Permian Basin has repeated multiple times over the past decade. These expansions, including the Double E Pipeline and the Permian Highway Pipeline, have helped alleviate short-term bottlenecks, bringing additional low-cost gas to the USGC and reducing local oversupply at Waha.

MVP, by contrast, was locally helpful for Appalachia but did not achieve the same level of impact as GCX. This was largely a result of system bottlenecks remaining in place downstream of the MVP additions that prevented the gas from reaching additional demand centers. Further pipeline development could help unlock these bottlenecks and create value for Appalachian gas producers and US end consumers.

Potential scenarios for expansion: Northward or southward from Appalachia

We explored two hypothetical development scenarios for pipeline infrastructure build-out from the Appalachian Basin to assess the potential implications for gas flows and pricing across Canada and the United States.

One scenario explores pipeline expansion northward (toward the Boston and New York areas), and the other southward (toward the Atlantic corridor urban centers and the USGC). If realized, these expansion scenarios could create the infrastructure conditions required to bring additional low-cost supply to demand markets as they become more accessible.

While these scenarios are not mutually exclusive, we explore them separately to examine the impact on stakeholders of different development goals: a more domestic, demand-oriented path (northward) and a more export-oriented path (southward). If both pipelines were developed, they could add approximately 7.5 bcfd of egress for Appalachia volumes, which is significantly below the more than 15 bcfd of additional economic supply that we estimate represents Appalachia’s “infrastructure unconstrained” potential.

For comparison, we also highlighted a baseline scenario where capacity remains constrained to the current midstream infrastructure (Exhibit 3).

The Baseline scenario assumes that Appalachian pipeline egress capacity remains constrained through 2030, with only approximately one bcfd of capacity added from 2024 to 2030.

The Southward Expansion scenario assumes a cumulative addition of 4.6 bcfd on top of the baseline from resolving the southbound transmission bottlenecks (through MVP’s Southgate expansion and Transco’s southbound Southeast Supply Enhancement [SESE] project) and possible others such as Texas Gas Transmission’s (TGT) Borealis expansion.

The Northward Expansion scenario assumes expansions to the Algonquin Gas Transmission, the Millennium Pipeline, and the Transco northbound pipelines, cumulatively adding up to around three bcfd to existing capacity.

The modeled results for these two pipeline expansion scenarios suggest that stakeholders across the value chain—upstream producers, midstream operators, and downstream consumers (residential and commercial, LNG, storage providers, and traders)—and across geographies could see distinct and significant impacts, with value pools shifting as a lower-cost gas delivery configuration becomes available.

The Baseline scenario

Our baseline scenario assumes increasing LNG demand out of the USGC, limitations on Appalachian egress capacity, and the Permian-associated gas production plateauing in the long run. All these dynamics are expected in the current market. To meet rising demand under this scenario, gas producers would need to increase drilling activity from higher-cost dry gas basins, potentially resulting in Henry Hub prices increasing by $1/MMBTU (above $4 to $5/MMBTU) through the 2040s.

The Southward Expansion scenario

Expanding southward pipeline capacity by four to five bcfd would enable the same volume of additional, low-cost Appalachian gas to flow along the eastern seaboard for domestic use and USGC LNG export by increasing the utilization of Transco’s southbound, MVP, and TGT pipeline systems (Exhibit 4).

Despite the gas having to travel longer distances from Appalachia to the USGC, the total delivered gas cost is projected to decrease due to lower drilling and completion costs in this scenario. This net reduction in system costs could be passed along to consumers or partially recognized as additional margin by producers. However, should this scenario be realized, producers would need to tread carefully, as excessive price markups could drive consumers back to their local suppliers (in this case, North Louisiana gas production).

Upstream impact: The next highest cost supply along the Gulf Coast would be displaced, improving system capital efficiency, while other supply basins would be unaffected

Bringing Appalachian gas supply to the USGC could directly compete with and displace marginal, higher-cost gas production from local Gulf Coast basins, such as the Haynesville Shale Basin (Exhibit 5). In contrast, supply and price differentials (to Henry Hub) for other supply basins, such as Canada (AECO gas hub) and Permian (Waha gas hub), could remain relatively stable and consistent with the Baseline scenario.

The replacement of high-cost, low-productivity Gulf Coast gas wells with cheaper, more productive Appalachian gas wells could improve overall system capital efficiency. Between 2025 and 2030, this upstream supply shift is projected to reduce drilling and completion costs by between $7 billion to $9 billion, while maintaining the same volume of natural gas production. This represents a potential decrease of around $16 billion in capital deployed to drill wells in the USGC, and an increase of $7 billion to $9 billion in capital deployed by Appalachian producers.

Midstream impact: Overall value pool expands with higher full-year flows

The Southward Expansion scenario would also result in increased connectivity between Atlantic corridor midstream players and Gulf Coast LNG export facilities, shifting an estimated $0.7 billion to $0.9 billion in revenue from USGC-centric midstream players to their Appalachian counterparts. With LNG exports continually operating throughout the year (even amid seasonal pricing variability and occasional ramp-downs during extreme weather events or facility maintenance), these revenues would be realized year-round for pipelines.

End consumer impact: Southeast gas consumers and LNG exporters see notable price benefits

Southern and Mid-Atlantic domestic gas consumers and LNG exporters are projected to see lower gas prices in the Southward Expansion scenario compared to the Baseline scenario, potentially reducing consumer costs by $4 billion to $5 billion from 2025 to 2030.

For example, our modeling suggests hub price differentials to Henry Hub along the Transco and TGT system (for example, Transco Zone 5 South and Virginia) narrow by about $0.1 to $0.2/MMBTU (10 to 15 percent) across seasons as the system gains greater access to lower-cost gas for the end consumer.

If realized, this scenario could also support the United States’ position as a key LNG supplier to global markets by improving USGC cost-competitiveness (through lower feedgas costs) and limiting impacts from increased exports on domestic gas prices.

The Northward Expansion scenario

By contrast, expanding northward pipeline capacity by one to two bcfd would bring low-cost Appalachian gas to key demand centers in the Northeast region (Boston, New York, and Virginia), principally during peak winter demand seasons, by increasing utilization of Transco’s northbound, Millennium’s, and Algonquin’s systems (Exhibit 6).

Upstream impact: Multiple supply basins would see displaced production from Appalachia, improving system capital efficiency, with Canada seeing the largest impact

An influx of Appalachian gas to northeast markets could primarily offset regional imports from other distant supply basins, notably Canada, Mid-Continent (for example, SCOOP/STACK shale plays), and the Rockies (for example, Denver–Julesburg shale plays and Powder River), basins (Exhibit 7). This displacement, while not as high as that in the Southward Expansion scenario, is projected to shift $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion of drilling and completions spend by oil and gas operators away from these locations to Appalachia.

The impact of this shift would be greatest during the high-demand winter months. During the summer months, when demand is lower, surplus low-cost Appalachian gas supply could slightly edge out flows from these higher-cost basins along the USGC. Northeast imports from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB)—a major natural gas-producing region in Alberta and British Columbia—are expected to be the most affected. In 2024, the WCSB supplied 8.78 bcfd of gas to US markets, accounting for virtually all of Canada’s natural gas exports. Northward expansion from Appalachia could displace about 1.0 to 1.5 bcfd of this Canadian gas.

Midstream impact: Increased seasonal flows on Appalachia pipelines with lower utilization of west-to-east cross-continental systems

Overall system transportation costs serving northeast gas demand could decrease due to increased use of shorter routes transporting gas from Ohio and Pennsylvania over other longer routes from Canada, Colorado, and Oklahoma.

Resulting midstream value pools are projected to expand, particularly for assets carrying these northward volumes, as local flows reorganize and overall regional system utilization increases. However, due to the high seasonal variability in northeast demand (30 to 45 percent higher in winter than in summer), incremental pipeline capacity may not be fully utilized throughout the year, potentially resulting in lower project margins compared to pipelines flowing southward.

End consumer impact: Reduced peak winter prices for end users

In this scenario, northeast consumers could collectively save $2 billion to $3 billion between 2025 and 2030 due to price reductions from lower-cost Appalachian gas. This would primarily benefit urban consumers across residential sectors, as well as commercial and industrial (C&I) users, including power generators and data centers.

A Northward Expansion scenario could also increase energy self-sufficiency for northern US cities and reduce overall energy costs for US consumers, with gas differentials to Henry Hub near key urban centers, such as Iroquois Zone 2 (Albany) and Transco Zone 6 (New York), projected to fall by around $0.2 to $0.3/MMBTU.

Consideration of full value chain impacts is critical for efficient infrastructure development

Under both Appalachian debottlenecking scenarios, the end consumers of natural gas stand to save billions of dollars in costs through the rest of the decade. However, very different consumers stand to benefit in each scenario.

Midstream infrastructure developers and oil and gas operators will need to clearly articulate the specific value of these integrated projects to create societal and governmental buy-in, whether the focus is on improved LNG exports and positioning US supply on the global market, or improved energy self-sufficiency and reducing pricing pressure on the American consumer.

Natural gas pipeline expansion is a critical tool for meeting the dual goals of supplying growing demand for gas and maintaining downward pressure on pricing. However, the significant differences in how capacity additions redistribute value through the system, combined with the challenges of completing regional midstream projects, likely require alignment across the entire value chain to solve.

Assessing the value of these projects will also need to occur while navigating other changes in the US energy system. Regulatory and energy policies are rapidly evolving, shifting the viability and incentive structure around infrastructure development. At the same time, the regional role of energy transition technologies and economic applications in a demand-growth environment is being tested, as projections view an increasing role for most energy sources in the near and medium term.

Many questions remain:

What level and direction of debottlenecking is most critical, given the changing profiles of domestic demand (for example, changes to the Inflation Reduction Act and expected power supply build-out) and LNG markets (such as potential changes to LNG market balances), given US policy shifts?

How can project developers communicate and share value across different stakeholders to improve the likelihood of infrastructure development? How do these values align with policy and societal objectives across political and geographical regions?

What levers are available for different operators to support the expansion of debottlenecking infrastructure and promote working toward a common goal?

How can non-Appalachia producers build resiliency into their development plans when both demand and infrastructure build-out remain uncertain?

Will gas pipeline infrastructure expansion bring a reliable supply to the emerging data center demand in the Northeast (for example, Virginia)?

A coordinated approach among all players could ensure infrastructure investments, not only by addressing immediate needs but also by aligning with long-term market dynamics, fostering resilience and shared growth across the industry.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/the%20infrastructure%20imperative%20who%20benefits%20from%20pipeline%20expansion/thumb-gettyimages-523796934.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 10:00:10.666757

Leveling the Playing Field Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been “extraordinarily active” in 2025, making three significant changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that are poised to reshape the biomass-based diesel market.

University of Illinois, Todd Gleason spoke to agricultural economists Dr. Todd Hubbs of Oklahoma State University and Dr. Scott Irwin of the University of Illinois, who outlined how these complex rulings create strong incentives for domestic soybean oil and other feedstocks.

“It has been something this year,” Hubbs said, detailing the EPA’s recent actions.

The changes, which are the focus of a new series of articles by Hubbs and Irwin, include:

June: The EPA finalized the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027.

July: The agency released a comprehensive ruling on Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) that had been pending since 2018.

September: The EPA established a new framework for reallocating those SREs.

The Mandate is Growing

Host Todd Gleason clarified that these changes do not impact the 15-billion-gallon component of the RFS, which is generally met by corn-based ethanol. Instead, the focus is on biomass-based diesel (often called soy diesel).

The mandate for this category is set for a 40% increase, rising from 5.36 billion gallons annually to 7.5 billion gallons by 2027.

A “Messy” Solution to Small Refinery Exemptions

A major part of the EPA’s recent action was resolving the backlog of SREs, which allow small refineries to get out of the RFS mandate.

Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration. For the exemptions it did grant (covering 2018-2022), the agency returned “worthless” RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers, or credits) from those past years, rather than current, valuable RINs. This effectively removed those credits from the marketplace.

“That’s a mess,” Hubbs said, summarizing the complex situation.

Crucially, the EPA’s new “reallocation” policy means that the exempted gallons will be added back into the RFS, making other, non-exempt obligated parties responsible for making up the difference in 2026 and 2027.

This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel. Hubbs projects the mandate could jump from 5.5 billion RIN gallons in 2025 to over 7.23 billion in 2026.

“Half-RIN” Policy Favors Domestic Production

Perhaps the most significant change, according to Hubbs, was the introduction of a “half-RIN policy” in June, which he described as “unheard of previously.”

Under this new rule, any imported fuel or imported feedstock used to make fuel will only receive half the RIN value.

“Well, that sort of totally favors it, right?” Gleason asked.

Hubbs agreed, noting the policy “sort of favors domestic feedstock and domestic production” and has “big implications” for U.S. producers.

Leveling the Playing Field

Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.

The agency lowered the RIN value for non-ester renewable diesel (and Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF) from 1.7 RINs per gallon down to 1.6. This brings it closer to traditional FAME (soy diesel), which has a 1.5 RINs-per-gallon value.

Hubbs and Irwin plan to release additional articles detailing the implications of these changes for feedstock prices as they continue to analyze the new RFS playbook.

At UD, alumna discovered twin passions for agriculture and laboratory research

The First-Generation College Celebration (FGCC) is held annually across the country on Nov. 8 to raise awareness of first-generation students and commemorate the signing of the Higher Education Act of 1965.

Six years after starting college, only 24% of first-generation students nationwide earn a bachelor’s degree, compared to 59% of continuing-generation students, according to FirstGen Forward.

University of Delaware alumna Tiffany Carro is among the 24% of first-generation college graduates. Today, she is the director of global regulatory sciences in the research and development organization for FMC Corporation, an agricultural sciences company with a research and technology center in Newark, Delaware. Carro also sits on the external advisory board of The Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN) at UD.

“Underrepresented minority women receive less than 7% of doctorate degrees in STEM in the US,” Carro said, citing a 2023 article from Pew Research Center. “Hispanic/Latina women in STEM represent less than 5% of STEM undergraduate degrees, but they have had the fastest growth in advanced degrees by race and ethnicity.”

Carro is an advocate for underrepresented communities in the STEM field. She volunteers her time to mentor the next generation of scientists.

“I had the advantage of a supportive family when I started college in 2000,” Carro said. “Even still, it would have been unlikely for me to obtain an advanced degree at the time — a woman, first-generation Hispanic college student, and pursuing a STEM major? I benefited from professors and mentors who invested in me at all levels of my education.”

Carro found those mentors at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources (CANR), where she earned a bachelor’s degree in animal science and agricultural education in 2004 and a master’s degree in animal science in 2007. She then earned a doctorate in environmental toxicology from the University of Maryland.

Carro wasn’t born into agriculture; she grew up in New York City, about as far from the farm as you can get. Her passion for agriculture grew through involvement with Sigma Alpha, a professional agricultural sorority at UD. She considers the sorority’s advisor, Pat Barber, a retired associate professor and former associate dean of Cooperative Extension, as a mentor.

Another of Carro’s mentors is Lesa (Griffiths) Massarotti, a professor in the Department of Animal and Food Sciences, who taught Carro’s very first class at UD.

“For somebody like me who came in and didn't really understand how the University platform worked, having Lesa as an instructor and a mentor was invaluable,” Carro said. “She empowered me to identify my own career path.”

In the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Carro also developed a passion for laboratory work.

“The opportunity to work in a lab, which I don’t think I would have had at other universities as an undergraduate, really helped me make the decision to move into a master’s program,” Carro said. “I didn’t have people in my immediate circle who understood bachelor’s versus master’s versus doctoral programs, so it was really nice to get that exposure so early on.”

That hands-on experience led Carro to pursue a master’s degree at UD after mentor Bill Saylor, UD professor emeritus, planted the idea in her mind.

“I remember Professor Saylor saying to me, ‘If you’re interested in research, you could go to graduate school,’ which wasn't even on my radar until he encouraged it,” Carro said.

During her graduate studies, Carro worked with scientists at DuPont, under Saylor’s guidance. The work informed her graduate thesis.

Carro developed an interest in environmental toxicology, the study of how toxins impact organisms in the environment. She worked for the U.S. Government, completing avian risk assessments at a Superfund site, a location contaminated with hazardous materials and requiring a long-term response.

“Those projects taught me, really fast, how important it is to collaborate in science,” Carro said. “There's not much that can be achieved without working across disciplines.”

Collaboration is key to Carro’s role as director of global regulatory sciences at FMC Corporation. FMC provides internships to Blue Hens, employs many UD alumni and supports University of Delaware Ag Day. At FMC, Carro oversees a team of 50 scientists, including experts in computational modeling, metabolism and residue chemistry, environmental fate chemistry, toxicology and other fields.

“The purpose of the team is to support FMC’s portfolio of plant protection products across both our synthetic chemistry and our plant health platforms to enable authorities like the Environmental Protection Agency to support decisions of safety to humans and safety to the environment,” she said. “That allows us to obtain registrations for our products.”

Her team’s research supports the FMC portfolio, including products registered in nearly 140 countries.

Carro values an interdisciplinary approach to solutions. She says having a growth mindset and being willing to collaborate are keys to success.

“When I was an ecotoxicologist, I couldn’t complete my responsibilities without understanding what’s happening in the environment, in exposure simulations and across risk assessment,” Carro said. “Everything we do as scientists is interdisciplinary.”

Carro sees her work aligning with the CANR mission to feed the world and protect the planet. She points out that although the human population is growing, farmland is a finite resource.

“To manage that, we need industries like the one I'm in to be creative and sustainable, and to be good stewards,” Carro said. “That’s what I find rewarding about the role that I’m in now.”

Carro feels lucky to have had great mentors and wants to offer those same opportunities to women and underrepresented communities in STEM. She participates in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and, through FMC’s outreach efforts, volunteers at career day events and mentorship programs.

The STEM fields have a profound impact on every aspect of our lives, and increasing diversity in STEM can lead to further scientific innovation. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that diverse teams lead to more effective problem-solving. Perhaps the first step in building those diverse teams, Carro said, is to support the success of first-generation college students, 50% of whom are students of color.",https://www.udel.edu/content/dam/udelImages/udaily/2025/november/Tiffany-Carro-Primary-800x420.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 13:07:13.126028

FREMONT, Calif., Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy technology company and the world's leading supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, today announced that its IQ8™ Microinverters have been selected for gas station solar projects around the world, helping businesses deploy clean, reliable energy in some of the most safety-critical commercial environments.

Enphase microinverters are uniquely suited to gas station installations thanks to their AC-based system architecture, which eliminates the risk of dangerous high-voltage DC wiring and potential arc-fault fires. Built-in Rapid Shutdown capabilities ensure automatic system shutdown in emergencies, while a NEMA 6 rating allows for reliable performance in harsh weather conditions. These features, combined with advanced cybersecurity protections, make IQ8 Microinverters a trusted choice for powering fuel retail sites safely and efficiently.

Several gas stations installations have been completed in the United States, including one from solar installer DynamicSLR, which installed a 49 kW solar system at the Tri Gaz 5 gas station in Crandall, Texas. The project is expected to offset 17% of the site’s electricity demand and generate an estimated lifetime savings of more than $150,000. Dozens of gas stations across Puerto Rico have Enphase products deployed through independent installers, including Green Energy & Fuels, Edison Energy, Pura Energia, and Solar Roots, further demonstrating the reliability and scalability of Enphase microinverters in demanding commercial environments.

In Southeast Asia, Enphase microinverters are powering hundreds of gas stations. Super Central Gas has installed Enphase systems across 105 Shell stations, while multiple installers – Super Central Gas, TNS Network Solution, and MRO Engineering – have equipped PTT franchise sites. PTT stations typically range from 30 kW to over 100 kW, with at least 37 locations confirmed that feature Enphase systems. In the Philippines, solar installer MSpectrum has deployed Enphase systems at several Petron stations, and Solaren has completed seven additional gas-station projects, each averaging 15 kW.

In Colombia, Gimecol Solar recently delivered a 50 kW system at the EDS Moya gas station using Enphase IQ8 Microinverters, showcasing the technology’s reliability and ease of deployment in Latin America.

""With the Tri Gaz 5 project, we needed a high-performing solution that could operate reliably in the intense Texas heat,"" said Ahmad Dweik, managing partner at DynamicSLR, an installer of Enphase products in the United States. ""Enphase microinverters have a NEMA 6 rating and zero potential for DC arc-fault fires, for safe operations in even extreme conditions.”

“Our project, the EDS Moya in Colombia, demonstrates how simple and safe Enphase technology is to deploy,” said Julio Darío Fuentes Polanco, co-founder of Gimecol Solar, an installer of Enphase products in Columbia. “The microinverters provide the performance and reliability our customers demand.”

“Our relationship with Enphase is helping fuel retailers like Shell and PTT reduce energy costs and lower their carbon footprint,” said Apisit Tanadumrongsak, CEO of SCG Future Energy Co., Ltd., an installer of Enphase products in Thailand. “The safety advantages of AC-based systems make Enphase a natural choice for these environments.”

As the nation anticipates surging electricity demand and corresponding high rates, DE offers a rapid-deployment advantage over traditional grid-scale power plants. This session dives deep into how technologies like bidirectional EV charging, Virtual Power Plant (VPP) orchestration, and demand response are meeting complex grid challenges and offering households and businesses true energy independence.

Policy and the post-tax credit landscape

The morning kicks off with a crucial keynote from Nick Montoni, Senior Program Director at the NC Clean Technology Center. Drawing on his extensive background with the Department of Energy and the U.S. House of Representatives, Montoni will illuminate the evolution of state solar policy and the monumental hurdles facing the Solar for All program. The discussion will address the impact of the EPA’s termination and subsequent litigation over the $7 billion program and the challenges in translating large-scale federal legislation (like the IRA) into rapid, effective deployment at the state and local levels.

Montoni will also provide actionable insights from the “50 States of Solar” reports, focusing on:

The Interconnection Bottleneck: Identifying the most severe drag on distributed project timelines and the most promising state-level innovations to solve it.

Beyond Net Metering (NEM): Analyzing the mass migration away from traditional NEM and defining the characteristics of a successful successor tariff that balances project economics with utility compensation for grid services.

Technology and the fully integrated solution

The session then pivots to the role of technology and integrated solutions in lowering costs and enhancing grid stability. Danielle Merfeld, Global Chief Technology Officer at Qcells, will detail how the company’s full vertical integration in the U.S.—from ingots to modules—not only secures supply but also standardizes products to lower “soft costs” and reduce administrative “red tape” for installers. Merfeld will also discuss the future of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), explaining how Qcells’ Geli software uses AI and real-time data to make battery systems reliable grid assets.

Following this, Rob Adams, COO of Solaflect Energy, will present his company’s pioneering off-grid solar and EV charging solution, the Apollo. The presentation will explore the substantial value proposition of entirely bypassing the traditional utility grid upgrade process—a major hurdle for commercial clients and fleets—to enable faster EV adoption and provide a competitive Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

The path to widespread adoption

The highlight of the day is a powerhouse panel featuring advocates, analysts, and installers: Brad Heavner (CALSSA), Caitlin Connelly (Wood Mackenzie), Emily Walker (EnergySage), and Fortunat Mueller (ReVision Energy).

Key issues the panel will dissect include:

The Residential Market Crunch: Analyzing the policy and market conditions behind recent installer bankruptcies and the impact of the expiring residential tax credit (25D) on customer-owned systems.

The VPP Promise: Discussion on the benefits and legislative status of Virtual Power Plants in leading markets like California, and the critical missing pieces needed to make aggregated customer batteries truly effective for grid services.

Soft Cost Conundrum: Exploring non-hardware strategies—from SolarAPP+ adoption to financing innovation—to achieve significant cost reductions in the distributed sector.

Electrification Synergy: The opportunity for installers to bundle solar and storage with heat pumps and EV chargers to deliver a fully integrated, cost-effective home energy solution.

This final session offers a comprehensive outlook on how policy reform, technological integration, and market education will overcome constraints to establish distributed energy as the lynchpin of the future U.S. grid.

Rolls-Royce Replaces The EV Tax Credit

The $5,000 EV Lease Credit for the Spectre EV is available on 2025 and 2026 model years. It’s only available on leases and, like the automaker’s other programs, it ends on November 30. Based on our analysis, the lease cash offer used to be $7,500. After September 30, Rolls-Royce reduced it to $5,000.

The underlying money factor for the Spectre, though, isn’t great at 0.00190 on 2025 model year trims. That’s equivalent to 4.6% APR financing.

Does Maserati Have Better Discounts?

Rolls-Royce isn’t the only luxury brand that introduced discounts on its electric vehicles. Earlier this October, Maserati was offering select models with up to $50,000 in incentives. The Italian brand’s GranTurismo Folgore and GranCabrio Folgore were being offered with $25,000 discounts when leased or purchased, which could be stacked with 5.49% APR financing for 72 months. These discounts heavily outweighed those that were available for gas-powered vehicles.

Why Are Automakers Introducing EV Lease Deals?

The current administration got rid of the federal EV tax credit for shoppers looking to purchase and lease a model at the end of September. The decision essentially made electric cars $7,500 more expensive. Since the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit, automakers have introduced price cuts, lease deals, and special financing rates to persuade shoppers to purchase an EV. In Rolls-Royce’s case, the Spectre wasn’t available for the federal EV tax credit when purchased, but was available with the $7,500 federal tax credit when leased.

AUSTIN, Texas, November 06, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ørsted has selected Habitat Energy to provide optimization and Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) services for its 250 MW, 2-hour battery energy storage system in Fort Bend County, Texas. Once completed, the project will be among the largest standalone batteries operating in ERCOT.

The partnership is structured across two deals: Habitat will contract QSE services to Ørsted’s Asset Management division and optimization & trading services to their Trading division, aligning incentives across both functions. This dual arrangement reflects the increasing importance of integrated energy management for battery energy storage systems in ERCOT, especially hedging strategies that safeguard returns in volatile markets and readiness to thrive under upcoming real-time co-optimization changes.

""This is our largest battery to date, and it’s exactly the kind of project our platform was built for,"" said Mike Kirschner, U.S. Managing Director of Habitat Energy. ""Ørsted is a global and US energy leader with world-class capabilities of its own. Working with Ørsted on this project highlights both its scale and the need for a platform designed to manage large, complex assets in ERCOT’s high-stakes market.""

The battery’s size brings unique operational and market considerations. Every charge and discharge has the potential to move prices, affect congestion, or shift dynamics within the local market. With a co-located solar project also connected to the same interconnection point, Habitat will manage the added complexity of separating solar production from battery metering, ensuring accurate forecasting, dispatch decisions, and revenue capture.

""Large-scale storage is becoming essential to balancing the grid and unlocking further development of American energy,"" said Robert Gomez, Head of Asset Management at Ørsted. ""Habitat’s platform and expertise give us the tools to maximize the value of this key project while managing our market impact.""

With over 1.5 GW of storage under management in ERCOT, Habitat’s growing portfolio reflects the trust that developers and investors are placing in third-party optimization. By combining algorithmic bidding, forecasting, QSE representation, and hedging support, Habitat helps asset owners capture full value from their investments while derisking performance.

The group filed a Notice of Appeal on behalf of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy last Thursday.
“Duke’s new customer program undermines the trust of North Carolinians seeking to protect their families and future generations from the consequences of climate-warming carbon pollution,” said Stacey Washington, clean energy and equity director with SACE, in a written statement.","The Southern Environmental Law Center plans to bring an upcoming Duke Energy program before the North Carolina Court of Appeals.

The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.
The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we’re breathing.
DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.","After months of work and political wrangling over potential legal impact, a new, small network of air sensors began collecting real-time data in four Mississippi River communities and has already detected spikes in pollution since going live in September, an environmental group says.

For years, community and environmental advocates have argued that the state should require real-time, fence-line air monitoring around the state's major industrial facilities to supplement its regional network with more localized data. But the idea has faced resistance from industry, regulators and legislators over the cost, the fear of false positives and of providing fuel for lawsuits.

Located between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, new AQMesh sensors sponsored by environmental group LEAN represent a different tack, putting monitors in the community and offering, the nonprofit's officials believe, the potential to spur voluntary air quality improvements even if the sensors' data don't have regulatory teeth.

""It is our hope that by shining a light on contaminants in the air, we can show companies where their operations are having potentially adverse impacts on neighboring citizens, as well as on company workers, and can spur constructive discussions of ways to reduce emissions and lessen the health impacts,"" Marylee Orr, LEAN's executive director, said in a statement.

The AQMesh sensors can't carry the force of law because they don't meet a new state equipment standard, LEAN officials acknowledge, but they insist the accuracy is close to regulatory-level equipment.

Financed with part of a $500,000 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant, the four LEAN air sensors are located in Alsen, Geismar, St. James and Donaldsonville. The communities were selected after an earlier phase of the project used Aclima's mobile air monitoring car to identify pollution hotspots in the river region.

Running since the beginning of the year, the four sensors were first calibrated for months standing next to Louisiana regulatory air monitors and were found to meet EPA thresholds for data comparability with the state equipment, LEAN's scientific advisors say.

The monitors collect information on fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, total volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. They also collect data on wind speed and direction, with the information published on LEAN's website every 15 minutes.

These pollutants are regulated by the state and federal government, have known health impacts and are common near industrial sources, but, in many cases, can come from many other sources as well.

Slawomir Lomnicki, an LSU environmental science professor who is advising LEAN, explained that the data so far are providing clear trends, including spikes in Geismar for volatile organic compounds, a class of chemicals that can be tied to toxic industrial pollution.

""When we look at the correlation between atmospherical conditions and these pollutants, in many cases, you can see a very clear correlation with the direction from where the plume is coming,"" he said.

'This is historic'

LEAN officials say they have been meeting with community members to discuss the data and then will facilitate meetings between residents and area companies ""to explore ways to correct and prevent emissions incidents.""

The arrival of the sensors has sparked a mix of praise and criticism from community groups, as well as caution from industry and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

""This is historic; for the first time, we have access to real-time information about the air we’re breathing. And now, we—the people—can be part of the solution,"" Pastor Harry Joseph, LEAN’s local community shepherd, who oversees the air quality sensor in St. James Parish, said in a LEAN statement.

DEQ officials said they don't yet have enough information to comment on the air sensors.

The Louisiana Chemical Association, a key trade group for river industries and outspoken critic of the cost and feasibility of public fence-line monitors, said it wants to review the findings ""to better understand"" them, ""confirm their methods and quality controls, and interpret how the results compare with reported emissions data from state and federal authorities.""

""Ambient measurements can reflect background levels and non-industrial contributors, including traffic and other businesses, so we want to ensure these are properly taken into account,"" said David Cresson, president and CEO of LCA and its sister organization, the Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance.

""We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue.""

Other community groups have criticized the sensors as technologically insufficient, though those criticisms have come in the context of a parallel LEAN project still under development in St. Rose.

Four more AQMesh sensors are in place and being calibrated for future reporting in the St. Charles Parish community, where chronic smells and emissions have fueled concern over a large tank farm owned by International Matex Tank Terminals.

Those sensors come after DEQ removed one of its own community monitors a few years ago that both residents and IMTT had wanted to remain.

Though LEAN's early mobile testing didn't find St. Rose was an emissions hotspot, according to a report on that work, IMTT agreed to finance additional LEAN sensors. The data will be collected by a third party and published in real time on LEAN's website, like the current data.

Kimbrelle Eugene Kyereh, who leads the St. Rose community group Refined Community Empowerment, said she didn't trust LEAN's early hotspot findings and argued the LEAN sensors won't provide specific enough information about what kinds of toxic chemicals are in the air.

Traci Johnson, IMTT's vice president for environment, health, safety and security, said the company followed LEAN's recommendations on which chemicals the sensors should test for.

'What's going on here?'

In 2024, as environmental groups began proposing their own community-based systems and conducting other efforts like mobile air monitoring, the Legislature pushed through new rules that barred data from these systems from being used for regulatory actions or lawsuits if they didn't match federal standards for regulatory air monitoring equipment.

That law is the subject of a 1st Amendment lawsuit brought in federal court by environmental groups, though not LEAN.

Larry Starfield, a retired top EPA official and lawyer who also advised LEAN, said that while the sensors are not the same as regulatory air monitors, they have seen great improvement in accuracy over the past decade and come at significantly lower cost than regulatory equipment.

Starfield, who spent his last 12 years at EPA as the principal deputy assistant administrator for enforcement before his retirement in 2023, said that LEAN's advance calibration work has shown the results ""are highly consistent with readings that would be expected using LDEQ’s regulatory monitor.""

But he added that LEAN's intended application will fit a role that EPA says is acceptable for sensors and won't violate the new state law, highlighting instead elevated emissions in the hopes of voluntary corrections, not to allege violations of law.

""Where you have people living so close to industry, having a local, real-time, every-15-minute look at what's going on in your neighborhood in terms of air quality is just unique, and so it just gives them a chance to raise a flag and say, 'Hey, what's going on here?'"" he said.

Starfield pointed out that the earlier phase of the LEAN project that used the air monitoring car found elevated emissions and a company quickly corrected the problem after it was informed. He called it a ""different way of doing business"" than more traditional, slower methods through enforcement or litigation.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/shreveportbossieradvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/59/959f5559-f07f-59ab-a3b3-13257a4019ae/690be18eba8a9.image.jpg?crop=977%2C513%2C0%2C803,N,,2025-11-06 10:20:16.591693

AFPM highlighted the following in its comments:

EPA’s June RFS proposal is already poised to be the most expensive in history. Reallocation will make it worse, potentially pushing total 2026-2027 compliance costs to nearly $150 billion: “…analysts already ‘expect the RVO compliance per barrel of gasoline or diesel to go from $5.42/bbl through the first five months of 2025 to $10.24 in 2026,” meaning that they will nearly double in less than two years. EPA must not exacerbate these high costs with additional volumes… Turner Mason & Company (TM&C) estimates that full (100%) reallocation alone could increase compliance costs by $10–12 billion [pushing total compliance costs to nearly $150 billion].”

Reallocation would raise the RFS well beyond the volume that domestic supplies of soybean oil could support (based on 2026-2027 crushing capacity). It will raise biofuel feedstock costs and make the United States more dependent on imports: “…additional renewable fuel production will be required to achieve the additional volume requirements proposed [by EPA], increasing RIN demand, putting upward pressure on feedstock and RIN prices, and increasing overall RFS program costs… new analysis by S&P Global Commodity Insight confirms that feedstock shortages will increase soybean oil prices, forcing higher imports, and further undermining U.S. energy security — the very outcome the RFS was intended to prevent.”

If EPA’s reallocation mandate helps to drive soybean oil costs significantly higher, total RFS costs—which are paid by American consumers and refiners—could rise from $150 billion to $190 billion over 2026 and 2027: “As a result of forecasted higher feedstock prices, the price difference between bean oil (BO) or more specifically soybean oil — the primary feedstock for biodiesel production—and heating oil (HO) or ultra-low sulfur diesel (referred to as the BOHO spread) is expected to widen. If the spread widens to historical highs, TM&C projects the proposal could increase compliance costs from $136 billion [total costs of EPA’s June RFS proposal] to as much as $190 billion — an increase of $54 billion or 40%. Furthermore, EPA failed to evaluate the impact of this proposal on food prices, which may require shifting the use of soybean oil from current uses, such as food or animal feed, to biofuel production.”

The only lawful, acceptable reallocation number is zero: “EPA must withdraw the SNPRM and instead implement a 0% reallocation policy. Only by setting volumes grounded in real, forward-looking production data and completing a comprehensive statutory impact analysis can EPA maintain compliance with both the Clean Air Act and principles of regulatory accountability.”

The updated strategy targets every stage of the company's value chain, from agriculture and manufacturing to packaging and energy sourcing.

With a workforce of 18,000+ and a portfolio that includes more than 200 brands such as Absolut vodka, Jameson Irish whiskey, Beefeater gin and Malibu liqueur, the group distributes its products in more than 160 countries. The focus now is on making its entire production model more resilient and sustainable, rooted in what Chairman and CEO Alexandre Ricard describes as a generational commitment.

Alexandre says: ""Good Times from a Good Place is our strategy to ensure that we operate in a way that minimises our impact on the environment, supports people throughout our value chain and fosters a culture of convivial drinking.""

Protecting terroir with regenerative agriculture

Pernod Ricard places emphasis on protecting terroir – the natural environment in which its ingredients grow, particularly relevant in viticulture and spirit production. This focus translates into concrete steps to adapt to climate change and enhance biodiversity.

The company is introducing regenerative agriculture, referring to farming practices that aim to restore soil health, capture carbon and improve the ecosystem, across its growing regions. Through this approach, Pernod Ricard aims to reduce agricultural emissions and preserve biodiversity in its supply chain by 2030.

The move includes replacing synthetic fertilisers with greener alternatives, switching to renewable energy for agricultural equipment and introducing cover crops such as clover, herbs and grasses between harvest cycles. These crops help retain soil nutrients, reduce erosion and support pollinators and other biodiversity.

Expert consultation also plays a role, as the business partners with specialists to protect and restore habitats, ensuring long-term resilience in both its ecosystems and harvests.

Alexandre acknowledges the scale of challenges: “Today, the world at large faces a growing number of existential challenges. From the escalating impact of climate change to increasing social and political uncertainty, we remain firm in the belief that operating responsibly and sustainably is fundamental to ensure our business remains resilient in the future.”

Packaging strategy builds circularity

Elsewhere, Pernod Ricard has identified packaging as a critical area to tackle in its carbon footprint, with packaging currently responsible for 26% of its total emissions. The company uses this data to inform material and design changes that fit within a broader circular economy model.

Circularity, in this context, refers to the reuse, recycling and reduction of materials throughout a product’s lifecycle. To address this, the company is increasing the use of post-consumer recycled materials, light-weighting bottles and altering glass colours to reduce emissions during manufacturing.

The business is also moving away from plastic, switching to plastic-free caps and using bottles made with 95% recycled glass. These adjustments not only lower emissions but simplify recycling for end-users.

Energy efficiency upgrades contribute to these goals. For example, Pernod Ricard reports that its Absolut vodka distillery now operates without fossil fuels. Elsewhere, distilleries in Ireland and Scotland have introduced heat recovery technology to reduce both water and energy consumption.

In a broader energy context, 2024 marked the point at which the group reached 100% renewable electricity for all global offices and production sites – achieved through a combination of green energy purchasing and Renewable Energy Certificates, which verify the use of clean power sources.

Prioritising efficiency and responsibility

Maria Pia De Caro, Executive Vice President of Integrated Operations and Sustainability and Responsibility (S&R), explains how sustainability now shapes all aspects of Pernod Ricard's business operations, from sourcing raw materials to distribution.

She says: “Sustainability and responsibility is fully embedded in how we operate, shaping the way we produce and serve our brands while caring for people and the planet. From grain to glass, our value chain reflects a deep commitment to doing business the right way by embedding efficiency and innovation.”

That grain-to-glass model links every production step, ensuring environmental considerations are not treated as standalone initiatives but as embedded parts of every decision. This includes reducing emissions not just at the point of production but across Scope 1, 2 and 3 categories – covering direct emissions, indirect emissions from energy, and all other emissions linked to its supply chain.

With Canada facing a slew of challenges, the Carney government promised a budget that would “swing for the fences” — one that would make generational investments to build, protect and empower Canada.

To do so, the budget outlines an industrial strategy focused largely on infrastructure and boosting business productivity and competitiveness. It hits a lot of the right notes with investments in trade infrastructure, critical minerals and tax incentives for business investment. It also strives to use federal fiscal power to catalyze investment from different sources, with the aim of maximizing the economic impact of each public dollar.

However, with few measures directly aimed at households, the budget appears to sideline affordability — a pressing issue for many Canadians. The government may be betting that Canadians see the wisdom in securing the economic foundations that support Canada’s social programs. As Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew often says, the economic horse pulls the social cart.

The Carney government may be on the right track, but whether the budget delivers remains to be seen. Success requires the public service to excel at program execution, while its employees, funding and access to outside consultants face cuts. This will be a serious test for the public service.

The first industrial strategy in decades

Budget 2025 uses a long list of adjectives, such as accelerating, boosting, strengthening, mobilising, catalysing (with British spelling) and supercharging, to describe a package of measures that arguably amounts to the first comprehensive industrial strategy Canada has seen since the mid-20th century. The goal is to use federal spending and taxation power to drive investments from the private sector and other levels of government to help offset the economic costs of tariffs and the uncertainty they bring.

The budget doubles public capital investments over five years to enable more than $1 trillion in total investment — including in major projects, housing and infrastructure. A suite of tax incentives will also provide Canadian businesses with the lowest marginal effective tax rate in the G7.

Particularly promising investments include:

Spending $5 billion over seven years in a “trade diversification corridors fund” for rail, ports and other infrastructure to improve access to non-U.S. markets.

Dedicating $2 billion over five years for a “critical minerals sovereign fund” to invest in projects and companies.

Creating a “productivity super-deduction” that includes tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest in productivity-enhancing assets and technologies.

A proliferation of strategies: Some impressive, some less so

As part of the industrial strategy, the budget includes a climate competitiveness strategy, a defence industrial strategy and a trade diversification strategy. It also promises an artificial intelligence strategy by the end of 2025.

The climate competitiveness strategy is underwhelming. It vows to engage provinces and territories on a post-2030 industrial carbon pricing trajectory and the benchmark that harmonizes plans across regions. The strategy also promises to update and finalize regulations for methane emissions, electric vehicles and clean fuels, and adjust tax credits.

It hints at axing the oil and gas emissions cap, noting that technologies such as carbon capture and storage would remove the need for it. Expanded critical mineral measures are also rolled into climate competitiveness, given their use in electric vehicles and clean energy.

The defence industrial strategy is more concrete. It commits $6 billion over five years for the creation of the Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science (BOREALIS), support for small and medium-sized enterprises to contribute to defence and security capabilities, and funding to develop and commercialize dual civilian-military technologies. This commitment includes funding for quantum technology development and adoption, partnerships with allies to secure critical mineral supplies, and development of sovereign space launch capability.

The trade diversification strategy is also relatively specific. It earmarks $5 billion over seven years for trade infrastructure, $1 billion over four years for dual-use transportation projects in the north, and enhanced capacity for Export Development Canada to increase the total business they facilitate by $25 billion by 2030.

However, two of the most interesting announcements come with little funding. The first is a new Strategic Exports Office to co-ordinate trade diversification engagement across all departments. The second is tapping the Major Projects Office to act as a single window for proponents and steer a unified and co-ordinated financing approach that prioritizes nation-building projects. Both initiatives propose better co-ordination, which could be powerful if it gets all departmental and Crown agency efforts working in lockstep to achieve the government’s goals.

Execution challenges

Whether the budget delivers will depend on a public service that is expected to do more with less.

The budget commits to reducing the public service workforce by 40,000 below its 2023-24 peak over three years, which amounts to a 10 per cent cut. Early retirement incentives may alleviate some of the pain but could result in a significant loss of knowledge and experience. The public service must also spend 20 per cent less on external consultants, which will limit the option of outside help.

Fiscal rules and the return of discipline to Canada’s finances

Canada’s economic success is at risk from weak climate adaptation

IRPP research shows that industrial policies succeed or fail based on the clarity of the strategy, strength of governance and rigour of program evaluation. To deliver the Carney government’s industrial strategy, policy excellence is a must — something that depends on a public service with strong leadership, significant expertise and effective processes. This may be a tall order for institutions that must cut programs and staff.

Great expectations come with risks

By using lofty language to describe the budget, the government has raised expectations. Canadians may come to feel it overpromised and underdelivered.

It will take time for investments to show results, no matter how fast the government moves. As such, the government must find a way to demonstrate tangible benefits on a shorter timeline to keep Canadians on board. Otherwise, its efforts may amount to a swing and a miss.",https://policyoptions.irpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CP175197393-Carney-budget.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 11:07:59.248693

Tesla is expected to announce on Thursday the results of a shareholder vote determining whether CEO Elon Musk should receive a pay package of nearly $1 trillion worth of stock over the next decade.

There's little mystery to the outcome.

The electric vehicle company has suggested that shareholders approve the plan. Between Musk's substantial ownership and a hefty base of retail investors who almost always vote with the CEO, the numbers are difficult for the opposition, even though top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against the package.

Results of the vote are expected to be shared after Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas.

Board Chair Robyn Denholm, and other Musk fans, have argued that the outsized pay plan would keep Musk at the helm of the company, and that he's critical to Tesla's future and its ability to compete in robotics and artificial intelligence.

Baron Capital's Ron Baron said in a lengthy post on X, Musk's social network, that he's supporting the Tesla CEO.

""Elon is the ultimate 'key man' of key man risk,"" Baron wrote. ""Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.""

But there are some vocal opponents. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), said it would vote no. Norges is one of Tesla's top shareholders.

""While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk — consistent with our views on executive compensation,"" NBIM said in a statement this week.

Shareholder advocate and governance expert James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, is also opposing the plan. The company needs to address a number of risks, he said, especially around demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits that have long incentivized purchases.

""Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,"" McRitchie said. ""There's a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.""

Tesla shares are up 14% this year after a steep third-quarter rally lifted the stock into the green following a brutal start to 2025. Musk's purchase of $1 billion worth of stock aided the rebound.

'Robot army'

Tesla introduced the new pay plan in September. The package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he's made publicly since early 2024.

""If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?"" Musk said to analysts on the company's third-quarter earnings call last month. ""I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.""

The full award would give Musk, who holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.

Musk would receive the first tranche of stock if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Tesla's current market cap is $1.54 trillion.

The next nine tranches would be awarded if Tesla's value increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. Musk would earn the last two tranches if the market cap rises by increments of $1 trillion, meaning it would need to hit $8.5 trillion for Musk to get the full package.

Other goals tied to the pay plan include reaching 20 million vehicle deliveries, 10 million active FSD subscriptions​, 1 million bots delivered and​ 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. To date, Tesla has delivered more than 8 million vehicles, according to its September proxy statement.

The proposed plan doesn't specify whether the FSD subscriptions must be purchased or could include free trials. Tesla currently provides partially automated driving systems, which it markets as ""FSD Supervised"" in the U.S. The company intends to improve its FSD Supervised systems so they don't require human supervision on board.

Tesla also laid out a series of earnings milestones, beginning with $50 billion in annual adjusted profit and moving up to $400 billion. In the third quarter, Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion.

As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals.

There are also a list of ""covered events"" in the award terms that would allow Musk to earn shares without meeting the required operational milestones.

Covered events include natural disasters, wars, pandemics, and changes to ""international, federal, state and local law, regulations or other governmental action or inaction,"" that could hamper the company's ability to design, manufacture or sell its products down the line.

There are other benefits to Musk.

The pay plan doesn't require him to dedicate a minimum amount of time to Tesla, nor does it at all limit his involvement in politics.

In addition to leading Tesla, Musk runs xAI which has merged with X, leads SpaceX and its satellite internet business Starlink, and is a founder of brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Company.

He's also been heavily engaged in politics, most notably working to propel President Donald Trump back to the White House, and then leading a sweeping effort to slash the federal government at the beginning of his second term.

The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper last month estimating that Tesla sales from October 2022 through April of this year in the U.S. would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's ""polarizing and partisan actions.""

Shareholders are voting on the plan after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that Musk's earlier 2018 pay plan was improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.

Nell Minow, a corporate governance expert and chair of ValueEdge Advisors, said she would vote against the new pay plan for Musk, describing him as a ""part-time CEO"" today.

""If they said we're going to pay him a trillion dollars, but he's going to give up all of his outside activities, he's going to shut up about politics, and really spend all this time making this a great company, then I'd say, OK, let's talk about it,"" Minow said. ""But he's not doing any of those things.""

That’s where scores of Venture Dallas investors, founders, and key stakeholders found themselves early on the evening of Oct. 29, chatting away as they sampled hors d’oeuvres and a variety of specialty cocktails. Among them were JPMorgan Chase’s Elaine Agather, serial entrepreneur Rogers Healy, state Sen. Tan Parker (R-Flower Mound), Hubert Zajicek of Health Wildcatters, David Copps of Worlds, and Javier David, the new business editor at The Dallas Morning News. In time, the guests were asked to step into the library to listen to a conversation between Perot Jain partner Aaron Pierce—he’s the Venture Dallas co-founder and chair—and NYSE Texas president Bryan Daniel.

Their talk, and the conference that would follow, came at an opportune time for innovators and investors in North Texas. The region continues to boast strong population growth, a well-educated talent pool, government and infrastructure support, and more and more corporate relocations and expansions. The latter have been especially notable in the technology and financial sectors, with a recent proliferation of data-center developments and the advent of Y’all Street, underscored by the birth of the Texas Stock Exchange and the arrival of NYSE Texas and a new regional headquarters for Nasdaq.

Since beginning operations in March, NYSE’s Daniel told the elite crowd in the Crow library, “Nicey Texas,” as it’s come to be called, already has secured 94 dual listings. “This is just a great place to do business,” he enthused. “We came to Texas really to capitalize on the energy, the momentum, all the great things that we’re seeing in the state.”

‘People want to help each other’

Fourteen hours later, it was Pierce who welcomed attendees to the day-long Venture summit, held at the George W. Bush Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University. Pierce noted that the event has grown “bigger and bigger and bigger” since its inaugural conference in 2019. “Those of us that live here know how great this place is, but for those of you that don’t spend as much time here, I hope that you leave inspired and will say, ‘Man, Dallas is a place where I should be spending more time—maybe I’ll move my family there, or maybe I’ll start a business there,’” Pierce told the crowd.

After still more welcoming remarks by new SMU president Jay Hartzell—he said the university is eager to be the “best possible partner” for Dallas founders, investors, and corporate leaders—Pierce and Agather sat down to talk about JPMorgan’s growth in Texas.

Agather, who leads the bank’s Dallas region, said JPMorgan has grown from 4,000 employees to 33,000 in the Lone Star State, making Texas larger than the bank’s New York market. She explained the substantial growth by citing factors including the state’s geographic location, regulatory stances, diversified economy—and collaborative spirit.

“I think when people move down here at first, they kind of think it’s fake,” she said. “And then they’re like, ‘This is real—people want to help each other,’ and that does raise the bar for everybody.”

Agather also noted JPMorgan’s recently announced Security and Resiliency Initiative, which commits the bank to invest $1.5 trillion over 10 years in supply chains and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence, and strategic technologies like AI and cybersecurity.

Investments of a different sort were outlined next by Bobby Franklin, president and CEO of NCVA—the National Venture Capital Association. Citing NCVA studies, Franklin said venture-capital deals and dollars have ticked up recently, while exit activity remains below 2021’s peak liquidity levels and fundraising is tepid, despite the availability of “lots of dry powder.” But Texas investment, Franklin said, “is looking fantastic,” outstripping most states and outperforming the entire Southwest region so far this year.

The VC industry had “lots of wins” in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, added Franklin. He stressed the need for a single federal standard for AI regulation—rather than different sets of rules in each state—“so that AI can reach its full potential.” He also said the NCVA enjoys a good relationship with new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins, who “is serious about making IPOs great again.”

A cutting-edge trading engine for TXSE

The importance of IPOs was also referenced during a discussion of the new Texas Stock Exchange by Ylan Mui of the Penta Group, a research and consulting firm, and Jeb Hensarling, a former Dallas GOP congressman who’s now a strategic advisor to TXSE (or Tex-ee, as they’re calling it now).

With SEC approval of the Dallas-based exchange having been secured in September, Hensarling told Venture Dallas attendees to look for TXSE to announce its physical headquarters location by year’s end. The first quarter of 2026 will see training on its state-of-the-art “trading engine,” he said, and then listings of ETPs (exchange-traded products) “probably in the second quarter of next year, with listings in corporates to follow.”

TXSE’s cutting-edge trading engine—as well as its newly announced, AI-native Oculon data-analytics and compliance software platform—will give the new exchange a leg up over the NYSE and Nasdaq duopoly, Hensarling said. “I think not only will Tex-ee be great for Texas … but I also think it’s going to be great for capital markets and for those companies who choose to have the ability to have world-class trading and listing at a more competitive price, with policies that are known and stable,” he said.

Panelists at another session called Furthering the Texas Miracle agreed with Hensarling, who’d predicted that in 15 years, Texas will be “the center for capital markets in America.” Ross Perot Jr., chairman of The Perot Companies and Hillwood, cited the business-friendly groundwork laid by the state’s leaders stretching back three decades, from the development of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and the Alliance Texas project to reforms in the legal and education fields.

“You’ve got incredible growth coming, and it’s the airports, it’s infrastructure, but what it really is, is attitude,” Perot said. “It’s a very optimistic attitude and a can-do spirit: We’re going to get it done!”

Drew McKnight, co-CEO and managing partner at Dallas-based Fortress, a global investment group, echoed Perot’s sentiments, highlighting the proactive role of educational institutions like SMU in encouraging entrepreneurship. He also cited the region’s “civic-mindedness”—in sharp contrast to California, where McKnight had worked before relocating to North Texas.

“I wasn’t nearly this civic-minded in California, mainly because they wouldn’t return my phone calls, because they didn’t care,” McKnight said. “And here, whether it’s the mayor or the governor or any one of state representatives, they want to hear from you and they want ideas. That’s encouraging, because when you have an idea and someone actually listens to you, it encourages you to come up with more.”

Robots called ‘the space race of our time’

The idea explored in the next session—a conversation between Apptronik CEO Jeff Cardenas and investor Chris Camillo of Dumb Money—was the future of humanoid robots. Cardenas said Apptronik, a 10-year-old, AI-powered robotics company that has a strategic partnership with Google DeepMind, is reimagining a next generation of general-purpose robots that will change the way people live and work. He likened creation of the company’s latest-iteration robot to a “personal computer moment,” when robots are able to collaborate with humans to accomplish multiple tasks on a mass scale.

Camillo pointed out that China is ahead of the United States in robotic investment and adoption for industrial manufacturing, and Cardenas agreed. “I’ve sort of called this the space race of our time,” said Cardenas, who’s been urging Washington to develop a national robotic strategy. “I think whoever wins it is going to define the future for us.”

He predicted there will be significant progress in making humanoid robots available for the U.S. industrial market at scale by 2027, with adoption for home uses coming a few years afterward. “I would say very confidently that, 10 years from now, it’s very likely that many of you guys have a robot in your home,” Cardenas told the attendees.

Perot Jain managing partner Anurag Jain, whose 14-year-old Access Healthcare was folded in May into a new company in a $6 billion deal by private equity firm New Mountain Capital, said he agreed that “robots are important.” But in a conversation with retired EY partner Debra von Storch, Jain said there should be limits: “I think the creativity of the human mind is something that I don’t want to ever take away.”

Dallas-based Access, the fourth company in Jain’s entrepreneurial journey, had become a leading player in revenue cycle management for the healthcare industry. But Jain told von Storch that the deal with New Mountain made sense because of New Mountain’s ability to keep pace with rapid change in that industry, much of it powered by artificial intelligence. Jain’s next company, he said, also will be a business process outsourcing provider—a “mostly AI native” company in the real estate industry, with far fewer workers than Access’ 27,000 or so.

Asked what “critical lessons” he’d learned during his career that might be helpful to entrepreneurs, Jain said the first is: Don’t sell yourself short. “I think we sold ourselves short many times. Number two is: Your people are the most important thing. … At this point in time, staying private is an equally good opportunity [as an IPO], depending on the company, where you are, and the capital you need,” he continued. “I think private equity is a fantastic option if you find the right partner.”

Seeking innovators and investors who are brave

Participants in another panel called Driving Growth Through Dallas Venture Capital indicated that, for too many DFW founders, securing any kind of equity is problematic. Despite the proliferation of wealthy investors in North Texas, the panelists said, startups that often are forced to fundraise elsewhere end up relocating permanently to other cities, depriving the region of entrepreneurial vitality. The culprit, the panelists agreed, is the “standardized playbooks” of traditional Dallas industries like energy and real estate, which conflict with venture’s bent toward creativity and contrarian thinking.

What’s needed, they said, is a stronger bench of local CEOs and business owners as well as a cadre of so-called bravery hunters—that is, a new generation of transformative founders courageous enough to tackle truly hard problems while taking real risks. “It’s that risk calibration. Are we getting the most novel technology companies on the planet, or certainly at least in the United States, into the DFW area?” asked John Redgrave, co-founder and general partner of Dallas-based DTX Ventures. “We’ve got to be bravery hunters. We hunt for people who are brave, and we ourselves need to be brave. That means writing checks to early-stage companies who are going to go and change some ecosystem.”

Another panelist—Jun II Kwun, founder and managing director at Actium Group—made the case for Dallas as a life-sciences powerhouse, albeit one that he said still needs a critical mass of life-sciences companies and CEOs willing to relocate to North Texas. But, according to participants in a discussion called Advancing Life Sciences and Venture Innovation, that’s happening already. “The Texas life-sciences ecosystem is experiencing remarkable growth, and Dallas has really emerged as an inspiring innovation hub,” said discussion moderator Jenn Yandle, executive director, life sciences-innovation economy for JPMorgan. “In fact, we are seeing one of the fastest-growing markets in the country, and we’re seeing remarkable growth in terms of the expansion of lab space and the deepening of our talent pools and the amount of companies that are making DFW home.”

Bridging the tech-transfer gap

A lynchpin for Dallas’ growth in the sector is Pegasus Park, a 26-acre, biotech and life-sciences development near the Dallas Design Center and the Southwestern Medical District. With tenants like Health Wildcatters, Mass Challenge, and UT Southwestern Medical Center, plus a record of incubating more than 30 companies collectively valued at $14 billion, the complex funded in part by billionaire philanthropist Lyda Hill is bridging the gap between scientific discovery and commercializing those discoveries.

“I remember, right when we were opening Pegasus Park, standing out in the parking lot with a local venture capital family office,” said Nicole Small, CEO of LH Capital. “And he said to me, ‘We really are interested in the healthcare space, but we don’t really know how to get into UT Southwestern, because it’s like over there in those buildings!’ And literally right at that time the head of tech transfer walked through the parking lot and I was like, ‘Oh, let me introduce you two.’ Those are the sort of collisions being created there.”

A “collision” of a different sort—one that occurred a few years ago following a board meeting of Venture Dallas—was described during a panel called Killer Brands: How Liquid Death Disrupted the Beverage Industry. Access Capital co-founder Blake Wiley said the Venture meeting was how he’d met Marissa Bertha, chief strategy officer at Liquid Death, the canned water and beverages brand that’s earned a $1.4 billion valuation thanks to its viral punk/metal marketing campaigns.

Besides Access Capital, the brand’s investors have included other investment firms, family offices, entertainment companies, and aluminum can manufacturers, Bertha said. And, after expanding its offerings from canned water to soda-flavored sparkling water and iced tea, the brand is poised to debut an energy drink in January, she added. “We’ve been able to grow as the most expensive product in every category in which we play,” Bertha said. “We’re the most expensive water, we’re the most expensive flavored sparkling, we’re the most expensive tea. But in the energy category, we will actually be able to be priced at parity.”

‘It’s OK to fail’

Closing out the conference, Capital Factory president and co-founder Bryan Chambers introduced the day’s final three “fireside chats” featuring Draper Associates partner Andy Tang, Keen Technologies founder John Carmack, and Colossal Biosciences co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm.

“Texas isn’t just big, it’s consequential,” Chambers told the crowd. “You may already know that if Texas were a country, it would be the eighth-largest economy in the world. That means the connections and the choices our community makes in rooms like this one ripple globally through supply chains and reach the cloud. Over the next hour and a half, you’re going to hear some more really big ideas.”

Tang alone proved him right. Draper, a prominent, early-stage VC firm that’s backed startups ranging from Tesla and Skype to Robinhood, invests in the likes of AI, robotics and automation, healthcare and biotech, and crypto and blockchain. Tang said that while he’s confident AI represents the “fourth industrial revolution” over the long haul, the transition will bring short-term pain to many in the current workforce. “Better days are ahead,” he said, “but that transition? I’m not sure.”

During his talk, Tang also said he’s optimistic about the safe use of nuclear power, advocated for reasonable cryptocurrency regulation at the federal level, and urged Texas entrepreneurs to be more risk-tolerant. “Here you think big—but let me help you to not, sort of, play too tight,” Tang said. “It’s OK to fail. There’s nothing wrong with failing. That’s one thing I learned from Silicon Valley. I find that in Texas, if we combined these two things—thinking big and [taking] big risks—it could become the next big venture market.”

One entrepreneur who embodies risk-taking is Carmack, the Dallas tech icon who’s now pursuing the keys to artificial general intelligence. In a riveting, “no-nonsense” conversation, Carmack explained that while the capabilities of today’s large language models are amazing, they lack the “classical reinforcement learning abilities” that are needed for continuous learning and long-term retention. As a result, he’s zeroed in at Keen on a “more obscure field of AI, which is reinforcement learning,” Carmack said. And he’s doing so largely by “running Atari simulations on modest numbers of GPUs.”

Dallas-based Keen, which has raised $20 million from various investors including Capital Factory, is grounding these experiments in the physical world, with actual Atari systems on tables with TVs, cameras, and robot controllers moving joysticks, Carmack said. The success of his experiments will be in the actual market value they create, he said, not in whether they “identify the clear bright line of AGI”—a quest he dismissed as “dorm room philosophy, arguments that are completely without value.”

“What are people willing to pay for?” he said. “How much value do they get out of this? I’m comfortable letting that drive most of the marketing investment.”

A sold-out event

The summit’s final speaker was Lamm, whose Dallas-based Colossal focuses on disruptive conservation through “de-extinction efforts,” such as resurrecting the woolly mammoth, the dodo bird, and the dire wolf.

Having attained a valuation of $10.3 billion since its founding in 2021 by Lamm and geneticist George Church, Colossal is taking a “software programming” approach to de-extinction, Lamm said, stressing precision in its gene editing. Its 2024 woolly mouse project, for example, produced 36 healthy mice with exactly targeted phenotypes, making it what Lamm called the most precision-edited multicellular organism on the planet.

The company deploys artificial intelligence across multiple functions—“Without AI, our projects would take 50 years plus,” Lamm said—and has found success on the national stage after oversubscribing every one of its funding rounds. “Anybody who tells you they don’t have trouble raising money is just lying,” Lamm said. “But we’ve also worked hard.”

He added that while he obviously appreciates Colossal’s “economic returns,” he’s motivated as well by the “inspiration aspects” of the company’s work. By that, Lamm said, he means the “promise we’ve made to kids in the world—the people that are rooting for us in your random classroom in Middle America. I think that promise is as big as a promise we make to an investor that gives us $300 million.”

Toward the end of the day, Pierce, the Venture Dallas chair, said the 2025 conference showed that the North Texas startup community has made great strides in the last year or so: It’s attracted new companies like Stablecore, hosted new venture funds like DTX, and watched Colossal attain decacorn status.

“There’s clearly so much energy in our space,” Pierce told Dallas Innovates. “How do we unlock that energy and create more great companies and more good outcomes for investors? It’s clear that something’s happening, and we’re tapping into that energy.”

One indication of this enthusiasm was attendance at the conference itself, he said.

“I look 12 months from where we were last year, and this year there were people outside trying to get into a sold-out event,” Pierce said. “There was a line out the door, with people asking, ‘Hey, can I buy a ticket?’ And sadly, we had to say no. We couldn’t accept one more without violating the venue constraints on capacity. So maybe, in the future, you think about if there’s a venue that can fit even more people.”

The physical transformation needed for the energy transition is advancing, but at about half the pace required to meet global commitments. Less than 15 percent of the low-emissions technologies required to meet Paris-aligned targets by 2050 have been deployed—a few percentage points higher than two years ago.

Deployment advanced in three of the seven parts of the energy system but stalled elsewhere. Momentum is strongest in low-emissions power, electrifying transportation, and critical mineral supplies. Progress is mostly stuck in carbon capture, hydrogen fuels, and heavy industry.

China accounts for about two-thirds of additional solar and wind power and electric vehicle sales since 2022. Emerging economies have stepped up, but the pace of deployment in the United States and the European Union slowed in 2025 in some areas.

The outlook has worsened for the hardest physical challenges of the transition. Advancing the transition will require tackling 25 physical challenges. There are bright spots such as improved range for electric vehicles. But progress on the most demanding challenges, including those related to hydrogen and decarbonizing steel, has been hampered by project cancellations, slow technological progress, and policy shifts.

Understanding the physical realities of the energy transition is more important than ever. This lens clarifies the scale of the task ahead, helping to set priorities amid uneven progress and to pinpoint emerging areas of opportunity and bottlenecks that demand new approaches.

Today’s energy system, encompassing the production and consumption of energy resources, is high performing, deeply enmeshed in the global economy, and has developed over centuries. But for all its advantages, today’s system also has flaws, most notably the fact that it generates more than 85 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Stakeholders around the world are engaged in the task of transforming the system to reduce its emissions. There is growing recognition that this must be done in a way that is affordable, reliable, enables competitiveness, and, in many places in the world, while increasing overall access to energy. More recently, a shifting policy landscape, geopolitical tensions, and surging energy demand from data centers have added further complexity.

In a digital age, we have become accustomed to lightning-fast transformations. However, the energy transition, particularly one that enables these broader objectives, is a challenging undertaking and requires a vast and complex physical transformation.

In 2024, the McKinsey Global Institute report The hard stuff: Navigating the physical realities of the energy transition took stock of where the world stands on this physical transformation. We found that, despite meaningful progress, the transition was in its early stages, with just about 10 percent of the required deployment of low-emissions technologies by 2050 achieved in most areas. The research identified 25 physical challenges that must be overcome for the transition to succeed—from developing and scaling new low-emissions technologies to building the supply chains and infrastructure they depend on.

We grouped the 25 physical challenges into three levels of difficulty. Level 1 challenges require progress on deploying established technologies and face the fewest physical hurdles. Level 2 challenges require accelerating deployment of known technologies, along with scaling the associated infrastructure and inputs. In Level 3 challenges—we call these 12 the “demanding dozen”—gaps in technological performance remain (often in demanding use cases), large interdependencies exist, and the transformation is just beginning.

In this research, we update our assessment of the energy transition with another reality check on where things stand, where progress has been made, and the task ahead. We find that an estimated 13.5 percent of the deployment to meet Paris-aligned goals has now been done. Many factors have driven progress on deployment across regions where it has occurred—emissions reduction goals, but also favorable economics, and the broader imperatives that we have noted. Nevertheless, progress has proceeded at roughly half the pace that would have been required to meet targets aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement, with only a few percentage points of headway in two years.

Against this backdrop, we find a tale of many transitions (Exhibit 1). Deployment has taken place, but it has largely involved only critical minerals, low-emissions power, and electric vehicles (EVs). There has been little movement in hydrogen, carbon capture, or low-emissions technologies for making steel and other key materials.

China accounted for about two-thirds of recent deployment in EVs and in solar and wind power. In the first half of 2025, emerging economies (excluding China) installed more new solar and wind capacity than either the European Union (EU) or the United States, where momentum is slowing.

And what of progress on the 25 challenges that will need to be tackled for the energy transition to succeed? The picture is mixed. Many of the easier challenges are getting solved, but we remain stuck on the most demanding ones, particularly related to improving performance and affordability.

Our aim with this research is to help business leaders and policymakers identify where there is opportunity from the energy transition and where fresh ideas are needed.

The transition is moving at half the pace needed to meet Paris-aligned targets

The energy transition is moving forward, but unevenly. Deployment of solar panels, batteries, and electric cars has been accelerating, for example. Similarly, the supply of critical minerals is rising quickly as new facilities come online, so much so that there are worries of oversupply in the short term. But progress in other areas—notably, decarbonizing heavy industries, scaling hydrogen, and capturing carbon—is largely stuck. Of the seven domains of the energy system we track, three are progressing and accelerating, but four are not.

By the end of 2024, about 13.5 percent of low-emissions technologies needed to meet Paris-aligned 2050 targets across the seven domains we study had been deployed on average. This is about three percentage points of progress in two years. This pace is roughly half of what would be required to meet Paris-aligned targets. Six percentage points on deployment in the past two years would have been in line with such targets (Exhibit 2).

We also analyze how deployment is progressing in each domain by measuring it against a “cruising speed.” By this, we mean a hypothetical constant speed of required annual deployment that is consistent with keeping global warming well below 2°C. While recognizing that progress may not be linear, this approach is a useful way to calibrate how we are going (for more on our approach, see sidebar “Measuring progress”).

Among the domains, raw materials is the only one where progress is outstripping cruising speed (Exhibit 3). Supply of critical minerals has been growing, especially in Africa, China, and Indonesia. Higher investment and an acceleration in the time it takes to bring projects online have put critical minerals on a trajectory that can sustain rapid growth in solar, batteries, and EVs.

Power is also in high gear. Between 2022 and 2024, annual additions of solar, wind, and other low-emissions generation doubled to 600 gigawatts, almost as much as the combined power grids of India and Brazil. Momentum on capacity additions further strengthened in early 2025, with wind and solar collectively up more than 60 percent year on year. The vast majority of these additions were of solar capacity. To put this into perspective, more solar capacity has been added since 2022 than in all previous years. If the pace holds, global capacity additions could reach a cruising speed of about 1,000 gigawatts of new low-emissions power annually before 2030.

Mobility is another bright spot. By mid-2025, about one in four passenger cars sold worldwide was electric. Global sales of battery electric and plug-in hybrid cars reached 17 million in 2024, up 70 percent from 2022, and momentum carried into 2025. Still, a reality check is in order: Volumes would need to more than triple, to around 60 million a year, for this domain to reach cruising speed.

In the other domains—buildings, industry, hydrogen, and carbon management—the story is far less encouraging. Although sales of heat pumps are above prepandemic levels, the surge in deployment of heat pumps after Europe’s 2022 gas price shock has receded. In the other three domains, deployment remains negligible.

Even in the accelerating domains of power, mobility, and raw materials, it is certainly too soon to declare victory on their ability to reach cruising speed. There are two important caveats. First, so far, China has driven the lion’s share of progress. If these domains are to keep growing and reach their cruising speed, progress will have to be more global. Second, as we discussed in our 2024 report, as deployment advances, it can become harder. For example, as more renewables are introduced into power generation, the system can become more volatile.

The next two chapters examine precisely these two aspects: regional differences and the physical challenges that need to be tackled for the energy transition to succeed.

China accounts for two-thirds of deployment, but emerging economies are stepping up

The geography of deployment in the energy transition is also not even and is shifting. China sits at the front, emerging economies are moving faster, and deployment in advanced economies is slowing down in some areas. In the domains that are accelerating, notably power and mobility, China has been responsible for around two-thirds of deployment in recent years (Exhibit 4).

China is playing the largest role globally in deploying low-emissions technologies

China is the world’s largest emitter of CO2 and has also accounted for most increases in emissions since 2022. Fossil fuels provide about 87 percent of China’s energy supply, and its electricity grid is still heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels for more than 60 percent of generation.

Nonetheless, China also accounts for the most progress in the deployment of low-emissions technologies. Since 2022, China has delivered nearly two-thirds of all new global capacity of solar and wind power. In the first half of 2025, this figure reached three-quarters. This boom now gives China almost a quarter of the low-emissions power needed to meet its share of 2050 deployment targets—nearly double the global average.

China’s role in mobility is just as notable. China accounts for six out of ten passenger EVs and nine out of every ten electric trucks on the road. In the first half of 2025, passenger EVs sold in China accounted for almost 65 percent of global sales. China has already reached 19 percent of the EV deployment needed by mid-century, compared with just 3 percent elsewhere.

Momentum in the United States and Europe slowed in 2025

In 2024, the United States added about 40 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity, a 60 percent jump from 2022 additions. But in the first half of 2025, new additions were flat compared with the same period in the previous years. EV sales also hit a plateau after years of rapid growth.

In Europe, deployment is also advancing at a slower pace in some areas. The EU added about 70 gigawatts of solar and wind in 2024—a 40 percent increase relative to 2022—but as in the United States, there hasn’t been any year-on-year growth in 2025. By contrast, EV adoption continued to climb, with passenger EV sales up more than 20 percent in the first half of 2025, compared with a year earlier.

Nevertheless, progress on deployment can be found within each of these regions. For instance, in the United States, some states moved ahead faster. While installations of solar power in the United States overall were up by less than 5 percent in the first six months of 2025, compared with a year earlier, several states, including Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, and Texas, grew installations by 15 to 80 percent. A similar picture played out in the EU, where Spain and France increased the solar and wind capacity installed by around 35 and 25 percent, respectively.

Emerging economies stepped up deployment

Perhaps the most striking development has been the increased role of deployment of low-emissions technologies in emerging economies. Since 2022, the additions of solar and wind power have grown faster than in the United States or the EU. In fact, in the first six months of 2025, emerging economies installed an estimated 30 gigawatts, similar to the EU. India alone added more than 20 gigawatts—more solar and wind power than the United States during that period.

Much of this momentum has been fueled by Chinese exports. Solar exports to emerging economies doubled from 2022 to 2024, overtaking those to high-income economies. Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia have emerged as leading importers while demand across Africa has also surged. The growth of distributed generation (for example, solar panels installed on the rooftops of people’s homes) is a big driver, helping extend access in markets where central grid expansion is slower.

EV adoption in emerging markets is also accelerating. Between 2022 and 2024, their share of global EV car sales almost doubled, from about 3 percent to 5 percent. In the first half of 2025, the number increased to 7 percent—roughly equal to the US total. The growth has been striking in economies like Brazil, where sales jumped from about 20,000 in 2022 to more than 120,000 in 2024, and in Southeast Asian countries, where sales grew from around 40,000 to more than 200,000 in the same period, a fivefold rise.

The hardest stuff may be getting harder

While progress has been achieved in deploying low-emissions technologies, the transition remains in its early stages, and progress is far from even. Achieving the remainder of the energy transition will require addressing 25 physical challenges, as outlined in our 2024 report. Examples of physical challenges are managing power systems with a large share of variable renewables, addressing range and payload challenges in electric trucks, and finding alternative heat sources, feedstocks, and processes for producing industrial materials.

In 2024–25, we find that many of the (relatively) easy physical challenges are being solved, but the hardest ones remain broadly stuck. Since 2022, almost no progress has been made on the demanding dozen. However, about half of energy-related emissions depend on tackling these challenges (Exhibit 5).

Easier challenges are being solved

In this update, we found that the 13 challenges previously categorized as Level 1 and 2 remained in those categories. But many of them continue to experience forward momentum. There has been progress in the form of continued technological improvement and removal of bottlenecks to help with scaling in six of them since our 2024 report.

Most progress was in electrification-related areas and improvements in underlying technologies. Batteries are a prime example. Their energy density has improved 10 to 20 percent across different chemistries, which has extended the range of EVs (challenge 8). Furthermore, the increased use of chemistries such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) has led to the reduction in both emissions from manufacturing and the cost of manufacturing EVs, improving the breakeven distance of EVs in comparison with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in terms of their carbon (and cost) savings (challenge 7).

Having sufficient clean firm power as a complement to variable renewables (challenge 6) has also progressed. While deployment of clean firm power has not advanced meaningfully since 2022, new technologies promise to create new options even if they are a few years away from mass commercialization. Geothermal drilling times have fallen by about 80 percent; pilots for enhanced geothermal systems have launched in the United States; and a few small modular reactors (SMRs) are actively under construction, including in Argentina, China, Russia, and the United States, with more than 30 in the design stage.

That is the good news, but of the comparatively easy Level 1 and 2 challenges, there are still six where progress has, on balance, been neutral, often with both positive and negative developments.

And in one case, the negatives outweighed the positives. The grid is a growing bottleneck (challenge 5). Supply chain constraints have pushed transformer and cable prices up by about a third since 2022, while delivery times have doubled to two or three years. At the same time, the IEA has estimated that 1,650 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity globally were awaiting connection in 2024, due to grid investment and permitting delays. That is equivalent to six times Germany’s current generation capacity. Expanding the grid is critical to the entire transition to, for instance, support the connection of new low-emissions power sources, integrate storage, and enable EV charging.

Overall, policy has had a mixed impact on the pace of the transition. In the case of Level 1 and Level 2 challenges, policy measures did offer some tailwinds. One example is reforms to nuclear permitting that streamline approvals for early-stage projects, including advanced reactor designs (challenge 6). In Europe, recent initiatives streamlined permitting to secure critical mineral supplies (challenge 19) and expanded support for heat electrification (challenge 16).

But for the hardest—Level 3—challenges, the picture looks meaningfully different.

Level 3 challenges are mostly stuck, despite a few bright spots

Solving Level 3 challenges requires meaningful technology advances, establishing a track record of deployment to build scale, and solutions to complex interdependencies. However, during the past two years, the opposite has occurred for many Level 3 challenges. Attempts to tackle five of the demanding dozen challenges are mostly experiencing negative trends.

Across these five, of course there has been some innovation, such as the emergence of new types of hydrogen electrolyzers and new processes for producing industrial materials. However, by and large, more effort is needed to improve performance and costs in these areas. Moreover, a deteriorating economic background together with policy shifts (some in 2025) have prompted the cancellation of many of the few pilot projects that had been underway. So, progress toward commercial scale has been negligible (see sidebar “New forces are reshaping the transition”).

Consider hydrogen’s two physical challenges—deploying hydrogen in an efficient way (challenge 20) and scaling hydrogen infrastructure (challenge 21). These have come up against significant headwinds. Cancellations of more than 50 hydrogen projects were announced from 2024 to mid-2025. A wave of cancellations has also hit downstream projects reliant on hydrogen, including low-emissions steel projects (challenge 12) in Germany; ammonia production (challenge 15) in Australia; and more than 15 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects for aviation (challenge 11).

Having said this, there have been success stories even within Level 3. Better batteries and improvements in design, such as aerodynamics, have enabled electric trucks (challenge 9) to reach longer average ranges. Many original equipment manufacturers have extended the ranges of their flagship models, many of which can now travel more than 600 kilometers without recharging. The performance gap with diesel is narrowing. Battery electric trucks can now serve use cases that were previously thought to need low-emissions fuels such as hydrogen. Furthermore, megawatt charging systems are offering faster charging than ever before. They could charge the average heavy-duty truck in about 15 minutes—half the time of an ultra-fast charging system. The global stock of medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks more than tripled between 2022 and 2024. Still, they are at less than 1 percent of the 2050 target, and about 90 percent of them are in China.

In heavy industry, cement has similarly bucked the trend. In 2025, the world’s first full-scale cement carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) plant came online in Norway, and a pilot plasma-heated kiln came online in Sweden. These were both milestones in tackling one of the toughest industrial decarbonization challenges.

Navigating the physical realities

The past two years have shown that the energy transition is moving in many directions at once. Some barriers are falling, while others seem to be getting taller. Overall, a nuanced understanding of the physical challenges and where there are headwinds and tailwinds remains critical for leaders looking to navigate the energy transition. (For details of all 25 physical challenges, see the appendix: “Progress report, 2024–25.”)

Progress on what were already the Level 1 and 2 challenges has opened new opportunities. But making further headway will take more disciplined execution, both to maintain the pace of progress in challenges where it has been made and to accelerate where it hasn’t. For business leaders, advantage will come from anticipating the next constraint and positioning early to remove it. The organizations most likely to succeed will be those that treat execution as a source of competitive advantage.

The hardest obstacles—Level 3 challenges—still depend on innovation, both in individual technologies and across entire systems. As our 2024 report discussed, it is essential to keep testing how technologies fit together within a wider system and how their roles may evolve. In the past two years, breakthroughs in low-emissions cement and electric trucks show that there is rarely a single route forward. For a long time, low-emissions fuels such as hydrogen were seen as the main way to match the performance of fossil fuels in these applications. Now denser batteries for trucks and electric and plasma-heated kilns for cement are pushing electrification ahead. Similar shifts could reshape other industries and open new paths to solving the demanding dozen.

Tackling the physical challenges of the energy transition remains hard stuff. There is progress but there are also headwinds. Building the capacity to read the landscape and act quickly on opportunities will matter more than ever. Clearly seeing the physical realities and how they change will help leaders steer toward lower emissions while ensuring an affordable, reliable, and competitive path to net zero.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/mckinsey%20global%20institute/our%20research/the%20hard%20stuff%202025%20taking%20stock%20of%20progress%20on%20the%20physical%20challenges%20of%20the%20energy%20transition/the%20hard%20stuff%202025%20update-1352147326-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 11:08:09.154503

This brownfield expansion north of Toronto represents more than just another industrial project—it embodies a fundamental shift toward domestic supply chain resilience in the battery materials sector.

The project's specifications demonstrate significant industrial scale ambitions. With an annual production capacity of 6,500 tonnes of battery-grade cobalt sulfate, the facility positions itself as a cornerstone asset for regional battery manufacturing. The comprehensive financing structure totaling US$82 million reflects sophisticated risk management, combining US$48 million in non-dilutive government support with private investment capital.

Table: Electra Battery Materials Cobalt Refinery Key Metrics

Metric Value Annual Production Capacity 6,500 tonnes battery-grade cobalt sulfate Total Project Financing US$82 million Government Support US$48 million (non-dilutive) Target Commissioning Date 2027 Construction Restart Date November 2025 Location North of Toronto, Ontario

The brownfield nature of this development significantly reduces execution risk compared to greenfield alternatives. Major processing equipment remains on-site from previous operations, concrete foundations are completed, and infrastructure has been upgraded to support full capacity operations. This existing asset base provides a substantial head start toward operational readiness.

Furthermore, the strategic timing of this restart aligns with broader North American policy initiatives supporting domestic critical minerals processing. The facility targets commissioning in 2027, positioning it to meet growing regional demand for battery-grade materials as electric vehicle production scales and grid storage deployment accelerates across the continent.

Breaking Down the US$82 Million Financing Structure

The financing architecture of this cobalt refinery project reveals sophisticated government-private sector collaboration. The US$48 million in government support represents approximately 58.5% of total project costs, demonstrating unprecedented public sector commitment to critical minerals infrastructure development.

This tri-national government backing involves coordinated support from United States federal agencies, Canadian federal programmes, and Ontario provincial economic development initiatives. The non-dilutive structure of government support preserves shareholder equity while providing essential risk mitigation for project completion.

Key Investment Structure Components:

• Government Support (58.5%): US$48 million across three jurisdictions

• Private Investment (41.5%): US$34 million in equity and debt financing

• Risk Profile: Significantly reduced through public-private partnership model

• Repayment Terms: Non-dilutive government support minimises equity dilution

The financing model demonstrates how government policy can effectively catalyse private investment in strategic industrial capacity. Unlike traditional subsidies or grants, this structure aligns public policy objectives with commercial viability, creating sustainable foundations for long-term operations.

The Role of Tri-National Government Backing

The coordination between American, Canadian, and provincial government agencies represents a notable evolution in North American industrial policy. This alignment reflects shared strategic interests in reducing dependence on overseas processing capacity for materials critical to defence, industrial, and energy transition applications.

In addition, the critical minerals policy shift emphasises domestic processing capabilities, making projects like this increasingly valuable for national security objectives.

The combination of US, Canadian, and Ontario government support totalling US$48 million represents nearly 60% of the project's financing, demonstrating unprecedented policy alignment for critical minerals onshoring.

Government support mechanisms likely include combinations of direct capital contributions, loan guarantees, tax incentives, and accelerated depreciation schedules. The specific allocation between federal and provincial jurisdictions reflects the cross-border nature of North American battery supply chains and shared economic interests in domestic processing capacity.

Strategic Importance for Defence and Industrial Applications

Cobalt sulfate serves essential functions across defence electronics, aerospace components, and high-performance industrial applications beyond battery manufacturing. Domestic processing capacity reduces supply chain vulnerabilities that could impact critical national infrastructure and defence systems.

The refinery's capacity to produce 6,500 tonnes annually addresses significant market demand. Battery-grade cobalt sulfate specifications require purity levels exceeding 99.5% with strict limits on iron, nickel, copper, and manganese contamination. These technical standards ensure compatibility with advanced battery manufacturing processes used by major cell producers.

Understanding Battery-Grade Cobalt Requirements

Battery-grade cobalt sulfate represents a highly specialised intermediate product in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. The material serves as a precursor for cathode active materials, particularly in nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) battery chemistries commonly used in electric vehicles and consumer electronics.

The technical specifications for battery-grade cobalt sulfate extend beyond basic purity requirements. Manufacturing processes demand consistent particle size distribution, controlled moisture content, and specific dissolution characteristics that enable uniform cathode material production. These parameters directly impact battery cell performance, cycle life, and safety characteristics.

Current battery industry trends show increasing demand for cobalt-containing cathodes despite ongoing efforts to reduce cobalt content per cell. Higher energy density requirements for electric vehicle applications and grid storage systems maintain strong demand for cobalt-based materials, even as individual battery chemistries evolve.

North American Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

The current global cobalt production landscape reveals significant geographic concentration risks that this refinery aims to address. Asian processing facilities, particularly in China, handle the majority of global cobalt intermediate processing, creating potential supply chain bottlenecks for North American manufacturers.

Table: Global Cobalt Processing Landscape

Region Processing Capacity Market Share Strategic Control China Dominant 70%+ High Democratic Republic of Congo Raw material source N/A Limited North America Emerging <5% Growing

This concentration creates multiple vulnerability points: transportation logistics, currency exchange risks, trade policy uncertainties, and potential supply disruptions during geopolitical tensions. North American battery manufacturers currently depend on lengthy supply chains that transport raw cobalt from African mines through Asian processing facilities before reaching domestic battery production facilities.

Consequently, the Electra Battery Materials cobalt refinery construction restart addresses these vulnerabilities by establishing domestic processing capability that can handle multiple feedstock sources, including recycled battery materials, North American mining outputs, and diversified international raw material inputs.

The Economics of Midstream Processing

Cobalt midstream processing economics involve significant value addition between raw materials and finished battery-grade products. Processing margins typically reflect the technical complexity, quality control requirements, and market positioning of refined products versus raw cobalt concentrates or hydroxides.

The brownfield development approach provides economic advantages through reduced capital expenditure compared to greenfield alternatives. Existing infrastructure, equipment, and site preparation eliminate substantial upfront costs while accelerating time-to-production timelines.

Economic Value Drivers:

• Processing margins: Value addition between raw cobalt and battery-grade sulfate

• Transportation cost savings: Reduced shipping costs for North American customers

• Currency stability: USD-based transactions eliminate foreign exchange risks

• Supply chain efficiency: Shortened lead times and reduced logistics complexity

Early Works Programme Completion

The construction restart builds upon substantial preparatory work completed during the early works programme phase. Site preparation activities, permit acquisition, and detailed engineering phases have established readiness for full construction mobilisation planned for early 2026.

Critical infrastructure components are already positioned for rapid construction progress. Concrete foundations completed during previous development phases provide structural readiness for equipment installation. Major processing equipment remains on-site, eliminating long lead times typically associated with specialised refining machinery procurement.

However, the engagement of EXP for construction management brings established expertise in industrial project execution. This professional oversight structure enhances project delivery discipline and provides experienced management of complex construction logistics in Canadian winter conditions.

Infrastructure and Equipment Readiness

The brownfield advantage becomes evident in infrastructure and equipment positioning. Unlike greenfield developments that require complete site development, this project benefits from existing utilities, access roads, and basic industrial infrastructure that significantly accelerates construction timelines.

Current Site Status:

• Foundations: Concrete work completed and ready for equipment installation

• Utilities: Electrical, water, and communication infrastructure upgraded

• Access: Transportation and logistics access established

• Equipment: Major processing equipment on-site and inventoried

• Permits: All necessary construction and operational permits secured

Winter Preparation and Site Activities

Construction activities in Ontario require careful management of seasonal weather constraints. The November construction restart timing allows for site preparation and system reinstatement activities before winter weather intensifies, whilst positioning for accelerated construction progress during spring 2026.

Winter activities focus on mechanical, electrical, and instrumentation systems reinstatement rather than weather-sensitive outdoor construction. This approach maintains project momentum whilst respecting seasonal construction limitations that impact outdoor concrete work and equipment installation.

Timeline Visualisation:

• November 2025: Construction restart and site preparations

• Winter 2025-2026: System reinstatement and indoor preparation activities

• Early 2026: Full-scale construction mobilisation

• 2027: Target commissioning and production startup

LG Energy Solution Partnership Analysis

The partnership with LG Energy Solution provides essential market validation and revenue security for the refinery project. As one of the world's leading battery cell manufacturers, LG Energy Solution's commitment to North American cobalt sulfate sourcing demonstrates genuine market demand for domestically processed materials.

This geographic proximity creates natural logistics advantages for cobalt sulfate sourcing from the Toronto-area refinery, reducing transportation costs and supply chain complexity compared to Asian alternatives.

For instance, the offtake relationship likely includes volume commitments, quality specifications, pricing mechanisms, and delivery schedules that provide predictable revenue streams essential for project financing and operational planning. Such agreements typically span multiple years and include provisions for volume adjustments based on market conditions.

Feedstock Supply Chain Diversification

The refinery's feedstock strategy emphasises supply chain diversification to reduce dependence on single-source raw material suppliers. This approach includes capability to process various cobalt intermediates: concentrates from mining operations, recycled materials from battery recycling facilities, and intermediate products from other processing operations.

Recent developments in battery recycling breakthrough technology represent a growing feedstock opportunity as electric vehicle adoption creates increasing volumes of end-of-life battery materials. Cobalt recovery from recycled batteries can provide high-grade feedstock whilst supporting circular economy objectives and reducing primary mining requirements.

North American cobalt mining operations, whilst limited compared to African sources, provide potential regional feedstock sources that enhance supply chain security and reduce transportation costs. The refinery's technical capabilities allow processing of various cobalt intermediates, providing operational flexibility to optimise feedstock sourcing based on availability and pricing.

North American Source Testing Programmes

Ongoing feedstock qualification programmes evaluate North American cobalt sources for technical compatibility and economic viability. These testing initiatives assess material quality, processing characteristics, and output specifications to ensure consistent battery-grade product quality regardless of feedstock source.

Source diversification testing includes evaluation of recycled cobalt materials, regional mining outputs, and intermediate products from other North American processing facilities. This comprehensive approach builds operational flexibility whilst reducing supply chain risks associated with single-source dependencies.

Brownfield Expansion Advantages

The brownfield development approach provides substantial advantages over greenfield alternatives in terms of risk mitigation, capital efficiency, and timeline acceleration. Existing site infrastructure, equipment positioning, and regulatory frameworks create a foundation for rapid construction progress and reduced execution uncertainty.

COP30 must bring urgency and acceleration to the global energy transition","Collective action is bending the emissions curve downwards, but not nearly fast enough. As countries gather for COP30 in Belém, leaders must build on their recent statement to strengthen political confidence in the inevitability of the shift to clean energy, demonstrating real-world progress that goes beyond their NDCs and showing genuine commitment to accelerate the transitions to clean energy globally.

Global emissions are projected to fall 19 – 24% below 2019 levels by 2035 if all commitments in countries’ climate plans (NDCs) so far are fulfilled, including those conditional on finance and international support. This is insufficient for a global pathway to limit warming to 1.5 °C. NDCs must be the floor, not the ceiling, of ambition.

Energy accounts for more than three-quarters of total global emissions, making decarbonising the energy sector a critical part of the mitigation challenge. While year-on-year record-breaking renewables deployment is mirrored in countries’ climate plans, more is needed to triple renewable capacity, and a major step up is required to deliver on the full energy package agreed at COP28, including the Global Stocktake (GST) commitments to double energy efficiency and to transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables deployment accelerates as countries see the opportunities…

The benefits of clean energy deployment are increasingly reflected in countries’ climate plans. Approximately 90% of newly submitted NDCs mention plans to increase renewable energy capacity, and three-quarters reference an intent to increase the share of renewables in the power mix, displacing fossil fuels.

Despite this, many NDCs still fail to truly reflect both the momentous opportunities of clean energy and the real-world progress already made.

Renewable energy deployment figures were the highest on record in 2024 for the third consecutive year, and solar PV capacity additions are on track to reach, and even exceed, the required capacity by 2030 for a 1.5°C world.

Renewable energy costs continue to plummet. They are now comfortably cheaper than new fossil fuels in most markets, while the cost of battery storage has collapsed by nearly 90% since 2015, making dispatchable renewable power a reality.

The deployment of non-hydro renewable capacity has enhanced energy security in fossil fuel-importing countries. Renewables installed since 2010 saved an estimated US$1.3 trillion in cumulative global imports of coal and natural gas through 2023. Without additions, imports of coal and natural gas would have been 45% higher in 2023.

The challenge, however, is pace. The world is not moving at the speed required to meet the goal to triple renewables capacity by 2030, with global projections putting the world at 2.7x rather than 3x. Most of this deployment is concentrated in advanced economies and China, with clean energy investments going to EMDEs a mere 15% of the global total. On energy efficiency, the latest data shows we are a long way off from the goal – improvement in energy intensity is currently around 1% per year, when 4% in needed.

…But the transition away from fossil fuels requires urgent attention

The shift away from the dirtiest fossil fuel continued this year as global power generation from renewables outstripped coal for the first time. Latin America and the Caribbean are now free of actively planned coal-fired power plants and No New Coal is a norm in 164 countries. In 2025, stalled and cancelled coal proposals led to a record low in the number of countries proposing or building new coal plants.

Three-quarters of countries that have submitted new NDCs plan to displace fossil fuels in their electricity system with clean energy, showing clear movement on the transition. However, very few have explicitly set out plans for transitioning away from fossil fuels beyond the power sector, in the whole energy system and economy.

A few first movers – Barbados, Chile, Colombia, Iceland and Vanuatu – have strong plans and state intentions to be fossil fuel free.

No country has provided a timeline for reducing oil and gas production, though Canada, Colombia and the UK have referenced plans to start winding down. Eight countries have used their climate plans to commit to boosting gas production.

These plans are all in stark contrast to the global agreement to transition away from fossil fuels, and to the clear economic benefits of the transition. A poll among business executives in 15 major economies, including the US, found that 97% support the switch.

As a result, local water utilities have spent millions of dollars to prevent saltwater from flowing out of Hilton Head taps.
The City of Savannah has also started using river water for its drinking water supply instead of relying solely on the Floridan aquifer.
The state of South Carolina instituted limits on how much water Hilton Head could withdraw from the Floridan aquifer in 1997.
Hilton Head public service districts estimate the total cost to address the issue has exceeded $129 million.","On an island in many ways defined by the water, the quest to get it fresh and flowing from Hilton Head’s taps is one with a fraught history.

The closure of International Paper in Savannah led to the overused Floridan aquifer, historically Hilton Head’s main water source, rising about two feet at a Hutchinson Island monitoring well, according to reporting from The Current.

Overpumping of the aquifer in and around Savannah has contributed to a decades-long issue with saltwater intrusion on Hilton Head, as saltwater has slowly crept into the island’s wells. The paper mill was one of the biggest users of water from the Floridan aquifer in the region. As a result, local water utilities have spent millions of dollars to prevent saltwater from flowing out of Hilton Head taps.

International Paper announced earlier this year that it would close its containerboard plants in Savannah and Riceboro. By mid-October, the water level recorded in a monitoring well on Hutchinson Island had risen compared to the readings in late September, when the mill shut down.

The slow, steady march of salt

Saltwater intrusion occurs when too much water is pulled out of an aquifer faster than it is replaced. Aquifers are typically replenished by rainfall, but if withdrawals occur faster than the aquifer can be replenished a “cone of depression” forms where the water table is lowered in an area due to overuse.

Before the region was developed, fresh groundwater flowed underground towards the ocean.

A natural breach in the aquifer sat under the Port Royal Sound, discharging enough water from the aquifer that Spanish ship captains would use freshwater springs in the sound to stock up on drinking water while anchored, Jim Reichard, a geology professor at Georgia Southern University, said. The flow is now reversed in the area, with saltwater from the sound entering the freshwater aquifer.

But as more water was pumped out of the upper Floridan aquifer in Savannah and later Hilton Head, it changed the direction in which the water moved through the aquifer. This alteration in its natural flow has resulted in saltwater leaching into the freshwater aquifers that the island used for drinking water. While some upper Floridan wells on the island are still in use, many have been lost to saltwater intrusion.

“So it’s mostly caused by the huge withdrawals in Savannah,” Riechard said. “Hilton Head obviously contributed to that, but the bulk of the problem is caused by the large industrial municipal withdrawals in Savannah.”

Limits on aquifer use lead to improvements

Riechard said the aquifer level at that well has been steadily improving for some time now due to Georgia’s limits on groundwater withdrawals. The City of Savannah has also started using river water for its drinking water supply instead of relying solely on the Floridan aquifer.

While Hilton Head’s own water usage has contributed to its issues with saltwater intrusion, much of the problem stems from the heavy industrial water use in Savannah, Riechard said.

International Paper had one of the largest water withdrawal permits in the area, according to an analysis from The Current.

Salt water reached Hilton Head’s wells about 100 years before it was expected to impact Savannah, which led to tensions between the two states, according to previous reporting from The Island Packet.

In 2012, South Carolina was prepared to bring the issue to federal court, though the lawsuit never materialized. Dean Moss, former general manager for the Beaufort-Jasper Water and Sewer Authority and member of the S.C. Governor’s Savannah River Committee, said that Savannah and Beaufort County’s ongoing transition to Savannah River water has helped the issue. Even so, the 120-year-old saltwater intrusion problem has never been completely fixed.

The state of South Carolina instituted limits on how much water Hilton Head could withdraw from the Floridan aquifer in 1997. Over the past 25 years, water utilities across Beaufort and Jasper counties have made extensive changes to their water supply, coming to rely more on water from the Savannah River, or digging wells to deeper aquifers.

Hilton Head public service districts estimate the total cost to address the issue has exceeded $129 million. As more wells are pulled offline, they anticipate spending another $80 million.",https://www.islandpacket.com/public/latest-news/icdx78/picture312607284/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/InternationalPaperMillBoxPlantDM.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 07:23:41.653914

According to Renub Research, the United States Electric Vehicle Market is projected to reach US$ 537.53 billion by 2033, growing from US$ 200.76 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 11.56% between 2025 and 2033.

The EV revolution in the U.S. is being powered by a surge in environmental awareness, cutting-edge battery technology, and supportive government policies. As concerns about climate change intensify, Americans are rapidly shifting toward greener mobility alternatives. Incentives like federal tax credits, expanding public charging networks, and lower operating costs are making electric vehicles (EVs) more appealing than ever.

United States Electric Vehicle Industry Overview

The U.S. electric vehicle industry is witnessing dynamic transformation as automakers introduce diverse models across price ranges and categories. From compact cars to mid-size SUVs, brands like Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Tesla are leading the charge with innovative, affordable options that appeal to both luxury and budget-conscious consumers.

For instance, Hyundai launched its updated 2025 IONIQ 5 lineup in September 2024, including the IONIQ 5 XRT edition tailored for off-road enthusiasts. These models boast improved range, enhanced safety systems, and next-gen connectivity—reflecting the ongoing race among automakers to capture a fast-evolving market.

However, challenges remain. One of the most pressing is the uneven distribution of charging infrastructure, especially in rural and suburban regions. While urban areas have seen rapid charger deployment, large parts of the U.S. heartland remain underserved.

According to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), cities with higher charger density show the greatest EV adoption. The ten largest U.S. metro areas have 935 public chargers per million residents, but areas where half of the population lives host only 20% of total charging stations. This disparity underscores the urgent need for expanded public charging infrastructure to sustain growth.

Growth Drivers of the U.S. Electric Vehicle Market

1. Government Incentives and Subsidies Powering Growth

Federal and state-level incentives are the backbone of U.S. EV adoption. Many states offer benefits such as tax credits, rebates, free parking, reduced tolls, and discounted registration fees.

California offers rebates on plug-in hybrids and zero-emission vehicles, with extra incentives for low-income households.

Louisiana and Maryland provide tax credits of up to US$ 2,500–3,000 per vehicle.

Washington and New Jersey exempt EVs from sales and use taxes entirely.

These initiatives not only make EVs financially attractive but also accelerate the transition toward sustainable transportation.

2. Stringent Emission Norms and the Push Toward Zero-Emission Vehicles

The U.S. government’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a major catalyst for EV adoption. Several states are implementing Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates requiring automakers to sell a certain percentage of emission-free vehicles.

By 2020, two-thirds of national EV sales came from states with ZEV programs. This has prompted automakers to significantly ramp up their R&D investments.

A notable example is General Motors’ 2035 pledge to phase out gasoline-powered passenger vehicles entirely—a transformative move that signals the American automotive industry's electric future.

3. Battery Advancements and Extended Driving Range

Battery technology innovation remains the cornerstone of EV evolution. Breakthroughs in lithium-ion batteries and battery management systems (BMS) are boosting energy density, reducing costs, and extending range.

These advances have alleviated “range anxiety,” a long-standing barrier to EV adoption. Vehicles offering over 300 miles per charge are becoming increasingly common, making them suitable for both urban commuting and long-distance travel.

Moreover, ongoing research in solid-state batteries promises even faster charging, higher safety, and lower production costs—potentially revolutionizing the next generation of electric vehicles.

Key Challenges in the United States Electric Vehicle Market

1. Competition from Legacy Automakers

While EV startups like Rivian, Lucid Motors, and Fisker have drawn attention, established automakers are reclaiming dominance. General Motors, Ford, Toyota, and BMW are leveraging their existing production infrastructure and brand equity to scale EV output rapidly.

This intensified competition has a dual impact—stimulating innovation while putting pressure on new entrants to differentiate themselves through unique value propositions in performance, design, and technology.

2. Limited Model Variety in Specific Segments

Despite a surge in EV options, gaps remain in certain categories—particularly electric trucks and affordable compact cars. Many consumers, especially in rural states where trucks are essential for work, find limited choices in the EV segment.

This shortage hinders adoption among middle-income and utility-focused buyers. Expanding product portfolios to include more accessible, practical EV models will be essential for holistic market growth.

Segment Insights: Key Market Breakdowns

The Sierra Club, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Appalachian Voices and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy aren’t behaving as if they are opposed to carbon emissions.","Last Friday, the Sierra Club issued a news release opposing construction of the Southeast Supply Enhancement natural gas pipeline through Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama. Additional opponents of the project have included the Southern Environmental Law Center, Appalachian Voices and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

According to Williams, the energy firm hoping to build the pipeline, it will carry fuel “equivalent to what is needed to serve approximately 9.8 million homes.” Even a news release from the Southern Environmental Law Center concedes this will be enough to service up to six new gas-fired power plants.

According to Scientific American, when natural gas is used to fire a power plant it “emits about half of the carbon dioxide emissions as conventional coal plants.” This claim is supported by data from the Department of Energy. So, the Sierra Club and its allies should be celebrating this pipeline as a carbon cutting miracle rather than opposing it. Their decision not to do so exposes them as anti-energy groups masquerading as environmentalists.

When that Scientific American report was produced in 2010, the American electricity sector was a few years into a major shift to using natural gas rather than coal. In 2007, the historic peak for American CO2 emissions, coal-fired power plants produced 48.7 percent of American electricity, and natural gas just 21.6 percent. By 2023, the mix had flipped to 42.4 percent gas and 15.9 percent coal.

As reported earlier by the Capital Research Center, this tradeoff resulted in a 510 million metric ton annual increase in CO2 emissions from burning natural gas, but a decline of 1.4 billion metric tons from the reduced coal use. The difference—a net decline of 893 million metric tons of annual CO2 –exceeded the total combined annual CO2 emissions of France and Germany. (Note: that’s their total economies, not just their electricity generation.)

In simple terms this means that Americans switching from coal to natural gas in just our electricity generation has cancelled out the combined total carbon footprint of two of the world’s seven largest economies.

By making it possible to add more gas-fired electricity rather than coal power plants, the Southeast Supply Enhancement project will help continue this progress. This should be celebrated by the Sierra Club and the rest as a victory for the climate. Instead, they’re opposed.

Why?

Another revealing fact about the aforementioned opponents of natural gas is that they each also oppose nuclear power, which produces functionally zero CO2 emissions. Nuclear is by far the cleanest electricity option we have. And if we exclude weather dependent and grid destabilizing power sources, such as wind and solar, nuclear is overwhelmingly the cleanest reliable power option humanity has ever created.

The Sierra Club boasts of being “unequivocally opposed to nuclear energy.” Just within the last six years the Southern Environmental Law Center has opposed the use of nuclear power in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. And Appalachian Voices is so twisted around on the issue that in 2022 they even opposed hooking up a small modular nuclear reactor on the site of an abandoned Virginia coal mine.

The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy falsely denounced nuclear power as a “high-risk” energy source on a web page that is now conspicuously missing. (The page was still available in 2024.) Nonetheless, the NGO’s news releases covering 2025 still demonstrate sustained hostility to the electricity source that Our World in Data has judged so safe and clean that it kills 25 percent fewer people per kilowatt-hour than even wind turbines, and emits 88 percent less CO2 than solar panels.

In a final hint of hypocrisy, some of these NGOs were once friendly to natural gas. According to the InfluenceWatch profile of the Sierra Club:

From 2007 through 2010, the Sierra Club took over $25 million from the natural gas industry. Most of the donations came from Aubrey McClendon, the CEO of Chesapeake Energy, which is involved in fracking. The money was used to help promote the “Beyond Coal” campaign.

As noted above, this was during the period before natural gas became our major carbon cutting replacement for coal.

Anti-gas and anti-nuclear. The Sierra Club, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Appalachian Voices and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy aren’t behaving as if they are opposed to carbon emissions. What they’re really opposed to is every reliable power source that we have.

Exit polls following Tuesday’s contests showed voters in Virginia and New Jersey were motivated primarily by opposition to President Donald Trump and disappointment in the economy when they handed Democrats sweeping electoral wins.

Democrats have already been hitting electric utility costs as a top messaging point ahead of midterms. They’re seeking to blame Trump and Republicans for price increases across the country, pointing to factors like Trump’s cancellation of wind and solar projects and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s termination of clean energy tax credits.

Now, the wins for Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and others are giving Democrats hope — although Republicans have sought to downplay their importance. Voters identified the cost of living as a top concern and electricity as one of the main drivers.

Down-ballot races similarly heavily favored Democrats, as did a pair of statewide races for Georgia’s Public Service Commission.

“Yesterday, from coast to coast, voters sent a resounding message that they reject the Republican agenda. They are raising costs on everything from health care to housing to utilities,” Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told reporters Wednesday.

“Trump and House Republicans promised on Day 1 to lower costs and they’ve broken that promise over and over and over again. It’s going to cost them the House majority,” she continued.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called the election a rejection of the Trump agenda and promised that Democrats “will continue to lead on the issue of affordability.”

Democrats in the Senate are similarly bullish.

“It should serve as nothing short of a five-alarm fire to the Republicans. Their high-cost house is burning. And they’ve only got themselves to blame,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

“The election showed that Democrats’ control of the U.S. Senate is much closer than the people and the prognosticators realize,” he continued. “The more Republicans double down on raising costs and bowing down to Trump, the more the Senate majority is at risk.”

“People don’t like bans on solar energy, which is right now the cheapest and quickest way to get electricity onto the grid,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, a leading Democratic voice on climate change and clean energy, said of the outcomes.

“In New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia, they all ran on a cheap, clean energy message, and it worked,” he continued.

Both Spanberger and Sherrill made electricity prices a major focus of their campaigns, as both states saw double-digital percentage growth in costs. Spanberger promised to protect residents from shouldering costs associated with the booming data center industry, while Sherrill said she’d freeze rate hikes.

Their Republican opponents tried to push back with their own solutions. In Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears blamed wind and solar and promised to get the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, while New Jersey’s Jack Ciattarelli said he’d reopen shut-down nuclear power plants.

Dan Kanninen, a Democratic strategist and founder of Arc Initiatives, said this week’s races demonstrate that Democrats can win on affordability and show the beginnings of a road map to doing so in the midterm elections.

“The key for Democrats will be to continue to focus on affordability and not take the gains last night for granted. And as Republicans inevitably try to change their talking points, Dems need to remind voters what Republicans actually did when they took power,” he said via email.

“They crawled over broken glass to deliver tax cuts to billionaires, then promptly abandoned — or even callously punished — everyone else out of pure retribution politics,” Kanninen added.

Luke Bassett, director of energy security at the Searchlight Institute, said a key takeaway from the races is that each successful candidate used issues tailored to their constituencies, not just a single national message.

Bassett’s group has been encouraging Democrats to talk less about climate change and instead espouse other policies that could help the climate, like adding solar and wind generation to the grid.

“It’s less about one particular message and more about the skill the candidates are showing in being responsive to their voters. And that translates, hopefully, to the same skill set that other candidates in other districts or states or cities, etc., can use,” he said.

Republicans are far from throwing in the towel on energy prices. It was a topic of discussion Wednesday morning when Trump brought Senate Republicans to the White House for breakfast, said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.).

“President Trump and the work that we’re doing is bringing those prices down from the inflation created by the Biden administration. But we need to make sure people know that,” Hoeven said in an interview.

The lesson from this week’s elections is that “we need to talk about it more and get the word out,” he added.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) all but dismissed the impact of the elections, with the exception of Zohran Mamdani’s win in the New York City mayoral race.

House Republicans doubled down on their efforts to connect Democrats with Mamdani and his support for democratic socialism, saying House Democrats across the board “have embraced him with open arms.”

“Off-year elections are not indicative of what’s to come. That’s what history teaches us,” Johnson told reporters.

“When we go into next year and the midterms, we’re very bullish about the outcome. We have an extraordinary record to run on,” he added, asserting that: “We’ve got American energy dominance revved and going again.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/4a/2c/cb4827c949919f88f0edf473a07f/election-2025-55203.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 07:57:56.871832

On Day 1 of the government shutdown, the Department of Energy canceled billions of dollars for Biden-era climate and energy projects. They say that the projects are wasteful. But as Colorado Public Radio's Ishan Thakore reports, recipients say the cuts are shortsighted.

HANK PRICE: Go ahead and walk out here.

ISHAN THAKORE, BYLINE: Yeah.

PRICE: It's more interesting once we get out...

THAKORE: In a grassy field near the Denver Airport, Hank Price is showing off a massive, roughly three-story collection of curved mirrors. It's called the SunBeam, and it's a demo for a technology called concentrating solar power.

PRICE: This is a low-cost way of making solar power at night.

THAKORE: Price says the SunBeam is different from your average solar farm. It uses the sun to generate heat, which can be stored to make electricity later, even after dark.

PRICE: You can design power plants that collect energy during the day and produce power just at night or produce power 24 hours a day.

THAKORE: Price's company, Solar Dynamics, has had contracts with the federal government for years, including during the first Trump administration. But in early October, the Department of Energy canceled two of his biggest grants. That's a huge hit for his business.

PRICE: I think it's very likely we'll shut down, unfortunately. Unless something changes...

THAKORE: ...Price and his 10 employees are probably out of a job. Their projects are among the 223 across the country that the DOE says it's canceled. Those included everything from building major new transmission lines to research on newer technologies like carbon capture. Most were approved during the Biden administration. Many were funded by major climate legislation or the bipartisan infrastructure law. The DOE did not respond to questions for this story, but in a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the projects do not, quote, ""adequately advance America's energy needs."" Here's Wright on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: These decisions are made - business decisions - on whether it's a good use of the taxpayer money or not.

THAKORE: Hank Price disagrees.

PRICE: We see this as providing a reliable, affordable, dispatchable domestic energy source. How's that not supporting America's energy needs?

THAKORE: Ken Gillingham is an economics professor at the Yale School of the Environment. He said government grants like these support innovations that may later become widely successful.

KEN GILLINGHAM: The whole point is to find technologies that are not commercially viable now and give them the support they need to become commercially viable.

THAKORE: Not all of the projects would have worked out, Gillingham says, but U.S. government funding has led to huge breakthroughs, like the first nuclear reactor. Some canceled grant recipients say their projects are well aligned with the Trump administration's goals, like supporting fossil fuel production. Dan Zimmerle runs a center at Colorado State University. It helps oil and gas companies cut their pollution.

DAN ZIMMERLE: We work every day with oil and gas operators, and they're getting value from that.

THAKORE: His team helps companies find natural gas leaks, which helps the environment and their bottom line. But he was informed his center's main funding was cut, apparently because of a change in priorities. That's a first, he says.

ZIMMERLE: It's now 14 years of working with the Department of Energy on projects, through multiple administration changes.

THAKORE: Recipients like Zimmerle and Price are now scrambling to make up the funding. They have a short window to appeal their cancellations. Back outside Denver, Price and his co-founder say giving up on projects like theirs - it means countries like China will fill the void.

PRICE: America really has been a world leader in technology, and now we just give up. We're throwing it all away, you know? That's unfortunate.

THAKORE: Building the company, though? They said it's been a heck of a ride. For NPR News, I'm Ishan Thakore in Watkins, Colorado.

What's the item?

Electricity

How has the price changed since before the pandemic?

Electricity prices have jumped 40% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a bigger jump than the 26% increase in the overall cost of living.

Why have prices gone up?

Demand for electricity has increased in recent years, partly because of all of the new data centers that are popping up to serve the artificial intelligence boom. Some old power plants have been retired, and utilities are scrambling to add new electric generation, while also making the power grid more resilient. Also, the price of natural gas used to generate electricity has increased.

Now that fall is here, Kathy Letourneau no longer has to run her air conditioner around the clock. But the Fort Walton Beach, Fla., resident also relies on electric heat to stay warm in the winter. Letourneau, who is 71, says her power bills run between $200 and $300 a month, all year round.

""When you're living on a fixed income, you feel it,"" she says. ""There have been a few times we couldn't afford it. We've had our lights turned off before.""

Residential electric rates in Florida have jumped more than 13% over the last year, according to the Energy Department. Letourneau and her husband are bracing for another increase next year.

""Florida is a lot of retired people on Social Security,"" Letourneau says. ""I mean, it's hard.""

Across the country, residential electric rates are climbing twice as fast as the overall rate of inflation. The high price of power became a flash point in this week's elections in both New Jersey and Virginia.

The rising costs are partly driven by the price of natural gas, used to generate electricity. Natural gas prices fluctuate with the weather and with the level of gas exports, which have been climbing.

Electricity demand has also soared

Electric bills are also going up because of increased power demand.

For the first two decades of this century, demand for electricity barely budged. But in the last few years, people and businesses have been plugging in more and more. The Energy Department expects demand to grow 2.2% this year and 2.4% next year.

""There's automobiles that have gone from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles,"" says Drew Maloney, president of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents power companies around the country. ""You're also seeing stoves being replaced from gas to electric. And the AI data center growth.""

Utilities are hustling to meet that demand by replacing old power plants that have gone out of service while adding new generating capacity from wind, solar, and natural gas.

""We support developing all energy sources,"" Maloney says. ""We need as many electrons on the grid as possible to help keep the grid reliable and costs low.""

Who pays for the electricity needed for AI?

Utilities say building new power supplies along with a more resilient electric grid will cost more than a trillion dollars over the next five years. The question facing regulators is, who's going to pay for that.

In theory, the new data centers springing up to support the artificial intelligence boom should cover their own power costs and at least a bit more, potentially lowering bills for nearby residential customers.

""That doesn't seem that hard to do,"" says Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at U.C. Berkeley's Haas School of Business. ""But you'd be surprised how many politicians and regulators say, 'Well, this is an economic development opportunity. We should give them a great rate.' And in their enthusiasm, they'll end up charging rates that don't even cover the incremental cost.""

If data centers are given a break on prices, residential customers could end up saddled with some of their costs. Across the country, residential customers typically pay higher rates than commercial or industrial power users, according to the Energy Department.

There are ways to reduce the nation's overall power bill, by adjusting when and where electricity is consumed. By far, the most expensive time to use power is when demand is at its peak — typically on the hottest days of summer when air conditioners are working hardest.

""If you could get these data centers to get off the grid, say 50-60 hours a year, they really wouldn't create any cost pressure at all,"" Borenstein says.

Data centers could do that by temporarily switching to backup power, or re-routing their data traffic to cooler parts of the country. Borenstein suggests regulators could require that. Electric vehicle owners also have considerable flexibility in deciding when to plug in and charge.

While demand for electricity is growing faster now than it was a few years ago, that increase is hardly unprecedented. Borenstein says electric demand grew more than twice as fast in the 1960s. That's when air conditioning was going mainstream, making it comfortable for retirees like Letourneau to live in places like Florida.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5333x3000+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2F9b%2F3517d5ed49fea5d530213006377b%2Fcost-of-living-electricity.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 07:57:59.782445

Rejected MIECO’s argument that Pioneer’s failure to purchase replacement gas was merely an economic hardship rather than a force majeure event.7 The court held that the contract’s plain language and industry practices supported Pioneer’s position.
Courts interpret force majeure using an impracticability standard rather than requiring impossibility.
Industry customs and the parties’ course of dealing are relevant to interpreting force majeure obligations, but the contract’s language is paramount.
If buyers want sellers to procure replacement gas during force majeure events, they must include explicit language.","In MIECO LLC v. Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.,1 Pioneer and MIECO were parties to an NAESB contract for Pioneer to supply MIECO 20,000 MMBtu of natural gas daily on a firm basis. MIECO claimed breach of contract when Pioneer failed to deliver the agreed amount of natural gas from February 14 to February 19, 2021, during Winter Storm Uri, arguing that the storm was not a force majeure event since Pioneer could have purchased replacement gas from the spot market.

The Texas Northern District Court, in denying MIECO’s motion for summary judgment, held that force majeure provisions in the contract were unambiguous and that Pioneer’s non-delivery from February 14 to February 19, 2021, caused by low temperatures that affected an entire geographic region and caused freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe, constituted force majeure under the contract.

On appeal, the Fifth Circuit in MIECO, L.L.C., v. Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.2 held that the district court correctly interpreted force majeure in that it did not require Pioneer to show that the storm rendered its performance under the contract literally impossible. However, the appellate court remanded the case for fact-finding on whether (1) Winter Storm Uri prevented Pioneer’s performance and (2) Pioneer exercised due diligence. The district court’s recent opinion on remand closes the loop.

On October 15, 2025, Judge Jane J. Boyle issued a memorandum opinion3 in favor of Pioneer, holding that the producer did not breach its firm gas delivery contract with MIECO during Winter Storm Uri. The court, in its opinion:

Reaffirmed that Winter Storm Uri qualified as a force majeure event under the contract because it was a weather-related occurrence affecting an entire geographic region, which caused well and pipeline failures.4 The court found that Pioneer’s performance was “prevented” within the meaning of the contract because the storm rendered full performance impracticable, and that a finding of impossibility was not necessary.

Found that Pioneer exercised due diligence by winterizing equipment, reallocating firm volumes, and working to restore production as soon as conditions allowed.5 The court also credited expert testimony that, under industry customs and practice, a producer who has lost its gas supply due to force majeure is not expected to purchase replacement gas on the spot market.6 This custom exists to avoid further driving up spot market prices to allow producers to focus on restoring supply, which benefits the market as a whole.

Rejected MIECO’s argument that Pioneer’s failure to purchase replacement gas was merely an economic hardship rather than a force majeure event.7 The court held that the contract’s plain language and industry practices supported Pioneer’s position. The court also found that MIECO had, in other contracts, negotiated for special language requiring sellers to procure replacement gas, but had not done so in contracts with Pioneer.8

The MIECO decision adds to a growing line of cases interpreting force majeure provisions under the NAESB. Together with opinions such as LNG Americas v. Chevron Natural Gas9 and Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Corp. v. BP Energy,10 the ruling underscores several consistent themes:

Severe regional weather events can qualify as a force majeure event under the NAESB.

Courts interpret force majeure using an impracticability standard rather than requiring impossibility.

A producer invoking force majeure is not required to procure replacement gas or draw from storage at the delivery point when disruption arises from loss of its upstream supply if not specifically required by the contract.

Industry customs and the parties’ course of dealing are relevant to interpreting force majeure obligations, but the contract’s language is paramount.

Precise contract drafting is vital. If buyers want sellers to procure replacement gas during force majeure events, they must include explicit language.

Though she majored in sociology, that interest never went away. So, in August, she took her first Detroit Documenters training. Since then, she’s documented two public meetings — Detroit City Council and Detroit Housing Commission (DHC).

Aqsa, 25, splits her time between Washington, D.C., and Detroit, working for an advocacy nonprofit as a community organizer.

She’s not new to city council meetings in general but has been impressed by the amount of public participation at Detroit City Council meetings.

“I don’t think everyone is aware of how important that is, showing up locally,” Aqsa said. She loves to see residents get involved and wants to do more of that herself.

The DHC meeting she documented was tougher because there was a lot of technical language, she said, adding that doing more research beforehand would’ve helped her decipher parts of the discussion. The highlight of that meeting for her was still public comments.

Aqsa graduated from American University with a desire to better understand how theories she studied show up in the real world. She wants to continue observing differences between spaces for organizing and public engagement in metro Washington, D.C., versus the Midwest. Detroit, she said, has “more of an ability to engage local residents.”

(NASDAQ: GEVO) announced the contracted sales of its remaining Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits for 2025 from its Gevo North Dakota facility (“GevoND”), totaling $30 million, to Stifel Financial Corp. and Capital Community Bank, bringing the total sales for 2025 to $52 million, when combined with the previously announced $22 million worth of credits sold in July. These production tax credits were generated based on volumes of ethanol produced at GevoND and taking into account operating carbon sequestration and operating efficiencies. Gevo believes it is one of the first ethanol producer to sell Section 45Z credits directly to tax credit purchasers.

Section 45Z, also known as the Clean Fuel Production Credit, is a federal incentive designed to support domestic biofuel production and agriculture. Initially enacted in 2022, the credit was extended through 2029 under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“The amount of production tax credits we generate is determined by the volume of ethanol produced that satisfies the Section 45Z requirements,” said Dr. Paul D. Bloom, chief business officer at Gevo. “The cash from these sales enables reinvestment in our ethanol and carbon businesses to improve throughput, expand margins, and increase production of fuel and feed co-products, and to develop voluntary carbon markets—all while supporting U.S. corn growers.”

“Our Section 45Z tax credit sale continues to be backed by a tax insurance policy that mitigates much of the residual risk for buyers in credit transfers, which we view as low risk to begin with,” said Leke Agiri, chief financial officer of Gevo. “We’d like to thank our buyers and transaction participants in working with us to achieve this milestone. We expect this to greatly enhance our cash flow from operations, and we expect it will be reoccuring. We are really proud of these deals.”

Would you pick the new F-150 Lightning STX over a Tesla Cybertruck, or do you think the Cybertruck still has the edge?","Ford saw that it had a winner with its F-150 Lightning and increased its investment by introducing the 2026 F-150 Lightning STX. This new version of its electric pickup truck replaces the outgoing XLT trim. The STX offers a combination of better performance, longer range, and added features without any increase in price, making it an appealing choice for buyers looking for value in a full-size electric truck from a proven brand.

This value and familiarity are driving many consumers to choose the Ford F-150 Lightning over the Tesla Cybertruck, which for many can seem too unusual or experimental. The Lightning looks and drives like a traditional truck while offering modern electric power and advanced features like vehicle-to-home (V2H) backup energy. The Lightning is easier to service through Ford’s wide dealer network.

The Lightning’s success hasn’t been overlooked on social media where recent owners are heaping praise. On Reddit, LordOfBadaBing posted “One Month with the 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning ER”:

“I bought an extended range 131 kWh battery rated for 320 miles at full charge. We’re getting 2.4 mi/kWh which is right up to spec, and pay $0.29 per kWh peak and $0.19 per kWh off peak incentive through energy provider.

What do I like? Everything! Simply put this is the best vehicle I’ve ever driven. Most comfortable. Most fun. Most advanced. Surprisingly among the easiest to drive (on par with our standard ICE SUV and way easier than a Suburban we recently rented). Any concern I had about driving an EV before the Lightning are long gone.

Range for an EV, let alone a 7,000-pound vehicle, is incredible.

Kids have their iPad/Switch/laptop plugged in and running in the back — keeps everyone quiet (although they do fight over the heated seats because the middle of the bench isn’t heated). We watched some YouTube on the huge center display while parked. I used the workstation feature to take a work call while the electrician had to cut power to the house installing the L2.

Showed off the frunk cooler for a mini tailgate party (though without a plug, once the ice melted it wasn’t much of a cooler anymore. It lasted about five hours on an 80-degree day after a 60 min drive). Added a tonneau tri-fold cover and bed mat.”

On another long Reddit thread, the F-150 Lightning compliments keep rolling with Ftbldude322 commenting:

“Mine has been flawless too. A 23 XLT with all the options. Over 21k miles now and it’s the most well built vehicle I’ve ever had. Zero flaws that I’ve found. No squeaks or rattles. Love it so much.”

jayk82 responded with a comment about media bias:

“I've read a lot of the horror stories here, but I've had mine for 11 months and 23k miles and it's been flawless. I can't imagine having a different vehicle.”

Performance and Range Improvements

The F-150 Lightning STX comes standard with a 123-kWh battery, matching the Tesla Cybertruck in capacity. The new pack delivers an EPA-estimated range of 290 miles, about 50 miles more than the XLT’s smaller 98-kWh pack. Dual electric motors now produce 536 horsepower and 775 lb-ft of torque, offering a noticeable performance boost while maintaining all-wheel drive and an e-locking differential for added traction.

Design and Features

On the outside, the STX distinguishes itself with a black grille accented in Grabber Blue, STX decals, unique emblems, and rugged black wheels with all-terrain tires. It also borrows off-road running boards from the gas-powered Tremor model. Inside, Ford opted for cloth upholstery with embroidered Lightning STX logos, a heated steering wheel, and an optional easy-clean vinyl floor. New paint colors include Argon Blue, Marsh Gray, and Ruby Red Metallic.

Value Pricing

Despite all these upgrades, Ford has kept the MSRP at $63,000 which is identical to the previous XLT trim. That pricing positions the Lightning STX as one of the strongest value propositions in Ford’s EV lineup, making the switch from gas to electric even more appealing.

Future Ford EV Strategy

Ford is also working on a new universal electric vehicle platform aimed at affordability and efficiency. The company claims future models will be up to 40% faster to build, helping reduce costs. By 2027, Ford expects to launch a midsize electric pickup that will be similar in size to the Ranger, and starting around $30,000. This signals Ford’s commitment to making electric trucks accessible to a wider audience while pushing manufacturing innovation.

Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid Capability

The Sigenergy bidirectional charger, when paired with a Ford F-150 Lightning, enables both vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functionality. This setup allows the F-150 Lightning’s large battery, which can be as big as 131 kWh, to send power back to the grid. It can help stabilize the grid, allow owners to earn money by selling electricity, or provide backup power for a home or even a small factory.

Sigenergy’s offering for the F-150 Lightning is a bidirectional charging system called SigenStor that allows the vehicle to both charge and supply power for vehicle-to-home (V2H) or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications. This system is a smart charger that can automatically charge the truck during off-peak hours. It’s an all-in-one home energy management system which integrates a solar inverter, EV DC charger, battery power conversion system (PCS), battery pack, and energy management system (EMS). Its modular design allows for scalability, with stackable battery modules and the ability to mix old and new batteries. The system is designed to lower utility bills and increase energy independence through smart, AI-powered management and features vehicle-to-home/grid (V2X) capabilities for EV charging.

The setup also has strong potential for remote or off-grid work. Instead of relying on portable diesel generators or standalone battery packs, construction crews can use the F-150 Lightning to power a job site for the day. Afterward, they simply recharge the truck overnight and are ready to go again the next morning.

Bottom Line

The F-150 Lightning STX represents a smart evolution in Ford’s EV strategy, offering more range and power for the same price while hinting at a broader push toward affordability and efficiency in future models. With tax credits still available and a strong value equation, the STX could easily become Ford’s most compelling electric truck yet.

Together with the SIG Energy charger, the Ford F-150 Lightning demonstrates how electric vehicles can go far beyond transportation. They offer resilience for homes, flexibility for businesses, and mobility for worksites, making a powerful case for how EVs can function as both vehicles and energy tools.

What Do You Think?

Would you pick the new F-150 Lightning STX over a Tesla Cybertruck, or do you think the Cybertruck still has the edge?

Does Ford’s decision to add range and power without raising the price make the Lightning STX the best value electric truck right now?

In May, EPA officials announced at a staff meeting that Energy Star would be “eliminated.” The backlash was swift.
When industry argued that the Energy Star label helps them sell appliances, Zelden appears to have listened.
“Energy star is an American success story,” said Symons.
High energy costs were also a theme of gubernatorial races inNew Jersey and Virginia.","It has been a big week in energy news, with several resounding wins for efficiency advocates.

On Tuesday, voters in Georgia flipped two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, which oversees utilities and sets rates. They installed a pair of Democrats on this little known, yet powerful, body for the first time in nearly two decades. Further north, Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey handily won after making rising energy prices a centerpiece of their campaigns. The victories came just a few days after The New York Times reported that the Environmental Protection Agency is quietly reconsidering plans to eliminate the popular Energy Star program.

Taken together, these developments suggest that energy costs could be moving the political needle in ways that other issues, like climate change, have not. And, with next year’s midterms on the horizon, it’s an issue both political parties will increasingly have to grapple with.

“When the costs of climate change become evident, there’s a political necessity to find policy that works,” said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who represented South Carolina and has become a leading conservative voice on climate change. “When people see them on their utility bills and they see them in their property tax bills, that’s when they start asking, is there any way to head this off?”

The Trump administration’s potential reversal on Energy Star is one example of the political power that energy prices can have. In May, EPA officials announced at a staff meeting that Energy Star would be “eliminated.” The backlash was swift. Within weeks, a coalition of industry groups wrote to congressional leaders in support of a program that saves Americans some $40 billion a year in utility bills. They called minimizing that financial burden “a clear priority across party lines.”

Republicans, Democrats, appliance manufacturers, and corporate giants like Home Depot lined up in defense of Energy Star and, according to the Times, the EPA is quietly backing off its plans to fully shutter the decades-long initiative, widely considered among the most successful government initiatives in modern history. Its signature blue label is now nearly as recognizable as the Nike swoosh or a Coca-Cola can.

The EPA says the future of Energy Star is still being finalized, and many of the people who work on the program have been laid off or left. But the potential walk-back is a notable change of course for a Presidential administration that has, by and large, moved to gut federal climate and environmental policies. “This is a classic Lee Zeldin leap before you look at the situation,” said Jeremy Symons, a senior advisor at the nonprofit Environmental Protection Network, about the EPA’s administrator. When industry argued that the Energy Star label helps them sell appliances, Zelden appears to have listened.

“Energy star is an American success story,” said Symons. “It’s really a no-brainer.”

Energy costs played a large role in several key political races as well, most notably in Georgia, where the campaign for public utility commission seats revolved around affordability. Republicans argued that fossil fuels offer the best route to stable and affordable power prices in the state. Democrats pointed to a string of rate increases — six in the past two years — to contend that alternatives, such as renewable energy and nuclear, are the way forward. “We need to invest in a smarter, more resilient grid that’s capable of handling the extreme weather that Georgia experiences while also expanding that access to clean energy,” then-candidate Alicia Johnson told Grist in June.

On Tuesday, Johnson and fellow democrat Peter Hubbard, who is a clean energy consultant, flipped two Republican seats by 25 point margins in a race that drew national attention and funding. The wins are the Democrats’ first statewide victories in a non-federal election since 2006.

High energy costs were also a theme of gubernatorial races inNew Jersey and Virginia. In the Garden State, Democrat Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs.” In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, also a Democrat, campaigned on a platform that included calls to expand clean energy generation and promote home weatherization to ease consumption. Despite President Trump trying to pin surging prices in those states on the Democrats, both Sherrill and Spanberger beat out Republican challengers.

In New Jersey, the local chapter of the League of Conservation Voters funded a campaign ad that attacked the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, for spiraling electricity rates. The video has 6.9 million views on YouTube and Sara Schreiber, the national organization’s senior vice president of campaigns, said internal polling showed the ad drove up Ciattarelli’s unfavorable rating among all voters by 6 percent, and a staggering 8 percent with Trump voters.

“People care about this issue, they hear what the candidates are saying, and they are siding with the candidates who are offering clean energy solutions to help lower their costs,” said Schreiber.

Dan Jasper, of the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, said it’s not surprising that framing climate as an affordability issue helps win elections. “When you say “climate,” I think that just seems too far in the future for people,” he said. “But when you put it in terms of everyday expenditures, people start to listen for sure.”

As attention turns to next year’s midterm races, election watchers say utility bills could again be a centerpiece of campaigns across the country. It’s a concern that President Donald J. Trump has already repeatedly brought up, including with promises to cut prices in half. But with energy demand on the rise for the first time in decades and prices rising twice as fast as inflation, Inglis said “I would think that Democrats should really make an issue out of that.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright acknowledged the risk in August, saying, “momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

Jesse Lee, a senior advisor with the climate-politics nonprofit Climate Power, says that the impact of rising costs is so widespread that it could become an issue almost anywhere. But he’s particularly watching states that have seen large rate increases in recent years, such as Texas, Arizona and Pennsylvania. Incumbent moderate Republicans without much a buffer could also be at risk, he said, pointing to Mike Lawler of New York as one example.

Building out the supply of clean energy in the U.S. is a clear antidote to rising demand, Lee said. While Democrats have generally embraced a path lined with renewable energy, many Republicans, including President Trump, have panned that approach.

“Anybody with eyes can see that this is a glaring vulnerability for [Republicans],” Lee said. “Democrats should be embracing it.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/election-energy-electricity-rates-prices-issue-climate.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-06 07:23:37.591140

One Reddit user clocked this trend in Seattle and sought local solutions on the r/Seattle subreddit.

""I've been a happy EV owner for a couple of years now. In just the past few months, I've observed cut cables (...),"" the original poster wrote.

The OP then listed eight charging station locations in the Seattle area that they had seen vandalised.

""It's creating a charging island where EV owners are forced to travel long distances just to use their vehicles … this is a problem,"" they said.

According to charging companies, per PBS, the quantity of copper in charging cables is low. Each cable, PBS said, is worth only $15 to $20 at a scrapyard.

Despite this, thieves are stealing charging cables, disrupting the lives of EV drivers, and hindering the electric movement.

Going electric, though, is a critical way for consumers to lower their carbon footprints. Polluting gases from gas-powered machines — be they cars, yard tools, or stoves — trap heat in the atmosphere.

It causes a whole slew of environmental issues, such as extreme weather events, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

Extreme weather events leave people and animals in disarray amid climate-driven wildfires, floods, and droughts.

Pollutants in the air also cause respiratory issues, including asthma attacks in children.

EVs, on the other hand, release no fumes, and the pollution from lithium battery mining does not compare to that from gas-operated appliances.

EVs also save consumers money. The cost to charge an electric vehicle is significantly lower than the cost to fuel a gas vehicle, and maintenance costs are also lower, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

A combination of an at-home charging station and solar panels can further reduce charging costs, bringing the price close to zero. EnergySage offers solar quotes to those interested.

Going electric is worth it, but something must be done about charging cable vandalism.

Commenters on the post have also noticed this trend.

What does this mean?

Japan’s Nippon Steel, the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker, is leaning into its US growth strategy with a hefty $11 billion commitment over the next few years. The expansion includes a new facility in Arkansas that will introduce Nippon's advanced electrical steel sheet technology to the US market—a first meant to tap into soaring demand from the power grid and electric vehicle sectors. At the same time, upgrades planned for sites in Indiana and Pennsylvania are set to boost efficiency and output. But the aggressive push comes as the firm scales back its earnings outlook, now expecting a net loss of 60 billion yen for the year ending March 2026—down from last year’s sizable profit—largely because results from the US Steel acquisition are still pending. Tariff disruptions remain a hurdle, but Nippon Steel is banking on a steel demand comeback by 2026, while also trimming domestic operations and expanding its Indian partnership with ArcelorMittal.

Nippon Steel’s major US commitment—even as short-term profit forecasts take a hit—shows faith in the long-term outlook for American manufacturing and infrastructure. The steel sector has been rocked by tariffs, but the company clearly sees opportunity in rising demand tied to power grid upgrades, electric vehicle expansion, and public infrastructure spending. Ultimately, how these bets unfold could ripple across wider industrial and materials markets.

The bigger picture: Global steel strategy under the microscope.

Nippon Steel’s moves in the US and India are part of a broader industry realignment as firms rethink supply chains and diversify beyond riskier home markets. Bringing leading-edge technology stateside underlines a new chapter in global industrial collaboration, at a time when governments worldwide want to boost local manufacturing. The message: international players are still keen to make bold, cross-border investments—even when the outlook is far from certain.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FG2572813_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=a3046722bfbd5d0a596363da14f868dd,N,,2025-11-06 07:23:54.234812

“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio.
Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.
While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.
The DOE’s ​“hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031.","Two years ago, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for a nationwide network of hydrogen hubs meant to kickstart production of the alternative fuel.

Now, the Trump administration has cast doubt over the future of the program — including the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2, which features projects in Ohio.

Despite the turbulence, industry leaders said they see a bright future for hydrogen in Ohio.

“We’re building businesses in this state regardless of that federal funding,” said Bill Whittenberger, executive director of the Ohio Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Coalition, at the group’s 2025 symposium, held Oct. 27 and 28 at the Honda Heritage Center in Marysville, Ohio. In his view, federal funding ​“makes things go a little faster, [but] there’s a strong business case for all the things we’re doing here.”

Many see hydrogen as necessary for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify operations, such as steel and glassmaking, as well as some transportation sectors.

Today, however, few industries use the fuel at a meaningful scale — and very little low-carbon hydrogen is available.

The Biden administration’s hub initiative meant to change that by bringing down the cost of low-carbon hydrogen, which can be produced with renewable energy, nuclear power, or natural gas with carbon capture and storage.

The initiative sparked detailed planning for dozens of projects throughout the hub regions. In Ohio, proposals took on different shapes: One developer wanted to use solar power to make hydrogen for buses in Stark County, while another planned to derive the fuel from a chemical plant’s waste stream. Still others looked to expand storage and refueling operations in central and northeastern Ohio.

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act also created a lucrative federal tax credit for clean-hydrogen projects, an incentive that successful lobbying preserved through the end of 2027 in Republicans’ massive budget bill signed into law in July. But even with this federal support in place, the nascent industry has been on shaky ground. Some high-profile green-hydrogen projects were already floundering before this year.

The Trump administratibon’s October cancellation of federal dollars for two of the hubs that focused on hydrogen from renewable energy raised urgent questions about the viability of many hydrogen ventures nationwide.

The fate of the other five hubs remains uncertain. Last month, their names appeared on a leaked Energy Department list alongside a note to ​“terminate,” but the DOE has not confirmed their status.

Still, conference attendees emphasized, some hydrogen projects are moving forward in Ohio.

There’s the plan from American Electric Power’s Ohio utility to power data centers with fuel cells, for example. It’s part of a broader AEP partnership with Bloom Energy to acquire up to 1 gigawatt of fuel cells to help the giant computing facilities get online faster.

“Speed to power trumps all other things,” said Amy Koscielak, a senior business development leader for AEP.

At the outset, though, the systems planned in central Ohio for Amazon Data Services and Cologix Johnstown will run on natural gas. Eventually, AEP has said, they could switch to run on hydrogen.

Earlier this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio green-lit plans for AEP’s Ohio utility to provide the systems’ output exclusively to those customers, although appeals are pending.

Hydrogen also features in vehicle offerings from American Honda Motor Co. Although its hybrid cars that can use either hydrogen or battery electric power are built in Marysville, most of them go to California.

In general, battery-powered electric vehicles are probably the best option for ​“small mobility,” said Gary Robinson, vice president of sustainability and business development for the company. Indeed, hydrogen cars remain niche at best. But ​“trucks, buses, industrial equipment — all of those things, in our opinion, are perfect candidates for hydrogen,” Robinson said. The company is exploring shipping and aviation as other potential markets for fuel cells.

Ohio also has a few projects looking to harness electrolysis — a process that uses electricity to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity that feeds into electrolysis is clean, the resulting hydrogen is clean too.

Dayton-based Millennium Reign Energy supplied electrolyzer equipment to provide initial fill-ups for the fuel-cell hybrids that Honda has made in Marysville since last year, and it has provided fueling equipment to other locations in the United States and abroad. The company plans to add two fueling stations for its Emerald H2 network in the Dayton area by April, CEO Chris McWhinney told Canary Media.

Plug Power also relies on electrolyzers to produce its hydrogen. The 28-year-old company’s first big order back in 2007 was for fuel cells to power pallet trucks at a Walmart distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio, said Mike Ahearn, vice president for North American service. He did not talk about projects the company would do as part of ARCH2, if it moves ahead, but he did describe work outside of Ohio.

Plug Power remains on track to start construction next year on a wind-powered hydrogen plant capable of producing around 45 tons per day in Graham, Texas. ​“We are on a good trajectory,” Ahearn said, adding that the company’s goal is to turn a profit next year — something it hasn’t done yet over its almost three decades in operation.

Independence Hydrogen, another ARCH2 project-development partner, concentrates on local hydrogen production and distribution. While federal funding remains uncertain, the company still hopes it can move ahead with the Ohio project that would be part of the hub.

The company’s method of making the alternative fuel doesn’t fit neatly on the ​“hydrogen rainbow” that indicates whether production relies on renewable energy or fossil fuels.

Rather, the source would be an industrial waste stream from the INEOS KOH plant in Ashtabula, Ohio. The plant makes potassium hydroxide and other chemicals, and releases a waste stream that is almost all hydrogen. Independence Hydrogen would basically ​“clean up” the gas by removing water and other impurities and then compress it for transport.

But ​“I need an offtaker,” said William Lehner, chief strategy officer for the company. ​“We would love to provide that project.”

Indeed, most companies at last week’s symposium would love more customers, but it’s unclear how quickly interest in the alternative fuel will ramp up if federal funding for ARCH2 and other hydrogen hubs remains in limbo and if tax incentives aren’t extended further.

The DOE’s ​“hydrogen shot,” launched in 2021, aimed to scale up the production of clean hydrogen and cut its cost to $1 per kilogram — an 80% reduction — by 2031. While developers would still cover at least half the project costs at the hubs, federal grants would have reduced total expenses and let them charge customers less for their hydrogen. The hope was that the lower prices would stoke demand.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/H2-hub-Millenium-Reign-Energy.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=bddc879fea3ff25ffdc4117efcb40260,N,,2025-11-06 06:02:50.030129

Infrastructure: EQT has upgraded plans for a compression expansion on Mountain Valley Pipeline following strong interest in an open season.

Rigs: The US lost 5 rigs for the week ending Oct. 18, bringing the total rig count to 515.

Flows: US natural gas volumes in pipeline samples were flat W-o-W, averaging 68.6 Bcf/d for the week ending Nov. 2.

Storage: Traders expect the EIA to report a 34 Bcf injection for the week ending Nov. 24.

Infrastructure:

EQT has upgraded plans for a compression expansion on Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP). The project, dubbed MVP Boost, was initially expected to add 500 MMcf/d of capacity, but the owner upsized it to 600 MMcf/d following strong interest in an open season.

In a project filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), MVP revealed that the shippers backing the expansion are Duke Energy (275 MMcf/d), Public Service Company of North Carolina (125 MMcf/d) and Virginia Power (200 MMcf/d). The companies have all signed long-term contracts at negotiated rates for the new capacity. EQT said the open season received over 1 Bcf/d of interest from potential counterparties.

The expansion will take MVP’s capacity to 2.6 Bcf/d from its current 2.0 Bcf/d and serve growing gas demand in Virginia and North Carolina. The project scope includes a new compressor station on MVP’s mainline in Montgomery County, VA and upgrades to three existing compressor stations. MVP expects to begin construction in winter 2026-27 and is targeting in-service in mid-2028.

MVP is currently flowing around 1.5 Bcf/d from West Virginia’s northern Marcellus/Utica production area to Station 165 on Transcontinental pipeline (Transco) in southern Virginia. The pipeline was placed into service in the summer of 2024 following years of legal battles. Flows on MVP have been seasonal through the first year and a half of operations, hitting peak capacity in January and February ’25 but decreasing in the spring shoulder season (see figure above).

Downstream constraints on Transco limit how much gas can currently flow on MVP, but Transco’s Southeast Supply Enhancement is expected to add 1.6 Bcf/d of additional capacity once it enters service in late 2027, alleviating those constraints.

See East Daley Analytics’ Northeast Supply & Demand Report for more information on MVP.

Rigs:

The US lost 5 rigs for the week of Oct. 18, bringing the total rig count to 515. The Permian (-5), Anadarko (-1) and Marcellus+Utica (-1) lost rigs while the Barnett (+1) and Denver-Julesburg (+1) gained rigs W-o-W.

At the company level, ET (-6), WES (-3), EPD (-2), MPLX (-1), ENLC (-1) and Hess (-1) lost rigs while PSX (+3), TRGP (+2) and M6 Midstream (+1) gained rigs W-o-W.

See East Daley Analytics’ weekly Rig Activity Tracker for more information on rigs by basin and company.

Flows:

US natural gas volumes in pipeline samples were flat W-o-W, averaging 68.6 Bcf/d for the week ending Nov. 2.

Major gas basin samples declined 0.2% W-o-W to 42.2 Bcf/d. The Haynesville sample declined 1.2% to 9.3 Bcf/d, while the Marcellus+Utica sample gained 0.3% to 32.1 Bcf/d.

Samples in liquids-focused basins increased 0.2% to 18.5 Bcf/d. The Permian sample declined 2.6% to 6.0 Bcf/d, while the Bakken sample gained 6.1% W-o-W.

Storage:

Traders and analysts expect the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to report a 34 Bcf injection for the week ending Oct. 31. An injection of 34 Bcf would increase the surplus to the five-year average by 8 Bcf to 179 Bcf. The storage surplus to last year would flip to a slight deficit of 5 Bcf from last week’s 29 Bcf surplus.

If Thursday’s EIA report comes in as expected, working gas would end the official injection season at 3,916 Bcf, or 5 Bcf greater than East Daley’s forecast in the latest Macro Supply & Demand Report. Despite storage closing at roughly the same level as last year, that is where the comparison ends between the two seasons. The 2024 shoulder period (April-October) saw 440 Bcf less gas injected. The season started with higher overall inventory, then hot weather combined with low prices to limit injections. The 2025 injection season started with relatively low inventory, but summer temperatures were not nearly as hot as the prior summer. Higher overall prices this year also induced some fuel switching and further cut into power demand.

Injections could last another week, making the week ending Nov. 14 the first net withdrawal week of the season. Prompt and cash prices have been moving in an upward direction this week as the next 15 days are expected to be colder than previously forecast.

A sunny state of 11 million people, North Carolina is a leader on utility-scale solar but middling when it comes to residential solar adoption.
The policy whiplash comes amid a difficult macroeconomic environment for rooftop solar.","A longstanding federal tax credit for rooftop solar is about to expire, making it more expensive for homeowners to access cheap, clean energy — and sowing uncertainty for the companies that put photovoltaic panels up on roofs.

But a small Durham, North Carolina, company called EnerWealth Solutions sees a path forward — at least for the next two years. Its model is to buy rooftop solar panels with a tax credit still available to commercial entities and rent them to homeowners, passing along the savings.

It’s an approach that firms around the country can adopt as the beleaguered rooftop solar sector tries to weather the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy.

The leasing strategy could be particularly useful in places like North Carolina, where a robust solar industry has taken root but state policy support for home rooftop panels is waning. In early 2023, funding dried up for a popular rooftop solar rebate program run by Duke Energy, the state’s predominant electric utility. Later that year, Duke began lowering bill credits for customers who send their solar power back to the grid.

A sunny state of 11 million people, North Carolina is a leader on utility-scale solar but middling when it comes to residential solar adoption. Just over 55,000 homes are now equipped with rooftop panels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, so the industry has ample room to grow.

“It’s so imperative that we’re opening every avenue to get these technologies into the hands of as many North Carolinians as possible,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an advocacy group.

EnerWealth’s first residential leasing customer is one of the industry’s own. A certified public accountant and financial consultant for solar firms, Casey Gilley said installing an array on his Chapel Hill home is something of an unspoken requirement. ​“You can’t work in the business and not have solar,” he said. ​“Right?”

While his profession may not be entirely typical, Gilley is an average Tar Heel in other ways. He’s trying to do his part to reduce pollution and save energy. He wants to guard against coming electricity-rate increases. And forking over a down payment on a full-price solar array for his family of five was a no-go.

Plenty of people EnerWealth aims to serve fit that profile, says Brian Liechti, director of solar leasing. That’s why, until the end of 2027, when companies like his can no longer access the tax credit, the goal is simple: ​“Make hay and electrons while the sun shines,” he said.

Silver linings for an embattled industry

Veterans of the solar industry say they’re used to the ebb and flow of policies designed to encourage homeowners to go solar. But there’s no doubt that they’ve had an especially hard year.

Most crushing was the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress in July. The law eliminates the 30% tax credit for home solar at the end of this year, nearly a decade sooner than it was previously set to expire. The change is pushing sales to new heights, but a crash is expected once the incentive is gone in 2026.

The White House also clawed back $7 billion in grants intended to help low-income households go solar, including a $156 million initiative projected to benefit 12,000 families across North Carolina. The state’s Attorney General Jeff Jackson is among 23 attorneys general around the country suing the Trump administration for terminating the program, calling the move illegal.

The policy whiplash comes amid a difficult macroeconomic environment for rooftop solar. High interest rates and inflation have lingered for years, dampening interest in the sector among those without the cash to buy a solar array outright.

Despite these woes, North Carolina installers see a few bright spots.

For one, a Duke trial program called PowerPair, in which customers receive a rebate of up to $9,000 for investing in a battery along with a solar array, has seen thousands of enrollees since its launch in the spring of last year. The pilot has reached its limit in the company’s eastern and far western territory but still has room in the central part of the state.

What’s more, a 2017 state law creates a small crack in Duke’s monopoly. While agreements between homeowners and non-utilities for the purchase of electricity are forbidden as ever, the statute allows individuals to rent the use of solar equipment up to a certain cap. This provision has been little-used to date in the residential sector but is a cornerstone of the EnerWealth model.

Then, there’s a final puzzle piece for the company: the pro-solar policy that escaped the purge in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While incentives for individuals dry up Dec. 31, commercial entities can receive at least a 30% credit for investing in renewable energy through the end of 2027.

EnerWealth, then, can keep buying rooftop solar panels for another two-plus years, benefit from the credit, and then pass on some of the savings to its lessees. For now, the company doesn’t have to fear hitting the Duke solar leasing cap established in 2017. And customers who can cash in on the PowerPair battery incentive while it still lasts will see even more savings.

“One tool in the toolbox”

These federal and state incentives can come together to produce savings for North Carolinians, even in a tough time for rooftop solar.

Though Gilley might conceivably have borrowed money and installed his panels in time to use the expiring tax credit, he chose the EnerWealth lease model instead.

“I ran the numbers of ownership versus lease, and they were very similar,” he said. But what ultimately tipped the scales toward the latter was that it didn’t require a down payment or any ongoing costs. ​“I didn’t have to come up with any cash,” he said. ​“Also, I don’t have to worry about any maintenance or any problems for the next 25 years.”

PowerPair is still available in Gilley’s area, so he used the $9,000 rebate as a down payment on the battery and the solar system. He receives net-metering bill credits and still pays Duke for electricity — but about $210 less per month than before. Even with his $150 monthly payment to EnerWealth, Gilley is saving about $60 a month.

His rental payment for the equipment will step up 1.5% each year. ​“But electricity prices are going to escalate at a much higher pace than that,” he predicted. ​“So, my annual savings will only grow.”

When the residential tax credit expires in two months, homeowners who want to go solar will have an even easier choice to make: Finance their equipment over time at roughly 7% interest rates or rent it for about 25% less per year, thanks to passthrough savings from the tax credits.

According to EnerWealth calculations, the lower lease payments on a $35,000 battery and solar array mean customers will save nearly $15,000 in overall electricity costs over 20 years. Even those who can pay for a system outright might choose a rental option: It’s cheaper because the lessor gets the government incentive.

“A lease is the only way to monetize the tax credit for residential systems,” EnerWealth’s Liechti said.

Meanwhile, in terms of customer experience, there’s little difference between renting and owning the panels and battery. Homeowners have a buyout option beginning in year seven. If they move, they can purchase the equipment and include the expense in the home’s sale price, or transfer the lease — and monthly bill savings — to the new owners.

The EnerWealth model does have its limits. It’s only available in Duke territory, which covers most but not all of the state. It’s also much more attractive with the PowerPair rebate, which is soon to dry up and faces an uncertain future after that.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1379397562.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1b6791e45cad394369cf9b8dfabfe3c2,N,,2025-11-06 04:17:54.806957

The rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution found that climate change increased Melissa’s maximum wind speeds by 7% and made the rainfall 16% more intense.
The scientists also wrote that the temperature and humidity in which the storm intensified were made six times more likely due to climate change compared to a pre-industrial world.
Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to human-caused climate change.
“It’s like basically taking a sponge and wringing it out, and climate change is making that sponge even larger,” said Brian Tang, a professor of atmospheric science at University at Albany.","Human-caused climate change boosted the destructive winds and rain unleashed by Hurricane Melissa and increased the temperatures and humidity that fueled the storm, according to an analysis released Thursday.

Melissa was one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes to make landfall and brought destructive weather to Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and Cuba, causing dozens of deaths across the Caribbean. Roofs were torn off of homes, hospitals were damaged, roads were blocked by landslides and crop fields were ruined.

The rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution found that climate change increased Melissa’s maximum wind speeds by 7% and made the rainfall 16% more intense. The scientists also wrote that the temperature and humidity in which the storm intensified were made six times more likely due to climate change compared to a pre-industrial world.

Rapid attribution analyses are a type of research that study factors influencing an extreme weather event and explore what the event would have been like in a world without climate change. They are typically published days or weeks after an extreme weather event.

Melissa slowly tracked across the region and drew in enormous amounts of energy from abnormally warm ocean water. The analysis reported ocean temperatures in Melissa’s path through the Caribbean were about 1.4°C (2.5°F) warmer compared to a pre-industrial climate.

“Warmer ocean temperatures are effectively the engine that drives a hurricane … the warmer the ocean temperatures, the greater the wind speed a hurricane can have,” said Theodore Keeping, a climate scientist who works for WWA and contributed to the analysis.

Melissa is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification, which is when a tropical cyclone’s maximum sustained winds increase by at least 30 knots (about 35 mph or 56 kph) in 24 hours.

“A hurricane this rare would actually have had wind speeds about 10 mph (16 kph) less extreme” in a pre-industrial climate, said Keeping. He said research links hurricane wind speeds to economic damage and there would have been less destruction caused by Melissa if the winds were slower.

Scientists have linked rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to human-caused climate change. Planet-warming gases released by humans, such as carbon dioxide, cause the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and increase ocean temperatures. Warmer oceans give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.

“It’s like basically taking a sponge and wringing it out, and climate change is making that sponge even larger,” said Brian Tang, a professor of atmospheric science at University at Albany.

Tang, who was not involved in the WWA research, said the methodology of the study released Thursday seems robust, and one of the more novel aspects of the analysis was the connection the scientists drew between wind speeds and increase in damage, which he said is a challenging area of research.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, who was not involved in the WWA research, said the findings of the rapid analysis are in line with existing research about climate change and tropical storms in the Atlantic. “This is completely consistent with our expectation of what’s going to happen in the future,” Dessler said.

Rapid attribution analyses help fill the need for an explanation about the influence of climate change shortly after a catastrophic weather event occurs, said Dessler. He said such analyses are “very valuable as a quick look” before the scientists are able to do more time-consuming calculations.

Dessler said one of the scariest aspects of Melissa was the storm’s peak sustained winds of 185 mph (298 kph) winds. “That’s pretty rare to have a storm that strong. And I think that, to the extent that this is a harbinger of the future, it’s not good,” he said.

PRICE: You can design power plants that collect energy during the day and produce power just at night or produce power 24 hours a day.

THAKORE: Price's company, Solar Dynamics, has had contracts with the federal government for years, including during the first Trump administration. But in early October, the Department of Energy canceled two of his biggest grants. That's a huge hit for his business.

PRICE: I think it's very likely we'll shut down, unfortunately. Unless something changes...

THAKORE: ...Price and his 10 employees are probably out of a job. Their projects are among the 223 across the country that the DOE says it's canceled. Those included everything from building major new transmission lines to research on newer technologies like carbon capture. Most were approved during the Biden administration. Many were funded by major climate legislation or the bipartisan infrastructure law. The DOE did not respond to questions for this story, but in a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the projects do not, quote, ""adequately advance America's energy needs."" Here's Wright on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: These decisions are made - business decisions - on whether it's a good use of the taxpayer money or not.

THAKORE: Hank Price disagrees.

PRICE: We see this as providing a reliable, affordable, dispatchable domestic energy source. How's that not supporting America's energy needs?

THAKORE: Ken Gillingham is an economics professor at the Yale School of the Environment. He said government grants like these support innovations that may later become widely successful.

KEN GILLINGHAM: The whole point is to find technologies that are not commercially viable now and give them the support they need to become commercially viable.

THAKORE: Not all of the projects would have worked out, Gillingham says, but U.S. government funding has led to huge breakthroughs, like the first nuclear reactor. Some canceled grant recipients say their projects are well aligned with the Trump administration's goals, like supporting fossil fuel production. Dan Zimmerle runs a center at Colorado State University. It helps oil and gas companies cut their pollution.

DAN ZIMMERLE: We work every day with oil and gas operators, and they're getting value from that.

THAKORE: His team helps companies find natural gas leaks, which helps the environment and their bottom line. But he was informed his center's main funding was cut, apparently because of a change in priorities. That's a first, he says.

ZIMMERLE: It's now 14 years of working with the Department of Energy on projects, through multiple administration changes.

THAKORE: Recipients like Zimmerle and Price are now scrambling to make up the funding. They have a short window to appeal their cancellations. Back outside Denver, Price and his co-founder say giving up on projects like theirs - it means countries like China will fill the void.

PRICE: America really has been a world leader in technology, and now we just give up. We're throwing it all away, you know? That's unfortunate.

THAKORE: Building the company, though? They said it's been a heck of a ride. For NPR News, I'm Ishan Thakore in Watkins, Colorado.

China recently disclosed intentions to establish an electric vehicle (EV) plant in Nigeria.","The Senate has passed the Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill 2025 for its second reading, giving way for a gradual phase-out of petrol-powered vehicles across the country.

The proposed legislation, sponsored by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North) seeks to establish a national framework for the transition to electric vehicles, encourage local manufacturing, and strengthen Nigeria’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

During Tuesday’s plenary, lawmakers overwhelmingly supported the bill, describing it as a necessary step to diversify the economy and align with global clean energy trends.

Senator Kalu said the legislation aims to transform Nigeria’s automotive and energy sectors, foster innovation, and create jobs throughout the manufacturing value chain.

According to the draft, the law will provide incentives including tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, and subsidies for both electric vehicle users and investors.

It will also make it mandatory for all fuel stations nationwide to install electric vehicle charging points.

The bill further requires foreign automakers seeking to sell electric vehicles in Nigeria to partner with licensed local assemblers and establish domestic assembly plants within three years.

Companies must source at least 30 percent of their components locally by 2030. Violations could attract fines of up to 250 million naira per breach, while unlicensed importers risk penalties of 500 million naira and confiscation of goods.

The bill positions Nigeria as a potential hub for electric vehicle production in Africa. It mandates that local assemblers produce a minimum of 5,000 units annually, meeting international safety and technical standards.

Investors who establish charging infrastructure will also qualify for government grants and tax credits.

Meanwhile senate president Godswill Akpabio described the proposal as forward-looking legislation that supports President Bola Tinubu’s economic diversification and clean energy goals.

“This is a necessary shift that reflects the future of transportation and sustainability,” he said.

The Electric Vehicle Transition and Green Mobility Bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Industry for further legislative work and is expected to return to the chamber within four weeks for third reading and final passage.

China recently disclosed intentions to establish an electric vehicle (EV) plant in Nigeria.

The development was made known during a courtesy visit by China’s Ambassador to Nigeria, Yu Dunhai, to Dr. Dele Alake, Minister of Solid Minerals Development.

During the visit, Ambassador Dunhai underlined the need for further collaboration between the two countries in unleashing Nigeria’s solid minerals potential, a crucial component in EV battery production, and propelling Nigeria’s industrial growth.",https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Senate.png,N,,2025-11-06 06:58:06.941858

Revolutionizing Battery Manufacturing

UK-based battery tech startup Anaphite has announced the results of an independent assessment confirming that its dry coating technology for lithium-ion electrodes can significantly cut carbon emissions in battery production.

The study, conducted by Minviro, a life cycle assessment (LCA) specialist, found that Anaphite’s process reduces emissions by 3.57 kg CO₂ per kWh of battery capacity compared to conventional wet coating — a method still used for over 99% of batteries produced globally.

If adopted industry-wide, the technology could help save 7 million tonnes of CO₂ annually — equivalent to the carbon captured by 320 million trees.

Why Dry Coating Matters

Battery electrodes are typically made using a wet coating process that requires enormous ovens to dry solvent-based slurries — consuming vast amounts of energy and releasing significant emissions.

Anaphite’s dry coating process eliminates this energy-intensive drying stage. Instead, it uses a single engineered powder material that integrates all the necessary components of an electrode, optimized for high-speed manufacturing lines.

The result is a cleaner, more cost-efficient method of producing electrodes, one that can help battery and EV manufacturers cut carbon footprints while preparing for stricter regulations.

A Step Toward EU Battery Passport Compliance

From 2027, the EU’s Battery Passport regulations will require every EV and industrial battery over 2 kWh to disclose its total carbon footprint through an ISO-compliant life cycle assessment.

Using Anaphite’s dry coating method could help manufacturers stay ahead of these requirements.

For example, a 75 kWh EV battery pack made with this process could save around 268 kg of CO₂ compared to traditional manufacturing.

Although specific emission thresholds have not yet been set, such reductions could soon become essential for market access in Europe — and potentially a competitive edge for forward-thinking OEMs.

Expert Insights and Validation

The Minviro assessment adhered to ISO 14067 standards and was critically reviewed by independent experts in life cycle analysis and battery production.

According to Lydia Bridges, Senior Consultant at Minviro, the project demonstrates how transparent environmental assessments can translate innovation into measurable impact:

“Our independent analysis identified a clear reduction in carbon footprint for Anaphite’s dry coating process compared with conventional wet coating. Studies like this provide essential environmental data for cell manufacturers as they prepare for EU Battery Regulation compliance.”

Backed by UK Innovation Funding

The study was part of a Feasibility Study project supported by the UK Government’s Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF), facilitated by the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC).

These government-backed initiatives aim to support next-generation technologies that could make the UK a leader in sustainable battery manufacturing.

Looking Ahead

As global battery demand is expected to exceed 1.9 TWh by 2025 and nearly double by 2030, innovations like Anaphite’s could play a crucial role in decarbonizing the e-mobility supply chain.

Dry coating isn’t just about reducing emissions, it represents a broader shift toward cleaner, faster, and more efficient manufacturing methods that could define the next decade of EV production.

Premium Subscriber Q&A: Jamieson expounds on how the role of in-house counsel has changed over her three decades working in legal departments.
“When she first started, she hit the ground running and quickly understood the various existing legal challenges and issues that OCI faced.
Austin-headquartered Topaz Power Management hired Jamieson in 2012 as its general counsel — a position she held for more than eight years.
Throughout the Covid pandemic, Jamieson worked as a freelance legal consultant, providing legal and advisory services to a handful of energy companies.","As the world exited the isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, Janet Jamieson and her husband “were ready for an adventure.”

Jamieson had been a general counsel and senior counsel at three conventionally fired power plants for more than two decades. Then, she received a call from a legal recruiter with an opportunity that, she says, “fit the bill in a number of ways.”

OCI Enterprise’s emphasis on renewable energy and related manufacturing attracted Jamieson right away.

“Renewable technology, especially solar, and its cousin, battery energy storage systems, are incredible technologies that have much to offer in terms of enhancing grid stability as well as, of course, in terms of protecting the environment and limiting harmful emissions, which is important to me,” she told The Texas Lawbook.

Two years into her job as OCI’s general counsel, the new administration and Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which introduced sweeping changes that directly affected OCI’s businesses.

“The legislation adjusted tax credits for renewable projects, added restrictions on foreign investment and created new compliance obligations,” said Jessica Adkins, a partner at Sidley Austin. “These changes came at a time when energy companies were already contending with global trade restrictions and supply chain pressures.”

“Janet played a central role in ensuring OCI not only complied with the new requirements but also used them as an opportunity to strengthen the company’s market position,” Adkins said. “She has also advised OCI’s Korean parent company on U.S. investment structures, guided cross-border transactions through tightened foreign investment framework and developed strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs on polysilicon-related products.”

“Her ability to see both the legal and commercial implications of these changes has enabled OCI to continue closing high-value transactions while positioning itself as a leader in clean energy,” said Adkins, who nominated Jamieson for the 2025 San Antonio Corporate Counsel Award for General Counsel of the Year for a Small Legal Department (two to five lawyers).

The Association of Corporate Counsel’s San Antonio Chapter and The Lawbook agree with Adkins and are honoring Jamieson with the award this Thursday, Nov. 6.

Premium Subscriber Q&A: Jamieson expounds on how the role of in-house counsel has changed over her three decades working in legal departments.

“Janet has been able to guide the company with a steady hand through significant changes in the industry, the economy and OCI’s projects,” said Andrew Wong, a partner at ArentFox Schiff. “When she first started, she hit the ground running and quickly understood the various existing legal challenges and issues that OCI faced. She was able to lead her team and the business as it dealt with many of these issues, and as the company explored and transitioned into new projects and areas.”

“Despite a lean team, she has been instrumental in sustaining OCI’s success and increasing OCI’s presence in the industry and the area,” Wong said.

Mario Samos, a senior managing associate at Sidley Austin in Houston, said Jamieson “has strengthened OCI’s ability to execute deals with speed and confidence.”

“One of Janet’s important achievements has been improving the company’s transaction processes, including by assessing and refining the forms of agreements used across deals and the processes used to review and negotiate transactions,” Samos said. “This work has given OCI the flexibility to take advantage of commercial opportunities quickly while still maintaining clear frameworks for addressing issues that might arise in a transaction.”

“Beyond process, Janet’s success has been in how she has shaped the relationship between the legal and commercial teams,” Samos said. “She has built a culture of partnership and mutual understanding. In the transactions in which we have worked on together, she has successfully been able to ensure that the legal function does not just advise on risks but also actively drives business success.”

The accomplishments of Jamieson and her team of three other lawyers in 2024 and 2025 seem to accumulate monthly. They include:

· Navigated and structured transactions under new foreign investment rules;

· Mitigated trade restrictions and tariffs and developed strategies to address ongoing antidumping and countervailing duties and polysilicon related tariffs, safeguarding OCI’s renewable energy and manufacturing businesses;

· Closed more than 1 gigawatts of solar project sales in Texas;

· Advanced energy storage and power agreements and negotiated a long-term agreement with CPS Energy for services from OCI Energy’s Alamo City battery project, strengthening San Antonio’s grid resilience;

· Strengthened domestic solar manufacturing and supported Mission Solar Energy’s 2024 nationwide launch of a tariff-free, domestically sourced, utility-scale product line that aligns with new sourcing rules, enhancing America’s renewable supply chain; and

· Counseled OCI Alabama’s state-of-the-art chemical facility and provided legal oversight on operational, environmental and regulatory issues critical to the company’s advanced sodium percarbonate manufacturing operations.

“There is no consistent routine from one day to the next,” Jamieson said. “Every day is different. Executive leadership spends a fair amount of time discussing the strategic direction of all our U.S. subsidiaries — one of which is a developer of utility scale solar farms, another of which is a chemical manufacturer, and the third of which is in the solar module business.”

Jamieson said she works on financings, engages in transaction structuring discussions, provides input on major agreements, provides guidance on HR-related matters, manages contract disputes and interacts with OCI’s Asian-based affiliates on trade or regulatory matters.

“My time tends to be very taken up by others during the day, so I often use evenings or the mornings to catch up on drafting and reviewing documents,” she said. “I also take time each day to catch up on general and industry news, particularly given the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill and changing tariff and trade-case environment.”

Jamieson grew up in Colorado Springs and enjoyed hiking and skiing with her parents and older brother. Her mother was an elementary school teacher, and her father owned a small construction company.

“I had always been interested in the law, given my affinity for logic and language, not to mention that, when my brother and I were kids, he would often jokingly tell me when we argued that I’d make a good lawyer someday,” she said.

Jamieson earned her undergraduate degree at Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1987 and then a master’s degree in 1989 at Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey.

“I found myself somewhat adrift as to where my new path would lead,” she said. “On a whim, really, I applied for a job to be — of all things — a natural gas marketer for a company in Denver. My customers were quite diverse and all in New Mexico, ranging from farmers to large hotels to hospitals. The famers were my favorite. It was my first exposure to negotiating contracts, which I enjoyed. Later, that company was acquired by an affiliate of then-LG&E Energy Marketing.”

The idea of law school resurfaced in the early 1990s, and she was admitted to the University of Colorado School of Law.

When she informed her employer, company leaders suggested that she take a leave of absence instead of resigning, which would allow her to work during holidays and summer breaks. She agreed.

“I hadn’t planned on staying in the energy industry when I was accepted to law school,” she said. “The company continued to offer me opportunities throughout law school, including transitioning me to legal-related work with their commercial and regulatory attorneys.”

When Jamieson graduated in 1996, LG&E hired her directly into its legal department to work with and support their senior attorneys in Dallas.

“It’s actually very unusual for companies to hire attorneys directly out of law school, but mine was a smooth transition, given my industry background and the fact the company had a large enough legal department so there were a number of senior attorneys to train me,” she said.

In 1999, Houston-based GenOn Energy, which is now part of NRG, hired Jamieson as its senior counsel handling complex power sales agreements, credit support agreements, tolling agreements and overseeing finance and compliance matters.

Austin-headquartered Topaz Power Management hired Jamieson in 2012 as its general counsel — a position she held for more than eight years.

Throughout the Covid pandemic, Jamieson worked as a freelance legal consultant, providing legal and advisory services to a handful of energy companies.

As the world reopened and returned to normal in 2022, Jamieson and her husband, who retired from a long career at Canadian National Railway, started thinking about the future.

“Neither of us had a specific vision [of] what that would look like,” she said.

Then came the call about OCI.

The emphasis on renewable energy was an attraction, Jamieson said, but so was the “fabulous group of diverse people” at OCI’s helm, which included leaders from Korea, South Africa, Turkey and Australia.

“Like a lot of attorneys practicing in the renewables sector, I began my energy career working with conventional-fired power generation facilities,” she said.

The move also provided Jamieson and her husband the opportunity for some lifestyle changes.

“When we moved to San Antonio, instead of living outside the city as we did in Austin, we ‘shook it up’ and chose a flat downtown near the river, where we frequently walk to restaurants or to get a coffee on weekends,” she said. “We’ve enjoyed being at the heart of San Antonio, its diversity and its celebrations, including Fiesta, which I’d never heard of before moving here but now look forward to each spring.”

The OCI position has come with challenges, such as the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But lawyers agree that she has successfully handled each one of them.

“The changes in renewables- and tax-related legislation have presented significant challenges for renewables and related manufacturing in the United States,” she said. “Also, I had never worked for a foreign-controlled company, and I was not versed in Asian/Korean law and culture. Suffice to say, there is a different tempo and business culture, which I’m still learning but enjoy.”

“One of the super fun things about being in-house is having the opportunity to work closely with the commercial folks — not just at the end to document a transaction — but rather to participate and assist in the structuring of that transaction from its early stages,” Jamieson said. “I appreciate the collaborative environment throughout the organization. Respectful communication is key in that it facilitates the exchange of ideas so they can be evaluated and built on. Part of that is we have to listen, truly listen to each another, to make sure we understand what is being communicated.”

“While from time to time we all mess up and get hurried and perhaps don’t listen as well as we could, everyone at least tries, which is big,” she said. “It may sound cliché, but I truly believe that we are stronger as a team than as individuals.”

Samos, who has worked with Jamieson on multiple transactions, said she “is mission-focused and strategic in the work she does.”

“Janet has an exceptional ability to see both the immediate transaction and the broader organizational goals it serves, including the impact on transactions across the organization as a whole,” he said. “She is also thoughtful about resource allocation, understanding when to draw on internal legal expertise and when to bring in external counsel to achieve the best result for a transaction.”

Wong agrees and said Jamieson “is flexible and adapts easily to a variety of situations.”

“Whether it is negotiating with an opposing party, dealing with difficult counterparties or working with her team or individuals throughout her organization, Janet is able to strike the right tone and work to address any situation or issue,” he said. “She is a great listener who values the opinions of everyone on her team as well as her outside consultants and is quick to give credit to others at every opportunity. Because of this, she is able to work seamlessly with lawyers, business-side and technical folks to arrive at the best decisions and solutions for the company.”

Jamieson refers to herself as an “accidental general counsel.”

“While I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the course of my career, little of it has been self-directed, but rather much has occurred just by being open to challenges and pursuing opportunities as they came my way,” she said. “I’ve never been title or role driven. What has always been most important to me is working with smart, respectful, ethical people while doing challenging, interesting work to the best of my ability.”

(CETY) and METIS Power Inc. have partnered to introduce a mobile, modular power and mining solution designed to give cryptocurrency operators more control over where and how they source power. The integrated system pairs a mobile cryptomining solution with mobile power generation, allowing miners to deploy, relocate, and scale without relying on the local electrical grid.

The cryptomining units will be built on a trailer-based platform and arrive with racking, cooling, power distribution, and remote monitoring already in place. Operators will be able move the system to any suitable power source, including behind-the-meter sites, remote gas fields, or private power infrastructure, and begin operating shortly after arrival.

“The biggest challenges for miners continue to be power price stability and access to reliable supply,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. “Our approach should give operators the flexibility to position their mining capacity where economics make sense, whether that is grid-connected, behind-the-meter, or fully off-grid power. This solution should expand the company’s commercial footprint by generating revenue through system sales, deployment, and ongoing operational support services tied to mobile mining installations.”

The MPM-series mining unit can accommodate approximately 160 ASIC miners and is equipped with a closed-loop liquid cooling system designed to maintain steady operating performance. The companion power unit supplies on-site electrical generation so the mining operation does not depend on local grid capacity or utility interconnection timelines.

“For many operators, power is both the largest cost and the biggest operational constraint,” said Pooya Kabiri, CEO of METIS Power Inc. “By locating mining capacity directly at the power source and reducing transmission and demand charges, this approach can create conditions where delivered power cost can fall into the sub–$0.03 per kWh range, depending on fuel supply, permitting, and site configuration.”

Mr. Kabiri continued, “By combining mobile power generation with mobile compute, we’re removing those constraints entirely. Miners can now move where the energy is available, where the economics are strongest, and where operational conditions make sense, without being tied to one location or utility system.”

For operators seeking to monetize flare gas, stranded gas, or waste heat, the combined CETY–METIS mobile system will allow conversion of energy that would otherwise be wasted into productive computing output. Because the system is mobile, mining capacity can shift with market conditions, regulatory changes, or fuel availability.

The companies plan to support deployments initially in North America, with additional expansion expected in regions where behind-the-meter or off-grid power resources are accessible.

About Montauk Renewables, Inc. Montauk Renewables, Inc. (NASDAQ: MNTK) is a renewable energy company specializing in the management, recovery and conversion of biogas into RNG.","PITTSBURGH, Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Montauk Renewables, Inc. (“Montauk” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: MNTK), a renewable energy company specializing in the management, recovery, and conversion of biogas into renewable natural gas (“RNG”), today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Third Quarter Highlights:

Revenues of $45.3. million, decreased 31.3% compared to the third quarter of 2024

0.7 million RINs generated and unseparated as of September 30, 2025

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 million, decreased 56.4% year-over-year

RNG production of 1.4 million MMBtu, increased 3.8% compared to third quarter of 2024

RINs sold of 12.4 million, decreased 3.3 million or 21.2% year-over-year

Our decision to sell an increased amount of our production under fixed/floor-price arrangements contributed to our having less RINs to sell in the 2025 third quarter over the 2024 third quarter. However, we have not experienced an appreciable increase in Environmental Attributes shared with our pathway providers during the third quarter of 2025. In October 2025, we filed response comments to the joint motion with the North Carolina Utility Commission (“NCUC”) requesting they grant modifications or delays only to individual power suppliers that have demonstrated need and compliance best-efforts, require power suppliers that have not achieved 100% compliance in 2025 to apply cumulatively acquired swine RECs to the suppliers unsatisfied 2025 pro rata obligation, and modify the swine RECs set-aside for 2026 and beyond to match the requirement as set by North Carolina in 2018.

The EPA indicated their intention to finalize the Supplemental Rule and the RVOs for 2025, 2026 and 2027 by the end of 2025, however, the duration of the US federal government shut down and any residual impacts on EPA staffing after the shutdown concludes may extend finalization of these items into 2026. The average D3 RIN index price for the third quarter of 2025 was $2.19 compared to $3.36 in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of approximately 34.8%. As we self-market a significant portion of our RINs, a strategic decision to not to commit to transfer available RINs during a period may impact our revenue and operating profit.

Third Quarter Financial Results

Total revenues in the third quarter of 2025 were $45.3 million, a decrease of $20.6 million (31.3%) compared to $65.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease is related to a decrease in the number of RINs we self-marketed from 2025 RNG production in the third quarter of 2025. Our average realized RIN price in the third quarter of 2025 was $2.29 which decreased approximately 31.4% compared to $3.34 in the third quarter of 2024. Operating and maintenance expenses for our RNG facilities in the third quarter of 2025 were $13.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million (10.6%) compared to $12.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The primary drivers of this increase were timing of preventative maintenance, media changeout maintenance, wellfield operational enhancement programs, and utility expenses at our Rumpke, Atascocita, and Apex facilities. Our Renewable Electricity Generation operating and maintenance expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were $2.6 million, a decrease of $0.1 million (4.3%) compared to $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily driven by timing of annual engine maintenance at our Tulsa facility. Total general and administrative expenses were $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $3.5 million (35.1%) compared to $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 driven by accelerated vesting of certain restricted share awards as a result of the termination of an employee in the third quarter of 2024. Operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $4.4 million, a decrease of $18.3 million (80.4%) compared to $22.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. Net income in the third quarter of 2025 was $5.2 million, a decrease of $11.8 million (69.5%) compared to $17.0 million in the third quarter of 2024.

Third Quarter Operational Results

We produced approximately 1.4 million Metric Million British Thermal Units (“MMBtu”) of RNG in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 53 thousand MMBtu compared to 1.4 million MMBtu produced in the third quarter of 2024. At our Rumpke facility, we produced 50 MMBtu more in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 as a result of higher feedstock gas. At our Apex facility, we produced 25 MMBtu more in the third quarter of 2025 as a result of the June 2025 commissioning of the second Apex RNG facility. Offsetting the increase was the fourth quarter of 2024 sale of our Southern facility which produced 69 MMBtu in the first nine months of 2024. We produced approximately 44 thousand megawatt hours (“MWh”) in Renewable Electricity in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 3 thousand MWh compared to 41 thousand MWh produced in the third quarter of 2024.

Our Bowerman facility produced approximately 2 thousand MWh more in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024 as a result of processing equipment maintenance that was completed in the third quarter of 2024.

2025 Full Year Outlook

RNG revenues are expected to range between $150 and $170 million (unchanged)

RNG production volumes are expected to range between 5.8 and 6.0 million MMBtu (unchanged)

REG revenues are expected to range between $17 and $18 million (unchanged)

REG production volumes are expected to range between 175 and 180 thousand MWh

The proposed legislation seeks to establish a national framework for Nigeria’s transition to electric vehicles (EVs), promote local manufacturing, and advance the nation’s commitment to environmental sustainability.

Sponsored by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North), the bill received widespread support from lawmakers, who emphasized the need for local content development, foreign investment, and nationwide charging infrastructure as key components of Nigeria’s transition to green mobility.

Leading the debate, Senator Kalu stated that the bill aims to transform the country’s automotive and energy sectors, foster technological innovation, and generate employment across the manufacturing value chain.

He explained that the legislation provides a range of incentives — including tax holidays, import duty waivers, toll exemptions, subsidies, and road tax reliefs — to encourage EV adoption and investment. The bill also mandates the installation of electric vehicle charging stations at all fuel service outlets nationwide.

A major provision requires foreign automakers to partner with licensed Nigerian assemblers and establish local assembly plants within three years, with a minimum of 30% local content sourcing by 2030. Non-compliance may attract fines of up to ₦250 million per violation, while unlicensed EV importers could face penalties of ₦500 million and confiscation of their goods.

Economically, the bill positions Nigeria as a potential hub for EV manufacturing in Africa, mandating that assemblers produce at least 5,000 units annually while adhering to international safety and technical standards. Investors who establish EV charging stations will also be eligible for government grants and tax credits.

Senate President Godswill Akpabio described the bill as a forward-looking initiative aligned with President Bola Tinubu’s agenda for economic diversification and clean energy transition.",https://lagostelevision.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/senate-690x449-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 03:03:14.497045

From Rio de Janeiro to Belém, Wisconsin is showing how pragmatic, locally led climate action can power jobs, resilience, and economic growth

Standing on the waterfront in Rio de Janeiro, where hundreds of mayors, governors, and regional leaders have gathered for the COP30 Local Leaders Forum, it’s clear that local action is driving global climate progress. While world leaders prepare to meet in Belém later this month, the real momentum is here — among the subnational leaders delivering measurable results where people live and work.

And Wisconsin, led by Governor Tony Evers, is front and center.

As Co-Chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, Governor Evers joined New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and other U.S. state leaders to release the Alliance’s new Annual Report in Rio. The message was simple and strong: despite federal headwinds and denialism from some quarters, U.S. states are pressing forward — cutting climate pollution, growing the economy, and investing in a cleaner, more resilient future.

“We want the world to know that the United States continues to work at the state level to reduce emissions, create clean energy jobs, and increase resilience — regardless of what our president or anyone else says,” Evers told reporters at the opening session.

Subnational Leadership That Works

The U.S. Climate Alliance — a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing more than half the U.S. population and GDP — has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 24% since 2005, while growing GDP by 34%. Those numbers tell a powerful story: climate action and economic growth are not opposites. They’re two sides of the same coin.

Alliance states are driving the nation’s clean-energy buildout — responsible for 70% of America’s zero-emission vehicles, 68% of all public EV chargers, and nearly 200 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity added since 2005. Electricity-sector emissions alone have fallen 45% across member states.

That kind of steady progress is why subnational leadership is so vital. Even when Washington wavers, states and localities keep building, innovating, and creating jobs.

Solutions Exchange: From Policy to Practice

At the America Is All In “Solutions Exchange” sessions this week — co-hosted by Bloomberg Philanthropies — governors, mayors, and business leaders shared how climate policies translate into real community benefits: lower energy bills, cleaner air, and more resilient infrastructure. It’s a shift from negotiation to delivery, and Wisconsin offers a compelling example.

Our state’s clean-energy workforce now tops 75,000 jobs, spanning manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and services. Visit Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley, and you’ll see companies like Ingeteam building EV chargers and wind-turbine components for projects across the country. These are “Made in Wisconsin” climate solutions powering the global transition.

Wisconsin’s Common-Sense Climate Playbook

In a purple state like ours, climate action succeeds when it’s rooted in kitchen-table common sense — lowering costs, creating local jobs, and protecting our air and water. That pragmatic approach is helping Wisconsin communities weather storms, modernize schools, and give businesses the predictability they need to invest.

Consider the growing number of solar installations on schools and farms, energy-efficiency upgrades in homes and small businesses, and rural areas deploying EV charging corridors that connect tourists and truckers alike. Each project cuts carbon and saves money — the definition of win-win.

Equity is also at the heart of Wisconsin’s progress. Groups like Green Homeowners United are helping low- and moderate-income families weatherize homes, replace old furnaces, and install heat pumps — ensuring the benefits of clean energy reach the people who need them most.

Resilience in the Face of Federal Uncertainty

Evers and his fellow Alliance governors are candid about the challenge ahead. With rollbacks in federal climate policy, states must stay the course — not only to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, but to safeguard local economies and public health. As Governor Evers noted, “Even when federal leadership falters, our resolve only grows stronger.”

The Alliance’s updated targets are ambitious yet achievable: 26% emissions reduction by 2025, 52% by 2030, and 66% by 2035. Those goals are backed by data, science, and — most importantly — people on the ground who see the benefits of cleaner energy and smarter infrastructure.

Wisconsin’s Role on the Global Stage

Here in Rio, Governor Evers’ leadership reflects something larger: Wisconsin’s growing influence in the global climate conversation. As the U.S. delegation heads to Belém, the message from states like ours is clear — progress doesn’t wait for politics. It’s built city by city, farm by farm, and business by business.

For Wisconsin, that means doubling down on what works:

Supporting manufacturers building the backbone of the clean-energy economy.

Strengthening partnerships among businesses, farms, and communities.

Protecting the public tools — like rebates, tax credits, and utility programs — that make the transition affordable and fair.

By staying pragmatic, collaborative, and grounded in results, Wisconsin can continue to punch above its weight — showing that climate leadership in a purple state is not only possible, it’s a competitive advantage.

That’s the Wisconsin story worth sharing — from Rio to Belém, from our neighborhoods to the world.

Tuesday was a great day at the ballot box for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide.

In races from New York to Georgia to Washington, voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit—and the people promising to deliver those policies. On the whole, the results suggest Americans are pushing back against President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back climate action.

“This election was a decisive rejection of the Trump administration’s ban on clean energy, multi-million-dollar taxpayer bailouts for expensive dirtier energy sources like coal, and other ineffective proposals that will make costs go even higher,” Sara Schreiber of the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

One of the day’s biggest wins came in New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race in a landslide victory called just 35 minutes after polls closed. More than two million New Yorkers voted, the most in a mayoral race since 1969. Although Mamdani, who at 34 will be the city’s youngest mayor in more than a century, made affordability the predominant focus of his campaign, he garnered an endorsement from the youth-led climate organization Sunrise Movement. Many saw his campaign promises, which included calls for free mass transit and the greening of public schools, as the seeds of a populist climate movement.

“Zohran was talking about climate action in a way people could understand, and people were able to see the impacts of this climate action in their everyday lives,” Denae Ávila-Dickson, Sunrise’s communications and political manager, told New York Focus. Dan Jasper, of the non-profit group Project Drawdown, said Mamdani’s transit proposal “is not as sexy as something like solar. But these are the exact type of policies we’re going to need to actually address climate change, because it addresses people’s standards of living.”

Mamdani’s challenge will be assembling the coalition needed to make those policies happen. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who has also promoted a municipal green new deal agenda, may not have similar difficulty. Yesterday, Wu’s City Council allies retained their seats, giving her a fighting chance at success.

As far as statewide elections go, Georgia was a point of contention: There, electricity prices were on the ballot. Democrats won two of the five seats on the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees utilities and has approved six bill increases in three years.

Democrats have not held a seat on the board since 2007, but clean energy consultant Peter Hubbard and anti-poverty advocate Alicia Johnson tapped voter outrage over climbing prices and notched upset victories over Republican incumbents. Democrats also criticized Republicans for embracing fossil fuels and backing away from clean energy at a time when the state faces rising demand for power.

“I think for a lot of folks who have felt powerless over rising utility bills, especially in a state like Georgia where they’ve gone up for the average household by more than $500 in just the last couple of years, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that potential change is coming,” said Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy non-profit PowerLines.

Rising energy bills emerged as a top issue in other races, too, including the governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia. For political scientist Leah Stokes, who studies public opinion around climate change, Tuesday’s results weren’t unexpected.

“I think yesterday was a repudiation of the idea that Americans don’t care about energy or climate and these are losing issues, which is what all of these pundits have been going on and on about for about nine months now. That’s really wrong,” Stokes said. “Everyday people understand that clean energy is cheap energy—they can easily make those connections.”

In New Jersey, governor-elect Mikie Sherrill vowed to declare “a state of emergency on energy costs” on her first day in office. She plans to roll out expanded generation capacity, including rooftop solar and battery storage, and “immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity.”

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s seat on a platform that included data centre operators paying for their own electricity costs in a region that currently hosts over 13% of the world’s data centre capacity. Her “Affordable Virginia” plan included calls to expand wind and solar power, promote home weatherization to ease power consumption, and streamline permitting and other requirements for expanding generation.

To the west, California voters approved Proposition 50, which will allow the state’s Democratic majority to sidestep the statewide redistricting commission and redraw congressional districts ahead of 2026 midterm elections. Although it is not, strictly speaking, a climate measure, the move was crafted to give Democrats as many as five more seats in the U.S. Congress. Governor Gavin Newsom and a slate of prominent Democrats nationwide championed the proposal as a counterbalance to Republican-led gerrymandering in states like Texas, where a similar effort earlier this year carved out five new seats for the GOP.

In a speech Tuesday night, Newsom said California voters approved the measure “to send a message to Donald Trump. No crowns, no thrones, no kings. That’s what this victory represents. [It] is a victory for the people of the state of California and the United States of America.”

Climate-friendly policies—those centring on transit, in particular—won on a local scale, too. Voters in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which includes the city of Charlotte, handily approved a 1% increase in the sales tax to finance nearly $20 billion in transportation improvements. Although 40% of the additional revenue will be allocated to roads, some of that funding will support new bike lanes and sidewalks. Another 40% will go toward rail, and the remainder will be dedicated to buses and micro-transit. In Ellensburg, Washington, 65% of voters approved a permanent 0.2% sales tax to fund the municipal bus system.

Across the U.S., one thing was clear: Wallet-friendly climate policies—and candidates presenting themselves as helping people pay their bills—won.

“Climate change isn’t at the forefront of every election, but at this point, every election is a climate election,” Jasper of Project Drawdown said. “‘Climate action equals affordability’ seems to be the winning message of the day.”

Adaptation is a critically important part of addressing climate change, and a world with more prosperity and less inequality is one where we can better deal with the impacts of climate change – at least up to a point.
Or as the late climate economist Marty Weitzman memorably put it, when it comes to climate change “the sting is in the tail”.
There are real costs associated with fossil fuel use: from air pollution, from climate change, from local environmental damage.
And deprioritizing climate change as an issue risks substituting near-term benefits for long term harms that are nearly impossible to reverse.","There are a lot of things I agree with in Bill Gates’ new memo on climate change. The recent cutbacks on international spending on vaccination, malaria control, feeding the hungry, and poverty alleviation by many of the richest countries (driven in part by a desire for more military spending) is a catastrophe that will cost thousands if not millions of lives. Adaptation is a critically important part of addressing climate change, and a world with more prosperity and less inequality is one where we can better deal with the impacts of climate change – at least up to a point.

But in other areas I feel that it needlessly sets up a conflict between laudable goals: we can both mitigate emissions and alleviate poverty, disease, and hunger. While there are some tradeoffs it is more a question of policy priority than a zero sum game. Similarly, I feel that Gates is a bit too cavalier in his treatment of climate risk.

Given the strong reactions to Gates’ memo both on the left and the right, I thought it would be helpful to provide a more measured reaction and critique, and give some thoughts how to move forward to – as Gates suggests – have the most positive impact on the world.

A zero sum game?

Bill Gates – through his philanthropic work with the Gates Foundation – has done more than almost anyone else on the planet to meaningfully improve the lives of the world’s poorest. The Gates Foundation was the founding funder of Gavi which helped expand vaccination in the global south and drive down prices. They did key work to help eradicate polio, combat HIV, TB and malaria, deliver sanitation and clean drinking water, and worked to raise smallholder farmer yields and income through access to agricultural technology.

The recent gutting of USAID – and smaller reductions in aid spending by other countries – is a humanitarian catastrophe and threatens to undo much of the work that the Gates Foundation supported over the past few decades. I can see why, in light of these urgent needs, he is suggesting that resources to combat climate change be repurposed toward dealing with poverty, hunger, and disease.

But this assumes that funding for climate and development (to use a term to encompass help improve the lives of the world’s poorest) are inherently zero sum. And here I think that, for the most part, Gates errs in his analysis – for a few reasons:

First, the vast majority of spending on climate mitigation worldwide is not in low income countries, and there is little reason to assume that cutting it would free up resources for development aid. The world spent more than two trillion on clean energy technologies (albeit somewhat expansively defined) in 2024, but the overwhelming majority of this was spent by middle- and high-income countries (e.g. China, the US, the EU, the UK, India, Japan, etc.) to build domestic clean energy, build transmission, buy electric vehicles, electrify heating, etc.

The idea that spending less on domestic mitigation would create more budget space for international development is fundamentally misguided. Its hard to imagine that the Trump administration will revitalize development spending based on savings from cutting domestic green energy subsidies. Both development aid and climate mitigation spending represent relatively small shares of GDP in higher income countries, and there is space for policy to be able to prioritize spending on both without trading them off against each other. It is much more likely that any reduction in mitigation spending will be repurposed for other domestic priorities – leaving the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world even worse off.

Second, there are a number of ways that technologies can accomplish goals of climate mitigation and development simultaneously. Solar and storage for electrification of more remote areas, clean cook stoves to reduce deforestation, technologies to reduce both outdoor and indoor air pollution that kills millions per year globally are a few examples.

That being said, we should take a hard look at international spending priorities for programs in the poorest countries which, in turn, are the least responsible for global emissions today. Here adaptation should be strongly prioritized, and restrictions around finance for some fossil fuels (e.g. natural gas development in Sub-Saharan Africa) that could help support greater clean energy deployment should be reconsidered. We should generally spend more than we are today on adaptation and development (though the two are strongly related), and mitigation should be less of a priority in low income countries.

Richer countries should be the ones taking the lead on emissions reductions, and paying a (green) premium that will help drive down the costs of clean energy technologies so that they can be cost effectively adopted by lower income countries. Indeed, thats largely been the story of our successes here to date, with countries like China, India, and Brazil adopting ambitious net-zero goals in part because they see the cost of meeting them as modest and not trading off against their development priorities.

Third, the idea that we should “spend less” on climate adaptation is a dangerous misunderstanding of the problem. There is no world where we don’t spend money dealing with climate impacts. Rather, our choice is between spending money now to, e.g., build a seawall, or spend money later to rebuild the city after it floods. Our choice here should be guided by the fact that adaptation in advance is cheaper than adaptation after the disaster. In other words, spending money today on adaptation is the cheaper option that will better promote health and welfare of the world’s poorest citizens.

Hedging against climate risks

In his memo, Bill Gates highlights the progress we’ve made on climate change to-date, noting that:

Ten years ago, the International Energy Agency predicted that by 2040, the world would be emitting 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. Now, just a decade later, the IEA’s forecast has dropped to 30 billion, and it’s projecting that 2050 emissions will be even lower.

Read that again: In the past 10 years, we’ve cut projected emissions by more than 40 percent.

This progress is not part of the prevailing view of climate change, but it should be. What made it possible is that the Green Premium—the cost difference between clean and dirty ways of doing something—reached zero or became negative for solar, wind, power storage, and electric vehicles. By and large, they are just as cheap as, or even cheaper than, their fossil fuel counterparts.

Gates is right that cheap clean energy represents a remarkable success story, and is one of the reasons why projections of future warming have fallen from around 3.5C a decade ago to around 2.7C today.

But focusing on these precise temperature outcomes in 2100 is problematically reductionist. Our emissions are just one of three factors that will determine the future warming of the planet (and we should remember that current policies represent neither a ceiling nor a floor on current emissions, particularly at a time when some governments are actively rolling them back).

Even if we knew future emissions precisely, the warming in 2100 remains highly uncertain. It depends both on the sensitivity of the climate to our increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations – the response of various climate feedbacks like clouds and surface reflectivity – and how the carbon cycle responds to both our emissions and the changing climate.

Due to the combination of these uncertainties, its possible that we think we are heading for 2.7C warming and actually end up at 3.7C (or even 4C+) if we roll 6s on the proverbial climate dice. And we won’t know precisely how sensitive the climate is (despite some recent progress) until its too late to avoid where we are headed.

This means that we should think of mitigation less as targeting (or avoiding) a particular certain outcome, and more as hedging against risk. We should do more mitigation – all things considered – than if we had certainty in the climate response because of the high damages associated with less-likely but still quite possible tail risks. Or as the late climate economist Marty Weitzman memorably put it, when it comes to climate change “the sting is in the tail”.

Gates is right to note that climate change “will not lead to humanity’s demise”, but I’d suggest that this represents a bit of a straw man. Outside a fringe community of climate doomers there are few who think that climate change could realistically threaten the extinction of the human race (though some folks need to be a bit cautious about throwing around the term “existential threat” willy nilly). As the climate scientist Steven Schneider was fond of saying, for climate change “the end of the world and good for you are the two lowest probability outcomes”.

But not being an existential threat does not tell us all that much, as almost nothing aside from a planet-killing astroid or (possibly) an all-out global thermonuclear war rises to that highest of bars. Every other problem humanity deals with – war, violence, famine, poverty – is not existential but is still critically important. This is more or less Gates’ point, that climate should be treated as one of many problems that we need to solve rather than an all-encompassing ur-problem. But by and large the majority of people and policymakers have been treating it as just that.

Green premiums and brown costs

Gates posits that society can best address climate change by working to reduce the “green premium” associated with clean energy technologies (this was more or less the central thesis of his 2021 book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.

The idea of the green premium is compelling. As noted earlier, a lot of the progress that society has made on reducing emissions over the past 15 years has come on the back of near-miraculously rapid declines in the cost of clean energy technologies. Cheaper clean energy in turn enables more ambitious policy adoption, as the costs of getting to net-zero emissions turn from astronomical to manageable.

But I’d suggest that it is somewhat incomplete, at least in its more straightforward interpretation. There is an idea that innovation and markets alone will necessarily solve the problem in the absence of policy interventions; that if we can just make clean energy cheap enough the world will sufficiently decarbonize to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts from climate change.

This may be the case, but it may not. Innovation cuts both ways – the success of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technology has drastically reduced the cost of natural gas and oil production. There are lots of resources going into producing fossil fuels more cheaply, and while I’m hopeful that the cost of solar, batteries, wind, nuclear, geothermal, and other clean energy technologies will fall faster there is no law of physics that says that it will inevitably be cheaper.

Hoping that clean energy will be absolutely cheaper than fossil fuels at a scale needed to decarbonize our energy system is a gamble – and one with loaded dice. There are real costs associated with fossil fuel use: from air pollution, from climate change, from local environmental damage. These are currently borne by the public and not by the companies producing fossil fuels. As long as the costs remain socialized while the benefits are privatized, the market alone will not lead to the optimal level of deployment of clean energy technologies.

This is where policy comes in: we either need to include the “brown costs” of fossil fuels in their market price (e.g. a carbon tax, something that has been not very politically palatable to date) or be willing to pay some ongoing green premium in cases where clean energy remains more expensive to account for the real costs of climate and pollution.

Policy also plays a key role in technology. The rapid and amazing drop in the price of solar energy over the last few decades has been driven to a large extent by government support of the technology. The free market may have done this by itself, but it would have likely taken many decades longer.

I don’t think Gates would necessarily disagree with any of this, but its an important rejoinder for those who assume that innovation alone is sufficient to address the problem.

The death of nuance

The reception of the Gates memo was an unfortunate reflection of our extremely polarized politics. Some climate advocates dismissed it as denialism or the second coming of Bjorn Lomborg, while those on the right (including President Trump) portrayed it as proof that the science was wrong and climate change was actually a hoax.

Gates tried at length and upfront to make his position clear that climate is a big problem and his interest is on near-term prioritization of resources, but most interpreted the memo through their ideological priors (many likely without actually reading it).

To be clear: Climate change is a very important problem. It needs to be solved, along with other problems like malaria and malnutrition. Every tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.

Our inability to have nuanced discussions about these matters is detrimental to the broader societal discussion about serious issues like climate change. The portrayal of climate as an all or nothing problem coupled with the US’s thermostatic politics (where control of government commonly switches between parties) is a recipe for a lack of clear long term action on climate or any other big societal problem that gets caught up in the politicized culture wars. While I don’t know how to change society to make science less politicized and to center the debate around the best solutions rather than the physical reality of the problem, a change is sorely needed.

Balancing future and present harms

Ultimately Gates’ memo is making that case that we need to set a higher priority on helping the world’s most vulnerable in a time when aid to them is being cut. I broadly agree. But I think that deprioritizing mitigation spending is not a very effective way to accomplish that goal, outside of the relatively modest amount of money the world spends today on mitigation in the least developed countries.

When there is an option to spend money already going to these countries in a way that provides the greatest benefits for the population even if it does not reduce (or even increases) emissions, we should probably do it. But the vast majority of the resources we spend on decarbonization today in middle and upper income countries will not magically be repurposed for international development aid if we deprioritize climate change as an issue. And deprioritizing climate change as an issue risks substituting near-term benefits for long term harms that are nearly impossible to reverse.

A world of unabated climate change will impact the poor most severely. Addressing it requires two strategies in tandem: prioritizing development and poverty alleviation to build adaptive capacity (and human flourishing), and reducing emissions rapidly in middle and upper-income countries to mitigate future climate impacts and drive down the cost of clean energy technologies so they can be more readily adopted by low income countries. Perhaps I’m unduly optimistic, but I think that society should be able to do both.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8mbB!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88bd9bdf-9b18-4376-a409-1323b51c6d9b_1358x1134.png",N,,2025-11-06 04:18:34.665700

Strategic Partnerships and Government Support: EOSE has secured strategic investments and government funding that are critical for its growth and development. The company entered into a financing transaction with Cerberus Capital Management LP, securing a $210.5 million Delayed Draw Term Loan and a $105 million Revolving Facility. Additionally, EOSE closed on the DOE Loan Facility, which provides up to $303.45 million in funding, subject to certain conditions. These partnerships not only infuse EOSE with the necessary capital but also validate the company's potential in the eyes of investors and the government. The support from the Inflation Reduction Act, offering production tax credits for domestically manufactured battery components, further strengthens EOSE's competitive position.

Weaknesses

Financial Performance and Liquidity Concerns: Eos Energy Enterprises Inc's financial health is a significant concern, as reflected in its substantial losses and negative cash flows. The company's reliance on external capital to fund its operations is a testament to the challenges it faces in achieving profitability. The recent financial statements reveal a net loss attributable to common shareholders of over $1.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025. This financial strain is exacerbated by the company's ongoing need for capital to support its ambitious growth strategy, which includes scaling manufacturing capabilities and expanding its product offerings. The financial covenants associated with its credit facilities, such as Minimum Liquidity and Minimum Consolidated EBITDA, add pressure to maintain financial stability.

Operational and Scale-up Risks: As EOSE transitions to its next-generation product, the Eos Z3 battery, the company faces risks associated with scaling up its manufacturing capabilities. The complexity of automating production lines and the need to ensure product quality and performance at scale present operational challenges. The company's ability to forecast related costs and efficiencies accurately is crucial to its success. Any missteps in this transition could lead to increased costs, delays, and potential reputational damage, hindering EOSE's ability to meet growing market demand and maintain its competitive edge.

Opportunities

Expanding Market for Energy Storage: The global shift towards renewable energy sources and the need for reliable energy storage solutions present significant opportunities for Eos Energy Enterprises Inc. The company's Znyth™ technology is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional battery systems. With the increasing integration of renewable energy into the grid, the demand for energy storage systems that can provide longer discharge durations is expected to grow, providing EOSE with a vast market to tap into.

Policy and Regulatory Tailwinds: Government policies and incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, are favorable for companies like EOSE. These policies provide production tax credits and funding opportunities for domestic manufacturing and infrastructure projects, which could significantly benefit EOSE's operations and financial performance. By leveraging these incentives, EOSE can potentially reduce costs, increase sales, and enhance its market presence in the United States.

Threats

Intense Competition and Market Volatility: The energy storage market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Eos Energy Enterprises Inc faces stiff competition from established companies and new entrants offering lithium-ion and other energy storage technologies. Market volatility, driven by fluctuations in raw material prices and supply chain disruptions, further complicates EOSE's operational and financial planning. The company must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to maintain a competitive advantage in this challenging environment.

Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainties: EOSE's financial stability and growth prospects are subject to broader economic

Once installed the new tech should boost the efficiency of green hydrogen production.

The technology, supplied by Ampt, uses string optimisers to improve solar power systems. These small electronic devices control the output of each solar panel and allow the overall system to perform at its best, even if some panels are shaded or underperforming.

By improving power delivery from the solar farm, Ampt’s technology enables Hiringa’s GEGHA project to more efficiently generate green hydrogen and ammonia – the core ingredients of a low-carbon fertiliser being used on the farm’s cotton crops.

The GEGHA project aims to make agricultural production more sustainable by producing fertiliser and hydrogen through a combination of solar power, battery storage, electrolysis, and ammonia synthesis.

It received $23.6m in funding from the NSW government and is located at Sundown Pastoral’s Good Earth cotton farm near the town of Moree.

The project integrates electrolysis more efficiently by using power management and storage technology to reduce energy losses. The 27 MWdc solar array and 30 MWh battery energy storage system provide a continuous, off-grid power supply to the electrolysers, which produce hydrogen for ammonia production around the clock.

“By delivering higher performance and lower costs, our string optimisers help make renewable hydrogen and ammonia economically competitive,” said Russell French, Country Director of Australia at Ampt.

“Green hydrogen and ammonia production places unique demands on power systems, and Ampt’s DC power management technology enables us to maximise solar generation and storage efficiency – [the] key to making production cost-competitive,” added Alistair Tippett, Head of Projects and Engineering at Hiringa Energy.

The process starts at the solar farm, which generates renewable energy to power the electrolysers. This produces green hydrogen, which is then used both to run farm machinery and to make low-carbon ammonia. The ammonia is used as a fertiliser for the cotton crop, replacing conventional fossil fuel-based fertilisers.

Once operational, the improved facility is expected to produce around 224 tonnes of green hydrogen and 4,500 tonnes of low-carbon ammonia each year, cutting up to 17,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions annually.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2023/09/shutterstock_1459390562.jpg",N,,2025-11-06 10:00:19.839480

Byrd has extensive experience in the environmental department, working as the director of Keep Victoria Beautiful. Before that, she worked as marine biologist for Texas Parks and Wildlife.

“I will be working in the Environmental Services Division, which covers solid waste, community appearance, Keep Victoria Beautiful,” Byrd said. “I’ll be leading the outreach programs for the environmental services department, so things like recycling and education, proper waste disposal. I’ll be doing some grant writing and working with different community partners and other city departments on some environmental initiatives.”

Her main priorities in her new role include proper trash disposal and community outreach. She was instrumental in implementing curbside recycling and reviving Keep Victoria Beautiful in 2019. She served on the board for six years, two as vice chair and last four as chair.

As a board member, she led community cleanups, organized volunteer work and environmental education.

“Increasing our engagement with youth, with the schools, is a big priority that we have, that I’m excited to work on,” Byrd said. “We have some grant money for waste diversion education, correct recycling and other efforts. We’re going to continue doing lots of education centered around proper disposal of trash and recycling.”

She added that the Waste Wizard tool on Victoria’s website is a great tool that tells people how to distribute their waste. In her role, she will promote the website and use it as an educational tool.

The Waste Wizard tool is just a small part of her education plan, as she continues to notify areas of their bulky trash pickup days, sharing when each area of the city can have their bulky trash picked up.

In working with Texas Parks and Wildlife, she saw the true effects of littering and wants to emphasize to the people of Victoria that it’s not just a beautification issue.

“Trash really needs to be disposed of properly,” Byrd said. “Your trash blowing around is eventually going to end up in the river, in a drainage ditch, or in a little creek that’s eventually going to drain into the river and potentially make it down to our bays and estuaries… There’s, proper ways to dispose of everything. On a broader scale, there are impacts to the environment, to the ecosystem, to wildlife, even down to your pets in your yard that might ingest something that they shouldn’t that blew into some kind of trash that blew into your yard.”

Clean water agencies and biosolids managers didn’t create PFAS contamination, but without a federal exemption, they could still be held liable under CERCLA. CASA is advocating for passage of H.R. 1267, the Water Systems PFAS Liability Protection Act, to safeguard agencies and ratepayers from costly litigation. Learn how you can support this critical legislation and help protect our sector.

Clean water agencies and biosolids managers are passive receivers of PFAS chemicals and are not responsible for their production or contamination. Despite this, our sector remains at risk of being held liable under CERCLA for PFAS contamination. This is because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) did not provide a liability exemption for our sector in its 2024 Final Rule, and Congress has yet to act to provide this critical exemption through legislation.

Without an explicit liability exemption, CASA agencies are vulnerable to being drawn into third-party litigation and forced to pay for CERCLA cleanup costs, costs that are ultimately passed down to ratepayers.

H.R. 1267, the Water Systems PFAS Liability Protection Act, provides clean water agencies and biosolids managers with explicit CERCLA liability exemptions for PFAS contamination. CASA supports this legislation, which is currently pending before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. It is essential that Congress pass H.R. 1267 to protect our sector.

To this end, CASA agencies are encouraged to send letters of support for H.R. 1267 to their congressional delegations using the provided template letter. Letters should be submitted between now and December.

Senate WIPPES Act Report Outlines Need

A new Senate report on the WIPPES Act (S.1092) underscores the importance of clear “Do Not Flush” labeling for non-flushable wipes, 90% of which are still entering U.S. markets without proper warnings. The report outlines the bill’s goals, expected impacts, and next steps as it moves closer to consideration on the Senate floor.

The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation has released its report on the WIPPES Act (S. 1092), which establishes a national mandate for “Do Not Flush” labeling requirements for non-flushable wet wipes and mirrors existing California law. In its report, the committee outlines the purpose of the bill, its provisions, and the expected associated impacts if S.1092 were enacted. Importantly, the report emphasizes the need for the WIPPES Act, as citing that 90% of the wipes products sold in the U.S. are non-flushable wipes and that proper labeling notifying consumers to not flush these wipes leads to reduced improper flushing as a means of disposal.

While the report notes that implementing the bill, if it were enacted into law, would cost the Federal Trade Commission $4 million over 2025-2030 based upon the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates, it states that the “compliance costs associated with S.1092’s labeling requirements are expected to be minimal. It is believed that such expenses will be outweighed by decreased operating costs for wastewater systems from reduced disposal of non-flushable wipes into wastewater systems.”

At the end of September, S.1092 was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar following the successful bipartisan markup of the bill earlier this spring. The action to place the S.1092 on the Senate Legislative Calendar represents a step forward in the process for the bill to be considered on the Senate Floor.

The Government Shutdown Drags into Its Fifth Week; Federal Workforce Furloughs Continue

The federal shutdown has stretched into its 36th day, surpassing the previous record of 34-days during the 2019 shutdown. Over the past month, Senate negotiations have remained stalled over health care subsidy extensions, while the House continues to be on recess. As federal workers miss paychecks and agency furloughs expand, the ripple effects are growing across the nation.

For more than a month now, the federal government has been shut down. The Senate has continually failed to pass the House-passed Continuing Resolution (CR), as Senate Democrats have been unwavering in their demand that a final CR include an extension for the expiring Affordable Health Care insurance premium subsidies. Meanwhile, the House has remained on recess. At the time of this writing, there are reports that rank-and-file Senate Democrats and Republicans have begun the early stages of discussions on what a policy “fix” could be for the premium subsidies issue, but it is unclear what a resolution could include. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has reiterated that an extension of the ACA insurance subsidies will require 60-votes to pass. This is important as it signals that Senate Republicans will not, at the time of this writing, do away with the filibuster as the President has suggested to resolve the impasse. This means that Republicans will need Democrats to vote with them to pass any future deal that is struck. Further complicating the shutdown saga and adding new sources of pressure to the issue is that federal workers have now missed their first paychecks, funding for popular social safety net programs risk lapsing, health insurance marketplaces have opened with increased premiums for some, and concerns of increasing air traffic delays as the nation approaches a busy holiday travel period later this month. Beyond these new impacts, the federal agencies continue to furlough employees deemed as ‘non-essential’ under shutdown contingency plans. At the end of last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency furloughed an additional 4,000 workers. These furloughs will continue to exacerbate the delays in federal agency operations.

Governor Hochul stated that ensuring ""energy affordability for New York consumers"" and that ""the lights stay on"" remain priorities.

The ZEC program, established by the New York State Public Service Commission in 2016, recognizes the four Upstate nuclear power plants for their zero-emission contributions. Following the 2022 federal nuclear production tax credit, any resulting benefits are required to be passed on to ratepayers. Constellation Energy, which operates the reactors at three facilities along the shores of Lake Ontario, will utilize the federal tax credit, leading to savings for the state’s electricity consumers and an increase in clean electricity production, according to a statement obtained by the Governor’s office.

Rory M. Christian, Chair of the New York State Public Service Commission, said that the ZEC program provides flexibility and that federal support contributes to New York’s energy stability while offering financial relief to residents. Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, stated that a balanced energy mix, which includes the existing nuclear fleet and federal tax credits, supports energy security and affordability. She also noted that these savings are relevant to the development of advanced nuclear technologies.

This financial update is part of a broader strategy by Governor Hochul’s administration to support energy affordability. The administration has implemented an Enhanced Energy Affordability Policy, redirected surplus funding to consumer protection programs, and adjusted plans for offshore wind transmission development in response to federal policy changes. These efforts are complemented by initiatives to expand participation in energy efficiency programs, particularly for low- and moderate-income households, which will receive an additional $132 million in annual funding, as reported by the Governor’s office.

Risks

Alan Haughie noted, ""OSB prices spent most of the quarter barely above variable cost, driven by sluggish demand, particularly in the Southeast,"" resulting in a significant year-over-year decline in segment EBITDA and ongoing margin pressures.

Management guided to a $45 million EBITDA loss for OSB in the fourth quarter, with total company EBITDA projected ""about $10 million lower than the sum of citing and OSB breakeven,"" according to Alan Haughie for the full year.

The South America segment is ""struggling with a sluggish economy, and its results are not fully offsetting our corporate overhead at the moment,"" posing a drag on consolidated financial performance.

Takeaways

Total sales -- Down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to an extended trough in OSB prices and soft demand.

EBITDA -- $82 million, noted as a significant year-over-year decline driven by OSB market conditions.

Siding segment revenue -- Up 5% year-over-year, mainly from a 5% increase in average selling price and improved mix, exceeding internal expectations and guidance.

Expert Finish product volume -- Up 17%, representing 10% of overall siding volume and 17% of siding revenue.

Expert Finish price realization -- Average selling prices up 12%, with the naturals collection launch materially contributing to favorable mix impact.

OSB segment OEE -- Overall equipment effectiveness reached 80%, an increase of two percentage points from the prior year.

Operating cash flow -- $89 million generated in the quarter, with $84 million deployed for capital expenditures supporting Expert Finish and Structural products.

Ending cash balance -- $316 million, with over $1 billion of liquidity including the undrawn credit facility.

Siding EBITDA guidance -- Full-year EBITDA expectation reaffirmed at $430 million, with Q4 revenue guided to approximately $370 million and EBITDA around $82 million.

Total company EBITDA guidance -- Full-year EBITDA now forecast at $420 million, reflecting a $20 million improvement from the prior guide, but $10 million lower than the sum of segment targets owing to corporate and South America factors.

CapEx guidance -- Total capital expenditure guidance is being reduced further due to deferred OSB projects and optionality afforded by manufacturing network headroom.

Managed order file -- Demand for Expert Finish outstripped available capacity, resulting in a managed order file until incremental production comes online in early Q2 2026.

2026 siding price increase -- Jason Ringblum said, ""we are really targeting the net somewhere between 3%-4% in 2026.""

OSB utilization rate -- Currently in the 67%-69% range, aligned with committed contract volumes rather than open-market sales.

Mill conversion strategy -- Management is evaluating a conversion of the Manawaki OSB mill to siding production, citing greater scale and likely improved capital efficiency over Holton; no near-term decision, with process extending several quarters.

Summary

Louisiana-Pacific (LPX 0.73%) announced CEO succession, with Jason Ringblum set to succeed Brad Southern in February, as the company highlighted the continuation of its transformation strategy. Management confirmed a 5% increase in siding segment revenue drove overall mix improvement, while consolidated sales and EBITDA declined due to continued OSB price weakness. Leadership identified Expert Finish as a key growth engine, supported by a strong managed order file and new capacity expected online next year. Despite muted OSB and South American results, management raised full-year EBITDA guidance to $420 million and reduced capital spending amid ongoing network optimization. The company revealed that price increases for siding are planned to average 3%-4% in 2026, and the decision timeline for a major mill conversion remains open several quarters due to less urgent capacity needs.

Aaron Howald clarified that current Section 232 tariffs do not impact OSB and siding imports from Canada, and ""the importation of some heavy equipment categories into The United States is less favorable than it is into Canada currently,"" providing a potential equipment sourcing benefit for Canadian projects.

Ringblum provided that the Manawaki OSB facility offers potential siding production capacity of approximately 400 million feet, a scale advantage considered in mill conversion analysis.

Management stated that, if housing demand rebounds faster than expectations, existing flexible capacity and shifts would allow rapid response, ensuring supply for both North America and South America businesses.

Ringblum reported that despite current market softness in new construction, the company continues to observe share gains in the repair and remodel segment and believes Expert Finish growth has substantial runway given ""our market share in that segment is tiny. Relative to the opportunity.""

Haughie confirmed, ""South American business is also struggling with a sluggish economy, and its results are not fully offsetting our corporate overhead at the moment,"" affecting consolidated profitability.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Brad Southern: Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As usual, I'll discuss some highlights from the quarter before Alan shares more detail about our results and updated guidance. After that, Jason, Alan, and I will be happy to take your questions. As expected, excited volume in the third quarter was flat. This result in a softening market, especially compared to the difficult comp from last year, reinforces our confidence in our ongoing share gains. 5% growth in Siding sales revenue driven primarily by price and a strong mix exceeded our expectations and guidance.

While we anticipated the normalization of demand in the shed component of our siding business, our expert finish pre-finish siding product, primarily designed for R&R applications, saw sales volumes increase by 17% year over year. The April launch of our expert finished naturals collection, which is a new line of nature-inspired two-tone colors, has contributed materially to a beneficial price mix effect. Expert finished accounted for 10% of overall siding volume, and 17% of overall siding revenue in the quarter, showing once again the power of smart site innovation to drive price, volume growth, and share gains. Inventory levels and sell-through rates held steady through the quarter.

Alan Haughie: Consistent with servicing seasonally normal demand levels. The only exception is expert finish, which remains in such high demand that we have implemented a managed order file until new capacity comes online early next year. Total sales in the quarter were down 8% compared to the prior year, and EBITDA of $82 million was also down significantly. The extended trough in OSB prices was the main drag on both metrics. We obviously cannot control OSB prices, but we can manage the OSB business effectively. And our teams did that exceptionally well in the face of what remains a difficult market. The OSB business achieved 80% overall equipment effectiveness or OEE in the quarter, up two points from last year.

Increasing OEE is never easy, and it can be particularly challenging when we are also managing our capacity with discipline to balance supply and demand. I want to congratulate and thank everyone on the OSB operations team who contributed to this impressive achievement. Our results are only possible because of our teams and the strong culture we have built. In the third quarter, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation was named one of the 50 best manufacturers in The United States by Industry Week, debuting on the list at number 24, and one of very few specialty building products manufacturers to be recognized. We were also named by Newsweek as one of America's most admired workplaces.

Finally, as you saw, I informed Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's board of my intention to retire this coming February after more than 25 years of service. It has been the honor of my career to lead a 4,300-person team. Ultimately, the job of a CEO is to build an engaged culture focused on safety, growth, innovation, and execution to deliver value long after he or she is gone. When we launched Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's transformation strategy, I was daunted by the challenges we faced and the aggressive goals we've set for value creation. I am proud to say that we exceeded those goals.

As Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's team and strategy have evolved, the magnitude of the opportunity before us has only grown, and our confidence that we can continue to execute our strategy and achieve our ambitious goals has never been stronger. Jason Ringblum and I have been friends and colleagues for over 20 years. He was instrumental in the development and execution of Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's strategic transformation. He led Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's OSB and EWP businesses for five years and for the last three led Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's siding business before being named president. This perspective makes him uniquely suited to serve as Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's next CEO. I have total confidence that with Jason, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's future has never been brighter.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Alan.

Alan Haughie: Thanks, Brad. Before discussing the results, I do want to take a moment to say that working for Brad has been a personal and professional highlight for me. And, while they may be tough shoes to fill, I can think of no one better suited for this task than Jason. And with that, slide seven of the presentation shows Siding's results for the quarter. As expected, the bulk of growth came from price. Average selling prices were up 5% with prime products up 3% and expert finished prices up 12%. And there were two mixed phenomena helping this along. First, as Brad mentioned, shared segment volumes normalized after a very strong first half.

And as I'm sure you'll recall, strong shed volumes have been a drag on prices earlier in the year, so part of the 5% year-over-year price performance this quarter is simply the lower mix of shed relative to primed and expert finished products. The other mix factor was within expert finish itself, where demand for Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's two-tone naturals and other higher-priced prefinished products drove outsized year-over-year price gains. This mix shift is also evident in the year-over-year volume column, which shows relatively flat volumes in total but within which prime volumes were down 1% and expert finished volumes were up 17%.

Selling and marketing investments, raw material inflation, and other factors were fairly typical, but there are some moving pieces in the other column that they're mentioning. You may recall that the third quarter of last year saw an unusually high EBITDA margin, in part because of delays in maintenance projects and the resulting inventory build. Impacts which then reversed in the following quarter. So much of what you see in the $20 million of other in this waterfall is the non-recurrence of those events from last year. Among them, inventory absorption is actually a double hit. I.e., we built inventory in the third quarter of last year, which boosted EBITDA, whereas this year, we've reduced inventory temporarily hurts EBITDA.

But in the long run, it's all just timing. Viewing the second half of the year in total simplifies the year-over-year comparisons considerably. The $2 million tariff impact is the retiree tariffs Louisiana-Pacific Corporation had been paying to import expert finish into Canada. Those tariffs were rescinded in late August, so we are not currently incurring that expense. Also, as I'm sure you're aware, the section 232 tariff announcements did not impact Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's OSB or siding manufactured in Canada and imported into The US. So other than minor tariff impacts on some of our raw materials, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation is currently bearing minimal tariff costs.

The OSB chart on Slide eight tells a simple if bleak story of soft OSB prices in a challenging demand environment. OSB prices spent most of the quarter barely above variable cost, driven by sluggish demand, particularly in the Southeast. Price realization fared somewhat better than expected due to a combination of the lag in contact oil prices and structural solutions mix. And while the small non-price variances mask it rather well, the OSB operations team played the hand they were dealt exceptionally well. Overall efficiency hit 80%, up two points from last year, and aggressive cost control helped the OSB segment outperform our algorithmic guidance.

Now superficially, this waterfall suggests that price is the only thing that matters in OSB. Perhaps a more accurate reading is that if price is this low, everything matters. I tip my hat to the OSB team for making the best of a very difficult market. Slide nine shows cash flow for the quarter, which, while straightforward, very much continues to reinforce the value of Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's transformation. $82 million of EBITDA translated to $89 million of operating cash flow after minor puts and takes for working capital taxes and interest. Solutions We invested $84 million in CapEx to support growth of Expert Finish and Structural as well as to ensure that our plants continue to operate safely and efficiently.

And after $19 million in dividends, we ended the quarter with $316 million in cash, over a billion dollars of liquidity including our undrawn credit facility. Which brings us to guidance on Slide 10. Regrettably, OSB prices have scarcely moved since the last call, so our fourth quarter OSB guidance has only slightly improved. The beneficial life factors that helped the third quarter have dissipated given how long prices have remained in the doldrums. So all else equal, price realization in the fourth quarter will likely provide less of a tailwind than it did in the third.

The resulting $45 million of EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter and breakeven for the year are, as always, algorithmic projections of current prices and utilization. For siding, we reaffirm our full year EBITDA guidance of $430 million. However, for the fourth quarter, the market has continued to weaken so we anticipate slightly softer growth. We still expect a year-over-year revenue increase in the coming quarter, but of about 3%, and this mostly from price. And much like the third quarter, we expect an outsized contribution from Expert Finish to both volume and price. We are therefore guiding to fourth quarter revenue of about $370 million and to EBITDA of about $82 million.

Now this slightly reduces our full year revenue growth rate from 9% to 8%. For revenue of roughly $1.68 billion while increasing our full year EBITDA margin guide to about 26%. Now our South American business is also struggling with a sluggish economy, and its results are not fully offsetting our corporate overhead at the moment. Therefore, total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full year are both expected to be about $5 million lower than the sum of the siding and OSB. Nonetheless, our expectation for full year total company EBITDA has actually risen by $20 million from $405 million three months ago to $425 million today. But we're also cutting our CapEx guidance.

There are two factors in play here. First, given the current emphasis on capacity management and cost discipline in OSB, we are deferring even more projects. In OSB. In siding, we're balancing steadily improving OEE and initiatives to optimize Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's entire manufacturing portfolio against the backdrop of persistent market softness. As a result, the sense of urgency that motivated Holton's expansion as the fastest route to additional capacity is now somewhat diminished. And this makes our OSB mill in Manawaki, Quebec a viable candidate for conversion to siding. An option we are now exploring.

So should we ultimately proceed down that path, it would most likely still provide additional siding capacity in advance of market demand, and would likely do so at a larger scale and with greater capital efficiency. So while we weigh these options, we have paused any further mill-specific spending while continuing the longer lead time mill agnostic investments. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. Our first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.

George Staphos: Thanks so much. I appreciate all the details, everyone. And know, I know everyone will say it. Congratulations, Brad and Jason, on the news, and we wish you continued progress and success in the next chapters. I guess the first question I had, Alan, if you could just give us a bit more detail in terms of the potential shift from Holton to Manawaki, what's behind it, you know, how will we ultimately see it one manifest itself versus the other in terms of operations and performance.

And the second question I had, you know, maybe more for Jason and Brad, there have obviously been some headlines in the last couple days about in the last couple weeks about, you know, marketing battles, some of your peers, extending relationships with some of the building products distributors to push product, that maybe is a more competitive backdrop. Would you agree with that? Does that, you know, change the way you market, or does that actually help you because your peers might have some other things that they're focused on relative to the siding business? Thanks, and I'll turn it over there. Thank you.

Alan Haughie: George, thanks for the questions. Before I we will address your two questions. Before we get to that, I've just realized that I did misspeak slightly in my prepared remarks a moment ago when I was describing the impact of LPSA on the full year EBITDA guide. In the fourth quarter, the difference between LPSA and corporate unallocated expenses is indeed $5 million. For the full year, as you'll note from the published materials that went out this morning, the difference isn't $5 million, but it's $10 million. And so just to be clear, the full year EBITDA is expected to be $420 million. Excuse me, or about $10 million lower than the sum of citing and OSB breakeven.

There's still an increase. On the preview guidance. Sorry. I've got a fog in my throat. Hold on. And now I'm gonna turn over the question on Manawaki to my friend and colleague, Jason.

Jason Ringblum: Yeah, thanks for the question, George. I'll touch a little bit on milk conversion options. I guess, when you think about it holistically, the beauty of our position here at Louisiana-Pacific Corporation is that we have multiple options. I'll go through those just quickly. We've mentioned them on previous calls, but you know, we have the opportunity to expand existing siding plants. So you know, imagine a line parallel to an existing line at a current siding plant. I also had the opportunity to convert additional OSB facilities in Aspen Wood Bass. So Manawaki, as Alan mentioned, is an option along with Peace Valley.

And then also the potential for a greenfield that would leverage sites that we own today in Wawa, Ontario, or Cook, Minnesota. With that said, what I would say is the decision on the next mill will really come down to timing. And capital efficiency really coupled with the network optimization benefits that any given option has the potential to add. So we're still assessing all of those options that I mentioned, but as Alan stated, you know, Manawaki has surfaced to the top here more recently just given the OSD market.

Then the second part of your just around the competitive dynamics, what I would say is generally, we have not seen a whole lot of disruption within the channel. I mean, this is the time of year where you know, new programs are being put in place. We're navigating RFPs with we're focused on our strategy and different customers. But, right now, we're just really trying to minimize the noise and continue to focus on gaining share.

George Staphos: Hey, Jason. Just a quick one. I'll turn it over. Aside from the fiber basket, for Manawaki, what else makes it potentially rise to the surface more quickly?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. So Manawaki is a large OSB facility. So it's got the ability to produce 600 million to 650 million feet of OSB, which translates to call it, 400 million-ish of siding. So just the scale and relative cost position of that facility coupled with just the network optimization opportunities that it presents will all be factored into the analysis.

George Staphos: Okay. I see. Let me turn it over. I'll come back. Thank you.

Operator: Standby for the next caller. The next call comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open.

Susan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And let me add my congrats to both Brad and Jason as well. Looking forward to working with you.

Jason Ringblum: Thanks, Susan.

Susan Maklari: My first okay. The first question is talking about the pricing environment in citing. You've traditionally announced an increase late in or sometime in the fourth quarter. For effective in early the following year. Just given the world that we're in and the varying dynamics around housing the consumer, how are you thinking about pricing as we look to 2026?

Jason Ringblum: Thanks for your question, Susan. I'll take that one. So as of, I guess, the last seven to ten days, we did announce a price increase very consistent with what you've seen us do in prior years. Along with that, we are managing our order intake to really minimize any sort of build in the channel in advance of our price increase. So you know, really, those orders that are placed throughout December and in our January order file will come at the new price list. So nothing unusual here. What I would say is increases vary by product category and geography, but we are really targeting the net somewhere between 3-4% in 2026.

Susan Maklari: Okay.

Operator: Thank you. And then turning to OSB, when you think about the environment that the builders are facing and the commentary we're hearing, especially from the big publics around pulling back on start to end this year and then even into early 2026. How are you thinking about balancing that capacity the near term pressures that are there relative to the longer term outlook for housing? And just adjusting the cost structure on a relative basis given those factors?

Jason Ringblum: Yes. So demand for OSB has certainly been soft for the better part of the year and as a result, our focus has really been on matching capacity to demand, no different than what we've done you know, in prior years where we've experienced soft markets. What I would say today is our utilization rate for OSB is in the high sixties. Which is essentially which essentially matches our committed volumes for the business. So what we felt is if we sell open market wood or bring cash wood to the market, largely, it ends up in lower prices. So right now, we're focused on really managing costs and optimizing our network relative to the demand we see today.

Susan Maklari: Okay. Thanks for the color. Good luck with the quarter.

Jason Ringblum: Thank you. Thank you.

Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ketan Mamtora: Good morning. Thank you. Brad, I wanted to extend my congratulations as well. I mean, it's been a remarkable transformation. This is a much company today. Than what it used to be even ten or fifteen years back. So congratulations.

Brad Southern: Thank you, Ketan.

Ketan Mamtora: And, Jason, look forward to working with you. Maybe to start with, can you talk a little bit about you mentioned shed volumes normalizing in Q3. Can you talk about sort of what you saw there in Q3 and what's contemplated by way of volumes as you think about Q4?

Jason Ringblum: So I would say, Ketan, and I'll take that one. I mean, throughout Q3, our order intake and sell-through rates were pretty consistent. In fact, I would say they held up better than maybe we anticipated given the broader softening in the housing and repair remodel markets. And I think that's a testament really to our commercial team and our focus on innovating around the needs of our end-user customers, specifically expert finish, smooth siding, naturals, as Brad mentioned, being great product additions that have helped offset the weakness in some of the market segments we play in.

Specific to shed, you know, what I would say is, yes, business has normalized in that segment, but we were up year over year. So we're very pleased with the progress we continue to make in that particular segment. And we see that continuing going into Q4 as well. Really, the softness resides more in the new construction segment, particularly in the southern markets. And we see a little bit more resilience in repair remodel especially in the northern markets where we have a more dominant share position.

Alan Haughie: Jason, I'll just add to that. Sorry, Ketan. I'll just add that historically, we've kind of seen a bit of seasonality in the shed business where our distributor partners and the shed builders tend to build some inventory in anticipation of spring and summer sales. And that kind of backing off as we get through the summer. And I think this what we saw seasonally in shed is pretty consistent with the historic trends that have driven our order file in the past.

Ketan Mamtora: Got it. No. That's helpful. And then just one more question. It seems like, you know, you are also sort of in the way you are selling sort of your siding products and your OSB products, it seems like there is some transition happening where you're trying to align both these products and select, you know, kind of more as a bundle. Can you talk to sort of you know, what is driving that move and what kind of reception you're getting with your customers?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. I'll take that one Ketan. Appreciate the question. So back in April, we announced the integration of our OSB and siding businesses. And really the main reason for that was to better leverage our resources and better leverage the breadth of our product portfolio in the marketplace. So you're right. We are working on some bundling of programs to help us execute our segment strategies in all areas that we play in. But I would say we're still very much in the infancy stage of that process. We've made some good progress in the big builder segment, but it's still an area we're exploring largely.

Ketan Mamtora: Got it. No. That's helpful. I'll jump back in the queue. Good luck.

Jason Ringblum: Thank you.

Operator: One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Sean Steuart with TD Cowen. Go ahead. Your line is open.

Sean Steuart: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'll extend my congratulations to both Brad and Jason as well. I wanna follow-up on the Manawaki pivot. Can you give us a sense of the timeline to at least start this project and when you think it might be producing siding product, and attached to that question, does the section 232 determination which exempts OSB and siding from Canada, does that factor into the decision at all? And I guess broader perspectives, the determination on section 232 sort of left it open-ended that the administration can consider changes to the assessments as time unfolds.

I guess the short question is, are you comfortable that this will be an extended or a permanent exemption for OSB inciting from Canada? I'll leave it there.

Aaron Howald: Yeah. Sean, this is Aaron. I'll take the 232 component of that question. I don't think anybody's comfortable that policies are current in the current administration, but I will say that the decision to shift to Manawaki, should we make it, will be a long-term decision based on our long-term expectations about the evolving OSB and siding markets. The current situation for the 232 tariffs is that neither of those products is subject to a tariff importing it from Canada into The United States. And perhaps a less understood component of the 232 discussion is that the importation of some heavy equipment categories into The United States is less favorable than it is into Canada currently.

So, for example, if we were to acquire a press or other large equipment for a conversion of an OSB plant in Canada, we would be able to import that equipment at a lower cost into Canada than into The US because of those tariffs. I would like to stress, though, that would be a potential benefit, but it's not a reason for the decision. The 232 issue is not the decision maker. It is noise that currently is a net benefit, but the long-term reasons for Manawaki, should we make that decision, would be that the fundamental market dynamics and the efficiencies that mill would bring.

Brad Southern: Sean, the way you know, the process is as you can tell, as we've gone you know, we try to be transparent on these calls and talk about the different options. And some rise to the top and then some fade from the top. And so it is certainly dynamic. But, you know, the evaluation that we do is financially driven long-term financial driven as Aaron said. And there are components that specifically to tariffs or you know, when you look at wood cost, you look at particularly network optimization. Manawaki is in a really interesting place for us when you align it with our existing infrastructure, including what we're doing around expert finish growth.

And so but as we continue to do the evaluation over the next several quarters, we'll continue to evaluate all options in the face of a good strong financial analysis. Then when we get ready to present to our board, you know, that's when the rubber hits the road around you know, crystallizing around one facility and being able to explain you know, from a return standpoint why that one was chosen. So more to come on that, but we did think it was worth mentioning Manawaki as a prime candidate or might perhaps the prime candidate right now given that we haven't talked about that much in the past.

Sean Steuart: Understood. And maybe just one follow-up there, Brad. I you know, part of this reordering of the options is the extent to which OSB markets unraveled here, the last several months. I mean, you've positioned this as it's a long-term decision based on optimization of the fiber basket, the portfolio you have, is there any read through on you view this OSB downturn as potentially extended beyond what we would normally see and you're considering Manawaki in that context as well, this could be a longer trough than we're accustomed to seeing for OSB?

Brad Southern: No. We were not intending to signal that at all. I mean, it certainly the, you know, the near-term outlook for OSB is pretty abysmal. But we believe in the business in the long term. Really, what put this one up was, as Jason mentioned, or I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the timing we were leaning on Holton because we felt that we could get there faster with a conversion.

And so when really, it's the overall softening in the housing outlook overall gave us say, another year of capacity in our existing network, which allowed us to take a step back and say, you know, if we're not as in much of a hurry as we thought we were in, six months ago, what are other options? And that's really when we started focusing in on Manawaki. Was not OSB related that drove that.

Sean Steuart: I can hear them. They're I cannot. No.

Operator: Okay. Great. I just want to double check. I'm gonna have them dial back in. If everyone could please stand by. Please stand by for a moment while we get everyone reconnected.

Brad Southern: Joe, can you hear us now?

Operator: Oh, yes. We can. Great. I can hear you. And, Sean, you're still there?

Sean Steuart: I am. I'm all good, guys.

Brad Southern: You can go on to the next. So you got so did you hear? I mean, that such a great it's probably the best answer of my CEO career, and I got cut off in the middle of it.

Operator: You're leaving on a high note. I think I got the gist of it. All good, guys.

Brad Southern: Thanks, Sean.

Operator: Stand by for our next question, please. The next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Mark Weintraub: I don't know, Brad. I don't know if he should ask any more questions after that. That high note. But congrats to all, of course. So maybe just a little bit more on the thinking on the Manawaki, Holton. So, I mean, your volumes this year aren't that different from what you were expecting.

So, I mean, it seems to suggest that you're taking a little bit more of a cautious perspective on next year, and, obviously, it's pretty early, maybe help us think that through a little bit and when you say several quarters, does that mean you're kinda thinking you it's like a don't need it for close to a year later than what you would have initially anticipated wanting the volume up.

Brad Southern: Marcus, really, the key driver is we were forecasting internally improving housing starts, you know, at a pace higher than the current forecast is. And so when we were looking at you know, I don't know the industry adding 75,000 to a 100,000 new starts each year, year over year over year. You know, that was that was got us on a path of sooner rather than later on this conversion. But as we've looked at the most recent starts forecast that we follow, they're it seems pretty flat or low single-digit growth year over year. So that difference in outlook for housing you know, has given us some degrees of freedom on timing for it.

I will say know, it's been really nice to see Segola operating at the level that it's operating at now, which has provided a good bit of near-term headroom on that. And so but I do feel like the I mean, I do I know that the reason we were able to take a breath on expediting a mill conversion is halting as we just looked at the housing forecast that folks are putting out there. And as we aligned with that, felt like we had another year of time to make a conversion. Versus being very rushed.

And, you know, rushed caused us to go to Holton because it would be the quickest, but it also rush would have significantly increased the capital expense too. So I think we're in a good place to where we still got headroom that we need if housing was to get stronger than forecasted, which we certainly hope happens. We feel really good about having options other than Holton, which will be a little more capital efficient for us.

Mark Weintraub: Super. And maybe could you expand a little bit on that in terms of capital efficiency recognizing you're still in the evaluation stage? But order of magnitude how much capital might be required for a Manawaki conversion? And, also, does this mean that your cap spend in 2026 is actually gonna be more reduced than maybe what some of us would have been thinking previously?

Alan Haughie: Great questions, Mark. None of which we're really in a position to answer with sufficient reliability or confidence yet. You'll we'll deliver more on this topic on our full-year earnings call in February.

Brad Southern: Yeah. Fair enough. Great question. Sorry. We're just not in a not in a position to answer.

Mark Weintraub: Understood. And then just last if I could. So with the Sheds business, obviously, it had been quite weak last year. Much stronger this year. You give us any sense as to, where the sheds business? And I recognize even you guys don't have perfect visibility on this. But your best estimate is where that business is now relative to kind of trend line? Or, I mean, did we have some catch-up this year so that there is downside risk to next year in a normal environment or is it more that it was just so bad last year, these this really strong growth just got us back up to what you'd consider to be? Kind of a typical year?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. I'll take that one. So what I'd say, you know, there was a fair amount of pull-forward demand in shed during COVID. So our business was very strong in those years, and to some extent, you know, we supported that segment to a higher degree than others while we were on a managed order file. That pullback that we felt in late 2023, 2024 I think, was a result of that. We've seen the shed business return back to normal levels. If not, maybe a hair better. A lot of the fabricators that we talk to are saying their business is up, you know, a couple points relative to kind of a normal rate.

So we feel good about that business, and, you know, it's been very for us through the years. And feel good about opportunities we have to improve our share position there as well.

Mark Weintraub: Thanks so much, and congrats both again.

Jason Ringblum: Thank you. Thanks, Mark.

Operator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from the line of Kurt Yinger with D. A. Davidson. Go ahead. Your line is open.

Kurt Yinger: Great. Thanks, and congrats, Jason and Brad. I just wanted to go back to some of the comments just around the fourth quarter Siding volumes. Could you just talk about I mean, what you're hearing from your customers? In terms of maybe a little bit of demand degradation? And then how you know, perhaps managing inventory levels and the price increase factored in if at all?

Jason Ringblum: Yes. Thanks, Kurt. You know, what I've I guess I said this earlier, but, I mean, the process is very consistent with what we've done in prior years. You know, we look at historical purchases, kinda where demand is trending, and then come up with allocations for our distributor partners. And then obviously work with them closely through that process. If they're communicating that they're gonna short a customer on the other end, by no means will we hold them to that allocation specifically. So it is pretty fluid in nature. With the end goal being not to increase channel inventories as we go into the New Year and work through a price increase.

So far, yeah, I think that's been well received. And, you know, there are customers that, you are certainly asking for more. But that's something that we closely manage on a week-to-week basis.

Kurt Yinger: Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking forward to 2026 a little bit, I mean, what areas of deciding portfolio do you maybe have the highest conviction or visibility to at this stage in terms of delivering kind of above market growth and continuing the momentum? And separately, from a marketing or channel standpoint, kinda what do you most focused on there in terms of you know, strengthening your position, with different channel partners and whatnot? Thank you.

Jason Ringblum: I'll take that one as well. Know, what I would say is, you know, we've got very focused segment strategies for new construction repair, remodel, and then off-site, which includes shed, and manufactured housing segment. And those are three segments that we will be relentlessly focused on improving our share position in. And we're investing resources in all three pretty equally, maybe a little bit heavier in repair remodel. But we feel like there's an opportunity to continue to take, you know, a half point to a point of share of the addressable market on an annual basis as we think about the future.

Operator: Okay. Standby for our next question, please. The next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Adam Baumgarten: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Finish, can you kind of update us on where margins are there? Especially with the managed order file currently?

Alan Haughie: Margins still have that there. Good, but they still have a long way to go. Under this current circumstances. So, again, I still see both outsized We've certainly had outsized price increases on expert So there's nothing but opportunity there.

Adam Baumgarten: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

Alan Haughie: Okay.

Operator: Thank you. Our last call comes from the line of Steven Ramsey. Steven's with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Catherine Thompson: Hi. This is Catherine Thompson in for Steven today. Thank you for including me on the Q and A today. Answered, you know, many, many good questions, but wanted to follow-up just on a few on expert finish and have been taking some share gains. But I suppose for the quarter and as you think about the year, can you parse out the drivers between channel versus winning shelf space and end market demand. And then against the second part of this is against a pretty challenging R&R market, how sustainable do you feel these market share gains are on a go forward basis?

Jason Ringblum: I'll take that one, Catherine. So we're very pleased with the growth that we've seen in expert finish after getting into the prefinished business. I think it was back in 2020. We are on a managed order file right now, but we have incremental capacity coming online at the '1, early Q2 next year. In the neighborhood of 50 million to 70 million feet. We believe that we've got a very strong value prop with our expert finish line and, you know, have only added to that with the naturals collection that was launched in April. And that repair remodel contractors really enjoy using that product. So we think the demand is sticky.

Obviously, you need to get the contractor to get placement in the channel with our dealer partners. That's really our focus going forward is getting downstream as much as possible to pull that demand through for our dealer partners.

Alan Haughie: Catherine, I'll just add to Jason's answer that the keep in mind that our market share in that segment is tiny. Relative to the opportunity And as our product gets accepted, as Jason mentioned, as contractors, get to use, and as you mentioned, as we secure shelf space with the one-step distribution network, There's just a ton of upside in our ability to continue to grow that expert finish line. And, you know, have a higher a much higher market share of a large repair and remodel market.

Catherine Thompson: Yeah. And do you need to step up marketing expenses next year to keep being that share gainer, or are there other ways beyond to increase stickiness?

Jason Ringblum: Marketing is a big component.

Alan Haughie: So you're gonna yours it's in it's in home selling. To consumers primarily And so as a you know, if you parse our sales and marketing budget, particularly the marketing budget, it is skewed toward support of the repair and remodel segment more than any other segment by a pretty large margin. But I think what you'll see next year in our budgeting will be consistent or with our guidance will be consistent with the kind of span we've had historically, especially if you look a percent of revenue or anything like that.

Catherine Thompson: And since you brought up distribution, given the ongoing changes and the landscape in The US are you seeing any type of behavior changes for you as a supplier to the distribution market given some of the fundamental changes in distribution?

Jason Ringblum: Yeah. I would say right now, know, we're very pleased with the partners we have from a two-step distribution perspective and that, you know, those relationships are on very solid footing and you know, we look forward to continuing to work with our partners, but no real significant disruption. No.

Catherine Thompson: Okay. Great. Thanks so much, and best of luck. And congratulations.

Alan Haughie: Thank you, Catherine.

Operator: Moment, please. One additional question comes from the line of Michael Roxland with Trist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Michael Roxland: Yeah. Thanks, Brad, Alan, Jason, Aaron for taking my questions, and I'll just echo what everybody else has said. Brad, congrats on your upcoming retirement. Well deserved. And, Jason, congrats on the new role. A lot of my questions have been addressed, but I just wanted to ask if you guys if you could give us some more color around volume growth by end market in terms of single-family R&R and sheds and manufactured housing in 3Q? And how should we think about Siding volume growth as we look into 2026? I know it was asked recently, but just trying to get a sense whether you think volumes will be flat, slightly up next year versus low single digits? Thanks.

Jason Ringblum: So I'll touch on the first part of the question. Just looking at Q3 versus prior year by segment, As I mentioned earlier, even though shed volume came off slightly versus Q2, It was up over year over year more than the other two segments. Repair remodel was second strongest, as evidenced by our performance in our expert finish business or line. And then single-family, I think it was a mixed bag.

You know, we had decent volume in some of our core markets, but in the Southern markets that are dominated a little bit more by the big builder know, and are stressed by some affordability challenges and just consumer confidence in general, we have that was our weakest segment in the quarter.

Alan Haughie: I'm gonna address the second question briefly. It's I think it's too early for us to make a sort of convincing call on 2026. As you know, we have pretty good visibility within a quarter and when we get to February, what we see within the first quarter behavior will, of course, color our view of 2026, at which point we'll provide some full-year guidance.

Michael Roxland: Understood. And then just one quick follow-up. If you see houses in rebound more quickly next year than you're now expecting, what levers do you have available to meet that increased side demand now that you're pushing out some of your capital projects?

Alan Haughie: Plenty of capacity. We can add shifts in existing facilities. So, yeah, we will have no problem responding to almost any imaginable demand scenario over the next couple of years. In either of our businesses or South America.

Michael Roxland: Got it, guys. Thank you.

Alan Haughie: Yeah. Thank you.

Michael Roxland: You're welcome. Thank you.

Operator: This does conclude the question and answer session. Would now like to turn the call back to Aaron for closing remarks.

Aaron Howald: Okay. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call. We'll look forward to continuing the conversation and follow-up calls later today and throughout the quarter.

The initiative is part of a broader effort to enhance energy reliability, support clean power goals, and expand investments across the region.

“We’re making a significant investment in battery storage because we see it as a critical part of Minnesota’s energy future,” said Bria Shea, President of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. “Batteries help us store energy when it’s inexpensive to produce and dispatch it when needed, allowing us to continue delivering reliable electricity to customers while keeping bills low.”

Key Project Components

The proposal, filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC), includes several major developments:

Sherco Energy Hub (Becker, MN)

Expansion of previously approved battery storage from 300 MW to 600 MW.

The Sherco coal plant, adjacent to the site, is set to retire by 2030.

Blue Lake Facility (Shakopee, MN)

Addition of 135.5 MW of battery storage capacity.

Sherco Solar Expansion (Clear Lake Township, MN)

Installation of a new 200 MW solar array, further strengthening renewable integration.

Construction Timeline and Technology

If approved, construction is scheduled to begin in 2026, with operations starting by late 2027.

The projects will use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology, known for its safety, durability, and efficiency. LFP batteries can deliver four-hour discharge cycles and recharge quickly, supporting daily grid operations.

These batteries will reuse existing grid connections, enabling storage and distribution of energy generated from Xcel’s wind, solar, nuclear, and natural gas facilities across the Upper Midwest.

Economic and Community Impact

The new energy storage facilities are expected to bring substantial economic benefits:

Sherco Projects:

Over 150 union construction jobs.

Approximately $200 million in local tax payments.

Blue Lake Project:

Around 55 construction jobs.

About $60 million in local tax payments.

“For half a century, LIUNA members have kept the lights on in Minnesota by building and maintaining Sherco coal units,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager, Laborers’ International Union of North America – Minnesota and North Dakota. “Now, we’re proud to help transform it into a clean energy hub—supporting Minnesota’s climate goals while sustaining local jobs.”

Federal Tax Credits and Cost Savings

The projects are expected to qualify for federal clean energy tax credits, which will reduce project costs and benefit consumers directly:

Blue Lake Battery: 30% cost offset.

Sherco Battery and Solar Projects: 40% cost offset (qualifying as an energy community).

Xcel Energy has committed to passing these savings directly to customers in the form of lower electricity bills.

Clean Energy Fuels’ recent earnings call conveyed a positive sentiment, highlighting significant financial growth and strategic advancements in renewable natural gas (RNG) production and downstream fueling segments. Despite challenges such as net losses and slow adoption in the heavy-duty trucking sector, the company demonstrated resilience and optimism for future developments.

Strong Financial Performance

Clean Energy Fuels reported a robust financial performance for the third quarter of 2025, with revenues reaching $106 million, marking an 8% increase over the previous year when excluding alternative fuel tax credits. The company’s adjusted EBITDA stood at $17.3 million, reflecting its strong operational capabilities and financial management.

RNG Production Expansion

The company made significant strides in expanding its RNG production capabilities by initiating operations at its two largest dairy RNG projects located in Texas and Idaho. This expansion brings the total number of projects in operation to eight, underscoring Clean Energy Fuels’ commitment to scaling its renewable energy initiatives.

Transit and Refuse Business Growth

Clean Energy Fuels’ downstream fueling business continues to thrive, with steady contributions from the transit and refuse segments. The company’s success in this area is bolstered by its long-standing relationships with key customers, ensuring a reliable revenue stream.

Hydrogen Fueling Station Contracts

In a strategic move to diversify its offerings, Clean Energy Fuels secured contracts to design, build, and maintain hydrogen fueling stations for Foothill Transit and the cities of Riverside and Ventura. This development positions the company as a leader in the growing hydrogen fuel market.

Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions Launch

Partnering with Cummins and Hexagon Agility, Clean Energy Fuels launched Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions, focusing on low-carbon heavy-duty vehicles. This initiative aims to promote the adoption of next-generation compressed natural gas (CNG) trucks, aligning with the company’s sustainability goals.

GAAP Net Loss

Despite its successes, Clean Energy Fuels reported a GAAP net loss of $23.8 million for Q3 2025, compared to a $18.2 million loss in 2024. This was largely due to the absence of $6.4 million in alternative fuel tax credits and $3 million in net incremental costs.

Challenges with LCFS Credit Prices

The company continues to face challenges with Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit prices, which have impacted segment profitability. However, Clean Energy Fuels remains optimistic about improvements in credit prices by 2026, which could enhance future profitability.

Slow Adoption of X15N Engine

The adoption of the Cummins X15N engine has been slower than anticipated, hindered by challenging freight rates and uncertain policy regulations in the heavy-duty trucking sector. This has posed a challenge for Clean Energy Fuels in expanding its market share in this segment.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Looking ahead, Clean Energy Fuels remains optimistic about its financial trajectory, with a strong balance sheet boasting $232 million in cash and short-term investments. The company has raised its guidance for 2025, driven by the sale of 61 million gallons of RNG and the competitive advantages of RNG, such as low NOx and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the company anticipates positive impacts from the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and ongoing projects with Maas Energy Works.

In conclusion, Clean Energy Fuels’ earnings call reflected a positive outlook, with the company achieving significant financial growth and strategic advancements in RNG production and downstream fueling. Despite facing challenges, the company’s forward-looking guidance and strategic initiatives position it well for future success.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Energy-7-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 00:02:08.247238

This marks a remarkable 78% increase compared to the same quarter last year, driven in part by a surge in deliveries. As a result, Rivian’s stock jumped 14% in early trading on Wednesday.

Despite the revenue growth, Rivian reported a loss per share of $0.65, which was better than the estimated loss of $0.71. However, the company posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $602 million, which was slightly higher than the $570.7 million that analysts had expected. Notably, Rivian recorded a gross profit of $24 million, ending a streak of losses and achieving its goal of profitability in this area after two consecutive quarters.

Additionally, Rivian maintained its full-year loss projection amid ongoing trade disputes and the discontinuation of the electric vehicle tax credits, which pose challenges for the business. The company reiterated its adjusted full-year EBITDA loss estimate for 2025, projecting a range between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, along with capital expenditures expected to fall between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion.

In a statement, CEO RJ Scaringe emphasized the progress made in the third quarter, outlining the company’s strategic objectives, which include the development of the R2 vehicle and advancements in their technology roadmap. He expressed confidence in Rivian’s integrated technologies and direct-to-consumer ownership experience, which he believes position the brand for success in both U.S. and European markets.

Earlier in the month, Rivian reported production of 10,720 vehicles and deliveries of 13,201 for the third quarter, aligning with expectations of a strong quarter. The company has also narrowed its delivery guidance for 2025 to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles, adjusting down from a previous range of 40,000 to 46,000. Rivian’s initial target for 2025 was set between 46,000 and 51,000 vehicles.

Central to Rivian’s anticipated sales growth is the development of the R2 midsize crossover, which is expected to launch in the first half of 2026. Rivian has reported that all production areas for the R2 are operational, with equipment installations for body shop lines completed, and plans to start manufacturing validation builds by the end of the year. Upgrades to the paint shop have further enhanced manufacturing capacity to 215,000 units per year.

Analysts have responded positively to Rivian’s announcements, particularly concerning the R2’s development. Dan Ives from Wedbush indicated optimism regarding Rivian’s long-term vision, noting the company is navigating substantial macroeconomic challenges while gearing up for the ramp-up of its R2 and midsize platform supply chains, as well as improvements in autonomous capabilities.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rivian-Stock-Surges-After-Q3-Results-Beat-Estimates-and-R2.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 07:23:17.170702

Heavy industry is the foundation of modern society. We need materials like cement, steel, and aluminum more than ever to rebuild our bridges and roads, construct wind and solar projects, and manufacture electric vehicles and heat pumps that will undergird our future. But industry needs a second revolution. For as much as industry made the middle class and ushered in a remarkable era of prosperity for many, it also threatens our climate, reinforces environmental racism, wastes valuable materials and energy, and leaves communities and workers behind.

At Industrious Labs, our mission is to set into motion unstoppable policies, people power, and analysis to make a triple impact on climate, justice, and jobs that drastically reduce dangerous emissions, and make industry accountable to communities and workers.

A Necessary Tool for a Changing Climate As wildfires grow in size, frequency, and intensity, their environmental toll is becoming impossible to ignore.","by Marcela Munoz, Director of R&D for Americas Retardants for Perimeter Solutions

The USDA Forest Service and other fire management agencies around the world have used phosphate-based fire retardants for more than 60 years to prevent the spread of wildfires. Over that time, fire retardant has proven to be an effective tool, helping firefighters to protect thousands of structures from destruction and to save countless lives. It has also helped to protect the environment from the far-reaching and sometimes irreversible damages caused by wildfires.

In this article we will examine more than 80 years of scientific research that has determined that phosphate is the safest, most effective fire retardant available. We will also explore the potential environmental consequences of not using fire retardants, and why tools like PHOS-CHEK® are more important than ever as we face longer, more intense wildfire seasons.

Independently Tested: Phosphate is the Most Effective Retardant

One of the earliest tests of chemical fire retardants took place at the University of Idaho in 1940.1 Researchers evaluated seven chemicals for their ability to reduce combustibility in sawdust using a modified fire-tube apparatus. Diammonium phosphate proved most effective, followed by borax, zinc chloride, and others.

In 1954, the U.S. Forest Service launched Operation Firestop, the first major study of chemical firefighting effectiveness.2 Conducted at Camp Pendleton, the study tested various chemicals for their impact on wood ignition time, fire intensity, and flame suppression. Ammonium phosphate was again identified as among the most effective.3 The results from these tests led to phosphate-based retardants becoming the industry standard, and PHOS-CHEK eventually became the first fire retardant approved for aerial firefighting. Less effective chemicals were discarded for long-term use.

Sixteen years later, University of Montana scientist Aylmer D. Blakely expanded on Firestop’s findings in his 1970 paper A Laboratory Method for Evaluating Forest Fire Retardant Chemicals. Using a “superiority factor” based on weight loss, burn residue, and heat radiation, Blakely ranked the effectiveness of additional chemicals.4 Diammonium and monoammonium phosphate, again, outperformed others across all parameters, reinforcing phosphate’s status as the most effective retardant chemistry and solidifying PHOS-CHEK’s position as the preferred solution.

A more recent study, conducted in 2022 and co-funded by Australia’s Department of Energy, Environment, and Climate Action (DEECA) and the Victorian Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions took a different approach, comparing the effectiveness of wildfire retardants against water alone, and an untreated control using four different assessment methods:

Direct suppression test: Determining retardant effectiveness when applied directly onto burning fuels like a suppressant.

Indirect suppression test: Examining the ability of retardants to slow or stop fire spread when applied indirectly onto unburnt fuels in the path of a fire front.

Longevity test: Investigating the ability of retardant treated fuels to resist ignition pressure from flaming point ignition sources over time.

Coverage level test: Comparing the ability of fuels treated with different retardant depths to resist flaming firebrands.5

The “indirect suppression test” was considered the most important in evaluating the effectiveness of retardant, because this is how retardants are typically used in battling wildfire. Two different retardants were compared to water and the untreated control, with effectiveness of each measured by its ability to stop or slow the fire spread, the percentage of the treatment area burned, and the change in fire forward spread rate within the treatment.6

Retardant treatments outperformed water and untreated controls in all fire resistance measures, with significantly lower area burned and shorter fire penetration distances. Retardant A consistently resisted fire spread more effectively than Retardant B, and penetration distance emerged as the most reliable indicator of performance.

The Case for PHOS-CHEK

Organizations have recently expressed concerns about the use of fire retardant to battle wildfire citing the presence of heavy metals in fire retardants. However, it is important to note that no heavy metals are intentionally added to PHOS-CHEK. The active ingredient in PHOS-CHEK is diammonium phosphate (DAP), which is used to make food products such as beer, wine, cheese, and bread. Exposure to PHOS-CHEK is minimal, as it is typically applied in remote, forested areas. Meanwhile, the consequences of uncontrolled wildfire are immediate, widespread, and well-documented.

To illustrate the scale of the environmental impact, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reported that global wildfires in 2021 emitted approximately 1.76 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.7 For perspective, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO₂ per year.8 This is equivalent to the annual CO₂ emissions of more than 382 million passenger vehicles. Notably, 2021 wasn’t even considered a particularly active wildfire year. It didn’t rank among the top 15 years for total burned acreage in the United States over the past six decades.

Added to the environmental challenges presented with CO₂ emissions, air quality concerns are heightened with the release of other toxins from wildfires. With the expansion of the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), wildfires are now threatening more urban areas, evident in the destructive Los Angeles fires of January 2025. The wildfire smoke from these urban fires is more dangerous than smoke from forest fires due to the variety of materials that burn, including vehicles, plastics, batteries, and building materials. When burned, these items release particulate matter and toxic chemicals, including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and other toxins that are dangerous to breathe.

One of the most concerning pollutants from wildfire is particulate matter (PM2.5), fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less are up to ten times more harmful to human health than PM2.5 from other sources.9

These particles can travel great distances as witnessed during the 2023 and 2025 Canadian wildfires, which led to low air quality alerts across the United States. Among other health ailments, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that the smoke from the 2023 Canadian wildfires led to a marked increase in the number of people being seen for asthma-related symptoms in New York City emergency departments.10 Meanwhile, researchers from Kidney International Reports found that the air pollution created by the wildfires resulted in increased risk of mortality and hospitalization among hemodialysis patients in the Eastern and Midwestern United States.11

Beyond the negative air quality impacts, wildfires also lead to large amounts of heavy metals being deposited in the soil and surrounding waterways, and these effects can last for years. Researchers from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) compared water quality before and after a wildfire event occurred and found that wildfires could increase the presence of many pollutants in water by two orders of magnitude. Nutrients and suspended solids concentrations increased within a year after the fire, while peaks in heavy metal contamination didn’t occur until one-to-two years following the wildfire.12

Wildfires also release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are semi-volatile organic compounds composed of two or more fused benzene rings bounded in linear, cluster, or angular arrangements. 13 They are absorbed into soil following a fire, due to the soil’s lower vapor pressure and higher hydrophobicity (its ability to repel water).14 Burnt ash from wildfire contains high concentrations of PAHs, a known carcinogen, which leaches into burnt soil. Erosion carries the contaminated sediment to nearby soils, deteriorating the soil quality, and PAHs then enter into crops through plant uptake.15

Stanford and Colorado State University researchers conducted additional testing on the effects of wildfires on soil chemistry, finding that they can impact water contamination and plant growth, and that they can also alter the chemical properties of metals in the soil.16 Specific to chromium, the report stated that there were higher levels of a hazardous form of chromium that are created as a result of a heat-induced transformation. Wildfires literally cook the soil, and this highly toxic form of chromium created as a result remains in the soil until the next large rain event.17

Other long-term environmental impacts from wildfire include increased flooding and water contamination from soil erosion, reduced carbon storage capacity due to vegetation loss, and lasting harm to ecosystems and biodiversity from habitat destruction and invasive species.

A Necessary Tool for a Changing Climate

As wildfires grow in size, frequency, and intensity, their environmental toll is becoming impossible to ignore. The damage caused to the environment is not short-term, they linger for years, affecting public health, biodiversity, and climate resilience.

Phosphate-based fire retardants like PHOS-CHEK are not only scientifically proven to be the most effective tools for slowing or stopping wildfires, but they are also a critical line of defense in protecting the planet from the much greater environmental harm that wildfires cause.

In an era of increasingly extreme fire behavior, we cannot afford to leave our most effective tools unused.

Regulated Chemicals Under the California bills, fashion sellers would be prohibited from selling covered fashion items that contain certain chemicals above specified thresholds.
Fines would then be deposited in environmental funds created by the proposed bills to fund environmental benefit or remediation projects.","In 2025, four state legislatures—California, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington—proposed fashion accountability bills. These bills would require high-earning entities in the fashion industry to monitor and report activities related to their supply chains, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, and chemical management.

The proposed bills are largely consistent on key provisions related to scope, environmental due diligence, monitoring and reporting requirements, performance targets, and enforcement mechanisms. If enacted, these bills will significantly impact due diligence and reporting requirements and have the potential to influence long-term business strategy in the fashion industry.

Scope

The bills target “fashion sellers” doing business in the relevant state. A fashion seller is broadly defined to mean any business entity that sells apparel, footwear, or fashion bags and whose annual gross receipts exceed $100 million. Notably, multi-brand retailers are included in this definition when annual gross receipts of all private labels under the retailer exceed $100 million.

Environmental Due Diligence

Each proposed bill would require fashion sellers to implement extensive environmental due diligence measures, including supply chain mapping and disclosure and risk identification and mitigation, in compliance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED) Due Diligence Guidelines. In practice, these proposed conditions would require fashion sellers to:

Monitor their supply chains throughout a product’s life, from start to finish

Disclose identifying information about suppliers and subcontractors over time

Embed responsible business conduct into policies and contracting practices

Assess and respond to environmental-related risks

All information related to a fashion seller’s due diligence activities would be recorded in a due diligence report and annually disclosed publicly, on the fashion seller’s website and to the appropriate regulator.

Reporting Requirements

As proposed, the fashion accountability bills would require fashion sellers to report their GHG emissions, water usage, and chemical management.

GHG Emissions: Fashion sellers would have to annually report GHG emissions in accordance with certain global standards.

Water Use and Chemical Management: Under the Massachusetts and New York bills, fashion sellers would have significant reporting duties related to Tier 2[1] dyeing, finishing, printing, and garment washing suppliers. Specifically, fashion sellers would have to sample and report wastewater chemical concentrations and water usage, report chemical inventory, and verify the supplier’s compliance with local chemical concentrations. If appropriate, the fashion seller would also have to report chemical concentrations of wastewater treatment facilities, report the percentage of their suppliers that have chemical remediation plans in place, and disclose their internal remediation plan.

Performance Targets

The proposed bills in California, Massachusetts, and New York would require fashion sellers to establish and meet short- and long-term GHG emission reduction targets. These targets would apply to scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and would have to align with relevant regulations and comply with certain global standards. Fashion sellers who do not meet their emission reduction targets would be out of compliance and subject to civil penalties, unless they are able to comply within the specified timeframe.

Regulated Chemicals

Under the California bills, fashion sellers would be prohibited from selling covered fashion items that contain certain chemicals above specified thresholds. The Washington bill would require reporting on products that contain priority chemicals.

Enforcement

Under the proposed bills, enforcement power is given to the state attorney general and certain state agencies (together “Regulators”). Regulators would be responsible for investigating and enforcing each bill. If the Regulators find that a fashion seller is non-compliant or otherwise violates the bill, civil fines would be imposed. Depending on the jurisdiction, these fines could be up to 2 percent of the fashion seller’s annual revenue, $15,000 per day per violation, or $10,000 per violation. Fines would then be deposited in environmental funds created by the proposed bills to fund environmental benefit or remediation projects.

Conclusion

If enacted, the proposed bills will impose significant due diligence responsibilities on the fashion industry. We will continue to monitor this issue in 2026 because the 2025 legislative sessions in California, New York, and Washington have now closed. The Massachusetts legislative session adjourns on November 19.",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1762377217/201351.png,N,,2025-11-05 20:03:05.170100

THAKORE: In a grassy field near the Denver Airport, Hank Price is showing off a massive, roughly three-story collection of curved mirrors. It's called the SunBeam, and it's a demo for a technology called concentrating solar power.

PRICE: This is a low-cost way of making solar power at night.

THAKORE: Price says the SunBeam is different from your average solar farm. It uses the sun to generate heat, which can be stored to make electricity later, even after dark.

PRICE: You can design power plants that collect energy during the day and produce power just at night or produce power 24 hours a day.

THAKORE: Price's company, Solar Dynamics, has had contracts with the federal government for years, including during the first Trump administration. But in early October, the Department of Energy canceled two of his biggest grants. That's a huge hit for his business.

PRICE: I think it's very likely we'll shut down, unfortunately. Unless something changes...

THAKORE: ...Price and his 10 employees are probably out of a job. Their projects are among the 223 across the country that the DOE says it's canceled. Those included everything from building major new transmission lines to research on newer technologies like carbon capture. Most were approved during the Biden administration. Many were funded by major climate legislation or the bipartisan infrastructure law. The DOE did not respond to questions for this story, but in a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the projects do not, quote, ""adequately advance America's energy needs."" Here's Wright on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: These decisions are made - business decisions - on whether it's a good use of the taxpayer money or not.

THAKORE: Hank Price disagrees.

PRICE: We see this as providing a reliable, affordable, dispatchable domestic energy source. How's that not supporting America's energy needs?

THAKORE: Ken Gillingham is an economics professor at the Yale School of the Environment. He said government grants like these support innovations that may later become widely successful.

KEN GILLINGHAM: The whole point is to find technologies that are not commercially viable now and give them the support they need to become commercially viable.

THAKORE: Not all of the projects would have worked out, Gillingham says, but U.S. government funding has led to huge breakthroughs, like the first nuclear reactor. Some canceled grant recipients say their projects are well aligned with the Trump administration's goals, like supporting fossil fuel production. Dan Zimmerle runs a center at Colorado State University. It helps oil and gas companies cut their pollution.

DAN ZIMMERLE: We work every day with oil and gas operators, and they're getting value from that.

THAKORE: His team helps companies find natural gas leaks, which helps the environment and their bottom line. But he was informed his center's main funding was cut, apparently because of a change in priorities. That's a first, he says.

ZIMMERLE: It's now 14 years of working with the Department of Energy on projects, through multiple administration changes.

THAKORE: Recipients like Zimmerle and Price are now scrambling to make up the funding. They have a short window to appeal their cancellations. Back outside Denver, Price and his co-founder say giving up on projects like theirs - it means countries like China will fill the void.

PRICE: America really has been a world leader in technology, and now we just give up. We're throwing it all away, you know? That's unfortunate.

THAKORE: Building the company, though? They said it's been a heck of a ride. For NPR News, I'm Ishan Thakore in Watkins, Colorado.

President Trump's claim of unilateral power to impose tariffs across the globe hit a wall of skepticism at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Over the course of an argument that lasted almost three hours, both the court's conservatives and liberals seemed doubtful about the legal authority underpinning Trump's signature economic policy.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer, representing Trump, was first up to the lectern, telling the court that Trump imposed the tariffs to deal with two dire emergencies: a persistent trade imbalance and the flood of fentanyl entering the United States.

But the justices were openly doubtful about the president's claim that he has the power to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, known as IEEPA, a statute that, as Chief Justice John Roberts observed, says nothing about tariffs.

Sauer replied that the statute's terms are ""capacious,"" not restrictive, and that Trump has inherent authority as president, under the Constitution, to deal with these national security and foreign affairs threats.

Roberts acknowledged that tariffs involve foreign affairs. But he noted that the statute, as interpreted by Trump, imposes taxes on Americans, and taxes have always been ""the core power of Congress.""

Under your theory, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, President Biden could have declared an emergency under global warming, and that would have been enough to justify his environmental policy.

And Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked, ""Can you to point to any other place in the code or any time in history where the phrase…'regulate importation' [the words in the statute] has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?""

When Sauer repeated that emergency situations justify the Trump tariffs, Justice Elena Kagan replied caustically, ""It turns out, we're in emergencies…all the time, about, like, half the world.""

Justice Neil Gorsuch posed perhaps the most vociferous challenge to the solicitor general, contending that the president's position in essence, could cover anything, including the power to declare war specifically given to Congress in the Constitution.

""You're saying inherent authority in foreign affairs, all foreign affairs, to regulate commerce, duties, and tariffs and war. Its inherent authority all the way down, you say. Fine,"" he said. ""Congress decides tomorrow, well, we're tired of this legislating business. We're just going to hand it all off to the president. What would stop Congress from doing that?""

Sauer replied that the court in past opinions has said that the president's powers apply with ""much less force, more limited force.""

Indeed, he said that Congress can always change the law, and take back the power he claims it ceded under the IEEPA statute. But Gorsuch wasn't buying the argument, noting that even if Congress passed a new law, the president could veto it, and it would take a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate to override the veto and prevail.

""As a practical matter,"" said Gorsuch, that would be impossible. ""Congress can't get its power back once it is handed over to the president.""

Next up to the lectern was lawyer Neal Katyal, representing those challenging the Trump tariffs. He noted that IEEPA has been in existence for 50 years and no other president has ever claimed that the statute grants him such unilateral power. Katyal got some tough questions from the justices, particularly about why the words in the law calling for the regulation of imports and licensing fees are not tariffs.

But the hardest question came from Justice Barrett, and that was about how to return the billions of dollars already paid by U.S. businesses in order to comply with the Trump tariffs.

""If you win, tell me how the reimbursement would work,"" asked Barrett. You said before that ""the government promised reimbursement…How would that work? It seems to me like it could be a mess.""

Katyal said there would be a variety of options, prompting this from Barrett: ""So a mess.""

A decision in the case could come more quickly than usual because both sides asked the court to expedite consideration of the case.

“Addressing Austin’s most complex civic challenges requires connecting research and innovation directly to the people we serve,” said Daniel Culotta, assistant director at Austin Budget and Organizational Excellence.
Related stories: Living for the City: Municipal Impact Driven by World-Class Research Austin’s Power Couple","The City of Austin has renewed and expanded a partnership with The University of Texas at Austin, strengthening a now proven model that connects University research with community needs. During the next five years, the city is authorized by City Council to invest up to $12 million to continue the collaboration — originally launched in 2020 — and extend it to five additional Central Texas institutions: Austin Community College, Concordia University Texas, St. Edward’s University, Huston-Tillotson University and Texas State University.

Since its inception, the UT-City partnership has launched nearly 60 projects that are turning research into practical results for Austinites — advancing work in climate resilience, transportation safety, public health, housing and more. Together, UT and the City have streamlined project administration through a master Interlocal Agreement (ILA), reducing contracting time and making it easier for researchers and city staff to collaborate.

“The successes and insights gained over the last five years have delivered measurable outcomes and opened the doors for an expanded ecosystem,” said Charles Purma, Program Manager for the City of Austin. “Our partnership is driving significant benefits across research advancement, operational efficiency, policy innovation and community impact.”

City leaders say the expanded alliance marks an important next step in regional collaboration — uniting a wide range of academic expertise to address complex civic challenges through data-driven, interdisciplinary approaches. Already, other cities and agencies have expressed interest in replicating Austin’s model, which has emerged as a compelling example of how research partnerships can accelerate municipal innovation and improve community outcomes.

According to the City of Austin, standout projects include:

Upgraded Emergency Preparedness and Guidance

UT researchers Lucy Atkinson and Junfeng Jiao are leading a three-phase interdisciplinary project exploring how artificial intelligence can deliver real-time emergency guidance across multiple languages, particularly for residents whose primary language is not English or Spanish. Across three studies, the team is testing which message strategies are most effective at engaging audiences and promoting disaster preparedness and response.

Atkinson, an associate professor in the Stan Richards School of Advertising & Public Relations, contributes expertise in communication and AI strategy, while Jiao, an associate professor in the School of Architecture and director of UT’s Ethical AI research traineeship program, is developing the chatbot technology as part of the Good Systems Grand Challenge. Following data collection completed in February 2025, the team expects to finalize the AI chatbot by year’s end, pending city approval for integration into Austin’s emergency preparedness system.

Traffic Tech for Safer Intersections

Led by Natalia Ruiz Juri of the Center for Transportation Research, UT researchers partnered with the City of Austin to evaluate how advanced computing and video analytics can improve intersection safety. Using traffic camera footage, the team compared the accuracy of several emerging technologies for detecting vehicles, pedestrians and bicycles, and assessed their ability to identify safety risks such as near misses and red-light violations.

The project supported Austin’s Vision Zero goals — eliminating traffic-related fatalities — by revealing patterns in pedestrian movement and developing a framework to guide future technology-based traffic safety assessments, helping make Austin’s streets safer for everyone.

Forecasting and Preparing for Extreme Austin Weather

Created in 2023, the UT-City CoLab connects the City of Austin’s need for timely, actionable climate data with research expertise across geosciences, engineering, public affairs and planning. Led by Dev Niyogi, Patrick Bixler, Tim Keitt and Sergio Castellanos, the CoLab brings together city experts on climate adaptation and resilience; UT researchers from the Jackson School of Geosciences, LBJ School of Public Affairs, School of Architecture, College of Natural Sciences and the Cockrell School of Engineering; and local communities to integrate cutting-edge science with practical and evidence-based strategies for resilience.

Since its inception, the CoLab has updated Austin’s long-term climate projections, launched seasonal outlooks for summer and winter, and provided critical data to help city departments plan for and respond to extreme weather. Now in its third year, with sustained City funding and new research investments, the CoLab is advancing projects on forest health and wildfire risk, integrating climate data into building codes, developing and testing scenario planning tools for infrastructure and community health, and studying how “cooling corridors” can reduce heat impacts.

Together, these efforts advance the City’s resilience goals and help translate University research into real-world climate solutions for Austin’s future.

Data-Driven Solutions To Improve Homeless Services

Sherri Greenberg, a professor of practice at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, worked with the City of Austin’s Downtown Austin Community Court (DACC) to assess the design, implementation and outcomes of its homeless services program, Intensive Case Management, which has reduced repeat interactions with the justice system among the population it serves.

The DACC uses a person-centered, housing-focused case management model to help people experiencing homelessness achieve long-term stability. Greenberg and DACC also co-developed a sustainable, scalable community platform to improve access to legal, mental health and substance use services while equipping service providers with better data to support lasting change.

Currently in early planning stages, the second phase of this project will evaluate and enhance DACC’s federally funded Mobile Court initiative, which runs through 2028.

Ecological Stewardship at Balcones Canyonlands Preserve

Since 2021, College of Natural Sciences research scientist Ed LeBrun has helped support the City of Austin’s obligations under the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan by addressing the threat of invasive tawny crazy ants to endangered species and sensitive habitats within the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve, a 33,000-acre system of preserves. Funded jointly by the City of Austin and Travis County, the project evaluates the ants’ impacts on endangered karst invertebrates and golden-cheeked warblers, tests biological control methods, and develops management strategies to protect native ecosystems. In addition to advancing understanding of tawny crazy ant ecology, the work provides critical data and training for City staff, helping inform long-term conservation and land management efforts.

The project also aligns with the City’s Strategic Direction 2023 goals (adopted in 2018) to sustain Austin’s parks, open spaces and urban trail networks through evidence-based environmental stewardship.

Understanding the Neighborhood Impacts of Austin’s Land Use Policy Changes

Led by associate professor Herschel Thomas from the LBJ School of Public Affairs, researchers worked with the City of Austin to study how recent land use policy changes — including the HOME 1 and HOME 2 initiatives — are reshaping the city’s neighborhoods. The project is evaluating how these policies affect housing production, affordability, demographic composition and neighborhood mobility, with a focus on understanding who benefits and who may be displaced as Austin grows. By comparing Austin’s experience with that of similar cities, the research aims to help city officials assess the effectiveness of land use reforms and develop a framework for ongoing evaluation. This work builds on the city’s Strategic Housing Blueprint and decades of rapid urban change, providing critical insight into how zoning and development policies can better support affordable housing for all residents.

Looking Ahead: The Next Chapter in a Proven Partnership

To celebrate the partnership’s achievements and chart the course for the future, a University Partnership Showcase is planned for December on UT’s main campus. The event will bring together representatives from all partner universities and highlight standout projects.

This will be the first time all partners gather publicly, marking a new chapter in regional collaboration. As the ecosystem grows, so does the potential for transformative impact across the region.

“Addressing Austin’s most complex civic challenges requires connecting research and innovation directly to the people we serve,” said Daniel Culotta, assistant director at Austin Budget and Organizational Excellence. “By grounding this expanded partnership in an approach intentionally focused on municipal purpose and residents, we’re not just generating new ideas — we’re translating them into sustainable products, services and policies that cities can adopt to deliver better outcomes for all.”

As China’s “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” agenda enters its fifth year, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and the International Society for Energy Transition Studies (ISETS) conducted their annual expert survey to systematically summarise current progress and assess future trends. For the fourth annual edition of CREAʼs Chinaʼs Climate Transition Outlook, CREA surveyed a pool of 68 experts representing diverse specialisations in the fields of climate and energy. The survey targets experts, scholars, and practitioners to compare data since 2022, capture changes across key sectors and critical issues, and provide evidence-based insights and decision-making support for China’s “dual carbon” strategy.

The survey’s key findings include:

More than two-thirds (69%) of experts believe China will significantly or partly overachieve its new climate targets for 2035, which aim to reduce emissions by 7-10% compared to peak levels, showing China can indeed achieve much higher reductions.

Yet, uncertainty about China’s short-term energy transition and industrial decarbonisation has increased following the announcement of the conservative 2035 NDC targets, amid economic uncertainties and geopolitical volatility.

Although emissions have fallen since March 2024, experts are less certain that China will peak in 2025, expecting a peak later in 2028. This also reflects the reluctance of the government to adopt a peaking year for its 2035 targets and could leave more room for emissions to grow.

Still, the majority of experts (99%) are confident that China will achieve its 2030 targets, implying no emissions growth over the coming five years. That’s even as the country is currently far off track for its interim 2025 targets on carbon intensity and controlling coal consumption growth.

The majority (80%) of experts believe that emissions in the steel and cement sectors have already peaked or will do so before 2030, despite a lag in China’s steel decarbonisation.

Despite economic uncertainties, experts are more confident that the current and future domestic economic and geopolitical environment will accelerate the short-term energy transition and strengthen the importance of the dual carbon goals, highlighting the importance of clean energy sectors for the economy.

Electricity bills are expected to be a key focus in next year’s midterm elections.
Power prices nationwide have increased 5.1 percent over the past year, outpacing inflation, according to the latest government data.
“Affordability was a big issue, and every ad she ran on prices she talked about energy prices,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told POLITICO.
The president entered the White House with a promise to cut electricity prices in half.","That has given Democratic candidates an opening to pummel the GOP on affordability. And for now, voters appear to be listening.

“Electricity prices were a huge issue in Virginia and New Jersey,” said Neil Chatterjee, a Republican who chaired the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Trump’s first term. He also noted the drawbacks of the president’s decision to replace the GOP’s traditional “all of the above” energy messaging with an all-out attack on wind and solar power.

“If we’re gonna win the AI race and keep prices affordable we need all the electrons,” Chatterjee said. “All of the actions to cut clean energy make no sense and it’s totally counterproductive and voters took notice. There is plenty of time for Republicans to reverse course. But they need to get to it ASAP.”

Republican lawmakers acknowledged that surging power prices contributed to Democrats’ successes and said the GOP needs to push its own response.

“They [Democrats] pounded a message of affordability,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who is up for reelection in 2026. “And that’s a message that we’ve been working on.”

Though high power bills “definitely” played a role in Tuesday’s Democratic wins, she added that gasoline prices have fallen.

Electricity bills are expected to be a key focus in next year’s midterm elections. Power prices nationwide have increased 5.1 percent over the past year, outpacing inflation, according to the latest government data.

A poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research last month found electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36 percent of U.S. adults.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a moderate who is retiring rather than face reelection next year, downplayed the role of energy prices in an election that included only a few statewide races. But he warned Trump’s policies to phase out tax credits for solar and wind projects and impose permitting hurdles for renewable energy will lead to higher prices in the coming years.

“I do think we’ve got to look out,” Tillis said. “It’s two or three years before you’d see the bulk of it [further price increases], but we’ve got to get that right.”

Democrats on Tuesday won marquee gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, where moderates Abigail Spanberger and Rep. Mikie Sherrill both made affordability concerns and skyrocketing electricity bills central to their campaigns.

Power prices in Virginia — home to the nation’s highest concentration of data centers — have surged 13 percent in the past year, while New Jersey’s prices climbed 21 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. Both states have seen plans for huge new wind farms threatened by the Trump administration’s opposition to the technology.

Former Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee called the election results a “referendum” on Trump’s energy policies.

“This is clearly a rejection across the country,” he said. “And all these races had one thing in common: Every Democrat was running against the Trump exposure to Americans with higher electrical bills.”

In Virginia, Spanberger promised to ensure data centers are paying their share of the power costs, while pursuing a generation mix that includes solar energy, offshore wind and nuclear power. A recent study showed power customers there had already shouldered $2 billion in extra power grid costs from those data centers.

“Affordability was a big issue, and every ad she ran on prices she talked about energy prices,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told POLITICO. “So it did play a role.”

Sherrill similarly ran on a promise to freeze rates, bring in cleaner power generation and tie concerns about rate hikes to the utility grid operator. In her victory speech, Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on her first day to drive down utility costs.

“It’s all about affordability,” said Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), who called utility rates a “big” issue in both the Virginia and New Jersey races. “It all fits into the affordability framework where there’s an increasing awareness among the American people that Trump is blowing it.”

In Georgia’s contests for two seats on the Public Service Commission that regulates utility bills, two Democrats — Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson — defeated Republican incumbents by calling for a transition to renewable power and guardrails around data center growth. Their wins were the first for Democrats in a Georgia non-federal statewide election in nearly two decades.

Hubbard told POLITICO ahead of the results that voters are keenly aware they’re paying too much and are frustrated by it.

“I’m benefiting from the fact that people are motivated to take action, especially with the incredible amount of nonsense coming out of the Trump administration,” he said.

“This is something where they can have agency and can take action to improve their lives at the state level.”

Georgia has emerged as a top solar power state in recent years, ranking No. 7 in the nation, according to the Solar Energies Industry Association.

Ahead of Election Day, Trump made repeated calls for voters to cast their ballots for Republicans if they wanted to see lower energy costs.

The president entered the White House with a promise to cut electricity prices in half. Since taking office, he’s pushed to grow production of oil, natural gas and coal while blocking new wind and solar development — energy sources the administration has derided as unreliable and sought to blame for rising electricity prices.

And while the factors behind electricity bills are complex and vary by state, the prices have exacerbated the inflation that has driven up overall costs. And experts predict electricity demand will surge in the coming years as technology companies rush to build a fleet of new data centers for artificial intelligence. That’s helped elevate utility bills to a political status typically reserved for gasoline prices.

“The issue of energy prices has taken on a different level of political attention,” said Jason Grumet, the CEO of the American Clean Power Association. “For years and years, gasoline prices had been understood to be a political issue. I think this is the first time we’re seeing electricity prices become a top three political issue.”

Some Republicans, however, dismissed Tuesday’s results as simply Democrats finding success motivating their voters in blue-leaning states, rather than dissatisfaction with Trump.

“The political class can’t help itself in reading whatever they want to read in election results, and we are certainly seeing that in the attempt to take away lessons about the electorate’s concern over electricity and energy prices. But that doesn’t seem to be a takeaway for this White House,” one person in the oil and gas industry, who interacts with the administration and was granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, told POLITICO.

However, that person also conceded that concerns over the local impact of data centers in Virginia is a lesson for Republican lawmakers.

“I do think that the concerns over electricity demand provide an opening to mitigate some of the aggressiveness against solar and wind — with Republicans on the Hill,” the person said. “But I don’t expect a quiet revolt against the aggressively negative views of offshore wind coming from the White House.”

Republican Sen. Jon Husted of Ohio, who is expected to face a tough reelection race next year, argued that energy prices are being driven up by an inadequate supply of affordable energy, whether that is gas and diesel or electricity.

“The Democrats’ Green New Deal policies, closing all of these power plants, have been at the core of what is driving the supply-demand failure,” he said. “These are huge problems that have been unaddressed, made worse by the Biden administration, but now we have to rally ourselves to try to fix it.”

Alex Conant, a GOP strategist, also pressed that while it “was an ugly night for Republicans no matter how you look at it,” it wasn’t a referendum on Trump.

Instead, he said, “it is a reminder to the White House that they need to stay focused on the economy.”

Analysts said Wednesday the election results could actually trigger retaliation from Trump, including further cuts to federal funding for certain projects.

“[G]iven a Democrat is now in charge, we do think some investors will be wary as [to] whether the current U.S. Admin would take a tougher stance” on Virginia’s offshore wind project, for one, Barclays said in a memo.

Ishyan Veluppillai, an energy associate at analysis firm Capstone, agreed the administration was not likely to back off its anti-renewables push.

“It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to change their attitude toward wind and solar purely as a reaction to the election, even when they’re considering the potential of retaining the House in next year’s midterms,” he said. “I think you can very much expect to see the same sort of policies at [the Interior and Energy Departments] for the next year at least.”

Wayne D’Angelo, co-chair of the environmental law practice at the law firm Kelley Drye, said voters are clearly concerned about electricity prices, which will likely prompt Republican lawmakers to look for ways to take this issue off the table going forward.

“Whether it is in response to perceptions of strengthened public support for renewables or just pragmatism, I believe (or hope) that lawmakers will view the post-election period as a less politically perilous time to support energy projects of all types,” D’Angelo said in an email.

Environmental groups and Democrats, meanwhile, said Wednesday the results offered a strategy ahead of next year’s midterm elections for hammering Republicans on rising costs and their attacks on clean energy.

“This is a tremendous weapon to go after the Republicans,” Inslee said.

“It’s a winning issue. We’ve demonstrated this,” he added. “Why would we not use a winning issue when we demonstrated how powerful it is?”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F72%2Fef%2F33b7d6d64427866c9bfcf6d16fd6%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2245055015,N,,2025-11-05 20:02:56.512402

North Dakota Monitor reporter Michael Achterling can be reached at machterling@northdakotamonitor.com.","The federal government will allow the state of North Dakota to regulate the handling of waste from coal-burning power plants.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Gov. Kelly Armstrong and other officials announced Wednesday that the EPA has approved the state’s coal combustion residuals permit program.

Coal combustion residuals, or CCRs, are waste such as fly ash and other types of ash. Some can be recycled into concrete or wallboard.

Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven pointed to a bill he helped author to allow states to develop coal waste recycling programs.

Coal ash was used in the construction of the North Dakota Heritage Center and the National Energy Center of Excellence at Bismarck State College, according to the news release.

Fly ash also is a potential source of rare earth minerals.

“The potential to extract rare earth elements and critical minerals from CCR — instead of having to import them from foreign adversaries — makes this approval of our CCR permit program even more important to U.S. energy independence, the economy and national security,” Armstrong said.

North Dakota is the fourth state to be granted the permitting authority.

Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

The Dakota Resource Council is among the environmental groups opposed to state regulation of coal combustion residuals, saying North Dakota has a history of ignoring environmental issues.

Executive Director Scott Skokos called it “a free pass for coal companies to police themselves” in a news release.

Environmental groups say coal waste landfills can leak and pollute groundwater. Coal ash spills in Tennessee and North Carolina caused extensive environmental damage.

“Once groundwater is polluted, there’s no going back,” Skokos said.

Western North Dakota has five coal-fired power plants. The lignite coal industry supports about 12,000 jobs in North Dakota.

“This announcement demonstrates confidence in North Dakota’s leadership and technical expertise, reinforcing what we’ve long known: local knowledge and accountability lead to the best outcomes for both the environment and the economy,” Jonathan Fortner, president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, said in a statement.

Zeldin said the move helps cut red tape and puts more decision-making in the hands of the state, where it belongs.

“States should be more in charge of their own destiny,” Zeldin said.

Armstrong said the change gives North Dakota more control and flexibility.

“When you impose a federal regulation, 4,600 pages or otherwise … it’s almost impossible to change that if new technology comes out, or better technology comes out,” Armstrong said.

He said the change to state-level management of the coal waste will be “less restrictive, and more outcome-based.”

In an interview after the press conference, Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, said North Dakota established a program to monitor coal waste in the 1990s. He said the state submitted its application for state authority during President Joe Biden’s administration.

“It’s just taken this long and, quite frankly, it shouldn’t have taken that long,” Glatt said. “When I talk to EPA now, they said it should’ve taken six months because we had a very well-established program that really checked off all the boxes.”

Glatt said he doesn’t see a need for much change to what the state is already doing, but the agency may have additional reporting requirements for the EPA. The department already inspects monitoring well sites near coal waste landfills several times per year, he said. He said the department will not need additional staff.

“I don’t think we’re going to need any more people, because we’ve already been at it for decades,” Glatt said

Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011.","While the Trump administration pursues a coal revival, a utility in Oregon is saving money by giving up on fossil fuel

In a rare departure from the norm, one of the three monopoly electric utilities operating in Oregon is asking state regulators for permission to lower rates for residential customers in 2026.

The reduction, though small at less than 1%, is the result of Idaho Power’s break with coal, according to recent filings with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission. The utility’s roughly 14,000 residential customers who live in eastern Oregon will likely save less than a dollar a month. Idaho Power’s request could be on the commission’s agenda in early December, according to Kandi Young, a commission spokesperson.

It’s the result of the company saving $1.3 million by ceasing operations of a coal-burning power plant in Nevada, and through lower regulatory costs since a Boardman coal plant it co-owned with Portland General Electric in eastern Oregon was fully decommissioned in recent years, the filings explain.

Idaho Power plans to end coal-burning operations at the last coal plant it owns, along with PacifiCorp, in Wyoming by 2030, and to convert the facility to burning natural gas. The company has a goal to reach a 100% “clean energy” portfolio for power by 2045, though for now that involves natural gas — almost entirely methane gas, a powerful heat-warming greenhouse gas.

“Idaho Power has a detailed resource planning process that continually seeks the least-cost, least-risk resources to serve our customers,” Jordan Rodriguez, a company spokesperson, said in an email.

The cost savings from ditching coal come as President Donald Trump and his administration fight to keep coal-burning power plants running past dates many utilities had set for decommissioning them.

Experts have found coal power is significantly more expensive than alternative energy sources. And because so many coal plants in the U.S. are more than 50 years old, reviving them will needlessly cost ratepayers more than they need to pay for power. Coal is also among the primary sources of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions globally, according to the International Energy Agency.

In October, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced a $625 million investment “to expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry,” which includes $350 million in funding to recommission or modernize existing coal-fired power plants. But in the last four years, more than 100 such plants have closed because they’re not cost-effective to operate anymore, according to researchers at the Ohio-based nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis.

Electricity prices have risen across the U.S. in recent years — about 13% on average since 2022, according to the Energy Information Administration — in part due to the rise of massive new users like data centers, artificial intelligence processors and bitcoin mining, as well as growing electrification across sectors. But costs have gone up more steeply in several states that rely heavily on coal, including Kentucky and West Virginia. Electricity rates in West Virginia, where coal powers more than 80% of consumed electricity, are up nearly 25% since 2022.

Rising rates

Oregon customers of monopoly electric utilities have also experienced higher-than-average rate hikes in recent years.

Rates for residential customers of Pacific Power and Portland General Electric are up about 50% since 2020.

Officials from both companies blame rising inflation, building infrastructure for more clean energy generation and storage, increasing costs to buy power, higher insurance costs and new customer demand. Power demand from large industrial customers, such as new data centers, is up more than 34% in the last five years, while residential demand is up 5%.

“It’s not very common for a utility to request a decrease in rates, but it does happen occasionally,” said Charlotte Shuff, a spokesperson for the Citizens’ Utility Board, a watchdog group established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of utility consumers.

“What’s more common is a rate decrease after a utility requests an increase,” Shuff said.

Idaho Power raised rates on Oregonians in 2025 for the first time since 2011. It initially asked the state’s Public Utilities Commission for permission to raise rates 27%, but was ultimately allowed a 4% increase. The company recently asked Idaho regulators to allow it to raise rates 17% on Gem State customers in 2026 for infrastructure upgrades, new energy storage facilities and wildfire prevention.

In its latest request to Oregon’s Public Utilities Commission to lower rates for Oregonians, the company said despite its savings, it will need to spend more than $500,000 on wildfire prevention work in the state in the year ahead.

Coal supporters are asking Energy Secretary Chris Wright to use emergency powers to keep two power plants open in Colorado.","Democrats woke up today as the resounding winners of what could go down as the electricity election.

In New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill turned a hard-fought gubernatorial race against Republican Jack Ciattarelli into a 13-percentage-point blowout Tuesday with a pledge to freeze soaring electricity rates.

In Virginia, former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger will become the state’s first female governor after trouncing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears with promises to make data-center operators pay for their share of grid upgrades.

And in Georgia, Democrats won two seats on the state’s utility board with arguments that their Republican counterparts had rubber-stamped rate hikes to pay for two costly nuclear reactors and natural gas plants.

The results come at a critical moment for U.S. energy policy. Electricity demand is projected to soar due to data centers and artificial intelligence. Meeting that demand is pushing the limits of America’s network of aging power grids and threatens to send monthly utility bills skyrocketing.

At the same time, the Trump administration has been canceling major wind, solar and power line projects that could help ease the costs of meeting that new demand.

Voters who turned out Tuesday likely weren’t thinking about the intricacies of power management, but they were definitely aware of the increases in their monthly electricity bills, political observers said. That was especially true in New Jersey and Virginia, which belong to a regional electricity market that has struggled to keep up with rapidly increasing demand from data centers.

“These states are huge canaries in the coal mine because these issues are being felt acutely,” said Adrian Deveny, a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) who played a key role in drafting former President Joe Biden’s climate law.

In New Jersey, 87 percent of voters surveyed in a CNN exit poll described electricity costs as a “major” or “minor” problem. Sherrill won 54 percent of those voters, though Ciattarelli notably eked out a 51-48 percent advantage among voters who described electricity costs as a major problem.

Some analysts cautioned against overstating the importance of electricity issues. Expressing discontent with President Donald Trump was a major factor in Tuesday’s results, said Clint Andrews, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. Concerns over electricity rates were part of wider voter angst over pocketbook issues like the cost of housing and health insurance.

“It is the affordability election,” he said. “Electricity is a subset of that.”

But for Democrats, who have spent much of the last year in the throes of an identity crisis, Tuesday’s victories supplied the outlines of a message they think can carry them to victory in next year’s midterm elections.

Josh Freed, who leads the climate and energy program at the center-left think tank Third Way, said he had never seen electricity issues rise to the forefront of the national political discussion in the way they did Tuesday. The issue is especially potent because Trump pledged to slash electricity costs in his win over former Vice President Kamala Harris last year.

“On the most basic level, the party that controls Washington promised a year ago to cut energy prices in half,” Freed said. “They have failed to deliver, and voters are angry at that. They made that loud and clear basically in every county and every state that had elections.”

The difference a decade makes

It’s been 10 years since the U.S. and European nations pushed countries to sign on to an international agreement to combat climate change, and much has changed since then, Sara Schonhardt writes ahead of the next climate summit in Brazil.

Then-President Barack Obama hailed the Paris Agreement as potentially a “turning point for the world” back in 2015. Since then, Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the accord twice, while Europe’s climate commitments are wavering in the face of pressure from price-weary voters and rising far-right parties.

Still, there’s upside to the Paris Agreement. Scientists say it seems to have staved off the most catastrophic effects of rising temperatures for now.

EU weakens climate goal

EU environment ministers Wednesday agreed to water down their proposed 2040 climate target and set a new plan for 2035, Louise Guillot writes from Brussels.

The plans were approved just ahead of the next United Nations climate summit in Brazil. The nonbinding 2035 plan calls for lowering emissions between 66.25 and 72.5 percent below 1990 by 2035. Then it would switch to a binding agreement to cut the bloc’s emissions 85 percent by 2040.

The plans are similar to those outlined by EU leaders at a climate summit in New York in September.

A lopsided shutdown

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history has had uneven impacts across energy and environmental agencies, writes POLITICO’s E&E News.

The Trump administration has found cash to keep some programs funded — with officials prioritizing favored projects — while other work has stopped entirely.

The Interior Department, for example, has barreled ahead with energy development, issuing 600 drilling permits, even as roughly 29,000 employees remain on furlough. EPA has adopted an unusual “phased” approach to furloughs, with some employees remaining on the job to draft rule rollbacks and approve permits. And at the Department of Energy, employees from six offices focused on solar, wind and hydrogen are still awaiting word on whether the agency will follow through on its proposal last month to fire or reassign them.

• The success of state-led emission reductions and clean energy job growth despite federal uncertainty.

• On-the-ground examples of Wisconsin’s clean energy workforce, manufacturing capacity, and cost-saving community solutions.

• Why Wisconsin’s pragmatic, kitchen-table approach to clean energy is a competitive advantage — especially in a purple state.

Standing on the waterfront in Rio de Janeiro, where hundreds of mayors, governors, and regional leaders have gathered for the COP30 Local Leaders Forum, it’s clear that local action is driving global climate progress. While world leaders prepare to meet in Belém later this month, the real momentum is here — among the subnational leaders delivering measurable results where people live and work.

And Wisconsin, led by Governor Tony Evers, is front and center.

As Co-Chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, Governor Evers joined New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and other U.S. state leaders to release the Alliance’s new Annual Report in Rio. The message was simple and strong: despite federal headwinds and denialism from some quarters, U.S. states are pressing forward — cutting climate pollution, growing the economy, and investing in a cleaner, more resilient future.

“We want the world to know that the United States continues to work at the state level to reduce emissions, create clean energy jobs, and increase resilience — regardless of what our president or anyone else says,” Evers told reporters at the opening session.

Subnational Leadership That Works

The U.S. Climate Alliance — a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors representing more than half the U.S. population and GDP — has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 24% since 2005, while growing GDP by 34%. Those numbers tell a powerful story: climate action and economic growth are not opposites. They’re two sides of the same coin.

Alliance states are driving the nation’s clean-energy buildout — responsible for 70% of America’s zero-emission vehicles, 68% of all public EV chargers, and nearly 200 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity added since 2005. Electricity-sector emissions alone have fallen 45% across member states.

That kind of steady progress is why subnational leadership is so vital. Even when Washington wavers, states and localities keep building, innovating, and creating jobs.

Solutions Exchange: From Policy to Practice

At the America Is All In “Solutions Exchange” sessions this week — co-hosted by Bloomberg Philanthropies — governors, mayors, and business leaders shared how climate policies translate into real community benefits: lower energy bills, cleaner air, and more resilient infrastructure. It’s a shift from negotiation to delivery, and Wisconsin offers a compelling example.

Our state’s clean-energy workforce now tops 75,000 jobs, spanning manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and services. Visit Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley, and you’ll see companies like Ingeteam building EV chargers and wind-turbine components for projects across the country. These are “Made in Wisconsin” climate solutions powering the global transition.

Wisconsin’s Common-Sense Climate Playbook

In a purple state like ours, climate action succeeds when it’s rooted in kitchen-table common sense — lowering costs, creating local jobs, and protecting our air and water. That pragmatic approach is helping Wisconsin communities weather storms, modernize schools, and give businesses the predictability they need to invest.

Consider the growing number of solar installations on schools and farms, energy-efficiency upgrades in homes and small businesses, and rural areas deploying EV charging corridors that connect tourists and truckers alike. Each project cuts carbon and saves money — the definition of win-win.

Equity is also at the heart of Wisconsin’s progress. Groups like Green Homeowners United are helping low- and moderate-income families weatherize homes, replace old furnaces, and install heat pumps — ensuring the benefits of clean energy reach the people who need them most.

Resilience in the Face of Federal Uncertainty

Evers and his fellow Alliance governors are candid about the challenge ahead. With rollbacks in federal climate policy, states must stay the course — not only to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, but to safeguard local economies and public health. As Governor Evers noted, “Even when federal leadership falters, our resolve only grows stronger.”

The Alliance’s updated targets are ambitious yet achievable: 26% emissions reduction by 2025, 52% by 2030, and 66% by 2035. Those goals are backed by data, science, and — most importantly — people on the ground who see the benefits of cleaner energy and smarter infrastructure.

Wisconsin’s Role on the Global Stage

Here in Rio, Governor Evers’ leadership reflects something larger: Wisconsin’s growing influence in the global climate conversation. As the U.S. delegation heads to Belém, the message from states like ours is clear — progress doesn’t wait for politics. It’s built city by city, farm by farm, and business by business.

For Wisconsin, that means doubling down on what works:

Supporting manufacturers building the backbone of the clean-energy economy.

Strengthening partnerships among businesses, farms, and communities.

Protecting the public tools — like rebates, tax credits, and utility programs — that make the transition affordable and fair.

By staying pragmatic, collaborative, and grounded in results, Wisconsin can continue to punch above its weight — showing that climate leadership in a purple state is not only possible, it’s a competitive advantage.

That’s the Wisconsin story worth sharing — from Rio to Belém, from our neighborhoods to the world.
