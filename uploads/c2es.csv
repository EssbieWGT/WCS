June 30, 2026 - End of tax credits for installation of EV chargers at home or business.
July's EV sales figures represent a 26.4% improvement in EV sales since June, and a 20% year-over-year sales bump.
This Isn't The First Time We've Lost Our EV Credits We've actually been here before.
For as long as these EV credits have existed, the federal government has been renegotiating the terms and conditions every other year or so.","You've heard the saying, get in while the getting's good? That's exactly what's going on with electric vehicle sales in the US right now. If you haven't been keeping track, President Trump's plan to knock the EV credits (passed under Joe Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act) will be going into effect after September 30th. This means that, as of the time of this writing, you've got about a month and a half to claim your new Chevy Equinox EV before the credits disappear.

Just like in a good suspense film, the ticking clock element has created a sense of urgency, with a Cox Automotive representative saying that we should expect to see remarkably high sales numbers at the end of the third fiscal quarter of the year. The plan was initially to keep offering these EV credits all the way into 2032, but, with that offer being rescinded, time is quite literally running out to make the most of the credits. Here's what you need to know...

What's Going On With The EV Credits Right Now?

The official statement from the US Department of Energy on the matter puts it like this:

Tax credits up to $7,500 are available for eligible new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for eligible used electric vehicles. You can work with your dealership to process the vehicle tax credit. Tax credits are available for home chargers and associated energy storage, each up to $1,000.

The Effect Will Be Felt For Years Into The Future

President Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" aims to end these credits entirely. The timeline for EV buyers looks like this at the moment...

September 30, 2025 - End of rebate program for used electric vehicles for low-income buyers.

September 30, 2025 - End of tax credits for qualifying new EVs.

September 30, 2025 - End of credit for qualified commercial and fleet EVs.

June 30, 2026 - End of tax credits for installation of EV chargers at home or business.

January 1, 2029 - Taxation on auto loan interest resumes.

If you own an EV, and you've been putting off installing a home charger for some reason, you have until next summer to get that sorted. Tax-free auto loans were actually a Trump idea, going into effect January this year, and will expire in early 2029, at the end of President Trump's term.

We Bought Over 160,000 EVs In July Alone

According to Cox Automotive, after a slow start to the year, Americans bought 36,700 used EVs in July, a record monthly high, and 130,100 new EVs, slightly behind a monthly record of 136,000 last December, shortly before President Trump took office. July's EV sales figures represent a 26.4% improvement in EV sales since June, and a 20% year-over-year sales bump.

EV's July sales accounted for 9.1% of all passenger vehicle sales for the month, the largest monthly market share ever recorded. According to Cox Automotive, EVs made up around 8.7% of all new vehicles sold in the US in 2024, so this is a noticeable uptick from business-as-usual. Dealers have been helping the sales spike along as well, offering up to $9,800 in additional financial incentives, knocking average transaction prices down by a whopping 17.5%.

At the end of 2024, EVs only accounted for around 1.4% of all cars on the road, according to Experian, accounting for four million vehicles total. The average age of a car in operation right now is around 12.6 years, so it'll take a while before you really see that sales boost reflected in the Walmart parking lot.

A Rising Tide Lifts All Ships (But Some More Than Others)

Some models have benefited from this sales spike more than others, with the Chevy Equinox EV, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Honda Prologue all setting new sales records. The Equinox EV alone sold 8,500 models.

But, the more things change, the more they stay the same, as Tesla remains at the front of the pack despite a 12% year-over-year sales drop. The Tesla Model Y remains America's favorite EV, selling an estimated 146,000 units by the mid-point of 2025. The Cybertruck may have turned out to be a massive disappointment for the brand, but Tesla SUVs and sedans remain popular.

What Does The Future Of The EV Industry Look Like?

There are two things worth noting. First, not all EV incentives are offered at a federal level. There are state-level incentives to consider as well. But... number two, it's unclear what the future holds for these incentives at the moment.

California, for instance, has its own EV subsidies. Last year, California Governor Newsom pledged to renew the state's own $7,500 zero-emission rebate should Trump wipe the federal tax credit out. But, Californians are still waiting to hear if Newsom will hold true to that pledge. According to Yahoo! Finance, sources ""familiar with the discussions"" have reported that, even if California continues to offer its own subsidy program, there's no guarantee it will still be a dollar-for-dollar match for the $7,500 federal credit still available, and Newsom has yet to present a plan on the matter.

Cox Automotive Expects Used EV Sales To Hold (Somewhat) Steady

It doesn't take a Harvard-educated fiscal analyst to tell you that monthly sales numbers for EVs are about to drop off a cliff like Wile E Coyote when he looks down past his feet. Cox uses the word ""collapse"" when describing what's going to happen to EV sales in the fourth quarter, and that sounds about right. This sales spike is absolutely a short-term boom for the industry, and, as soon as the EV credits go away, so too will the record-breaking sales figures.

But, used EVs could be the bright spot in the market's near-term future. According to the analysts, only about one in three used EV buyers qualify for the $4,000 incentive in the first place, so the impact won't be felt quite as deeply in the used EV segment.

This Isn't The First Time We've Lost Our EV Credits

We've actually been here before. For as long as these EV credits have existed, the federal government has been renegotiating the terms and conditions every other year or so. In the summer of 2022, the $7,500 credits were renewed with a long list of stipulations that saw the list of qualifying EVs reduced to just 12 models. Not long after, Tesla was slashing the prices on Model 3s and Ys to make up the difference and keep the cars rolling off the lot.

Chances are, we're going to see the same thing this time around. As the tax credit is taken off the table, we'll see MSRPs and average transaction prices dropping. Those discounts may or may not be in lockstep with the $7,500 credits, but a dealer has no use for an overpriced EV that nobody wants to buy. The industry will likely do whatever it can to keep the product moving, and, while it's hard to read the end of the EV credits as anything but a net loss for the American buyer and the EV industry, it's unlikely that electric car sellers will simply sit around twiddling their thumbs and call it a day.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/people-are-rushing-to-make-the-most-of-president-biden-s-ev-tax-credits.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 19:00:36.164100

When the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to eliminate the Energy Star program became public, pushback from environmental groups was expected. The government-funded labeling system helps consumers identify energy-efficient products and practices, saving them $40 billion annually in energy costs. Since its founding in 1992, Energy Star has helped avoid at least 4 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions and has been lauded as one of the most effective decarbonization tools in U.S. history.

But over the last few months, a broad and unexpected coalition of industry groups has come out in support of the program. They range from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association of Home Builders to the Spray Foam Coalition, American Bakers Association, and the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance. The American Chemistry Council regularly fights the EPA’s regulation of power plants, and the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance’s previous lobbying efforts have promoted natural gas use in homes. Now, they find themselves aligned with environmental groups like the Sierra Club in defending Energy Star.

It’s an “interesting bedfellows” situation, said Justin Koscher, president of the Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association, which represents manufacturers of a type of rigid insulation used mostly in commercial roofing projects. “It’s not too often you get all of those groups saying the exact same thing on one particular issue.”

Bipartisan support for Energy Star

Most Americans recognize Energy Star from the iconic cyan-and-white logo on appliances like light fixtures, computers, and refrigerators, signaling that a third party has certified that the product uses less energy than other comparable options. But entire homes and buildings can also be certified as energy-efficient, and the Energy Star Portfolio Manager helps building managers track energy use.

Residential and commercial buildings combined make up about a third of the country’s total energy use, and nearly a quarter of all commercial buildings in the country use the tool. The EPA program incentivizes energy-efficient building practices, guides appliance choice, and drives demand for products like insulation. Koscher worries that if Energy Star disappears, so might the incentive.

Energy Star Portfolio Manager is also the basis for how cities and counties across the nation measure whether buildings within their borders are complying with local-level energy-efficiency regulations. Almost 50 municipalities — and a few entire states — rely on the program, according to the Energy Star website. If Energy Star is privatized or eliminated, there’s currently no adequate replacement, said Paula Cino of the National Multifamily Housing Council, a group representing apartment building owners, developers, and managers.

Energy Star certification can be good for landlords’ bottom line. One study found that after an office building earns the label, rents in the building go up even as utility costs — an indicator of how much energy the building is using — remain unchanged.

That suggests the program may be boosting the market value of already-efficient buildings without necessarily reducing energy use. Since the program is voluntary, its opt-in nature also appeals to organizations that prefer it over stricter, local electrification mandates.

In March, Cino’s group sent a letter to Trump administration officials asking to roll back a lengthy slate of building and appliance efficiency standards. But even so, the group sees value in Energy Star’s tools.

“There is still a tremendous need for building owners to be able to understand how their building is using energy, and that is expressly what Energy Star Portfolio Manager provides for the business community,” Cino said.

Support for Energy Star in Congress is bipartisan. In July, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $36 million in funding for the program. The House Appropriations Committee also passed a bill that sets Energy Star’s funding floor for the upcoming year at $32 million. Both are a far cry from the White House’s stated interest in zeroing out funding for Energy Star altogether. But final approval of funding appropriations for the EPA is still months away.

In the meantime, Koscher, the insulation representative, is waiting to see how the future of Energy Star impacts his business. “The Energy Star program is one of those prime examples of where government gets it right,” he said. “We should be looking for more opportunities to create programs like this that deliver a significant return on investment on taxpayer dollars, not doing less of it.”

CarsDirect suggests Mercedes is pushing out the deals to make hay before EV tax credits disappear in September, hoping to attract customers keen to secure a saving before the credits window closes. Although the G580 EQ wouldn’t qualify for the federal rebate (or the Mercedes incentive), if you were buying it outright, due to the combination of its high purchase price and foreign origin, those obstructions are removed if you lease it.

An almost five-figure discount would be game-changing on an ordinary car, but in this case we are talking about a $162,650 SUV. And more specifically, one that costs $13,000 more than the gas-powered G550 many people would prefer to drive, but unfortunately doesn’t qualify for the incentives. The $187,250 G63 AMG, the one almost everyone would – finances allowing – pick first, doesn’t qualify either.

The G580 EQ looks just as cool as a combustion G-Class and can do showboating tank turns, but it’s seriously compromised as an EV by its mammoth 6,800 lbs (3,085 kg) bulk and brick-like shape. Despite a huge 116 kWh battery, the 579 hp (588 PS / 432 kW) EQ has an EPA-rated range of only 239 miles (385 km), though reports claim a new battery coming in 2026 could add at least 100 miles (160 km) to that number.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Merc-G-Aug152511.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 19:00:40.013109

As data centers consume power at the scale of small cities, the global energy grid faces a crisis of scale and sustainability. Yet, amid this upheaval, a quiet revolution is unfolding in energy infrastructure. One company, in particular, stands at the intersection of AI-driven demand, geopolitical onshoring, LNG expansion, and nuclear innovation—while trading at a fraction of its intrinsic value.

Enter Pampa Energía (PAMPA), a South American energy infrastructure firm that has flown under the radar of most investors. With a price-to-earnings ratio of just 7x—well below industry peers like Chevron (CVX) and NextEra Energy (NEE)—Pampa is arguably the most undervalued player in the AI energy transition. Its business model is a masterclass in leveraging structural megatrends: it operates a debt-free, cash-rich balance sheet while building critical infrastructure to meet the surging power needs of AI, onshoring, and the energy transition.

The AI Energy Paradox

AI's insatiable appetite for electricity is reshaping the energy landscape. Hyperscale data centers, which now consume 50–100 megawatts of power each, require not just volume but reliability and cleanliness. The U.S. grid, for instance, is projected to face a 42-gigawatt shortfall by 2028. Pampa's strategic projects—such as Argentina's Vaca Muerta pipeline and its FLNG facilities—position it to supply both the energy and the infrastructure to meet this demand.

Consider the FLNG project: by converting natural gas into LNG at sea, Pampa bypasses the high costs of onshore liquefaction plants, enabling rapid deployment to AI hotspots like the U.S. and Europe. This is not just about energy—it's about geopolitical resilience. As onshoring accelerates, energy security becomes a non-negotiable. Pampa's ability to deliver scalable, low-cost LNG aligns perfectly with this shift.

A “Toll Booth” Model for the AI Era

Pampa's financial structure is equally compelling. Its “toll booth” model generates recurring revenue from every cubic meter of LNG exported and every kilowatt of power delivered. This creates a durable cash flow stream insulated from short-term tech cycles. For example, its geothermal and renewable projects supply clean power to tech giants like Google and Meta, locking in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) that provide stable margins.

The company's recent performance underscores its potential. While its stock has shown mixed results around earnings releases (a 50% win rate over three days), it has delivered a 71.43% win rate over 10 days. Analysts project 100%+ returns over 12–24 months, driven by its exposure to AI energy demand and U.S. infrastructure policies.

Policy Tailwinds and Strategic Positioning

Pampa's growth is further amplified by policy tailwinds. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Trump-era infrastructure plans are accelerating demand for energy infrastructure in AI hubs. Pampa's projects in Argentina, a country with abundant natural resources and a strategic location for LNG exports, position it to benefit from both U.S. onshoring and global energy transition trends.

Moreover, Pampa's involvement in hydrogen infrastructure and geothermal energy aligns with the decarbonization goals of hyperscalers. As AI companies face increasing pressure to meet ESG targets, Pampa's clean energy offerings become a critical enabler.

The Case for Investment

For investors, Pampa represents a rare combination of undervaluation and high-conviction growth. At a 7x P/E, it trades at a discount to its intrinsic value, which analysts estimate could reach $15–$20 per share within three years. Its debt-free balance sheet and $1.2 billion in cash provide a margin of safety, while its exposure to AI-driven energy demand offers upside potential.

The risks, of course, are not negligible. Geopolitical instability in Argentina and the cyclical nature of energy markets could pose challenges. However, Pampa's diversified portfolio—spanning LNG, renewables, and hydrogen—mitigates these risks. Its ability to adapt to shifting regulatory and market conditions further strengthens its long-term prospects.

Conclusion

The AI revolution is redefining the rules of energy infrastructure. While most investors focus on the tech sector, the real opportunity lies in the companies that power it. Pampa Energía, with its strategic alignment to AI-driven demand, onshoring, and the energy transition, is a prime example of a stealth energy play trading at a massive discount. For those willing to look beyond the headlines, it offers a compelling case for long-term value creation.

In an era where energy is the new oil, Pampa is the overlooked pipeline.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-17 19:01:04.080617

Zeldin, the former Long Island congressman, will be holding a press conference in Hauppauge Monday to discuss environmental safety issues posed by “Battery Energy Storage Systems,” which are hazardous when they catch fire.

While not explicitly opposing BESS, Zeldin is set to issue a new EPA guidance for communities and local governments to consider regarding the environmental risks of such facilities.

“Calling a technology ‘green energy’ does not mean there are no environmental impacts,” Zeldin, the 2022 Republican candidate for governor, told The Post.

He blasted the “delusional” and unrealistic green energy goals advanced by Gov. Kathy Hochul and Albany Democrats amid the backlash against the proliferation of battery storage plants across New York, including Staten Island, Queens, the Hudson Valley and upstate.

“Residents are looking across the country where dangerous lithium battery fires at BESS facilities have caused widespread damage, and they are concerned with New York’s partisan push to fill yet another of its delusional ‘green’ goals, which the state itself admits it cannot meet,” Zeldin said.

“Many New Yorkers, especially in New York City and on Long Island, have made their voices clear – they do not want Battery Energy Storage Systems built in their neighborhoods.”

The Empire State is aggressively expanding battery energy storage systems to meet ambitious goals

to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and achieve 100% zero-carbon emission electricity by 2040 under the the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019.

Zeldin slammed what he deemed wacky state Democrat policies that move to limit or phase out more reliable energy sources such as natural gas to advance their climate protection agenda.

“The state that banned the safe extraction of natural gas, gas hook-ups on new construction, gas stoves, and aims to end the sale of gas-powered vehicles, continues to put the safety and well-being of New Yorkers second to their climate change agenda,” Zeldin said.

He cited recent incidents in California and Hawaii to demonstrate the serious risks BESS facilities pose to host communities and first responders.

A rep for Hochul said it was bizarre to have the nation’s environmental chief opposing the advancement of clean energy programs that reduce carbon emissions to tackle climate change, aiming to improve the environment while diversifying New York’s power supply.

“Lee Zeldin’s job is to protect the environment, but he has been doing anything but that,” said Ken Lovett, Senior Hochul’s communications advisor on energy and the environment.

“His continued assault on clean energy and his push for rollbacks on environmental protections will hurt everyone in his home state of New York and across the country and fly in the face of the federal government’s claim of wanting U.S. energy independence,” Lovett said of Zeldin.

“While other states are rapidly investing in storage to stabilize their grids and lower costs, Zeldin’s approach risks leaving New York’s economy behind and forcing New Yorkers to pay,” he said.

New York recently enacted among the most stringent battery energy storage regulations in the country in 2023 pertaining to safely developing energy storage facilities, Hochul’s office said.

Six former city fire safety officials, including former FDNY Commissioner Tom Von Essen, praised the regulations.

Since 2019, New York has approved more than 6,000 battery storage projects creating 440 megawatts of capacity, with 1.3 gigawatts already under contract and a state goal of six gigawatts by 2030, according to the EPA.

New York passed two laws that dramatically expanded the state government’s power to override local opposition for major renewable projects, including battery storage facilities of 25 megawatts or larger.

The Hauppauge facility is not subject to a state override, but residents there have expressed widespread misgivings.

But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.
Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said ""it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.""
Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.
Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON -- A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet's shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

""I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they're going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that's just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that's been wasted,"" he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES REDUCE EMISSIONS

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

""We're already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,"" Keoleian said. ""We've been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.""

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said ""it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force."" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a ""boondoggle"" and ""a textbook example of waste,"" citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

""You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that's providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,"" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

""For now,"" she added, ""gas-powered vehicles -- use some ethanol in them -- I think is wonderful.""

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project ""has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.""

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was ""very modest"" and not unexpected.

""The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,"" spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVS HELP IN MODERNIZATION EFFORT

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The ""Deliver for America"" plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

""Our mechanics are miracle workers,"" said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. ""The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.""

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

BUILDING NEW POSTAL TRUCKS

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck's bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

""I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,"" he said. ""And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house -- they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly -- it's really amazing in my opinion.""

WHERE THINGS STAND NOW

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were ""carefully considered from a business perspective"" and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

""But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,"" she said. ""And that was not a smart move.""

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

""It's the perfect application for an electric vehicle,"" he said, ""and it's a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.texarkanagazette.com_default.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 19:01:48.795071

One friend wrote, “I am curious if you have any thoughts about why electric bills are doubling and, in some cases, tripling? People in my area are in shock. In two months, my bill doubled.”

I live in Phoenix, and we actually have reasonable electric bills because we are served by the Palo Verde Generating Station. Despite the intense heat here, my electric bill never rises above $300 except in July. More on that later.

That’s not the case everywhere. From the Midwest to the Southeast, people are seeing bills that are several times higher than that. What’s driving these sudden spikes isn’t just “using more power” or “a hot summer.” The reality is more complex, and it won’t be easy to solve.

Here are the five biggest forces reshaping your electric bill.

AI Data Centers Are Consuming Gigawatts

The surge in artificial intelligence has unleashed a gold rush in data center construction, and it’s quickly becoming one of the most powerful forces driving electricity demand. These facilities are energy-intensive, often consuming 30 times more electricity than traditional data centers. A single AI center can draw as much power as 80,000 homes, and by 2030, data centers are projected to require 30 GW of new capacity—the equivalent of 30 nuclear reactors.

To meet this demand, utilities are scrambling to add transmission lines and upgrade grid infrastructure, with those costs inevitably showing up on customer bills. At the same time, utilities that sell power into competitive markets—rather than operating under regulated rate caps—are seeing a windfall. Texas-based NRG Energy, for example, has seen its stock price triple in just two years, as soaring wholesale prices boosted profits.

LNG Exports Are Pushing Up Fuel Costs

Natural gas powers about 40% of U.S. electricity generation, and U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports have risen by nearly a factor of seven in the past seven years to over 13 billion cubic feet per day.

That means when Asian or European buyers bid up LNG cargoes, U.S. households indirectly feel it in their electricity bills. Put simply, you’re now competing with the world for the same fuel—and global demand is strong. The spot price of natural gas in the U.S. is about $1.00 per million Btu higher than it was a year ago at this time. That translates directly into higher electricity bills this year.

Heat Waves Are Breaking the Grid

July 2025 saw record-breaking temperatures across much of the country, with a “heat dome” trapping high humidity and driving peak demand to 758,149 MWh in a single hour—a national record. Air conditioning loads surged, and in many regions, utilities had to buy expensive spot-market electricity to meet demand. That cost gets socialized across monthly bills.

Aging Infrastructure and Grid Bottlenecks

The U.S. grid is old and straining under new loads. More than 70% of transmission lines and transformers are over 30 years old. Replacing and upgrading them is both essential and expensive.

Delivery charges—the part of your bill that covers the poles, wires, and transformers needed to move electricity—have climbed sharply in recent years. For households, that means even if fuel costs ease or demand moderates, the higher cost of maintaining and upgrading the grid will likely keep electricity prices from returning to the levels we saw just a few years ago.

Policy Shifts and Regulatory Lag

Finally, policy isn’t keeping up. The repeal of clean energy tax credits under the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” slowed renewable deployment. At the same time, permitting bottlenecks have delayed new transmission and generation.

Layer on top of that the electrification push—EVs, heat pumps, electric appliances—and electricity demand is rising faster than utilities can build capacity. The mismatch creates structural upward pressure on rates, regardless of short-term market moves.

Where Electric Bills Aren’t Skyrocketing

While millions of Americans are grappling with sticker shock, there are notable exceptions—regions that enjoy stable or even declining electricity prices, thanks to their unique energy mix.

Phoenix is one of them. As previously noted, despite triple-digit temperatures, my own bill rarely exceeds $300, largely because the Palo Verde Generating Station provides stable, low-cost nuclear power. Nuclear plants offer a huge advantage: their fuel (uranium) isn’t tied to volatile global gas markets, and their reactors run around the clock at high capacity factors.

It also doesn’t hurt that Arizona has seen a 187% increase in wind and solar power generation over the past decade, or that the state ranks 3rd nationally in installed battery storage capacity.

Other regions also benefit from abundant local resources:

Idaho: The lowest average rates in the nation at just 11.9 cents per kWh, thanks to hydroelectric power (which can be impacted by droughts).

Pacific Northwest (WA, OR): Wholesale prices are falling in 2025 due to strong hydropower and growing solar generation.

Texas (ERCOT): Despite surging demand, competitive market dynamics and solar buildout are keeping wholesale prices flat or slightly lower.

By contrast, states heavily reliant on natural gas—like California, New Jersey, and Ohio—are seeing double-digit rate hikes as LNG exports and peak demand drive up costs.

Why Nuclear Matters

It’s worth pausing on nuclear. Yes, the upfront capital costs are high, but once plants are built, their operating costs are remarkably stable—about 9.3 cents per kWh, compared to 7 cents for gas--which is susceptible to price spikes--and 9.5 cents for coal. Nuclear also avoids carbon pricing and doesn’t need backup generation like intermittent renewables.

In a grid increasingly stressed by AI demand, climate extremes, and geopolitical risks, nuclear’s ability to provide price stability, energy security, and reliability is hard to match.

The Bottom Line

So, why did your bill suddenly double? It’s not just about running your air conditioner a little harder. It’s about structural shifts in the energy system:

AI data centers reshaping demand

LNG exports reshaping fuel markets

Heat waves stressing supply

Aging infrastructure raising delivery costs

Policy bottlenecks slowing new capacity

At the same time, regions anchored by nuclear or hydro have been shielded from the worst price spikes. That contrast underscores an important truth: the U.S. doesn’t face a single energy reality—it faces many, depending on local resources and policy choices.

Unless utilities, regulators, and policymakers find smarter ways to expand capacity and modernize the grid, the broader trend is clear: for many households, higher electricity bills aren’t just a fluke—they’re the new normal.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68a200c9eb4d2425266c8b11/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-17 18:01:38.905402

By Kenneth P. Green

Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), recently announced that the EPA will scrap a 2009 Obama-era “Endangerment Finding” that held: “The Administrator finds that the current and projected concentrations of the six key well-mixed greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.”

After its 2009 enactment and 2016 reaffirmation, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, the Endangerment Finding would be the legal rationale to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for cars and light trucks, power plants, and facilities in the oil and gas sector.

There will no doubt be legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision to terminate the finding (as there seemingly is for everything Trump), however in the event that it proceeds (and it likely will), one can expect to see the elimination of a fair number of large-scale environmental regulations that could have ripple effects on the Canadian economy.

From a Canadian perspective, the most important aspect of the repeal is that it will likely lead to the complete withdrawal of the U.S. federal government’s support of vehicle electrification. The Trump administration has already killed electric vehicle (EV) mandates and federal subsidies for the purchase of EVs, but remaining production mandates for car companies (under the guise of EPA fleet fuel-economy standards) are also likely to end, and with that, EV manufacturing and sales will likely plummet. This will leave EVs in the niche they’ve held—novelty items for hobbyists or luxury toys for well-heeled eco-virtue signallers. And California can’t bail this one out—its own authority to set more stringent environmental standards for vehicles emissions has also been terminated, along with its ability to drive the EV revolution forward.

So, policymakers in Canada should shelve (or drop into the round file) any expectation of exporting significant EV-related goods into the U.S. market. At the least, governments should suspend or eliminate Canadian EV sales mandates and “investments” based on an expected U.S. market for such goods, unless governments want to give taxpayers a soaking.

The federal government, and some provincial governments, may choose to continue supporting vehicle electrification within Canada and the creation of export capacity for EV parts and components (such as batteries) outside of the U.S. market for any number of reasons. They might justify this support based on concerns over air quality or GHG emissions. However, the logistics of such endeavours, particularly tech sales out of North America, would be daunting. EV components tend to be heavy, require exotic materials and long costly shipping lines to Europe, Asia and points abroad. And planning to sell EV components to Asia is like preparing to sell ice to the Inuit or carrying coal to Newcastle.

Canada’s vehicle electrification fixation has been dubious from the start, much like the U.S. fixation, due to the vast transport distances, rugged topography, inadequate and unaffordable battery tech and charging capacity, and in some precincts, a great deal of cold weather.

But whether one agrees with the death of the Endangerment Finding or not, a pragmatic observer should recognize that, for the next good while at least, the United States is pulling the plug on North America vehicle electrification and subsequently any expectations of profit from the previous EV regulatory milieu. For Canada, I’d argue, that means killing the EV mandate and cancelling/trying to claw back as much of the government’s “investments” in EV and EV battery technology and manufacturing as quickly as possible.

Consumer appetites and changes in the global economy are outpacing government incentives.

Canada’s bold electric vehicle (EV) plan was once the big deal in the country’s climate policy, but now that reality has set in, it looks like the program is going to fail.

For years, Canadian politicians proudly led the country towards an electric future with strong rebates, strict rules, and a commitment to meeting tough emission reduction targets. But recent events have revealed serious problems that have sent the country’s electric vehicle plans into a tailspin.

The first cracks showed up earlier this year when the federal and provincial rebate programs ended. The iZEV program in Ottawa, which gave up to $5,000 per vehicle, ended suddenly in January 2025 when the money ran out. Quebec followed suit and stopped its provincial rebates for a short time.

They came back at a much lower rate, dropping from $7,000 to $4,000 in April 2025. British Columbia ended its popular rebate program completely after making it harder to qualify, which meant about 75 percent of EV models were no longer eligible. This makes it much harder for people thinking of switching to electric vehicles to make a financial case for it.

The market reacted quickly and strongly. EV sales, which had been increasing, stopped right away. Statistics Canada says EV sales reached their highest point in December 2024 when they made up about 18.29 percent of all sales in Canada. By April 2025, they had dropped to 7.53 percent.

British Columbia, which used to be the leader in EV adoption, saw its market share drop from almost 25 percent in mid-2024 to about 15.4 percent by June 2025. Quebec, which is now the leader in Canada, had similar problems, with sales dropping sharply even though the province has always been enthusiastic about electrification.

There are harsh economic facts behind these numbers. People who want to buy electric vehicles say cost is the biggest problem. Middle-class Canadians can no longer afford electric vehicles because the rebates were taken away. Infrastructure problems make this worse; public charging networks are still not good enough or reliable enough, which makes owning an electric vehicle impractical for many potential buyers.

Even though the government has been working to install thousands of new charging stations, a recent survey found 41 percent of British Columbians thought the current infrastructure was not enough.

The Canadian government’s EV sales mandate has become the big problem, making things even worse. The mandate was meant to ensure 20 percent of all new cars sold by 2026 would be zero-emission and 100 percent by 2035. Now most people think this is impossible.

Auto industry representatives, including the CEOs of Ford, GM, and Stellantis Canada, have told Prime Minister Mark Carney in no uncertain terms that the targets can’t be met in the current market. They say enforcing these rules without any incentives could cost automakers up to $20,000 per vehicle and mean fewer jobs and less production in Canada.

At the same time, geopolitical factors have made things even tougher. The Trump administration’s U.S. tariffs and the end of U.S. EV incentives and mandates have had a huge impact on the Canadian auto industry, which sends 85 percent of its production to the U.S. market.

Critics say Canada’s whole EV policy is a case of good intentions running into hard economic and practical realities. The Fraser Institute says directly that the EV mandate is the wrong way to choose which technologies will succeed and which will fail, hurting markets and putting an unfair burden on lower-income people.

Even people who care about sustainability agree the mandates as they currently stand don’t fit the market and consumer behaviour.

Canada’s EV program needs major policy changes now if it’s to survive and grow. Barry Penner of the Energy Futures Institute and other industry leaders say a more gradual and flexible approach is better. This would include bringing back rebates, improving charging infrastructure, and making sure the mandates match market conditions.

If these changes aren’t made, the good intentions behind Canada’s EV plans will be derailed, and economic stability and real environmental progress will be at risk.

U.S. automakers are celebrating their ability to continue selling gas-powered vehicles after President Donald Trump rolled back electric vehicle (EV) mandates.

Trump signed three new bills into law in June, which terminated Biden-era rules that allowed states like California to impose a national EV mandate. These rollbacks have caused companies like Ford and General Motors to scale back their EV plans and search to leverage demand for their big SUVs and commercial vehicles, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.

“This is a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next couple of years,” Ford Motor Chief Executive Jim Farley said last week in a call to analysts.

California and several other states imposed rules that would have banned the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in their respective areas by 2035. Trump’s new rules stripped these states of those mandates and have allowed the auto industry to continue selling gas-powered engines in new vehicles, according to The WSJ.

“It’s a very, very fast speed for the auto industry,” Tyson Jominy, J.D. Power’s senior vice president of data and analytics, told the WSJ. “But it’s faster to be able to revert to an existing technology rather than tool up and prepare for a new technology.”

General Motors switched its plan to do away with combustion engines by 2035 and have instead laid out the benefits of keeping them around, The WSJ reported. General Motors CEO Mary Barra stated that her company can “appreciate the profitability” of selling gas-powered vehicles as a result of Trump’s rollbacks.

Jeep maker Stellantis said on a call with analysts that the auto provisions in Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” will make it easier for companies to produce both EVs and gas-powered vehicles.

Ford, General Motors and Stellantis had agreed to pay nearly $10 billion on regulatory credits and fuel-economy rule-violation fines, according to The WSJ. Stellantis has expressed that it will benefit financially by no longer having to pay these fines.

Adam Lee, chairman of Maine-based Lee Auto Malls, added that large SUVs will boost companies’ sales because Americans are fond of them.

“Americans do like buying giant vehicles,” Lee said. “They’re going to see how many more giant SUVs they can pump out, because they sell a lot of them and make a lot of money on them.”

Additionally, under the new regulation, the post-construction monitoring requirement for eagle mortality in wind energy projects appears purposely skewed towards underreporting.
The 2024 regulation changed its core mission from protecting eagles to handing out permits for wind energy projects with unlimited authorization to kill eagles without consequences.
In my opinion and experience, the 2024 eagle permitting regulation does not contribute to the conservation of eagles, but rather authorizes, without any consequence, wind energy projects to kill eagles.
The Trump administration’s August guidance aimed at forcing wind energy projects to comply with the law is a good start.","The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service enacted a new eagle permitting regulation last spring, claiming that it would “promote eagle conservation.” But the new regulation only makes it easier for wind energy projects to receive permits, allowing them to kill eagles.

The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits “take” of eagles, defining “take” as “pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb.” In 2009, the Fish and Wildlife Service finalized a rule that, for the first time, authorized the “incidental take” of eagles which grants authorization to kill eagles incidental to otherwise lawful activity.

In 2013, it issued guidance to wind energy developers requiring them to complete Eagle Conservation Plans, demonstrating how they would avoid or minimize their effect upon eagles. The guidance also required running eagle-fatality models to predict the project’s potential for “take” of eagles.

In short, these regulations encouraged avoidance of areas with high eagle concentrations and implementation of conservation measures, including siting considerations, before the Fish and Wildlife Service would issue a permit authorizing take.

But the Biden administration alleged that the complexity of the earlier permitting process was preventing companies from applying for eagle take permits, which were only issued after the implementation of avoidance measures.

The agency alleged that simplifying wind permitting was preferable and would lead to greater eagle conservation. But does the 2024 permitting regulation really increase protections for eagles, or does it just authorize the killing of eagles at wind projects?

The 2024 rule revision provides for two permitting options — a specific permit and a general permit, the latter being easier to obtain, less costly and with fewer mitigation and monitoring conditions. General permits are available in the U.S. for areas where the relative abundance of eagles is considered low.

Unfortunately, the general permits erroneously assume there is little risk to eagles from wind energy projects in a range covering most of the U.S. outside of the Rocky Mountain states. Local areas with high concentrations of eagles are not accounted for in the general permit region.

Under the 2024 regulations, if a wind project in this region requests a general permit, staff lack discretion to refuse to issue it, even where existing wind projects have already killed eagles.

Additionally, under the new regulation, the post-construction monitoring requirement for eagle mortality in wind energy projects appears purposely skewed towards underreporting.

The monitoring survey distance was reduced from more than 100 meters to just 40 meters. Thus, unless an eagle carcass falls on the road or turbine pad, it is unlikely to be detected, and carcasses falling outside the 40-meter survey area will not be recorded.

The 2024 regulation does not give the Fish and Wildlife Service authority to prevent the siting of wind projects in high eagle concentration areas. Nor does the agency have any recourse when siting guidance is ignored.

The 2024 regulation changed its core mission from protecting eagles to handing out permits for wind energy projects with unlimited authorization to kill eagles without consequences.

Before retiring, I served 25 years with the Fish and Wildlife Service enforcing federal wildlife laws. Wind energy projects have always posed a threat to birds and bats, and yet, in the past our personnel were instructed not to enforce existing wildlife protection laws against this industry, even though they would be enforced against other energy producers, such as oil and gas.

In my opinion and experience, the 2024 eagle permitting regulation does not contribute to the conservation of eagles, but rather authorizes, without any consequence, wind energy projects to kill eagles.

The Trump administration’s August guidance aimed at forcing wind energy projects to comply with the law is a good start. But it will also be necessary to amend the 2024 Biden permitting regulations to protect our national symbol.

Biden effectively tried to give wind energy projects immunity from our existing laws to protect eagles, and that’s not why I went to work there, and probably not why anyone else does either.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villasenor did not respond directly to questions about the Fountain Wind project, but touted the governor’s renewable energy record in a statement.
Before Fountain Wind submitted its application with the CEC, local officials changed zoning laws to prohibit large wind facilities in the unincorporated sections of the county.
The board quietly voted to pull its permission to sell Fountain Wind water to be trucked to the site, foiling the supply plan Fountain Wind had listed in its opt-in application.
In March 2024, Fountain Wind submitted an alternative water plan to the agency, but it was too late.","“Why champion a state permitting process that does authorize a local override if you’re not going to wield it?’ said Alex Jackson, executive director of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy trade group. “In the face of federal attacks on wind and rising demand, the case for grabbing every zero-carbon electron in California could not be stronger right now.”

In June 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a major budget trailer bill that was a key step in California’s yearslong effort to pare down its notoriously byzantine permitting processes. AB 205 created an optional permitting process that would allow large renewable energy projects to get the green light from the CEC, effectively sidestepping local advocates who have become so effective at wielding county-level laws to mothball construction.

But three years later, developers are still facing a lengthy review process. The centerpiece 270-day review timeline only kicks off once the CEC determines that an application is complete. It’s taken the CEC about a year on average to make that determination for the four projects that have made it that far in the opt-in process. The second longest-tenured project in the pipeline, a solar and battery project in Imperial County, applied over 530 days ago and still hasn’t received its stamp of approval that its application is complete.

Long timelines are nothing new, especially in California policymaking circles. But the delays, and the fact that CEC staff cited local opposition in its recommendation to spike the Fountain Wind project, have frustrated renewable energy industry leaders, who are saying the state will never meet its ambitious clean energy goals at this pace. Meanwhile, developers are facing a hostile federal government as the Trump administration continues its assault on wind and solar projects.

“Do you think that I’m going to commit to a 10-year, multi-million-dollar development process with the risk that the county supervisors three elections down the road don’t think it’s appropriate?” said Michael Rucker, CEO of renewable energy company Scout Clean Energy, which is currently constructing a wind farm in the hills south of San Jose. “The CEC’s action puts the development prospects for wind energy, at a time when the state needs it very much, just on ice.”

The industry’s concerns have found receptive ears in Sacramento.

SB 254, state Sen. Josh Becker’s (D) sprawling bill to rein in electricity rates, contains language that would establish a presumption under the AB 205 system that the facilities’ construction would economically benefit local governments, reversing the current dynamic, which has a higher bar for developers to demonstrate those benefits. It would also extend the application window deadline from 2029 to 2034, make smaller projects eligible, and give the CEC a 30-day deadline to ask for additional information after it receives records from applicants.

Becker said his goal is to improve on the initial AB 205 framework, which, in his view, has been “been working well in some cases, and not as well in others.” He views the bill through the popular “abundance” framework of trying to strike the right balance between protecting the environment while getting projects approved more quickly.

“If we just have years and years of delays … it just adds costs to the system,” Becker said.

In a statement, CEC spokesperson Stacey Shepard said that the opt-in program is working as intended, delivering a faster, predictable timeline for reviewing California energy projects. It brought the Fresno County Darden Clean Energy Project across the permitting finish line within the 270 day window, has three others with complete applications in the opt-in pipeline, and five more in the prefiling stage, representing 2,800 megawatts of new generation and 4,800 MW of storage capacity.

Shepard defended the application timelines, saying that Fountain Wind got booted from the 270-day clock due to a change in its water-supply plan, and that there is no time limit restricting how long it takes the CEC to deem an application complete.

“Prior to the application being deemed complete, the onus is on the applicant to provide the information to CEC, and CEC has no control over how long an applicant may take to do so,” Shepard said.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villasenor did not respond directly to questions about the Fountain Wind project, but touted the governor’s renewable energy record in a statement.

“Under Governor Newsom’s leadership, California has expedited more clean energy projects than ever before — helping the state add record energy capacity to our grid, at the fastest pace in our history,” Villasenor said. “We’re not slowing down any time soon.”

The Fountain Wind saga

Fountain Wind’s developers began their effort to erect 71 wind turbines on about 4,500 acres of land in unincorporated Shasta County by submitting an application to local officials. In June 2021, county planning staffers filed a report supporting the project.

But Mary Rickert, then a member of the Shasta County Board of Supervisors, wasn’t convinced. She remembers the Fountain Fire, which ripped through the region in the ‘90s, destroying hundreds of homes. She feared that the 679-foot-tall turbines would prevent first responders from effectively fighting fire from the air if another blaze ignited.

“The last thing we want is something that hampers us in fighting a fire,” Rickert said.

Many of her neighbors agreed. So did the county planning commission, which voted to deny permission to the project. The board of supervisors, Rickert included, shot down the project when its developers appealed to their body. It looked like the local opposition had killed Fountain Wind.

But then the CEC opt-in program launched along with the promise that state permissions would supersede any local rulings. Fountain Wind’s developer — a company called ConnectGen which has since been acquired by Spanish energy developer Repsol — jumped at the opportunity, filing paperwork with the CEC in January 2023.

The county wasn’t walking away without a fight.

Before Fountain Wind submitted its application with the CEC, local officials changed zoning laws to prohibit large wind facilities in the unincorporated sections of the county. Nonetheless, the Fountain Wind bid proceeded at the CEC, and in October 2023, the agency deemed the application complete, beginning the 270-day clock for it to make a decision on the project. But locals still had one more card up their sleeve.

Rickert and her allies had approached the mostly-volunteer board of the Burney Water District, serving the nearby community of about 3,000 people. The board quietly voted to pull its permission to sell Fountain Wind water to be trucked to the site, foiling the supply plan Fountain Wind had listed in its opt-in application.

“As a community whole, we just didn’t want to be taken advantage of just so we would have the windmills in our backyards and no real benefit to the community,” said David Barry, the water district president.

Shasta County representatives notified the CEC of the water situation in November 2023. In March 2024, Fountain Wind submitted an alternative water plan to the agency, but it was too late. That month, the CEC notified the developer that due to the “substantial change” in the water supply, the agency was extending its review timeline and would not decide on the project within the 270-day deadline.

When the CEC published its staff assessment in March 2025, officials recommended that the agency’s leadership deny the project. To override local laws, like the Shasta County large wind facility prohibition, the project had to clear the standard of being necessary for public convenience and necessity. It didn’t, officials concluded, and a battery energy storage system would be “a more prudent and feasible alternative.”

“While we respect the work of the [CEC] staff, Repsol disagrees with the recommendation in its Draft Environmental Impact Report regarding the Fountain Wind Project,” spokesperson Christi Shafer said in a statement. “We believe the project offers a meaningful opportunity to safely and responsibly contribute to the state’s and Repsol’s clean energy commitments.”

The CEC is scheduled to make a final decision on whether or not to greenlight the project during its October business meeting, according to its spokesperson Shepard.

The specter that Fountain Wind’s application will be denied has infuriated renewable energy advocates, spurring them to shop around a laundry list of further opt-in streamlining measures to lawmakers. At the same time, SB 254 and AB 531, which would expand the CEC’s authority to certify geothermal power plants, both remain in play as the end of the legislative session approaches Sept. 12.

Meanwhile, some local government advocates say they never liked the opt-in process in the first place, and they’ll fight the moves to expand the state’s jurisdiction.

“We need to retain discretion over projects that are occurring within our jurisdictional boundaries,” said John Kennedy, a senior policy advocate with Rural County Representatives of California, which represents the state’s 40 rural counties. When the state overrules county regulations, it can leave locals feeling “embittered by projects that come in and don’t take their concerns into consideration,” he said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F90%2Fe2%2F74e07c9c4b9ebfa73834ab1e24c3%2Fclimate-national-action-plans-63215.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 17:00:40.568241

The vast majority of Massachusetts cities and towns — 298 out of 351 — have already earned the Green Community designation.
The first Green Communities were designated in 2010, and more than 30 of those communities have received more than $1 million in aid since receiving their designation, according to Casey.
But Chair Dan Fox suggested that the town may want to consider the complication presented by the MBTA Communities Act noncompliance, in terms of when the town files its Green Communities application.
The purpose of Casey’s presentation was to introduce the concepts, solicit feedback on the draft vehicle policy and answer board members’ initial questions.","Marblehead may soon check off the final boxes to gain official recognition as a “Green Community,” opening the door to a state grant program that has awarded $54 million for energy conservation and decarbonization projects over the past 15 years.

But this is yet another area where the town’s noncompliance with the MBTA Communities Act may prevent the town from reaping the full benefits of attaining Green Community status.

At the Aug. 13 Select Board meeting, Sustainability Coordinator Logan Casey gave an overview of the state program and discussed a draft fuel-efficient vehicle procurement policy for town departments, the adoption of which is one of three tasks that remain before the town can submit its Green Communities application.

Another of those tasks is in the Light Commission’s purview: adopting a renewable energy surcharge, which would add $5 or $6 per year to the electric bills of the average family of four, Casey explained. Discussions with the commission are ongoing, he noted.

The vast majority of Massachusetts cities and towns — 298 out of 351 — have already earned the Green Community designation. Marblehead is late to the party through no fault of its own, Casey told the Current, as the town only recently became eligible to apply.

“Since Marblehead has a municipal light plant and does not get service from the state’s investor-owned utilities, there wasn’t technically a way for us to enter into the program until late 2022, and the final regulations weren’t officially approved until March 2024,” he explained.

The first Green Communities were designated in 2010, and more than 30 of those communities have received more than $1 million in aid since receiving their designation, according to Casey.

Cities and towns can use the funds they receive on any number of energy conservation measures, including weatherization, insulation, HVAC equipment, lighting and building controls, electric vehicles and charging stations, and technical support and training.

Upon earning their Green Community designation, cities and towns become immediately eligible to receive an initial award of $150,000 to $170,000, Casey explained. Then every six months, municipalities are invited to submit proposals for competitive grants, with up to $225,000 available in each round of funding.

But when the board opened the floor for public comment, Bayview Road resident Isaac Chute asked the million-dollar — or at least several-hundred-thousand-dollar — question: Would the town still be eligible for those Green Communities grants, given its noncompliance with G.L.c. 40A, §3A?

Casey replied that the state Department of Energy Resources would “definitely consider” MBTA Communities Act noncompliance when reviewing applications to the semiannual competitive grant program, suggesting that the town would be out of luck.

The initial $150,000-plus designation grant is in more of a “gray area,” Casey added. He pledged to seek out more definitive guidance from state officials and provide an update when the topic is revisited at a future Select Board meeting.

The next deadline to apply for Green Community status is December, and Casey believes the town will be able to meet that deadline. But Chair Dan Fox suggested that the town may want to consider the complication presented by the MBTA Communities Act noncompliance, in terms of when the town files its Green Communities application.

Vehicle policy

Under the draft fuel-efficient vehicle procurement policy, town departments would be directed to purchase “the most sustainable vehicle option,” be it a fully electric or hybrid vehicle, as “non-exempt” municipal vehicles are being replaced.

Vehicles that would be exempt from the policy would include heavy-duty vehicles, like fire trucks, ambulances and public works vehicles.

Instead, the policy would target light-duty vehicles, which comprise about half of the town’s 178-vehicle fleet, Casey reported. The town had already embraced the concept of a “a zero-emission municipal fleet policy” in its 2023 Net Zero Roadmap, Casey noted.

Transitioning away from gas-powered vehicles would not only save money on fuel, but it would also improve local air quality and public health, Casey said. Electric and hybrid vehicles also typically require less maintenance than their conventional counterparts, Casey added.

If adopted, the policy would take effect in fiscal year 2027, which begins July 1, 2026.

Casey also briefly touched on the other box the town would need to check to apply to be a Green Community: creating an energy reduction plan. The plan would be composed of building-specific strategies and projects to reduce energy use. A consultant, PowerOptions, is in the process of developing a draft plan, which should be ready for review in October, Casey said.

The purpose of Casey’s presentation was to introduce the concepts, solicit feedback on the draft vehicle policy and answer board members’ initial questions.

In response to a question from board member Erin Noonan, Casey reported that the town currently has two fully electric vehicles, while hybrid Ford Interceptors make up a significant portion of the Marblehead Police Department’s fleet.

Board members, Casey and Town Administrator Thatcher Kezer discussed both the up-front cost of purchasing electric or hybrid vehicles and the cost to keep them fueled. While federal tax credits for purchasing EVs may be going away, the Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles, or MOR-EV, program should be here to stay, Casey noted.

Kezer noted that the cost of fueling his personal EV is about one-third the cost of gassing up his previous conventional vehicle.",https://marbleheadcurrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-at-4.02.14-PM-1.png,N,,2025-08-17 17:00:18.321877

The move taken by the Arizona Corporation Commission sets the stage for utilities to meet surging demand from data centers, new computer chip plants and population growth by keeping old coal plants online and building a fleet of new natural gas plants.

That's a step that the state's largest utility, Arizona Public Service, has already taken for coal by ending its commitment to shutter a big New Mexico plant by 2031. And it and several other utilities, including Tucson Election Power, are embracing new gas pipelines and plants, despite solar power being a cheaper option.

The commission's move came a week after APS reneged on its 2020 pledge to get 100% of its power from zero-carbon sources by 2050, with 65% coming from clean sources by 2030.

CEO Ted Geisler said on an Aug. 6 earnings call for parent company Pinnacle West Capital Corp. that the utility would completely ditch its 2030 promise and only commit to be ""carbon-neutral'' by 2050. That means that instead of eliminating all plants that emit carbon dioxide its new sources of the planet-warming gas won't add to its total current emissions.

Tucson Electric Power hasn't changed its renewable energy goals. The utility, owned by Canadian utility company Fortis, promised in 2020 that it would retire its coal plants by 2032 and get more than 70% of its power from solar and wind by 2035. Its goal is to reduce carbon emissions, which are tied to climate change, by more than 70% by 2035.

But TEP joined with APS, Unisource Energy Services, the Salt River Project and the city of Mesa earlier this month and committed to buying natural gas from a new pipeline from Texas expected to be open by the end of the decade. APS and SRP are already developing big new gas plants. And SRP is acting on its own as it isn't regulated by the commission and not subject to its renewable energy requirements.

The backtracking on clean energy by the commission and APS come after the GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump eliminated tax breaks for electric cars and solar and wind power as part of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill'' tax and spending law he signed on July 4.

Environmental and renewable energy advocates called the commission's move to eliminate the renewable energy mandate ""misguided'' and ""shortsighted'' and let fly with a slew of other arrows as the commission heard comment on the proposal last week.

But the five Republicans who sit on the Corporation Commission were unmoved. They voted unanimously Thursday to initiate a formal repeal of the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules adopted in 2006.

And they pushed back on criticisms that repealing the REST standards will lead to the death of the solar industry in the state. Instead, they argued the repeal will end subsidies that they say consumers are forced to pay for clean power and actually lower bills while allowing utilities to invest in solar and wind when they make the most economic sense.

""I think there's a lot of doom and gloom narrative that people throw out there,'' Commission Chairman Kevin Thompson said before the vote. ""We hear a lot of teeth gnashing anytime we touch subsidies and anytime we really try to help ratepayers at large.

""And what I heard from (Arizona Public Service) is that potentially millions and millions of extra dollars are being put on the backs of APS ratepayers to meet mandates and we're stuck with these artificially high rates for decades,'' Thompson said. ""And we know that TEP and UNS are probably in the same boat.''

Nick Myers, vice chair of the panel, agreed it was time to scrap the standard.

""Utilities should have the flexibility to choose the most cost-effective energy mix to deliver reliable, affordable service — without being burdened by government-imposed rules that ultimately increase costs for customers,'' he said.

Several commissioners pointed to the Solana Generating Station solar plant, which was built just after the standards were adopted. APS buys all the power at about 15 cents per kilowatt hour, far more than the 2.5 cents current solar plant cost. APS attorney Jeff Allmon told commissioners.

The commission's 2006 rules mandated that the state's electric utilities get at least 15% of their power from renewables like solar and wind by this year, with 30% of that coming from ""distributed energy'' sources like rooftop solar. Thompson and another commissioner campaigned on eliminating the REST rules, saying they increase regulatory burden and costs for utilities - and their customers.

Power companies like APS are now above that level, but not by a lot. Annual reports filed with the commission show APS got 16% of its total retail power sales from solar and wind sources in 2024, while TEP got just under 23%.

Last week's votes kick off a long process of ""rulemaking"" to repeal the renewable energy standards. Final repeal could come next year, and the 5-0 commission vote signals the rules will almost certainly be adopted.

But Lea Marquez Petersen, another member of the commission, said none of this means solar is dead in Arizona. She said many of the companies coming to Arizona like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have their own clean energy goals.

""Based upon market demands and the low cost of solar, I believe that renewable energy will continue to thrive in Arizona without a renewable energy mandate,'' she said.

Legal fight possible

Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes pledged to fight the effort, calling it illegal because the commission is abdicating its constitutional duty to set just and reasonable rates. Mayes sat on the Commission as a Republican when the REST standards were adopted.

In a letter to the commission, Mayes noted that the commission staff's own analysis of the repeal proposal ""concedes that doing so will harm Arizonans. Bills will likely increase for individuals and for businesses.''

Growth in the vibrant renewables industry, which employs nearly 10,000 workers, could stall, and tax revenue going to local and state government could drop, she wrote. The industry is already facing headwinds from the repeal of tax credits in place for years.

The benefits to the utility industry, lower regulatory and administrative costs, ""pale in comparison,'' she wrote. She said the move is also illegal because the original REST rules were passed in a full-blow rate case but the commission is repealing them through administrative rulemaking.

In an interview, Mayes said her office won't sit back and watch the commission undo the rules.

""We'll see whether we have to sue,'' she told Capitol Media Services. ""They are going to be going through a long rulemaking process here that we will engage on, and we will make every argument for why they should not repeal the REST rules.''

Mayes ticked off a series of concerns about eliminating the renewable energy mandate, concluding that APS and other utilities would stop expanding their solar and wind investments to focus on natural gas plants.

They also have a financial incentive to do so, because owning and building a gas plant is far more lucrative: The cost of building gas plants gets folded into electricity rates, essentially passing the costs on to customers.

""There's a reason the utilities want to build natural gas plants more than they want to build renewable energy,"" Mayes said. ""And that's because they make more money off of that kind of plant.''

The commission's vote to end the REST rule comes just four years after commissioners nearly adopted a rule mandating 100% clean energy by 2050.

Power demand rising

Clean energy advocates testified Thursday against the repeal, noting that with huge new power demand expected from data centers and computer chip plants, utilities will soon slip below the 15% target for renewable power as they build new gas plants.

""Given the load growth projected by the (utilities), the plans to spend approximately $5.3 billion on a new gas pipeline, and APS's recent announcement that they are reneging on all of their clean energy goals, there is absolutely no certainty that the utilities will remain at 15%'' Autumn Johnson of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association told commissioners.

More concerning for consumers, she said, is that natural gas is subject to wild price surges — and wind and solar are not. About half the state's power currently comes from gas plants.

""This over-reliance on these specific technologies, all of which have out of state supply chains, is a vulnerability for Arizona,''Johnson said. ""It also can have unexpected and dramatic impacts on costs, as many of you witnessed firsthand.''

Besides APS's Aug. 6 announcement that it was ending it's 2020 commitment to be carbon free by 2050, the company also ditched its plan to shut down the big coal-fired Four Corners Power Plant in New Mexico seven years early.

Although APS is walking back the closing date, a spokesman said Friday the newly announced 2038 closure plan isn't set in stone.

""We expect that our exit from coal will be no later than 2038, consistent with the end of operations under our Four Corners lease,'' spokesman Mike Philipsen said in an email. ""Coal is an important part of our balanced energy mix today, and we will not exit it any earlier than is in the best interests of our customers to ensure reliable service at the lowest cost possible.''

Philipsen said the company's decision to end its clean energy by 2050 pledge was driven by the need to ensure reliable energy at the lowest cost amid surging demand. Removing the 2030 goals was done for the same reason.

""The interim goals have been removed to better match our near-term resource needs, which include natural gas along with renewable and clean energy projects,'' he said.

'Going in the wrong direction'

All that said, Philipsen said APS remains committed to renewable energy, if it is reliable and cost competitive.

""Clean-energy resources — such as solar paired with battery-energy storage — that provide a 'best-fit, least-cost' solution to serving our customers (as demonstrated through our competitive all-source request for proposals process) will continue to be a key part of how we provide reliable service at the lowest cost possible for our customers,'' he said.

Philipsen put solar and wind power total at 19% of APS' electricity supply. And with the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station west of Phoenix, 54% its power comes from carbon-free sources.

""Arizona is growing fast and we're making sure we're planning for the increased energy demand we anticipate in the future,'' he wrote in the email. ""By 2038, APS customers will require more than 13,000 MW of energy to serve peak needs, a staggering 60% increase over today's peak demand which took APS 140 years to reach since it first began serving customers.''

A megawatt is enough to power about 160 homes. APS has broken its own peak energy demand records three times this summer.

APS has 1.4 million customers in 11 Arizona counties. TEP supplies electricity to nearly 560,000 homes and businesses in Pima County while Unisource, also a subsidiary of Fortis, have more than 107,000 customers in Mohave and Santa Cruz counties.

For Mayes and other clean energy advocates, that growth is another reason to boost the supply of renewable energy, the least expensive source of new power today at less than 4 cents a kilowatt hour. Arizona's average retail power price for residential customers was just under 16 cents a kilowatt hour in May, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

By comparison, retail residential rates per kilowatt hour in California sit at 35 cents, Nevada at 13.3, Utah at 12.6 and New Mexico at 14.6 cents.

Mayes said both the commission and APS should be embarrassed by their moves.

""Frankly, it's pathetic that these commissioners would attempt to eliminate the renewable energy standard. It's embarrassing,'' she said.

""It is absolutely going in the wrong direction, and it's not where other states are, but certainly it's where Donald Trump is,'' the attorney general added. ""So one can imagine, that's why they're a part of the reason why they're doing it.''

As for APS, she said their move to end their commitment to renewable energy is bad for consumers, especially after five years of promoting its clean energy commitment.

""It tells me that this utility doesn't give a damn about its consumers,'' she said.

""And you know, it just spent a whole lot of time greenwashing itself,'' Mayes said. ""And it's got a commission that is doing it's bidding in a lot of different ways. So, yeah, APS should be ashamed of itself.''

""President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions.","California and its California Air Resources Board (CARB) are facing yet another legal challenge following last week's lawsuit filed by several major truck OEMs over the former's Clean Truck Partnership.

[Related: OEMs file lawsuit over 'backdoor' enforcement of banned CARB regs]

The Department of Justice announced last Friday it filed two complaints in federal court against CARB's enforcement of the emissions standards set for OEMs in the Clean Truck Partnership (CTP), which was signed in 2023.

The DOJ is making its case by claiming federal law overrides state regulations, at least when it comes to setting certain environmental policies. In this situation, the DOJ argues that the Clean Air Act ""preempts state regulation of vehicle emissions unless the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grants California a preemption waiver,"" which it did under the previous Biden administration.

Last June, President Trump invalidated the EPA's preemption waivers for CARB's heavy-duty truck regulations, claiming it would be impossible for the state to enforce its own regulations.

Enter the controversial Clean Truck Partnership.

This was California’s so-called “backdoor” legal tactic of last resort—essentially a handshake agreement that CARB claims still binds OEMs to follow its emissions regulations, even though those regulations have been officially revoked.

Both the DOJ and major OEMs are now legally challenging the CTP's legitimacy. The DOJ's Environmental and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) filed motions to intervene specifically with two pending cases: in the Eastern District of California and Northern District of Illinois.

""Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate—whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of ENRD. ""President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions. CARB must respect the democratic process and stop enforcing unlawful standards.""

Alongside its California lawsuit, the ENRD moved to dismiss two related cases in the Ninth Circuit, where industry groups had challenged the EPA’s preemption waivers for passenger vehicles.

DOE Selects 11 Firms for Advanced Reactor Pilot Program

The Department of Energy has selected 11 developers of micro and small modular reactor to participated in its Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program. Except for Last Energy, which is developing a 20 MWe PWR, and Deep Fission, whichs is developing a 15 MWe PWR, all the other choices are advanced reactors that will require TRISO or other forms of HALEU fuel.

The Reactor Pilot Program establishes a new DOE pathway for advanced reactor demonstration to fast-track commercial licensing. The program aims to leverage DOE’s authority to expedite the research and development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies with the larger goal of reaching criticality for at least three advanced nuclear reactor concepts located outside of the national laboratories by July 4, 2026.

Typical materials used in a an advanced microreactor. A heat-pipe microreactor (HP-MR) is used as an example. Note that every microreactor design is unique. Image: Argonne National Laboratory, “Materials for Microreactor Applications. “

DOE will initially work with 11 advanced reactor projects to move their technologies towards deployment. DOE will work with industry on these 11 projects, with the goal to construct, operate, and achieve criticality of at least three test reactors using the DOE authorization process by July 4, 2026.

DOE is not providing any funding for to these companies for their participation in the program. Each company will be responsible for all costs associated with designing, manufacturing, constructing, operating, and decommissioning their test reactors. DOE has made no promises for future funding for any of the participant nor for the three or more reactors that achieve criticality by July 2026.

There is great variability among the 11 designs chosen by DOE in terms of technology readiness levels. Some exist only on virtual drawing boards while others are racing toward building their first prototypes. All of the firms selected jumped at the chance to gain competitive advantages via the DOE program even if all of the costs are borne by their investors with no support of any kind from the govenment other than a place to land.

DOE announced the Reactor Pilot Program in June 2025, following the release of Executive Order 14301, which reforms reactor testing at the Department. The goal of the Reactor Pilot Program is to expedite the testing of advanced reactor designs that will be authorized by the Department at sites that are located outside of the national laboratories.

Seeking DOE authorization provided under the Atomic Energy Act will help the selected companies to unlock private funding and provide a fast-tracked approach to future commercial licensing activities with the NRC.

Opinion

Is DOE Fish Farming for Minows

When it Needs to Deploy Fleets of Whales?

DOE’s decision to select 11 microreactor firms to spend their investors’ money in pursuit of achieving a political flavored milestone of achieving first criticality by July 4, 2026, is not doing the nuclear industry any favors. There is no promise of future funding for any of the three firms that cross the finish line first. All of them will eventually face the cost and time of licensing their designs with the NRC.

What DOE ought to be doing if the agency is really serious about deploying 25GW of nuclear power by 2050 is to figure out how to get the cost of construction of GW class reactors, e.g., 1,000MW or more, under control.

No utility worth its stock price is going to commit to new GW class projects without project controls that will be effective to prevent a repeat of the cost overuns and schedule delays that were recorded for building the twin AP1000s at Vogtle.

Additionally, DOE’s priority endeavor also needs to include spooling up a supply chain that can cost effectively deliver the components that are used to build GW class reactors including LWR RPVs, steam systems, turbines, generators, and switchyard transformers. The current wait time for these components is stretching out in ways that make future large reactor project look to be unsustainable for publicly owned utilities.

On the point of supply chains, with the great variety of microreactor designs, every one of them will confront the challenge to their burn rates of the high costs of one-off fabrications of their first of a kind units with no guarantee for them or their suppliers of the economies of scale that would occur using much promoted concept of factory production of these designs.

In point of fact, the great variety of design specifications for 11 microreactors is a nightmare for suppliers. It will likely drive some suppliers to make choices about which customers they will work for based on which ones are willing to pay the highest premium for one-off fabrication purchase orders.

DOE’s concept of rolling out 11 of these projects looks like a old style DOD “bake off” for new weapons systems like fighter jets and munitions. The difference is DOD paid its contractors to play the government’s game.

DOE’s pursuit of three microreactors to achieve first criticality by next year (July 4, 2026) is a horse race without a purse and a distraction from the long term goal of decarbonizing America’s grid.

NextEra Updates NRC on Duane Arnold Restart Plans

(WNN)

The company presented an overview of the current status and its plans for the proposed restart of the shuttered plant in slides submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) ahead of an August 7, 2025, Pre-Submittal Meeting at the NRC. (NextEra slides – PDF file)

Planned restart activities will restore the plant to its previous operating license condition at 2020 shutdown. Planned plant modifications include new cooling towers, restoration of in-scope transmission lines, new office and warehouse buildings, and upgrades to the sewage treatment system upgrade. Plans also include dredging of the water intake from the Cedar River.

The company said in the slides, “Under NEPA [the National Environmental Policy Act], it is anticipated that NRC will prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) for this restart,”

The firm said in its slides NextEra Energy Duane Arnold, LLC will coordinate with the NRC Environmental Project Manager regarding the need for an environmental review document, and the subject areas to cover; and, “will submit an environmental review document (tentatively in October 2025) that focuses on restart activities useful for the NRC’s NEPA review. It anticipates that a final EA and Finding of No Significant Impact will be issued within 12 months of acceptance of an environmental submittal.”

NextEra Energy recently filed a request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking to reclaim interconnection rights that were previously transferred from the shut down Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Iowa to a solar energy project: about 40 acres of the Duane Arnold site are now occupied by a solar farm.

The 610 MWe boiling water reactor plant, owned and operated by NextEra Energy Duane Arnold, LLC located in Linn County, Iowa, which includes the city of Cedar Rapids, IA, commenced commercial operation in 1974.

Although currently licensed for operations until 2034, the Duane Arnold plant ceased operations in 2020 and is currently “idled and in decommissioning status”, but in January, the company submitted documents including a restart overview and regulatory path to reauthorization of power operations.

Since it was shut, all the plant’s used fuel has been transferred to its Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation, and most major plant systems have been drained and deenergized. Training and administrative buildings have been removed, as have the mechanical draft cooling towers, and generator output transformer and in-scope transmission lines, but the main power block buildings remain intact.

NextEra took the initial decision to move forward with D&D of the plant after a storm severely damaged the plant’s cooling towers in August 2020.

X-Energy Gets USAF Deal to Develop its HTGR

X-energy has entered into an agreement with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Department of the Air Force to further develop its commercial microreactor technology.

The company said it will lead efforts to demonstrate microreactors designed to supply secure, resilient energy to defense infrastructure and remote microgrids. Under the agreement, X-energy will receive support to advance the design and development of its XENITH microreactor.

The agreement supports continued design and development for the X-energy XENITH microreactor under the Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program, an initiative led by DIU in partnership with the Department of the Air Force.

The program is designed to accelerate the deployment of next-generation microreactor technologies to provide resilient, secure power at military installations, and enables governmental sponsors like the Department of the Air Force to engage with X-energy under a flexible contracting mechanism that allows for faster development and deployment of commercial nuclear systems.

The XENITH microreactor was initially developed for the DOD’s mobile microreactor, Project Pele. The high-temperature, gas-cooled microreactor (HTGR) will now enter an enhanced engineering phase to achieve preliminary design maturity. The company will also begin pre-licensing discussions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for both military and commercial applications.

In addition to XENITH, X-energy is advancing the deployment of its Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor as a grid-scale energy solution for utilities, industrial customers, and hyperscalers. The company is also constructing a first-in-the-nation advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility to manufacture its proprietary TRISO-X fuel.

Equinix Signs Off on Three Nuclear Deals for 750 MW of Power for Data Centers

(Data Center Dynamics) (World Nuclear News) US data center giant Equinix has expanded its commitment to nuclear energy, announcing three major agreements with advanced nuclear developers that together could provide up to 774MWe of power.

Only one firm selected by Equinix is based on the US. The other two are in Europe which appear to be a part of a pattern of flight of data centers from the US to Europe given the increasing levels of turmoil in the US government.

A sovereign cloud is a cloud computing solution that ensures data remains within a country’s borders and complies with local laws. By adhering to strict regulations, sovereign clouds provide enhanced security and data governance crucial for industries like government, healthcare, and finance

Some firms, like Google and Amazon, are setting up what are called “sovereign clouds” in European nations and elsewhere to protect their operations, assets, and customer data from the possibility of U.S government uncontrolled intrusion or even interruption of their operations in the US.

First Deal – The first deal was with Radiant Nuclear, a microreactor company based in El Segundo, CA. Equinix will purchase 20 Kaleidos microreactors, each designed to produce 1.2MWe and 3MWth.

The Kaleidos is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) that uses TRISO fuel, a helium gas coolant, and prismatic graphite blocks. Radiant says its modular containerized system can be deployed to deliver on-site power within days of completing it production of the unit(s) order by the customer.

Radiant is currently in pre-application talks with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and was recently named one of 11 projects in the US Department of Energy’s Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program. The company has completed front-end engineering and experiment design for a Kaleidos prototype, aiming for lab testing as early as mid-2026. It has not yet been disclosed where the microreactors will be deployed.

Second Deal – The second agreement is a Letter of Intent with ULC-Energy for a Power Purchase Agreement of up to 250MWe to power its data centers in the Netherlands. ULC-Energy, based in Amsterdam, is the exclusive Dutch development partner for Rolls-Royce SMR and selected the company’s 470MWe light water small modular reactor as its preferred technology in 2022.

The Rolls-Royce SMR is currently undergoing the Generic Design Assessment process with UK regulators and is targeting grid connection around 2030. In June, Rolls-Royce was named the preferred partner for Great British Energy in developing SMRs.

Third Deal – Equinix’s third deal is also its biggest and is a pre-order power agreement with Stellaria, a French nuclear company, for 500MWe to supply data centers across Europe. Founded in June 2023 by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and Schneider Electric, Stellaria is developing the world’s first molten salt Breed & Burn reactor. The design focus is for the reactor to run on low enriched uranium.

The 250MWe design breeds all of its liquid fissile fuel internally, recycles spent fuel, and burns long-life waste without refueling. Each Stellaria reactor is designed to produce 250 MWe of electricity and steam at 600F for process heat applications. The first fission reaction is targeted for 2029, with commercial operations planned for 2035.

In June, Stellaria raised €23 million ($26.8 million) to accelerate R&D, double its workforce, and complete development of its liquid-core fast-neutron reactor demonstrator. The funding round was co-led by At One Ventures and Supernova Invest, alongside CEA Investments, Schneider Electric, Exergon, and Technip Energies.

Last April, Equinix signed a pre-agreement with Oklo to procure up to 500MW of power from future fast fission plants.

Final Investment Decision Delayed for NuScale SMR in Romania

(NucNet) The final investment decision for a 462 MW small modular reactor (SMR) at a former coal plant site in Romania could be delayed to early 2027, according to John Hopkins, chief executive officer of US-based reactor developer NuScale.

RoPower Nuclear, the joint venture established for the SMR project, intends to use NuScale’s technology for the facility in Doicesti, about 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest.

NuScale expected RoPower to make the final investment decision early in the second quarter of 2026 at the latest. It is scheduled to be made after the completion of the front-end engineering design (FEED) process. US engineering and construction company Fluor was hired for the job in July, with its subsidiary NuScale as a subcontractor.

“RoPower and the Romanian government continue to pay their bills, and we’re keeping our finger on the pulse and watching it very closely. We have almost weekly conversations on progress,” of the Feed study, Hopkins said. The final investment decision looks to be probably between mid-to-late 2026 and early 2027.”

RoPower Nuclear intends to deploy six 77 MW NuScale reactor modules at the planned facility. Deployment had originally been scheduled for around 2029.

The RoPower joint venture is undergoing a change in ownership. Its current owners, each with 50%, are state-controlled Nuclearelectrica, operator of Romania’s only nuclear plant, Cernavoda, and Nova Power and Gas, a subsidiary of E-Infra, a Romanian group of companies with operations in energy and telecom infrastructure, energy and civil construction.

Oklo and Lightbridge in Joint Effort to Manufacture Advanced Fuels

The two firms will Evaluate Additional Co-Location Opportunities for Manufacturing Advanced Fuels from Legacy Materials

Lightbridge Corporation (NASDAQ: LTBR), an advanced nuclear fuel technology company, and Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, announced a strategic collaboration to explore the potential co-location of a Lightbridge fuel fabrication facility within Oklo’s planned advanced fuel manufacturing facility.

This work is under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that was signed earlier this year. Oklo and Lightbridge are jointly assessing the feasibility of commercial-scale fuel fabrication within Oklo’s planned fuel manufacturing infrastructure.

This initiative aims to accelerate the commercialization of advanced nuclear fuels through joint fuel fabrication and research and development, including manufacturing fuel using repurposed plutonium from legacy materials. The proposed co-located facility would support the production of advanced fuels for both fast reactors and light water reactors.

The ANS Newswire reports notes that Oklo is developing fast fission power plant technology and advanced nuclear fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the DOE and national laboratories.

The firm plans to build a spent fuel reprocessing facility at the INL. Last year, the DOE approved the conceptual safety design report for Oklo’s Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility, to be located at the same site at the INL as the first commercial reactor. INL’s reactor R&D program is located on the Arco Desert about 50 miles west of Idaho Falls, ID.

The company received a DOE site use permit in 2019 to build and operate a prototype for its Aurora Powerhouse at Idaho National Laboratory. Aurora is a liquid metal–cooled fast reactor that Oklo intends to begin deploying commercially before the end of the decade. Last year, the DOE approved the conceptual safety design report for Oklo’s Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility, to be located at the same site as the first commercial reactor.

Jacob DeWitte, Co-Founder and CEO of Oklo, said, “This collaboration supports our efforts to bolster near- and mid-term advanced reactor fuel supplies with legacy materials such as down-blended uranium and repurposed plutonium.”

Virginia-based Lightbridge is developing Lightbridge Fuel, a next-generation nuclear fuel that could be used for existing LWRs and pressurized heavy water reactors, as well as future small modular reactors. According to the company, this fuel enhances reactor safety, economics, and proliferation resistance.

Lightbridge has two long-term framework agreements with Battelle Energy Alliance, the DOE’s operating contractor for INL. The company is also participating in university-led studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Texas A&M University through the DOE’s Nuclear Energy University Program.

Seth Grae, President and CEO of Lightbridge Corporation said, “This joint effort reflects a shared vision for a modern nuclear fuel cycle—one that supports both existing and advanced reactors and strengthens America’s energy resilience.”

Fermi America and ASP Isotopes Ink MOU for HALEU Fuel

Fermi America, developer of the 11 GW private grid campus for next-generation hyperscale AI in collaboration with the Texas Tech University System, announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ASP Isotopes Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPI) and its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE) to explore the development of a High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) enrichment facility at Fermi America’s site in Carson County, TX, near the city of Amarillo, TX.

The planned facility would use advanced laser-based isotope separation technology to produce HALEU — a specialized nuclear fuel essential for many Generation IV and small modular reactor (SMR) designs. With very few commercial HALEU suppliers currently operating in the Western world, the project is intended to strengthen U.S. and allied supply chains, reduce reliance on Russian enrichment, and accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

Fermi America’s private grid campus will be anchored by four AP1000 nuclear units using conventional fuel, with the potential to integrate advanced reactor technologies in future phases. These PWRs do not need HALEU. What they would provide is the power to make the advanced fuel through the laser process.

The addition of domestic HALEU production capability at the FERMI site would position the private grid as both a significant clean energy generator and a strategic nuclear fuel hub.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. HALEU demand could exceed 50 metric tons annually by 2035, with similar needs emerging in Europe and Asia. The proposed project would help meet this demand, supporting the clean energy transition while enhancing energy security.

Clean Core Thorium Energy Hits Fuel Testing Milestone at INL ATR with HALEU/Thorium Blend

Clean Core Thorium Energy (CCTE) a Chicago-based company developing thorium-based nuclear fuel, announced a milestone for its patented Advanced Nuclear Energy for Enriched Life (ANEEL) fuel, which it said has now reached a burnup level of over 45 gigawatt-days per metric ton in the advanced test reactor at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

This level, CCTE said, outpaces the capabilities of conventional nuclear fuels used in pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) and CANDU reactors – Canadian pressurized heavy-water reactor design used to generate electric power.

The fuel, the company said, uniquely combines thorium with HALEU to offer a safer, more efficient, and proliferation-resistant alternative for existing and future PHWR and other CANDU reactor fleets worldwide.

ATR Irradiation of ANEEL Fuel

In May 2024, twelve ANEEL fuel rodlets were loaded into the ATR for irradiation to achieve three burnup level targets. The first successful irradiation of four rodlets surpassed 20 GWd/MTU last year, the company said, adding that the second set of four rodlets have exceeded 45 GWd/MTU—six to seven times the average discharge burnup for PHWR/CANDU reactors that are designed to use natural uranium fuel.

The newly irradiated rodlets are currently cooling in the ATR water pool and will soon be transferred to INL’s materials and fuels complex for detailed post-irradiation examination. The final four rodlets will remain in the ATR for continued irradiation, with expected burnup levels exceeding 60 GWd/MTU, CCTE said.

“This second burnup milestone is a transformative moment for CCTE and for the future of nuclear energy,” CCTE Thorium Energy CEO Mehul Shah said in a news release.

“ANEEL fuel is not just demonstrating superior technical performance, it’s proving that thorium-based solutions can meaningfully address global challenges of energy security, nuclear waste, and proliferation,” Shah said. “Our partnership with INL is helping unlock a new era for advanced nuclear fuels.”

Fuel Potential Performance

The company said these results reflect ANEEL fuel’s potential to redefine performance and sustainability standards in the nuclear industry.

Dr. Koroush Shirvan, Head of Fuel Design at CCTE and Professor at MIT, added:

“The collection of this data positions ANEEL™ fuel as a prime candidate for near-term deployment in PHWRs”

“ANEEL’s performance in the ATR is a strong indicator of the promise thorium-based fuels hold in supporting future energy goals and diversifying the nuclear fuel landscape,” Dr. Michael Worrall, Technical Lead for the CCTE ATR Irradiation at INL.

In February, the privately-held company raised a $15.5M Series Seed round of financing to advance the ANEEL fuel – a patented blend of thorium and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) designed to be seamlessly deployed into existing reactors.

Thorium, weakly radioactive, silvery-white metal, has been hailed as a safer and cheaper alternative to uranium in nuclear reactors. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), thorium is three times more abundant in nature than uranium, but historically has found little use in power generation due to the significant economic and technical hurdles.

Change is unsettling to humans. We like to understand the world around us and to seamlessly be able to deal with what comes our way. Change is out of our control, though, and it can often happen very quickly. Transitions help us psychologically to make sense of change. Here’s an example. The Trump administration has done another TACO and relinquished funds for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program after all. Yeah, it’s got a few caveats, some dilution of former language, but federal funding for EV charging infrastructure is back on the proverbial table for US states.

This is important for many reasons. NEVI will offer existing EV drivers more and more confidence to charge reliably when they’re away from home. The new NEVI language encourages states to give their money to charging locations where the businesses that own the stations also own the ground below it. That NEVI provision that has piqued the interest of gas station and convenience store owners.

Why is this turn of events interesting? Because it offers more opportunities for diverse drivers to see EV charging in action, at their neighborhood stops, by people who seem like they’re enjoying their electron refills. Transitions are the key to accepting change. Smoothly-introduced change can make a difference in adjusting everyday people’s mindsets.

So NEVI will introduce new audiences to EVs in a familiar surrounding. Yeah, sure, gas stations aren’t ideal spaces, often dirty and smelly, and they do perpetuate the myth of endless low-cost energy. But gas stations and their associated convenience stores will offer one more way for consumers to make sense of the systemic change to all-electric transportation. Do you think the Trump administration realizes this?

That’s a transition and paradox that is another nail in the inevitable fossil fuel coffin.

The $5 billion in funding for US EV fast chargers will keep gas stations relevant as more and more consumers switch to EVs.

Why gas stations? The Trump administration says it wants to “accelerate project delivery.” Long distance travelers will recognize truck stop operators like Pilot Flying K, Love’s Travel Stops, and TravelCenters of America that are now part of NEVI charging infrastructure discussions. Convenience store chains like Sheetz, WaWa, and Kwik Trip are possibilities. Walmart’s name has been tossed around.

What EV driver doesn’t like to locate a fast charger in one of these brightly-lit parking lots that also features a marketplace, restaurant, restrooms, and indoor/ outdoor seating? It’s very civilized. It’s made all the difference in my own long-range EV road trips.

The Charge Ahead Partnership, a group that represents several convenience stores, truck stops, and fueling groups, endorsed moving ahead with the program because it promotes flexibility and can lead to charger growth. “Prioritizing chargers at locations where the site host is also the operator eliminates the step of the applicant having to find a site host, and it promotes greater accountability once the charger is operating,” spokesperson Ryan McKinnon elaborated.

Trump’s surrender to NEVI is definitely part of a much bigger picture. It’s been clear for several years that industrialized nations have been facing a triple challenge: increasing environmental degradation, socio-economic tensions, and political-cultural polarization. Even with Trump administration is tossed by this turmoil.

The NEVI About Face

The reopened federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide comes after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states. Threatened with cancellation, NEVI is ready to go, albeit with a few alterations. Of course, the Trump administration has removed any references to giving women or other underrepresented groups any advantage in the process — let’s keep propping up the white guys and calling it equity. Also, no longer do states have to worry about those pesky emergency evacuation plans or consumer protections as they’re assigning money for the charger installations.

The new Trump administration guidance does seem mostly like the original NEVI language. Sierra Club clean transportation head Katherine García poo-poohed the idea of any great revelation from the NEVI reissue, saying it’s just reiterating the existing law, and the freeze was really little more than the Trump administration’s attempt “to try to stall electric vehicle momentum.”

Insisting differently, the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) says it wants fewer hurdles for the companies that build charging stations. In that way, it can be a quicker turnaround from initial proposal to a whole slew of new charging stations open-and-ready for business.

States that already had plans in place now need to submit revised iterations for using the charger funding within 30 days. That’s a fast turnaround but workable if you want the cash. And states do. Aside from the core matter of EV sales, there is no topic more instrumental to the transition to electric vehicles than the topic of EV charging. It’s one of the first things anyone without an EV asks EV owners about, and it’s one of the most important factors everyone considers before going electric.

Why did it take the states so long to get new chargers up-and-running when Joe Biden was President? Federal money like this is accompanied by a whole list of of rules and requirements around everything from reliability to interoperability, to where stations can be located, to what certifications the workers installing the chargers need to have. In other words, as our mothers told us, good things take time. The newly revised NEVI paradigm gives a leg-up on gas stations and truck stops, which don’t have to go through a lengthy lease negotiation.

NEVI program allocations are different from grant money, which involve competition and awards for likely best future practices. Grants would have given the executive branch discretion over whether NEVI funds are distributed or not. Instead, it’s what’s called “formula funding,” which means that Congress allocated it to states based on a calculation. Each state gets a certain percentage of the total NEVI pool, as long as they follow the required steps, including making detailed plans for where they would put chargers and how.

We’re not hearing many of the derisive “electric vehicle mandate” phrases being bandied about anymore. Now it’s up to the states, many of whom won legal cases that promised funding must be forthcoming.

Moreover, there is also the stark realization that more than half of clean energy projects since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act were located in red states. Oops. The loss of investment and jobs had the real potential to hurt communities, and citizens turn quickly on their elected representatives once their wallet start to sting.

Add into that dynamic a White House under Biden that had championed an accelerated transition to clean energy. It seemed then that the world was at a tipping point following the buy-in of the Paris Agreement to keep the world warming no more than 1.5°C by 2030. NEVI also establishes an interconnected network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability.

But the US, in its former Biden-era enthusiasm and energy, failed to provide everyday folks with adequate introductions, tutorials, modeling, and 1-to-1 trainings about all things renewable. It seemed to many people like social and technological processes and participatory governance were going amok. EVs became an easy target for profitable gas companies. But change is a-comin’.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Nouria-Wareham-MA.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 17:00:49.083663

WASHINGTON (AP) — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency’s new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,” he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That’s a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university’s Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn’t make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.” She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and “a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,” Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, “gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa’s farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project “has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest” and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There’s also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were “carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it’s fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,” he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Rusch described the One Big Beautiful Bill as bad business and bad policy. He cited a previous analysis by the American Center for Progress, which found that the Inflation Reduction Act/IRA was projected to be net-generative of tax revenue by 2031, starting to turn positive in 2028 and adding $175 billion by that time. This figure was expected to balloon to over $500 billion in net tax revenue for the federal government by the middle of the next decade. Rusch explained that the residential market is now seeking a solution, particularly for the leasing elements of the 48 credits, which are crucial for financing residential solar systems. He highlighted that deploying solar plus energy storage at homes is more efficient for utilities and consumers than building new and expensive distribution and transmission lines.

Prior to this, on June 9, Solar Energy Industries Association/SEIA, along with Wood Mackenzie, in its Solar Market Insight/SMI report, detailed the performance of the US solar industry during Q1 2025. In the first quarter, the US solar industry installed 10.8 gigawatts-direct current/GWdc of capacity. This marked a 7% year-over-year decline and a 43% sequential decrease. Despite the decline, it was still the fourth-largest quarter on record. Solar power accounted for 69% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the US grid during this period. The US also saw an increase in domestic solar manufacturing, adding 8.6 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity in Q1, bringing the total to 51 GW. In January, ES Foundry opened a 1 GW cell factory in South Carolina, becoming only the second domestic cell manufacturer. However, the report notes that there was slow or non-existent growth in upstream manufacturing for polysilicon and wafers.

The report projected that the US solar industry will add an average of nearly 43 GWdc annually through 2030 in its base case forecast. This outlook, however, assumes that the proposed tax credit changes will not be enacted. While strong demand from data centers and other industries will drive growth, the industry is projected to contract by 2% annually between 2025 and 2030 and by an average of 7% from 2025 to 2027 due to policy uncertainty and rising costs. Growth is expected to resume in the second half of the outlook, from 2028 to 2030, driven by domestic supply chain shifts and increased energy demand.

AES Ohio in a press release stated intentions to increase customer rates by 9 percent per 1,000 kWh usage. The amount is a decrease from original plans which involved a 14 percent increase.

The announcement was part of AES Ohio reaching a potential settlement with Public Utilities Commission of Ohio staff and the Ohio Consumers’ Council on Wednesday.

The settlement would also see AES Ohio provide a $1 million funding commitment to provide assistance for residential customers that are either unable to pay their electric bills or possibly be facing disconnection.

J. P. Blackwood, an OCC public affairs liaison, stated the OCC pushed AES Ohio into not increasing its fixed customer charges, which will stay at $9.75 per month. Original plans would have seen those costs increase to $22 per month. All reconnection fees will also be eliminated, and those with electric vehicles will cover their own costs of charging those vehicles.

“This is a win for AES Ohio’s residential consumers,” Maureen Willis, Agency Director of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, in a statement. “This settlement keeps costs fair, helps families keep the lights on and should improve service for AES Ohio’s residential consumers.”

The additional funding would allow AES Ohio to help upgrade and replaces its electric infrastructure for what it describes as better safety and reliability.

The agreement still needs to be approved by a PUCO committee before being finalized. A hearing was set to be held on Thursday at the Dayton Municipal Building.

EV buses are so quiet, some national parks have introduced them not only to cut pollution, but to improve their birdwatching and wildlife sightseeing tours.","The winding, steep roads of Humboldt County, California, are getting a new form of public transport: fuel-cell buses.

New Flyer of America (NFI) has unveiled an extended range for its Xcelsior CHARGE FC, a hydrogen fuel cell electric bus that now boasts up to 370 miles on a single refuel.

""New Flyer has been a pioneer in hydrogen fuel cell bus technology for decades and continues to push the boundaries of clean transit innovation,"" reported Hydrogen Central.

This is a major development towards the widespread adoption of electric vehicles across the private and public transport sectors. Range is a common point of anxiety when considering electric alternatives, yet the technology just keeps getting better.

""With zero-emission buses, range matters, and this upgrade is a game-changer,"" said Chris Stoddart, president of NFI's North American Bus and Coach sector, per Hydrogen Central.

This innovation places hydrogen-powered transit squarely at the center of clean, efficient urban travel — even in hilly, more remote areas like Humboldt County — offering a real alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles, which contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and urban pollution.

Unlike gas-powered vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles emit only water vapor. Not only does this slash emissions, but it also improves daily life by reducing air and noise pollution.

Additional benefits for riders and city denizens include a smoother, quieter experience. EV buses are so quiet, some national parks have introduced them not only to cut pollution, but to improve their birdwatching and wildlife sightseeing tours. These vehicles are less likely to scare off animals or disrupt the experience of natural wonders.

One major incentive for city governments to prioritize mobility solutions is that fuel cell vehicles cut maintenance costs, thanks to fewer moving parts and more efficient energy use. For commuters, that means efficiency and lower fares. For cities, it means major savings.

""Mobility solutions should work for every community, whether in rural counties or growing cities,"" said Jennifer McNeill, vice president of sales and Marketing at NFI and Motorcoach Industries, per Hydrogen Central.

Widespread migration to electric vehicles is well underway — with EV makers like Tesla passing major sales milestones, and fuel-cell technology transforming transportation by ground, air, and sea. There is no better time to invest in your future by making your next car an EV.

Major money-saving rebates may be ending at the end of the year, so act soon with EnergySage for the chance to subsidize your vehicle and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

This has come as a shock to the Asian, European, and American automakers that have long dominated the Brazilian market.","As China continues to grow its electric vehicle (EV) industry, it has expanded to several new markets in recent years, opening multiple production and assembly plants across Latin America. Chinese EV companies now offer a wide variety of EV models at competitive prices, making them well-suited to the Latin American market, with a growing uptake of Chinese EVs being seen in Brazil and Mexico. However, while its Latin America prospects might be good, developing successful nearshoring activities for the United States market is less certain due to the ongoing trade war.

The Chinese EV production capacity has boomed in recent years thanks to favourable national policies, financial incentives, and easy access to parts. Chinese automakers are now projected to contribute 30 percent of global car sales by 2030, up from 21 percent in 2024.

China is in the fortunate position of controlling most of the EV component supply chain, from lithium to semiconductors and batteries. This has led to the launch of multiple Chinese EV-makers that can produce competitive and affordable vehicles. As these companies expand beyond the Asian market, one of the places where they are doing especially well is Latin America.

The Chinese EV manufacturer Build Your Dreams (BYD) has quickly risen to compete with several EV makers from around the globe, including Tesla, thanks to its advanced capabilities. BYD promises to offer consumers a full charge in just 5 minutes, similar to the time it takes to pump petrol, as well as offers ranges like those of high-end American and European EVs at a lower cost.

As BYD and other firms, such as Great Wall Motor and SAIC, look to expand, they are developing operations in Europe and Latin America. Great Wall Motor recently took over a former Mercedes-Benz plant in the industrial town of Iracemápolis, near São Paulo in Brazil, after the automaker suspended activities in 2021 due to a decline in luxury car sales. Meanwhile, BYD took over a Ford facility in Brazil following several years of poor sales, and Chery joined forces with the Brazilian company Caoa to produce cars in the central state of Goias.

Natalie Unterstell, the president of the Rio de Janeiro-based climate research and advocacy organisation Talanoa Institute, said, “For the first time in decades, we’re seeing a real challenge to the dominance of American and European brands, not just in terms of market share, but in shaping the future of mobility.”

Brazil is the world’s sixth-largest car market. In recent years, the government has encouraged Chinese automakers to set up shop in Brazil to avoid becoming overly reliant on EV imports alone. It aims to make Brazil part of the value chain, as EV uptake in Latin America expands, which is encouraged by import duties on vehicles not produced domestically. This has come as a shock to the Asian, European, and American automakers that have long dominated the Brazilian market.

Some players in the industry criticise the Chinese automakers for flooding the market with impossibly low-priced vehicles. While others accuse Chinese automakers of assembling cars with components imported from China rather than using regional supply chains.

To adapt to the Brazilian market, Chinese automakers are producing hybrid vehicles that run partly on a gas-ethanol blend – made from sugar cane – and partly on batteries, to make the most of Brazil’s strong ethanol industry and adhere to government gasoline standards. Marcio Renato Alfonso, Great Wall’s director of research and development for Brazil, explained, “We need to produce what customers are looking for… high technology with an affordable price.""

Chinese automakers have also shown an interest in Mexico, which has a strong history of automaking, for nearshoring activities. While the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and both China and Mexico means greater uncertainty for nearshoring, Chinese companies still have significant potential to solidify their regional market by developing operations in Latin America’s two biggest markets.

In 2023, China was the leading car supplier to Mexico, with vehicle exports worth $4.6 billion, according to the Mexican Ministry of Economy. Mexico’s free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada also opened other markets, before the uncertainty of the current trade war. In 2023, BYD announced plans to develop a plant in Mexico capable of producing around 150,000 vehicles a year and generating 10,000 jobs. However, in July, the EV maker said it had cancelled plans following months of trade uncertainty.

While nearshoring activities now appear less certain, the launch of operations in Brazil and Mexico, which both have strong automaking capabilities and well-established regional supply chains, is helping Chinese EV makers to gain a solid foothold in the Latin American market. Several Chinese newcomers are rapidly rising to compete with reputable Asian, European, and American automakers by offering high-quality vehicles at a low cost.

The Trump administration has officially terminated $156 million in Solar for All funding for Michigan, part of a nationwide move to cancel $7 billion in solar energy grants (Reuters). These funds were designed to expand rooftop and community solar projects, lower household energy costs, and create new jobs across the state.

For Michigan, the funding loss is significant. The state’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) had already distributed nearly $14 million in early awards to 13 projects across counties including Berrien, Kent, Oakland, Washtenaw, and Wayne (Manistee News). These included rooftop installations for affordable housing, community solar projects for rural areas, and tribal energy programs. In total, the full program was expected to save families about $400 per year on energy bills while creating nearly 700 clean energy jobs.

The Potential Downsides

Immediate Disruption: Projects already underway may face delays or cancellations (Fox 17).

Equity Setback: Solar for All targeted low-income households, rural residents, and historically underserved communities. Without federal support, these groups risk being left out of Michigan’s clean energy future (Bridge Michigan).

Job Losses: Hundreds of solar installation and maintenance jobs may vanish, slowing momentum in Michigan’s renewable workforce pipeline (ClickOnDetroit).

Climate Goals at Risk: Michigan has set ambitious clean energy targets, including 100% carbon-free energy by 2040. Pulling federal support undercuts this progress (Planet Detroit).

Possible Silver Linings

Legal Challenges: Michigan’s Attorney General has indicated the funding cut may not hold up since the money was approved by Congress. Lawsuits are expected (Planet Detroit).

State and Local Action: Michigan could scale state incentives, green bank tools, and philanthropic support to backfill projects.

Community Momentum: Demand for affordable clean energy is growing, and many local projects are still viable with alternative funding.

Policy Focus: The funding loss may accelerate new state-level solar incentives, workforce programs, and financing options.

Looking Ahead

While the funding loss is a major setback, it does not erase the progress Michigan has already made. The state has built over 1,400 MW of solar capacity and continues to expand both large-scale and community-based projects (Wikipedia). From the Assembly Solar Farm in Shiawassee County to rooftop systems in Detroit, the demand for clean, affordable power is real and growing.

For Michigan communities, the fight for solar is now about resilience and local determination. Whether through state policy, private partnerships, or grassroots organizing, the momentum for solar energy in Michigan is far from over.

Who Is Most Affected

Low- to Moderate-Income Households: Many were expecting no- or low-upfront-cost solar via community subscriptions or rooftop incentives.

Multifamily and Affordable Housing Owners: Solar + storage plans tied to utility cost relief could be delayed.

Local Governments & Tribes: Community-scale arrays and resilience hubs face funding gaps.

Installers & Trainees: Workforce programs and pipeline projects may slow, affecting hiring and training cohorts.

The Potential Downsides

Project Delays & Uncertainty: Financing stacks need to be reworked; timelines slip.

Equity Setback: Households depending on bill relief face longer waits.

Workforce Headwinds: Fewer near-term installs can dampen entry-level opportunities.

Possible Recommendations

Prioritize “Shovel-Ready” Community Solar: Advance interconnection studies, site control, permits, and subscriber acquisition so projects are financeable with alternative funds.

Blend New Capital Sources: Pair state incentives + utility programs + CDFI loans + philanthropy-backed guarantees to replace grants in the stack.

Target High-Impact Sites: Focus on affordable housing, brownfields, schools, and resilience hubs where avoided utility costs and community benefits are highest.

Add Storage Where It Pencils: Solar + storage strengthens resilience hubs and can unlock new revenue (demand management/TOU).

Keep Subscription Models Simple: Transparent pricing and bill-credit predictability boost subscriber uptake and lender confidence.

Document Measurable Benefits: Track bill savings, outage resilience hours, and workforce hours to attract mission-driven funders.

Pipeline Hygiene: Maintain a living pipeline (Tier 1–3) with standardized data rooms (site control, interconnection queue status, SLDs, pro formas).

Funding & Finance Cheat Sheet (2025 Landscape)

State Incentives & Green Bank Tools: Explore low-interest debt, credit enhancements, and LMI carve-outs.

Utility Programs: Community solar pilots, low-income bill credit riders, and potential on-bill repayment.

Municipal/County Tools: ARPA residuals, bonding authority, or climate funds for resilience hubs.

Private Capital: CDFIs, mission-driven lenders, impact funds; consider PACE where available for host-owned systems.

Philanthropy: Program-related investments (PRIs) and guarantees to de-risk early projects.

Good vs. Bad: A Straight Comparison

Good

Opportunity to build durable state + private models less vulnerable to federal swings.

More disciplined project development and subscriber protection standards.

Stronger emphasis on resilience, not just kWh.

Bad

Near-term slowdown for LMI and community projects.

Lost economies of scale that grants enabled.

Risk of widening energy burden if replacements lag.

What to Watch Next

State Budget Adjustments: Any supplemental appropriations for LMI/community solar.

Green Bank Announcements: Credit enhancements, warehousing lines, or LMI set-asides.

Utility Filings: New/expanded community solar tariffs, bill credit mechanisms, storage incentives.

Local Success Stories: Early projects closing without federal grants—templates to replicate.

FAQs

Is community solar in Michigan dead without the $156M?

No. It’s harder, but not dead. With state tools, CDFIs, utility bill-credit mechanisms, and careful design, projects can still pencil especially on public, tribal, and affordable housing sites.

Can rooftop solar for LMI households still move forward?

Yes. Focus on low- or zero-upfront offers using a mix of state incentives, on-bill repayment, and philanthropic guarantees. Community solar subscriptions remain a viable path where roofs or credit don’t fit.

What should local governments do right now?

Advance siting, interconnection, and subscriber outreach; line up credit enhancements; and prioritize projects that double as resilience hubs (solar + storage at schools, libraries, clinics).",https://michigansolarpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/chjpdmf0zs9sci9pbwfnzxmvd2vic2l0zs8ymdiyltexl2zsnteyntq0nzc0mjctaw1hz2uuanbn.webp,N,,2025-08-17 18:01:28.924954

And the problem isn’t just domestic; South Korea also finances and provides the infrastructure for fossil fuels globally.
At the same time, South Korea has emerged as one of the world’s top importers of Russian fossil fuels, even as other nations cut ties.","South Korea’s vital statistics

On a cool early morning on South Korea’s east coast, Eunbin Kang pointed to a monument to a vanishing era.

The 2.1GW Samcheok Blue power plant which came online in South Korea in January looms out of the headlands above a beach made internationally famous by a K-pop album shoot. It is expected to emit 13m tonnes of CO2 annually, while its lifespan could stretch beyond 2050, the year by which the country has pledged to reach carbon neutrality. The country was building coal-fired power plants, said Kang, an activist who heads the Youth Climate Emergency Action group and relocated to this city to oppose the facility, “even as the climate emergency demands an immediate halt to fossil fuel expansion”.

But Samcheok is not an outlier. It is a symbol of the stark climate contradiction at the heart of the world’s 12th largest economy, celebrated for its technological prowess in semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries, yet among the top ten worst global climate performers.

Despite South Korea’s impressive climate pledges to reach net zero by 2050 with a 40% reduction in emissions from 2018 levels by 2030, fossil fuels still dominate its energy mix: 60% of electricity comes from coal and gas, while renewables make up just 9%, a quarter of the OECD average of 34%.

Monopoly strangling transition

At the heart of South Korea’s climate failure is an energy model based on a state monopoly and central planning. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco), the state-owned energy company, controls transmission, distribution and retail, while its subsidiaries dominate generation, creating structural challenges for competitors. These include Korea South-East Power, Korea Western Power and four other generation subsidiaries that together operate the vast majority of the country’s coal, gas and nuclear power plants.

Meanwhile, renewable energy developers face an obstacle course of regulatory barriers. Until recently, windfarm developers had to obtain 28 different permits from multiple ministries in a bureaucratic maze which created years of delays and significantly increased project costs, making many otherwise viable developments financially unfeasible. Progress was made in early 2025 with the passage of a long-awaited bill aimed at streamlining approvals, although the law won’t take effect until 2026.

Grid connection remains another hurdle. While electricity demand has grown by 98% over the past two decades, the transmission network has expanded by just 26%, but attempts to expand the grid have led to bitter local conflicts.

In Miryang, South Gyeongsang province, the government tried to compel residents to sell up to clear space for transmission towers and people faced violent crackdowns during a six-year standoff. Currently, a dozen such projects are stalled in the country.

In February 2025, the National Assembly passed a Power Grid Special Act aimed at expanding transmission. But civic groups warn the law reinforces the country’s decades-old top-down model of infrastructure development, removing what few safeguards remained around public consultation and environmental review.

“We fully acknowledge that renewable energy transition requires transmission lines,” says Kim Jeong-jin from Friends of the Earth in Dangjin, where one project faced more than 10 years of delays due to local opposition. “But the repeated conflicts arise because the electricity is not even for local use, yet it causes damage to our region without any regard for our voices.”

The country’s energy strategy is guided by the Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, a 15-year forecast revised every two years. But the framework, which dates back to the 1960s, still prioritises centralised, large-scale power generation – a model built for coal and nuclear, and fundamentally incompatible with today’s decentralised, flexible renewable technologies.

Political volatility worsens the problem. Each five-year presidential term brings a policy reversal. For instance, in 2017, President Moon Jae-in announced a nuclear phase-out; his successor, the now disgraced ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, reversed course five years later. This whiplash undermines any long-term planning for renewables – a problem faced by democracies around the world.

The consequences are stark. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fossil fuel prices soaring, Kepco incurred enormous losses. In 2022 alone, South Korea faced an extra 22tn won (£11.9 bn) in LNG power costs. Yet the government kept electricity prices artificially low, a political choice that pushed Kepco’s debt to a staggering 205tn won (£111bn) by 2024.

Despite this crisis, meaningful reform remains elusive. This entrenched monopoly system has effectively blocked the clean energy transition, with independent renewable producers struggling to gain meaningful access to a market dominated by fossil fuel interests.

Carbon-intensive by design

More broadly, South Korea’s postwar rise relied on energy-intensive industries: steel, petrochemicals, shipbuilding and semiconductors.

“This structural dependency on heavy and chemical industries makes the energy transition extraordinarily difficult,” says Park Sangin, a professor of economics at Seoul National University. “These industries are deeply embedded in the country’s economic fabric and require vast amounts of stable, cheap electricity.”

Powerful chaebols, or family-controlled conglomerates like Posco, Samsung and Hyundai, exert outsized influence on national policy. Their operations are supported by an electricity market designed for industrial stability, not climate mitigation.

And the problem isn’t just domestic; South Korea also finances and provides the infrastructure for fossil fuels globally. South Korean shipbuilders dominate the global market for LNG carriers. Public financial institutions also bankroll overseas fossil fuel projects.

One that was recently approved, the Coral Norte gas project in Mozambique, is projected to emit 489m tonnes of CO2 across its lifecycle. At the same time, South Korea has emerged as one of the world’s top importers of Russian fossil fuels, even as other nations cut ties.

“This financing directly contradicts [South] Korea’s climate targets and makes a mockery of the Paris Agreement,” says Dongjae Oh, the head of the gas team at Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC). “It exposes the country’s hypocrisy – adopting climate targets at home while funding climate destruction abroad.”

Even climate-friendly institutions continue backing fossil fuels. The National Pension Service (NPS), one of the world’s largest pension funds, remains a major investor in coal and gas projects, despite a 2021 “coal-free” declaration. Three and a half years after this announcement, NPS only finalised its coal divestment strategy in December 2024, with a timeline that will delay implementation for domestic assets until 2030.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s market-based climate policies have failed to drive meaningful change. The emissions trading scheme (K-ETS) was supposed to put a price on carbon when it launched in 2015.

But the system, which hands out free allowances to the largest companies, has instead created perverse incentives, according to campaign group Plan 1.5. The group carried out an analysis and found that South Korea’s 10 largest polluters have made over 475bn won (£258bn) from selling unused carbon credits between 2015 and 2022. The system that was meant to make polluters pay has instead rewarded them.

Next generation fights back

There is growing awareness of a climate crisis as the country begins to experience increasingly severe weather. In 2023 46 people died in floods that displaced thousands. More recently, torrential rains have again caused at least 26 deaths, followed by a record-breaking heatwave.

In March this year devastating wildfires swept across more than 48,000 hectares (118,610 acres) – roughly 80% of the area of Seoul – killing 31 people and destroying thousands of homes. The country’s disaster chief described the situation as “a climate crisis unlike anything we’ve experienced before”.

The prime minister, Kim Min-seok, has described the climate crisis as “the new normal”.

Now a new generation of South Koreans is challenging the status quo through legal action. In February, a group of children gathered outside Posco’s office in Seoul. Among them was 11-year-old Yoohyun Kim, the youngest plaintiff in a groundbreaking lawsuit against Posco.

The case aims to block the company’s plan to reline an old coal-fired blast furnace, a move that would extend its life by 15 years and emit an estimated 137m tonnes of CO2.

“I came here during my precious winter break, my last as an elementary school student, because I want to protect all four seasons,” Yoohyun told supporters. “Spring and autumn are disappearing with climate change – and with them, the chance for children like me to play freely outside.”

The lawsuit is the first of its kind globally to target traditional blast furnace production. It follows a crucial ruling by South Korea’s constitutional court last August which found that the government’s climate policies violated the rights of future generations by failing to set legally binding targets for 2031-50.

In March, residents and activists filed another suit over the government’s approval of the world’s largest semiconductor cluster in Yongin, backed by a 360tn won (£195bn) Samsung investment. The suit argues that the project’s 10GW electricity demand and new LNG plants contradict climate regulations and corporate sustainability commitments.

Kim Jeongduk, an activist from Political Mamas who participated in protests against the Samcheok Blue plant with her child, sees this as a generational struggle.

“Growing up in Pohang, I saw smokestacks fill the sky on my way to school every day. My throat would hurt from fine dust, and iron particles would collect on our windowsills,” she recalls.

“Adults always said: ‘Thanks to Posco, our region survives.’ I don’t want my child to grow up with that same false choice between a healthy environment and economic survival.”

The international data shows that South Korea’s emissions peaked in 2018, and have been falling, with a brief jump after Covid, ever since. The government maintains that it is making progress on its climate goals, although critics argue that it is relying on some wonky calculations around its 2030 emission reduction target, confusing net with gross emissions.

“South Korea is actively pursuing bold reduction of coal power generation through prohibiting new permits for coal power plants and phasing out ageing facilities,” the ministry said in a statement, arguing that any remaining coal plants operating beyond 2050, such as those approved before the 2021 ban, would be addressed through “carbon capture and storage technology and clean fuel conversion” in a way “not inconsistent with our carbon neutrality commitment”.

But independent analysis suggests these measures fall well short. “The Basic Plan has no specific plan for how to expand renewable energy,” says Prof Park. “There are vague targets, but no timeline, no locations. In stark contrast, the nuclear roadmap is extremely detailed and specific.”

His recent research using the Global Change Assessment Model shows the current plan would fall short of meeting South Korea’s 2030 emissions targets by approximately 6-7%.

A more ambitious policy focused on offshore wind expansion and a complete phase-out of coal by 2035 could not only meet climate goals but reduce power sector emissions by 82% by 2035.

When confronted with criticisms of its emissions accounting, South Korea’s environment ministry defended its approach: “Our emissions reduction target calculation method considers international regulations and major country cases. Countries like Japan and Canada use similar calculation methods for their 2030 NDCs,” a spokesperson said.

The ministry added that although previous targets used the older 1996 IPCC guidelines, from 2024 they have begun using the updated 2006 standards for national greenhouse gas statistics.

Back in Samcheok, Eunbin Kang looks out at the coal plant that now dominates the coastal landscape.

“We’ll continue to look for any gaps that need an EV charging station to strengthen this network.” mreinhart@detroitnews.com","Michigan needs about $998 million worth of new electric vehicle chargers around the state to meet current and future demand for EV drivers, a study by Michigan State University researchers found.

The study analyzed Michiganians' travel habits, EV usage patterns and other data and determined 66,602 chargers are needed and where they should be placed to ensure that EV drivers always have reliable access to one, whether they're commuting into the city for work or driving across the state for a vacation.

“We are considering things like making sure that our users won’t have to go out of their way to find a charging station or face significant delays while waiting for an available charger,” said Mehrnaz Ghamami, an associate professor at MSU's College of Engineering and co-author of the report. “It’s not just the investment that we are considering, but also the EV users. We want to make sure every single EV trip is feasible.”

The study got underway in 2018 and Michigan has expanded its EV infrastructure significantly since then, researchers said, but concerns such as long charging times and ""range anxiety,"" or the fear that one won't have enough charge to reach their destination or a charger, ""continue to impede widespread EV acceptance,"" the report found.

According to the study, as of the end of 2023, EVs and plug-in electric hybrids made up about 0.76% of vehicles in Michigan, lagging behind the 1.52% nationwide rate.

Michigan has an estimated 3,133 public chargers, the report said, and it needs more than 66,000 more to meet demand. The report doesn't mention a timeframe for installation, but does reference the state's Michigan Future Mobility Plan, which sets goals of 2 million EVs and 100,000 chargers in the state by 2030.

Ghamami and her team spoke to EV users, car companies and utility providers to address several questions, such as: When do EV users stop to charge their vehicles? And how often are they used for long-distance trips?

The team aimed to identify optimal locations ""that minimize investment costs while providing an acceptable level of service to users,"" according to a press release publicizing the research.

The researchers determined the most cost-effective, sufficient plan would involve installing 66,602 new chargers across the state.

Most chargers would be placed in urban centers, where traffic rates are highest, but also in rural areas where drivers may need to recharge during longer trips. For instance, the study determined chargers are highly needed in places like Benton Harbor, Reed City, Newport and Muskegon since drivers regularly travel through those areas en route to Chicago, Lake Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.

“These findings from Michigan State University’s research reinforces our commitment to a smart, data-driven approach to expanding Michigan’s EV infrastructure,” Michigan Chief Mobility Officer Justine Johnson said in a statement. “Understanding how and when EV users travel ensures we can build out Michigan’s mobility ecosystem and increase charging access for users across the state.""

In addition to considering the location and total number of chargers required, the team considered what type of chargers are necessary. Of the 66,602 total, they determined 60,087 of the new chargers should be the typical Level 2 variety, while 6,515 should be direct current fast chargers (DCFC), which are more powerful but far more expensive to install.

The authors noted one unexpected finding during the study: Though vehicle usage in Michigan climbs during the warm weather months, EV battery chargers are actually needed more during the winter.

“Electric vehicle battery performance drops 30% efficiency in winter,” said Ghamami. “So, we ran different scenarios by comparing charging needs in summer to winter, in which battery performance is 70% of what it is in summer.""

The research was sponsored by the Michigan Office of Future Mobility & Electrification and Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.

“When we started this project in 2018, Michigan had very limited public EV charging infrastructure to support EV users, but now Michigan has a more robust and accessible charging network across the state,” Ghamami said. “We’ll continue to look for any gaps that need an EV charging station to strengthen this network.”

As 2025 unfolds, the technology sector is witnessing a seismic shift driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Industry leaders are increasingly focusing on agentic AI systems, which go beyond traditional models by making autonomous decisions and integrating with technologies like IoT and blockchain. According to a recent analysis from McKinsey, these agentic AI frameworks are poised to transform strategic planning in sectors such as healthcare and finance, enabling real-time efficiencies that could streamline supply chains and enhance decision-making processes.

Quantum computing, meanwhile, is emerging as a game-changer for tackling complex problems that classical computers struggle with. Posts on X from tech enthusiasts and firms like SolidLedger Studio highlight how quantum innovations are integrating with AI to solve optimization challenges in logistics and drug discovery. This convergence is not just theoretical; companies are investing heavily, with Reuters reporting that global tech giants are pouring billions into quantum research to maintain competitive edges.

Sustainability and Green Innovations Take Center Stage

Sustainability is no longer a buzzword but a core imperative, with green technologies leading the charge in 2025. Innovations in bio-based materials and decentralized renewable energy are reshaping manufacturing and energy sectors. A post on X by Sneha S points to the rise of agri-tech and micro-factories, signaling a move toward more localized, eco-friendly production methods. These trends align with broader industry shifts, as noted in WebProNews, where green innovations are transforming industries by integrating with AI for smarter resource management.

Challenges abound, however, including the need for substantial investments in talent and infrastructure. McKinsey’s outlook emphasizes building trust in these technologies to mitigate risks like data privacy concerns in AI-driven systems. Insiders warn that without robust governance, the rapid adoption of quantum and green tech could lead to regulatory hurdles, echoing sentiments in recent TechCrunch articles that discuss antitrust issues facing big tech.

Investment Themes and Economic Implications

Investment strategies are evolving to capitalize on these trends, with a focus on AI infrastructure and digital banking. An X post from Oguz O. outlines key themes, including monetization efforts by cloud giants like Google and Amazon, which are expected to ramp up in 2025. This is corroborated by CNBC’s technology news, which details how firms such as Microsoft are subsidizing AI development to foster ecosystem growth, potentially leading to higher revenues through advanced cloud services.

Economic implications are profound, with startups leveraging AI for personalized services and remote work solutions, as highlighted in an X thread by Keith Tsang. The New York Times’ technology section reports on how these innovations are boosting market shares for pioneers like Tesla in electric vehicles and Amazon in cloud computing, driving faster revenue growth amid digital transformation.

Navigating Challenges in a Rapidly Evolving Sector

Yet, the path forward is fraught with obstacles, including disinformation security and integration sprawls. CriticalRiver’s X post discusses the importance of AI governance and hybrid cloud strategies to address these issues. Fortune’s tech insights warn of macro forces like regulatory pressures and supply chain disruptions that could impede progress, urging executives to prioritize compliance and talent development.

Looking ahead, the integration of spatial computing and ambient intelligence promises to redefine user experiences, per McKinsey’s trends report. As Lux Research’s e-book on 2025 innovations suggests, balancing rising trends like functional health tech with falling ones such as certain carbon capture methods will be crucial for sustained growth. Industry insiders must navigate these dynamics carefully to harness the full potential of 2025’s technological advancements.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-1a51101b-69d2-4e10-afe9-ae4bb3b75cef.jpeg,N,,2025-08-17 18:01:35.429554

June’s job losses were also revised to 1,500, which was “less severe than the previously estimated 2,700,” the Texas Oil & Gas Workers Association said. “Despite declines over the past two months, year-to-date growth remains positive at 4,300 upstream jobs.”

The upstream sector involves oil and natural gas extraction and some types of mining. It excludes other industry sectors like refining, petrochemicals, fuels wholesaling, oilfield equipment manufacturing, pipelines, and gas utilities that support hundreds of thousands of additional jobs statewide. Industry jobs pay among the highest wages in Texas, with an average salary of $128,000 in 2024.

“Forecasts for lower prices can slow industry growth plans,” TXOGA President Todd Staples said. “With approximately 8 bcf/d of new LNG export capacity under development in Texas and multiple infrastructure projects announced, we are optimistic stable global market conditions will strengthen short-term demand and reinforce our energy workforce.”

Since the COVID-era low point of September 2020, the upstream sector added 51,200 jobs in Texas, a 33.7% increase, averaging 875 jobs added a month. From September 2020 to May 2025, months of upstream job increases outnumbered months of decreases by 40 to 15, TXOGA notes, The Center Square reported.

According to a Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) analysis, direct Texas upstream employment last month totaled 205,200. The total represented an increase of 200 jobs in oil and gas extraction and a decrease of 1,600 jobs in the services sector.

“Fluctuations in monthly employment are normal and subject to revisions,” TIPRO says, adding that “demand for talent in the Texas upstream sector remains high.”

“We are acutely aware of the challenges facing some companies in the upstream sector,” TIPRO president Ed Longanecker said. “Texas oil and gas producers have gained significant market, regulatory and fiscal advantages relative to the pre-pandemic era, driven largely by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and EPA’s deregulatory actions that will reduce barriers and costs for operators, but those benefits will take time to fully realize or feel.

“While uncertainties remain relative to geopolitical conflicts, OPEC output and tariffs, this new era of American energy dominance will unquestionably be fueled by domestic oil and natural gas, with Texas as the undisputed leader.”

TIPRO’s new workforce data indicated strong job postings for the Texas oil and natural gas industry, with 8,853 active unique jobs postings for the industry last month, up from 8,457 in June. Texas had the most unique jobs posted for the industry, followed by those in Pennsylvania, California, Ohio and Illinois, it notes, totaling 57,472 unique job postings nationwide last month. This is up by nearly 5,000 new jobs postings over the month.

TIPRO posted workforce trends for last month, including unique job postings by state and industry job postings in Texas.

TIPRO also points to the industry’s strong tax contributions last month that fund public schools and universities, roads, first responders and other essential services. Last month, Texas energy producers paid $433 million in oil production taxes, according to the Texas comptroller’s office. Last month, producers also paid $178 million in natural gas production taxes, up 8% from last July.

Texas still leads the U.S. in production.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency’s new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,” he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That’s a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university’s Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn’t make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.” She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and “a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,” Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, “gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa’s farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project “has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest” and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There’s also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were “carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it’s fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,” he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

America's Energy Needs Are Projected to Skyrocket By The End of Decade, Putting Massive Pressure On the US Grid System

Big Tech firms like Meta, Amazon, and Google are rapidly expanding their AI CapEX to fuel their computing needs and achieve superiority in producing the best AI models. However, in this pursuit of 'AI perfection,' there's a lot at stake, and one of the more worrying aspects is how massively the need for energy is growing in the US. And, when you factor in power grids that were created back in the 70s, you'll realize that America needs to think quickly about its energy needs, or else the AI hype could prove to be devastating for the nation.

Based on a report by Goldman Sachs, it is claimed that datacenter energy requirements are outpacing the US grid upgrade cycles, to the point that it is now approaching a 'critical bottleneck', and if the current administration doesn't come up with a viable action plan, America could see a power problem pretty soon. It is revealed that a single interconnection request scales up to a whopping 5 gigawatts each, which accounts for the power usage of over five million homes.

When you factor in that Big Tech sees GW-centres as the new norm, the energy demand is expected to grow tremendously. Gartner predicts that more than 40% of US datacenters might not have power to fully function, as the collective power demand could reach up to 500 Terawatt-hours by 2027. The massive electricity demand has also resulted in power prices rising noticeably, and according to Axios, the monthly electric bills in high-datacenter regions could increase $14–$37 by 2040, not factoring in inflation.

If the U.S. Grid Cannot Support Datacenters, Big Tech May Build Its Own Power Sources

Firms like Google and Amazon cannot stop with their AI expansion, or else they will lag behind the race, and the only way they can ensure further expansion in America is if they build their power sources. This is already happening, and some of the more prominent examples include Meta building natural-gas-powered plants for their 'multi-GW' AI clusters, and Microsoft reviving the Three Mile Island nuclear plant project for its supercomputers. Tech companies are moving into the energy business to replace the incompetent US electricity system.

This might ease the pressure on the US grid in the longer term, but for now, concerns remain as setting up power plants is a multi-year project, while datacenter expansion is happening rapidly. For now, America needs an effective solution, and interestingly, President Trump's 'AI action plan' actually addresses the concerns and is coming up with a viable solution to uplift the US grid system.",https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/download-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 16:01:43.870364

Renewable energy currently supplies just 24.1% of Africa’s electricity, 76% of which comes from hydropower, a source increasingly affected by climate change.

Close to one billion rely on traditional biofuels for cooking. Africa is also very vulnerable to climate change, even though it has contributed less than 5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions over the past 170 years. Speeding up the move to renewable energy is a key topic on the agenda of the Second Africa Climate Summit in Ethiopia in September. Regional development and climate change specialist Abay Yimere sets out what’s likely to be discussed.

Why does Africa need its own summit on climate change?

African countries have made binding commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. To do this, they will need to shift to renewable energy and stop mining and using fossil fuels like oil and coal. However, many African countries continue to rely on coal, oil and gas, with solar energy accounting for just 3% of electricity generation. Renewable energy currently supplies just 24.1% of Africa’s electricity, 76% of which comes from hydropower, a source increasingly affected by climate change.

Collectively, African countries need between US$1.6 trillion and US$1.9 trillion by 2030 to move away from fossil fuels.

But Africa’s current climate finance needs are between $1.6 and $1.9 trillion. Much of the available climate finance is provided as loans rather than grants, leaving the continent in debt. About 751 million Africans are negatively affected by their governments spending money on repaying high interest external debt instead of investing in climate resilience and sustainable development.

Global energy initiatives also don’t cater adequately for Africa. The World Bank and African Development Bank’s recent Mission 300 project to connect 300 million people in Africa to electricity by 2030 will leave another 300 million behind.

The 2023 global COP28 climate conference pledged to triple the amount invested in global renewable energy. But as Africa currently only receives about 4% of global climate investment, tripling this amount will not make much difference.

For this reason, the continent needs its own climate summit to bring African countries together to demand fair global responses, including greenhouse emissions cuts from high emitting countries in the developed world. The summit will mobilise for finance and new technologies that are needed for Africa to combat climate change.

Without its own climate summit, Africa runs the risk of being sidelined in a crisis it did not cause.

What did the first summit agree on and how much progress has been made since?

Its first climate summit in 2023 issued the Nairobi Declaration. It agreed that African countries must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030. It called for the long-overdue delivery of the world’s US$100 billion annual climate finance pledge.

The summit also advocated for a fair phase-down of unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. African countries pledged a fivefold increase to funding for new renewable energy systems.

They also committed to setting up green industries, climate-aligned trade, and financial system reform. This included prioritising growth over austerity, reforming lending to eliminate surcharges and promoting local currency financing. The declaration also stressed the need for greater technology transfer, fair access to concessional finance, and scalable climate finance.

Progress since the summit remains largely unknown. There have been no progress reports and its promises were not measured.

However, some programmes like the Africa Green Industrialisation Initiative have been launched. This initiative aims to drive green industrialisation on the continent.

Similarly, the Continental Circular Economy Action Plan (2024–2034) was launched in July 2025. This aims to create green jobs, empower youth and women, and position Africa as a global leader in climate-resilient, inclusive growth.

What are the main topics for the 2025 summit?

The summit has six agenda items:

1. Reimagining climate finance and investment architecture

These discussions will centre on easier lending terms, restructured debt and funding national projects using domestic currencies. The summit also wants easier access to climate finance,

2. Accelerating renewable energy and technological transformation

Africa has vast solar and wind potential. The summit is expected to discuss ways to get electricity to the 600 million Africans without power by 2030. It will also look at emerging technologies.

3. Scaling nature-based and community-led solutions

Africa’s ecosystems and indigenous knowledge systems hold powerful solutions for both mitigation and adaptation. The summit should champion nature-based approaches and community participation so that climate action is inclusive, culturally grounded, and ecologically sustainable.

4. Strengthening strategic governance and global partnerships

The hope is that these discussions will revive multilateral cooperation and advance technology and knowledge transfer.

5. Harnessing critical minerals for green industrialisation and a just energy transition

Africa holds over 30% of the world’s critical mineral reserves. These resources are used in clean energy technologies, net-zero transitions, and the industries of the future. The summit will need to champion strategies to ensure that these minerals are mined responsibly and fairly.

6. Advancing regional implementation mechanisms

One of Africa’s persistent challenges is the disconnect between policy ambition and effective execution. The summit will need to attend to this.

How do these talk to the major climate challenges faced by African countries?

Indigenous knowledge systems hold untapped potential for climate solutions. When traditional practices are combined with modern technologies, they can strengthen resilience, enhance ecosystem stewardship, and support the emergence of green economies.

In the energy sector, decentralised renewable energy systems provide reliable power to rural communities. This is especially critical during climate extremes. They also reduce emissions. These systems also create jobs, improve health outcomes, and support local enterprises.

For example, civil society organisations like the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance reached out to local communities to ensure that their voices and interests were meaningfully represented. Similarly, institutions such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the African Group of Negotiators, and the African Development Bank have engaged different organisations. This bottom-up, distributed model of participant mobilisation will promote inclusivity and shared ownership of the summit’s outcomes.

Ultimately, the summit’s success hinges on African leaders’ ability to rally around a shared vision of combating climate change and building resilience. With unity, they can win this fight. They could also position Africa as a global climate leader.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/684471/original/file-20250807-64-hnd2e8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=257%2C1489%2C5344%2C2672&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-17 15:00:00.142318

Unless the US reengages with this worldwide green momentum soon, it risks ceding economic and technological leadership to those forward-looking nations already shaping the 21st century’s green economy.","The United States has enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), heralding a sweeping reversal of its climate and energy policies. This dramatic law marks a turning point in America’s sustainability agenda, rolling back support for clean energy, electric vehicles, and low-carbon technologies. While it is widely regarded as a major policy reversal undermining US climate leadership, the shift opens a window of opportunity for China and other clean-tech leaders to expand their influence.

The OBBB represents a broad rollback of US clean-energy policy, repealing key provisions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and dismantling decades of bipartisan support for green infrastructure. By scrapping tax credits for rooftop solar panels, EV purchases, and energy-efficient heat pumps, the OBBB makes clean technologies significantly more expensive for consumers — undermining progress toward affordable, low-carbon living.

The law also halts federal support for green manufacturing, jeopardizing over $100 billion in planned investments in EV, solar, and battery factories, and putting an estimated 115,000 jobs at risk. Even before its passage, policy uncertainty had led to $6.9 billion in project cancellations in early 2025. The message is unmistakable: The US is retreating from climate leadership. This retreat could ripple across global supply chains and slow the energy transition at a critical juncture.

With tax credits gone, solar and wind projects now face higher upfront costs — expenses likely passed on to consumers already strained by inflation. In an ironic twist, many Republican-led states that prospered during the clean-energy boom may end up suffering most from the rollback. Experts warn that the US could install up to 72 percent less new renewable energy over the next decade, undoing recent gains and increasing reliance on aging fossil-fueled power plants.

On the global stage, the fallout is serious: higher emissions, a weakened US commitment to the Paris Agreement, and eroded American credibility in climate diplomacy. Strategically, the OBBB shift undercuts US competitiveness in high-tech and energy-intensive industries — as worldwide demand for clean power is surging. Without ample green energy at home, the US risks falling behind countries like China that are forging ahead in innovation.

Despite its promises of boosting affordability, creating jobs, and outcompeting China, the OBBB appears to undermine those very aims. By repealing key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act — the nation’s flagship clean-energy law — the new law dismantles support for domestic manufacturing in sectors such as EVs, batteries, and other emerging green industries, along with plans to drive down future energy costs. In place of these investments, the law reverts to fossil fuels: It authorizes as much as $18 billion in new and expanded tax incentives for the oil and gas industry, and leaves longstanding advantages for coal and natural gas untouched.

Critics call this strategy a strategic misstep. Many observers attribute the move to vigorous fossil-fuel lobbying or partisan politics. Republican backers of the bill argued that clean tech can now stand on its own, yet traditional fossil industries still enjoy extensive government support. This policy U-turn also sends a troubling message abroad. America’s credibility in global climate negotiations weakens with each reversal, eroding trust among allies.

China’s clean-tech strides: filling the void

While the US steps back from climate commitments, China is surging ahead. Already the world’s leading producer of renewable energy, China continues to expand its lead at an astonishing pace. In 2024 alone, it installed 277 gigawatts (GW) of new solar capacity — a 45 percent jump from the previous year — and boosted its wind power capacity by 18 percent, reaching roughly 887 GW of solar and 520 GW of wind in total. This far outstrips the US, which had only about 139 GW of solar capacity as of 2023. China even met its 2030 clean-energy capacity targets six years early, at the same time as the US was retreating from the Paris Agreement and increasing its reliance on fossil fuels.

This dominance is no accident. China’s sustained and supportive industrial policies have nurtured a fiercely competitive clean-tech market at home. Even foreign companies like Tesla have thrived under China’s approach; Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, fast-tracked with government support, became the company’s largest global production hub. As the US weakens its own clean-tech strategy, China is poised to further consolidate its leadership. This shift has far-reaching implications: not only for global supply chains and technology standards, but also for the balance of economic and geopolitical power in a low-carbon future.

The rollback of US EV incentives comes as competition in the auto industry is heating up — creating major openings for China’s EV sector. China already manufactures over 60 percent of the world’s EVs and around 80 percent of its batteries, controlling much of the supply chain from raw minerals to finished cars.

Thanks to massive scale, innovation, and consistent government backing, Chinese EVs are often cheaper than comparable gasoline vehicles. In emerging markets from Brazil to Ethiopia, Chinese EV brands are leading the electric transition in places where Western automakers have been largely absent.

With American consumer tax credits now gone, US automakers such as General Motors and Ford face a tougher road for their EV plans. At the same time, new rules barring components from “foreign entities of concern” are hindering domestic battery manufacturing. Ironically, many of the battery plants planned in the US still rely on Chinese materials and technology — meaning efforts to exclude China could end up crippling America’s own EV supply chain.

Meanwhile, China’s automakers continue to expand their global reach. BYD, for example, saw its revenue in 2024 surpass Tesla’s, and it is on track to lead the world in EV sales in 2025. Even Tesla — deeply tied into China’s supply chain — has cautioned that Chinese competitors could outcompete traditional US carmakers if current trends continue.

Western trade barriers have begun to pose headwinds, but Chinese companies are adapting quickly — building overseas plants, introducing more hybrid models to sidestep tariffs, and leveraging their huge domestic market to maintain scale advantages. Despite these hurdles, China’s EV exports keep climbing — in April, registrations of Chinese-made electric cars in Europe jumped 59 percent year-on-year despite the new EU tariffs. As the US pulls back, China is accelerating its push into global markets. If current trends hold, Chinese automakers may soon dominate the global EV landscape, while American brands struggle to keep up in a fast-moving industry that increasingly spans the globe.

Clean future will forge ahead

There is little doubt that the global transition to a clean-energy future will persist. The passage of the OBBB marks a turning point where Washington has chosen to prioritize short-term fossil-fuel interests over long-term sustainability. Yet this US reversal is not slowing the pace of the global energy transition — China and other nations are stepping into leadership roles to push green development forward.

China’s path has not been without challenges — coal still plays a significant role in its energy mix — but its success in deploying solutions at scale is increasingly evident. At the 17th BRICS Summit held in July in Rio de Janeiro, leaders of major emerging economies reaffirmed their commitment to inclusive climate action through the Rio de Janeiro Declaration, themed “Strengthening Global South Cooperation for a More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance”. The declaration emphasized sustainable development and equitable green transitions — principles China has been putting into practice through its clean-energy investments across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Unless the US reengages with this worldwide green momentum soon, it risks ceding economic and technological leadership to those forward-looking nations already shaping the 21st century’s green economy.

The New York State Office of Renewable Energy Siting and Electric Transmission issued a final permit to Cypress Renewables to develop and operate the project, called Oxbow Hill Solar, according to the Observer-Dispatch.

Located in Madison County, the facility will offset over 177,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide and provide power for around 23,000 average homes.

""The solar array in Madison County brings us one step closer in reaching our climate and energy goals,"" Assemblymember Al Stirpe, D-127, said in a statement, per the Observer-Dispatch. ""Each major renewable energy project helps deliver the critical climate action that our state urgently needs, while also creating hundreds of local jobs and new revenue for community priorities.""

The office of Governor Kathy Hochul anticipates the project will create 330 jobs during construction, as well as increase tax revenue for schools and other community properties.

This kind of solar project and commitment from a local government are part of an ongoing trend of embracing clean energy for the future. They have also been shown to add value to properties in the area and even help provide habitats for native plants and pollinators, all while lowering energy costs for residents.

Renewable energy projects like this solar farm improve local power grid reliability and promote energy independence for the communities they serve.

There are numerous benefits to going solar, particularly when you choose to incorporate it in your home. Installing solar panels can reduce your costs to as little as $0 while decreasing reliance on large power grids and mitigating the impact of planet-warming pollution from dirty energy sources. EnergySage provides a free service that compares quotes from vetted local installers, saving you up to $10,000 on installation while further cutting costs.

Going solar also helps make using other clean and money-saving appliances like heat pumps, dryers, and induction cooktops even cheaper to run. Mitsubishi is a great resource for finding the right, affordable heat pump for your home.

However, in the wake of the overruling of Chevron deference in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) and the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. Environmental Protective Agency (EPA) (2025), California’s Clean Air Act (CAA) waiver now rests on fragile ground. The overturning of Chevron deference alongside the recent ruling in Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. EPA signals that courts may now reinterpret the waiver provision more narrowly, undermining many states’ capacity to lead on climate regulation.

Since 1984, Chevron deference from the Supreme Court’s decision in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. has historically protected the EPA’s authority to interpret vague language in environmental laws and establish pollution regulations under the Clean Air Act. In the Chevron case, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NDRC) challenged an EPA regulation that allowed states to treat an entire industrial plant as a single “stationary source” of pollution, which allowed companies to circumvent pollution regulations. [1] The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the EPA, arguing that because Congress had not explicitly defined the term “stationary source” in the CAA and because the legislative history did not resolve the issue, the EPA had discretion to interpret it. [2] This established the Chevron deference doctrine, under which courts defer to “a federal agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency administers.” [3] Consequently, the ruling in the Chevron case gave the EPA authority to define broad terms such as “stationary source,” which has proven essential to protecting regulations in the CAA. For example, in Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court upheld the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases, deferring to the agency’s interpretation that such gases fell within the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutants.” [4] In the later case Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit Court rejected industry challenges to the EPA’s regulations targeting greenhouse gas emissions, again deferring to the EPA’s definition of “air pollutants” to include greenhouse gases according to Chevron deference. [5] The judicial acceptance of the EPA’s expert interpretations illustrates the power of Chevron deference and the importance of allowing expert agencies like the EPA, and not courts, to define and apply technical terms in complex regulatory schemes.

In a legal ruling very similar to the Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA case, California’s Clean Air Act Waiver was also solidified using judicial deference to EPA’s statutory interpretations of “air pollutant” and “compelling and extraordinary conditions” granted by the Chevron deference doctrine. Yet, with the recent overturning of Chevron, the future of the Clean Air Act Waiver appears uncertain. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases by interpreting “air pollutant” broadly. [6] The interpretation then enabled the EPA in 2009 to grant California a Clean Air Act waiver that permits the state to implement stricter greenhouse gas emissions regulations. The waiver was granted based on the EPA’s judgment that climate change posed “compelling and extraordinary conditions,” according to the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which determined that greenhouse gases endanger both public health and welfare of people. [7] The waiver was later reinforced by the Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA case, which used direct application of Chevron deference. [8] However, in June 2024, the Supreme Court overturned Chevron deference in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024), leaving the Clean Air Act Waiver vulnerable. [9] Although the Court emphasized that prior decisions relying on Chevron remain intact under the principle of stare decisis, the removal of Chevron deference meant that courts will now interpret ambiguous statutory language de novo without deferring to the EPA’s expertise. [10] As a result, previously accepted definitions of “vague” terms by the EPA in the CAA Waiver are more susceptible to legal challenges in the future. Recent challenges to California’s waivers suggest that this shift is already underway. In an unprecedented and illegal move on June 12, 2025, President Trump signed into law Congressional Review Act resolutions revoking three of California’s most important vehicle emission waivers—despite the fact that the Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian agreed that the waivers are not themselves regulations and therefore not reviewable by Congress. [11] Although the resolutions were signed, their legal effect remains uncertain, as multiple lawsuits challenging the legitimacy of the Congressional Review Act’s application to these waivers are still pending in federal court, meaning the emissions programs remain in effect for now. [12]

Eight days later, on June 20th, the Supreme Court dealt the CAA Waiver another blow in their ruling in Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. EPA (2025), which granted standing to fuel companies to challenge the EPA’s approval of California’s vehicle emissions regulations as directly harmful to business. The decision opened the door for companies to legally attack California’s emissions regulations and force courts to reinterpret the Clean Air Act waiver provision more narrowly. [13] Although they did not rule on the legality of California’s waiver, the ruling in Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. EPA does establish an accessible pathway for companies to challenge regulations from the waiver. [14] Alongside the overturning of Chevron—which now forces courts to decide de novo whether a statute allows global concerns like climate change to justify California’s waiver—Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. EPA further positions future courts to more narrowly scrutinize serious challenges to the 2022 reinstatement of the waiver. This potential weakness in defense of the CAA Waiver is particularly relevant for several long-standing cases questioning the extent and jurisdiction of the waiver. [15]

In a recent announcement made on July 29, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a new proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding and get rid of all greenhouse gas emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines. [16] If the finding is repealed, the EPA would have no legal authority to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases through the CAA. This would mark the end of California’s CAA Waiver. Prior to approval, the proposal is subject to a 45-day public comment period and is expected to face a wave of legal challenges. If it survives, the rule could be finalized within the next year.

If California’s Clean Air Act waiver is struck down as a result of the weakening of its legal defenses, then the 17 other states that have adopted California’s vehicle emissions standard would lose the authority to enforce those regulations as well. [17] Under the Clean Air Act in Section 209, all U.S. states except California are prohibited from setting their own vehicle emissions standards, but Section 177 allows them to adopt California’s stricter standards if a valid waiver is in place. [18] The legality of California’s waiver has national consequences, and if it falls, the greenhouse gas regulations of a third of the country will be set back years.

Amidst a shifting legal landscape, agencies are adapting to increasingly aggressive legal challenges against the CAA. Noting the court’s hostility towards Chevron, the EPA has not upheld any rulings on the basis of Chevron since 2014, and no decision has been made based on the doctrine since 2016. [19] California has also pivoted away from the Clean Air Act and taken steps to prevent pollution through local laws rather than through the waiver. [20] But while agencies have anticipated and prepared for the fall of Chevron, the recent ruling in Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. EPA and the active threat to the Endangerment Finding actively open the door for direct legal challenges to California’s Clean Air Act waiver, signaling a broader judicial willingness to reexamine and potentially nullify longstanding interpretations of environmental law. The end of Chevron deference and the court’s greenlighting of challenges to the CAA waiver mark a dramatic constriction of regulatory flexibility and shift in interpretive authority from expert agencies to the courts. This development threatens the legal foundation of California’s climate leadership and sets a precedent that may hinder aggressive climate action at both state and federal levels.

While the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and falling technology costs have spurred investment, a shadow looms over the sector: regulatory bottlenecks driven by local opposition and outdated legal frameworks. From 2023 to 2025, these challenges have delayed or canceled 30% of utility-scale solar and wind projects, with legal battles adding an average of 15 months to project timelines. For investors, this volatility demands a recalibration of strategies.

The Bottleneck: Local Opposition and Legal Delays

Local activism and fragmented permitting processes have become major hurdles. A 2025 report by Columbia University's Sabin Center found that 459 counties and municipalities in 44 states imposed severe restrictions on renewable energy projects by year-end. Wind projects faced 298 anti-development laws, while solar projects were contested in 262 cases. States like Michigan (62 restrictions) and New York (46) exemplify the growing trend of localized resistance, often fueled by concerns over land use, aesthetics, and misinformation.

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) remains a double-edged sword. While it ensures environmental safeguards, its procedural rigidity has become a weapon for opponents. Nearly half of wind projects and a third of solar projects that completed NEPA reviews faced litigation. For example, the Calico Solar project was terminated after a decade of legal challenges, while the Searchlight Wind project required a court-ordered redo of its environmental impact statement. These delays inflate capital costs, as developers must maintain financing for extended periods without revenue.

Financial Fallout and Investor Exposure

The financial toll is stark. A 2025 study by E2, Clean Economy Works, revealed that $14 billion in clean energy investments and 10,000 jobs were canceled or downsized between August 2022 and April 2025. April 2025 alone saw $4.5 billion in cancellations, including battery and wind projects. ESG funds and renewable energy ETFs, which rely on predictable returns, now face heightened volatility. For instance, the Green Energy ETF (symbol: GRNL) saw a 12% dip in Q1 2025 amid project delays in Republican-leaning districts that had initially benefited from IRA tax credits.

The IRA's tax incentives have provided a lifeline, but their effectiveness is waning without policy alignment. A 2025 report by the Sabin Center noted that 16 states enacted restrictive legislation in 2024, with some repealing earlier pro-renewable policies. This instability forces investors to factor in regulatory risk as a core component of portfolio resilience.

Hedging Strategies for a Volatile Landscape

To mitigate these risks, investors must adopt a multi-pronged approach:

Jurisdictional Diversification

Prioritize projects in states with streamlined permitting, such as Texas and Florida, which have fewer local restrictions. Texas, for example, accounts for 25% of U.S. solar capacity additions in 2024, partly due to its centralized grid management. Conversely, avoid regions with fragmented oversight, like New York and Michigan, where legal battles are rampant.

Stakeholder Engagement and Adaptive Design

Projects with robust community consultation, such as the Panoche Valley Solar project (which reduced its footprint to address environmental concerns), are 40% less likely to face litigation. Investors should favor developers with proven track records in stakeholder collaboration.

Leverage IRA Incentives and Tax Credits

The IRA's 30% tax credit for solar and 10% for wind remains a critical buffer. However, investors must monitor legislative shifts under the 119th Congress. For example, the Clean Energy Infrastructure ETF (symbol: CEIN) has outperformed peers by 8% in 2025 by focusing on IRA-aligned projects.

Financial Derivatives and Insurance

Use futures and swaps to hedge against price volatility. Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) hedging, as seen in NextEra Energy's (NEE) long-term contracts, provides revenue certainty. Additionally, specialized insurance products covering construction delays and litigation risks are now available from firms like AIG and Chubb.

Portfolio Diversification Across Technologies

Spread investments across solar, wind, and storage to reduce exposure to project-specific litigation. For example, the Renewable Energy Storage ETF (symbol: STOR) has shown 15% lower volatility than solar-only funds in 2025.

The Path Forward

The U.S. green energy transition cannot afford to stall. While regulatory delays and local opposition are significant, they are not insurmountable.

Electric vehicles reduce emissions A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks.
But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.
Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.""
Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","Washington – A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,"" he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electric vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force."" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and ""a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,"" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, ""gas-powered vehicles – use some ethanol in them – I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project ""has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest"" and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The Deliver for America plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house – they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly – it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were ""carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,"" he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

As you aim to enjoy your golden years, you might want to minimize the costs and inconveniences associated with owning a car. Swapping out your gas-guzzling vehicle for an electric one brings several benefits that can help.

Gas Savings

Over the past year, the average gas price has ranged between about $3 and $3.50. The fluctuation of prices can make it difficult to budget, but with an EV, it’s a lot easier and cheaper. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, over the course of 15 years, EV owners can save up to $14,500 in fuel costs alone. However, your savings will depend on the state you live in and how much you drive your car.

Better Batteries and Charging Capabilities

While using a battery-powered car has its limitations, it also creates several benefits. For example, you don’t need to drive to a gas station to fuel up. Now, you can purchase a charging station for your home and charge your car overnight. If you do need to charge your battery while out on the road, it’s getting easier and easier.

Globally, the number of public charging stations has doubled since 2022, totaling 5 million. In the U.S., charging stations increased by 20% in 2024, meaning you won’t need to search far and wide to find one.

Depending on the model of your EV, a single charge can last for 248 to 372 miles.

Today’s batteries also last longer than ever. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that in moderate climates, EV batteries can last 12 to 15 years, while in extreme climates, they can still last eight to 12 years.

Lower Maintenance Costs

If you purchase an EV, you’ll save a lot of money by not having to pay for air filter replacements and oil changes. According to AAA, EV owners who follow the automaker’s recommendations will save $330 in maintenance fees annually compared to those with gas-powered cars.

In regular cars, when you hit the brakes, the forward energy turns into heat and wears down the brake pads. EVs have regenerative braking, which converts that energy into electricity that can power the car. This saves energy and money on brake maintenance.

Greater Safety

EVs are much safer than gas-powered cars. EVs perform well in crash tests and have been deemed as safe as or safer than gas-powered cars by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. They’re also less likely to burst into flames.

On average, between 500 and 600 cars with internal combustion engines catch fire each day. Because EV car frames protect their batteries, they are nearly 60 times less likely to have a fire than a conventional car. Also, when EV batteries do catch fire, they don’t explode like a gasoline fire can.

Environmental Improvements

The International Council on Clean Transportation found that EVs produce 73% less greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetimes compared to gas-powered cars. For retirees, this means creating a better environment for their grandchildren to enjoy.

Comfortable Driving

Most retirees aren’t trying to impress anyone with the revving of their engine or how quickly their vehicle accelerates. Instead, a smooth, quiet ride is much more appealing. EVs are much quieter than their gas-powered counterparts as they have battery-powered systems and don’t need engine RPMs to get the vehicle in motion. The lack of an internal combustion engine reduces the jerks and speed changes, also providing a smoother all-around experience.

And, you guys – the new Mahindra BE 6 is. So. Serious.

Someone at Mahindra is very taken with American culture it seems. After launching the Willys MB Jeep-inspired Mahindra Roxor a few years ago, the company followed it up by building a credible line of EVs co-developed with VW. Now, they’re building a limited edition of one of those EVs inspired by another American cultural icon.

“Batman is more than a pop-culture icon — he represents innovation, resilience, and an unyielding drive to push boundaries,” says Vikram Sharma, Senior Vice President, Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products, APAC. “This collaboration brings that spirit to the road in a bold, electric way. With this limited-edition range, fans in India can now experience the thrill of Batman every time they drive. It’s a collector’s statement on wheels.”

Mahindra Batman BE 6

As a car, the special edition Batman Mahindra is based on the top-shelf version of the BE 6, fitted with a 79 kWh battery good for 550 km (about 340 miles) of range according to its WLTP rating. That battery sends power to a rear-mounted 282 hp (210 kW / 286 PS) electric motor generating and 380 Nm (about 280 lb-ft) of torque that sends power to the rear wheels.

The BE6 also features a modern Level 2 ADAS tech and screens everywhere, including in the steering wheel hub – which seems like it might get particularly nasty in an airbag deployment (but no one asked me).

Pricing starts at ₹27.79 lakh (a little under $27,500, as I type this), and production will be limited to just 300 units. Order books are set to open 23AUG.

Hedge Against Legal Uncertainty: Renewable energy ETFs with diversified portfolios across solar, wind, and storage technologies can reduce exposure to project-specific litigation risks.","The transition to clean energy is a race against time. Yet, as the U.S. scrambles to meet decarbonization targets, a paradox emerges: the very tools designed to protect the environment—laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and state-level regulations—are now slowing the deployment of renewable infrastructure. Between 2023 and 2025, nearly one-third of utility-scale solar projects and half of wind projects faced legal challenges after completing NEPA reviews, adding an average of 15 months to development timelines. These delays, driven by local activism and procedural bottlenecks, are not just slowing progress—they are reshaping the risk profiles of ESG funds and renewable energy ETFs.

The Legal Labyrinth: How Activism and Regulations Create Gridlock

The Obama-era Bureau of Land Management (BLM) ""Fast Track"" initiative, intended to accelerate solar and wind projects on public lands, has become a case study in regulatory overreach. Projects like the Calico Solar and Searchlight Wind were initially hailed as climate champions but later became lightning rods for litigation. Environmental groups, tribal nations, and local stakeholders have increasingly used NEPA as a tool to challenge projects they deem insufficiently vetted. For instance, the Colorado River Indian Tribes successfully contested the Modified Blythe Solar project, citing unresolved cultural and environmental concerns. Similarly, the Quechan Tribe's temporary restraining order against the Imperial Valley Solar project forced a relocation to agricultural land.

These legal battles are not merely procedural. They reflect a broader tension between rapid decarbonization and the need for inclusive, transparent planning. While NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts, its implementation has become a battleground. Developers now face a Catch-22: expedite projects to meet climate goals or risk costly delays from litigation. The result? A fragmented landscape where 15-month delays are the norm, and three projects—Calico Solar, Searchlight Wind, and Whistling Ridge Wind—were outright terminated.

Financial Fallout: ESG Funds and ETFs in the Crosshairs

The financial implications for investors are stark. ESG funds and renewable energy ETFs, which rely on predictable timelines and returns, are now grappling with a new layer of volatility. The 15-month average delay increases capital expenditures, as developers must maintain financing for longer periods before generating revenue. For example, the Coggon Solar project's litigation extended into the Iowa Supreme Court, while the Campo Wind project faced procedural delays from the Ninth Circuit. These delays disrupt financial models, reduce return on investment (ROI), and amplify the risk of project failure.

Yet, the data tells a nuanced story. A 2025 study, ""Performance of Energy ETFs and Climate Risks,"" reveals that green portfolios outperformed traditional ""brown"" energy assets during 2023–2025, despite regulatory headwinds. Green ETFs attracted higher fund flows and exhibited lower downside risk, as measured by market semibeta. This resilience is partly due to falling renewable technology costs, AI-driven operational efficiencies, and the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) tax incentives. However, the study also warns that regulatory delays could erode this advantage if policy alignment fails to address permitting bottlenecks.

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors in clean energy equities, the lesson is clear: regulatory risk is now a core component of portfolio resilience. Here's how to navigate the landscape:

Prioritize Projects with Stakeholder Engagement: Developers that proactively engage with local communities and tribal stakeholders—like those in the Topaz and Panoche Valley settlements—are less likely to face litigation. ESG funds should favor projects with transparent consultation processes and adaptive design modifications.

Diversify Across Jurisdictions: States with streamlined permitting processes (e.g., Texas, Florida) offer lower regulatory risk compared to regions with fragmented state laws. Investors should weigh geographic exposure to mitigate delays.

Leverage Policy Alignment: The IRA's tax credits and green hydrogen incentives provide a buffer against delays, but their effectiveness hinges on policy continuity. Investors should monitor legislative shifts, particularly under the 119th Congress, and adjust holdings accordingly.

Hedge Against Legal Uncertainty: Renewable energy ETFs with diversified portfolios across solar, wind, and storage technologies can reduce exposure to project-specific litigation risks.

The Path Forward: Balancing Speed and Scrutiny

The green energy transition cannot afford to be held hostage by outdated regulations or reactive activism. While NEPA's intent—to ensure environmental accountability—remains valid, its execution must evolve to accommodate the urgency of climate action. Developers and policymakers must collaborate to modernize permitting frameworks, enhance tribal consultation, and streamline environmental reviews without sacrificing due diligence.

For investors, the key is to align portfolios with projects that balance regulatory compliance with innovation. The future of clean energy lies not in avoiding scrutiny but in embracing it—proactively, transparently, and with a commitment to long-term resilience.

In the end, the race to decarbonize is not just about technology or capital—it's about navigating the human and legal dimensions of progress. Those who master this terrain will find themselves at the forefront of a cleaner, more profitable future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-17 14:00:58.052938

Downstate, Con Edison is seeking an 11.4% hike to electric bills and 13.3% gas hike — largely thanks to green-energy mandates that Gov. Kathy Hochul embraced along with the rest of the party.

The “climate agenda” is delivering pain we’ve long warned of, in New York and New Jersey.

Across the Hudson, electric bills as much as tripled this summer — and could cost Democrats the Jersey governor’s race.

“Once they realize that Democrats’ bungled energy policies are to blame for their exploding utility bills as well, it could blow November’s race wide open,” warned Bethany Mandel last week.

Yes, GOP Gov. Chris Christie shares in the blame for the Garden State’s madness, but it started with the Democrats before him and accelerated under Dem Gov. Phil Murphy, who let the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant close in 2018 and aggressively shut down fossil fuel-powered electricity sources.

New York’s worst-in-the-nation Climate Action Plan began under Gov. Andrew Cuomo but then Hochul doubled down on closing reliable natural-gas power plants and pretending expensive — and less reliable — solar and offshore wind installations could not only replace them, but make up for growing electric demand.

Both states are using more electricity than ever — even as “decarbonization” prevented supply from growing to match.

Even without soaring power demands for data centers and AI, green policies that push ever-more consumers to need electricity for cooking, home heating and vehicles put added strain on the grid.

Hochul’s belated push for new nuclear reactors upstate comes too late to stop the crunch; even “clean power” advocates admit the high risk will cause chaos for New York’s power grid.

Democrats who locked both states into this idiocy certainly should pay the political price.

Beehive is designed to receive energy from the power grid during periods of high renewable penetration, store it in a series of batteries, and discharge electricity back into the power grid at peak demand hours. The BESS thereby supports APS in managing its growing energy and capacity demand.

'With electricity demand rapidly increasing in the Southwest, we anticipate battery storage will play a critical role in powering innovation and economic growth,' said Tim Evans, Partner and Head of North America at CIP. 'Beehive will provide reliable energy and grid services to customers in Arizona and build on CIP’s track record of developing, constructing, and operating energy infrastructure investments across the country. We are pleased to have worked with the EDF power solutions team.'

The project marks EDF power solutions' second stand-alone energy storage project, underscoring its commitment to innovation and the expansion of expertise in BESS technology. As a vital complement to its core renewable generation business, energy storage has gained increasing importance in EDF power solutions’ portfolio reinforcing the company’s dedication to maximizing the potential of renewable energy and accelerating the energy transition, ultimately contributing to the decarbonization of the economy.

'EDF power solutions actively seeks partnerships across all stages of a project’s lifecycle, with an eye toward both optimizing our portfolio and maximizing value creation,' said Ryan Pfaff, Executive Vice President, Grid and Distribution-Scale Power at EDF power solutions North America. 'We value the opportunity to collaborate with CIP on the Beehive project and look forward to working with CIP to ensure the successful completion of this critical large-scale energy storage system to support Arizona’s grid during peak hours.'

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency’s new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,” he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That’s a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university’s Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn’t make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.” She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and “a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,” Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, “gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa’s farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project “has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest” and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism, it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There’s also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were “carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it’s fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,” he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”",https://kslnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Electric_Vehicles-Postal_58421-e1755447656893.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 15:02:02.947966

Inslee made fighting climate change the rhetorical centerpiece of his time as governor and his short-lived presidential campaign.
Florida, with no meaningful climate policy, outperformed Washington with Jay Inslee at the helm.
That approach earned Jay Inslee national attention and accolades.
Todd Myers has worked on energy and environmental policy in Washington state for 25 years and is vice president for research at the Washington Policy Center in Seattle.","With passage of a federal budget that cuts subsidies for renewables like wind and solar and an executive order promising to “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources,” climate activists are considering new approaches to reduce the impact of greenhouse gases. One such champion stepping forward is former Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee.

Inslee made fighting climate change the rhetorical centerpiece of his time as governor and his short-lived presidential campaign. Inslee claims he made Washington state “a leader” in the fight against climate change, and Time magazine gave him a 2025 Earth Award, saying the former governor “believes in the power of local action.”

Having worked on environmental policy for 25 years in Washington state, I can attest that following Inslee’s lead would be a catastrophic mistake.

In a recent editorial, he argued that Democrats should use climate change to “win over young Trump voters.” His central, and repeated, error — the one he now encourages national climate activists to follow — is to treat climate change as a political tool, rather than focusing on effective solutions.

In fact, Washington state’s carbon dioxide emissions increased every year of Inslee’s first decade in office, except 2020. The governor’s policies were so ineffective that, in 2019, Florida’s per capita CO2 emissions were actually lower than Washington state’s, having been 10 percent higher just six years earlier. Florida, with no meaningful climate policy, outperformed Washington with Jay Inslee at the helm.

Given a choice between candidly assessing the results of his policies and political expediency, the governor routinely chose politics.

When he took office, Inslee promised to track the results of his policies, creating a web page that showed progress toward climate goals. He said the goal was to use that data to fix problems and improve outcomes. But in 2019, just prior to announcing his presidential campaign, Inslee’s administration shut down the page. His administration was missing virtually all its targets, an embarrassing reality for the “climate candidate.”

Washington is now so far behind its 2030 emissions targets the state will have to cut CO2 emissions by the equivalent of three COVID-level pandemic shutdown reductions cumulatively.

Washington’s electric vehicle policy is another example of how the state has performed so poorly. Last year, Inslee announced a $45 million program of subsidies to help “provide low-income Washingtonians access to electric vehicles.” The results were mixed at best, failing to “ensure the rebates reached overburdened and vulnerable communities.”

Governor Inslee deflects from those failures, instead focusing on the CO2 cap-and-trade system that took effect in 2023, promising that it will deliver results in the future. However, early results show projects funded by that system are failing to deliver emissions reductions. His own administration released a report showing that approximately two-thirds of the state’s climate projects create no “quantifiable emissions reductions.”

The pattern has been to make bold statements and send out press releases claiming victory while repeatedly failing to deliver. With each failure, Inslee relied on partisanship to paper over policy failures. That approach earned Jay Inslee national attention and accolades. It did not, however, help the planet.

This strategy is irresponsible and creates cynicism that undermines the ability to promote effective climate policy. Those who are sincere about climate and environmental policy are at a crossroads. They can take the route suggested by Inslee and put politics first, or they can honestly assess the record of the past two decades of climate policy and look for a better approach.

Those who believe climate change is — as Jay Inslee has often said — an “existential crisis” must live up to that rhetoric and ostracize self-serving politicians whose use of climate change as a political weapon has become a major barrier to addressing the problem. Politicians should look to companies like Microsoft and Amazon that invest in projects that are certified to reduce CO2 emissions — and if they don’t, the funding is returned. Prioritizing efforts based on effectiveness and innovation, rather than political grandstanding, is the only way to responsibly reduce the risk from climate change.

During the next three-and-a-half years of the Trump administration, those who care about reducing the risk from climate change can take the partisan (and failed) path that Inslee recommends. Or they can begin to find alternatives that aren’t contingent on politics and, instead, focus on results.

Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.

Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.

“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.

Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”

But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.

“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.

The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.

The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.

Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

There's a clear reason why 85% of surveyed clean energy business leaders consider clean energy tax credits ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" to business growth.
With federal clean energy tax credits now repealed, we need state officials and private companies to step up and maintain ""American energy dominance.""
That means investing in clean energy and putting consumers first, not hosting summits that ignore these vital goals.","The AI and energy summit held a few weeks ago in Pittsburgh by U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick and headlined by President Donald Trump made sweeping promises about Pennsylvania's energy future.

The event – featuring $70 billion in announced investments – offered potential benefits for workers and the regional economy if these commitments materialize. However, the summit was notably imbalanced, showcasing familiar rhetoric from fossil fuel companies while excluding a crucial player in Pennsylvania's energy landscape: clean energy companies.

This one-sided focus on gas failed to address the comprehensive challenges our region faces in the coming decades. With AI data centers driving unprecedented energy demand and extreme weather straining our grid, we need solutions that include all energy sources, not just fossil fuels. Sen. McCormick stated in a statement last month, ""There's no question that the path to American energy dominance runs directly through Pennsylvania."" I agree, but excluding home-grown clean energy like solar, wind and battery storage overlooks the significant job growth and cost savings that renewable energy has already delivered to our state's economy.

Clean energy investments benefit both rural communities and urban centers by lowering costs on everything from farm equipment to public transportation, while reducing pollution. Unfortunately, the Republican tax bill recently signed by President Trump eliminates clean energy incentives that have created jobs and reduced energy costs for Pennsylvanians.

With federal clean energy tax credits now repealed by Trump and congressional Republicans, Pennsylvania is projected to lose 26,400 jobs by 2030 and 29,000 jobs by 2035. Our state's GDP is expected to decrease by $3.44 billion in 2030 and $5.79 billion in 2035. There's a clear reason why 85% of surveyed clean energy business leaders consider clean energy tax credits ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" to business growth. Over half of these businesses anticipate revenue losses as a direct result of these repealed investments.

Clean energy benefits both businesses and consumers. In 2023, more than 158,000 Pennsylvania families received over $267 million in tax credits, which reduced costs for clean energy and efficiency upgrades like rooftop solar panels.

With these and other tax credits now repealed, Pennsylvania families face an expected increase of $170 in average annual household energy costs by 2030. This comes as utility prices are already rising for Pennsylvania consumers. Electricity bills in Pennsylvania have increased in March and again in June this year.

While President Trump and Republicans claim to care about rising costs, the Trump administration laid off the entire staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helped low-income households pay their heating and cooling bills. In FY2023, Pennsylvania received over $334 million in LIHEAP funding, helping over 312,000 households reduce their energy bills.

Programs like LIHEAP are increasingly vital as AI development and extreme heat drive energy demand to new heights, straining our grid. Clean energy helps meet this growing demand, with solar and wind power now 50% cheaper than electricity from fossil fuels. Pennsylvania currently hosts 88 data centers and ranks among the top three emerging markets for these facilities. A Monitoring Analytics report identified data center demand growth as the ""primary reason"" behind an 800% price increase in grid operator PJM's recent capacity auction. This auction is expected to increase energy bills by up to 20% for customers across Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and West Virginia.

The impact of extreme heat and related storms is already evident: high temperatures in June 2025 caused blackouts affecting tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians across the state. These included outages in central Pennsylvania, where a substation transformer failed and high temperatures led to repeated power losses, across the Philadelphia region, and in Pittsburgh and Erie.

To meet the growing demand from data centers and extreme weather, we need more energy sources, not fewer. Clean energy investments have created jobs in Pennsylvania while reducing consumer utility bills.

With federal clean energy tax credits now repealed, we need state officials and private companies to step up and maintain ""American energy dominance."" That means investing in clean energy and putting consumers first, not hosting summits that ignore these vital goals.

During the outcry against nuclear power in the 1970s, liberal Oregon lawmakers hatched a plan to slow an industry that was just getting started. They created a burdensome process that gave the public increased say over where power plants could be built, and the leading anti-nuclear activists of the day used appeal after appeal to delay proposed nuclear plants to death. It had a huge impact: Oregon’s first commercial nuclear plant, the one that spurred lawmakers into action, was also the state’s last.

What those lawmakers didn’t plan for was that 50 years later, an Oregon citizen activist would use that same bureaucracy to hinder some of the very energy projects that today’s liberals want: wind farms and the new high-voltage lines needed to support them.

They didn’t plan for Irene Gilbert.

The 76-year-old retired state employee, former gun store owner and avid elk hunter from La Grande, Oregon, is on a mission to keep turbines and transmission towers from blighting the rural landscape. She has filed more challenges to energy projects — 15 in all, including lawsuits — than anyone in the state, according to Oregon’s Department of Energy.

“I kind of have a reputation,” Gilbert said.

Renewable energy advocates treat activists like Gilbert as relentless gadflies who need to be stopped for the good of the planet.

They say Oregon’s slow process for approving energy projects, with its endless appeals, is one reason the state ranks near last in the country for green energy growth despite setting a deadline to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2040.

Democratic leaders up and down the West Coast are reckoning with liberal policies of the past that they say clash with today’s progressive agenda. In California, for example, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a rollback of environmental review laws to expedite the construction of affordable housing. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has been pushing to roll back her state’s vaunted land-use restrictions for the same reason.

But Oregon leaders have been far less aggressive in confronting the historical artifacts that critics say hold green energy back. One, the Depression-vintage federal agency that runs most of the Northwest power grid, which has set a sluggish pace for upgrades; the other, the energy siting system Oregon created long ago for nuclear power. (The federal agency says it makes financially prudent decisions about construction.)

In the past five years, the Oregon Legislature has repeatedly rejected or watered down bills to streamline permitting of energy projects. The efforts included legislation supported by renewables advocates as well as farming and land conservation groups, both of which share Gilbert’s concerns about development in rural spaces.

In response to questions from OPB and ProPublica, the governor’s office acknowledged “existing significant impediments” to renewable energy growth in Oregon.

Kotek is “carefully considering opportunities to streamline Oregon’s energy siting processes,” spokesperson Anca Matica said in an email, “while maintaining opportunities for community input and preventing detrimental impacts.”

In the meantime, Kotek and lawmakers let another effort to modernize the system fall through the cracks this year. A proposal to limit public appeals and speed up permitting decisions resulted in only minor changes to the process. The status quo means developers remain locked in battles with Gilbert and others for years on end.

“I figure I can lose a thousand cases,” Gilbert said. “Even if it doesn’t look like it, I have made a difference.”

An old lady with a laptop

Gilbert was retired from a career in state government and was running the Oregon Trail Trader gun shop with her partner in La Grande when she first heard about the Antelope Ridge wind farm. It was 2009, and only a handful of wind farms existed in the state. But an energy company suddenly wanted to erect 180 turbines across the scenic Grande Ronde River valley just outside town.

Energy infrastructure was a sore spot for Gilbert. Decades ago, she’d married into a ranching and timber family, and a chunk of the forest she owned was bulldozed for a transmission line. She blamed the line when she couldn’t get the timber to grow as she wanted.

She also had a stark memory of how quickly a business can erase a beloved part of rural Oregon. The company that owned Kinzua, the timber town where she grew up, razed it without a trace after shutting down operations in 1978.

Now that she was older, she said, she wanted to give back, and she was motivated by the idea of helping farmers and others protect their land from the government and electric companies.

“I feel like my reason for participating now is to do what I can to help these poor folks,” she said.

Gilbert became the legal research analyst for an opposition group known as Friends of the Grande Ronde Valley.

The tangle of rules governing energy siting was no problem. She’d worked as a trainer for the Oregon Department of Human Services and later Oregon Occupational Safety and Health, where she taught people how to understand the statutes that guided their work.

“So I know how to read government regulations,” she said.

She also enjoys it.

“It keeps my brain working,” she said with a laugh.

Gilbert spoke against the wind farm at public hearings. During one meeting in which she tried to add to her previous comments, she was cut off because the time for public testimony had passed.

She argued against the wind farm before the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council, which has ultimate authority over whether major pieces of infrastructure like wind farms, solar projects, power plants and transmission lines get built. She sent a letter to the governor’s office stating she would sue and make all of the state’s dealings with the energy company public along the way.

That wind farm never materialized. The company backed out in 2013, citing poor market conditions.

“We were successful in stopping that,” she said. “The company would say that it was a financial decision. I think it was more than that.” (The company told OPB and ProPublica in a statement that it was “the lack of strong commercial prospects.”)

Proposals for new wind farms kept cropping up, and she contested as many as she could, even ones three hours from her home. She’s missed only a handful of the energy siting council’s monthly meetings in the past decade, driving all around the state before video conferencing became common. Developers have approached her after meetings, she said, and asked her what it would take to make her happy.

“I’ve been called ‘an old lady who has access to a computer,’” she said. “That’s kind of, I guess, how I’m viewed, and OK … I guess that’s OK.”

She sometimes works at the antique desk in her home office, sometimes from the couch in a living room filled with her grandchildren’s artwork. She’s filed multiple challenges to five wind farms plus one big transmission line since the demise of Antelope Ridge. The transmission line is moving forward. Two of the wind projects were scuttled by developers, while three others got built.

Landowners and lawyers from around the region eventually began seeking her input for filing their own objections to energy projects.

“And my advice is free,” she said.

A committed Republican, Gilbert said she doesn’t do all this because she opposes the idea of clean energy. She owns a cabin powered by rooftop solar panels. She said she doesn’t believe in the need for large-scale solar, but said she did support a solar farm in the scenic Columbia River Gorge after developers listened to public input and took steps to reduce the project’s impact.

But she finds herself quite often at odds with the work of major wind, solar and transmission players, “Just because it’s taking so much land.”

Fuji Kreider, a self-described liberal Democrat who relocated from New York, started a friendship with Gilbert while both campaigned against a major transmission project.

“She calls herself a redneck environmentalist,” Kreider said during a visit to Gilbert’s home.

Kreider’s husband, Jim, chimed in: “A redneck, gun-toting environmentalist.”

“Something like that,” Kreider said.

The Boardman to Hemingway Line

In late summer 2023, Adam Richins, the chief operating officer of the electric utility Idaho Power, sat down in a black leather wingback chair at Paddy’s Bar & Grill in downtown Portland to swap horror stories with other Northwest leaders in the industry on a niche podcast called the Public Power Underground.

One of Richins’ doozies involved Irene Gilbert.

Richins at the time was in year 16 of trying to build a 300-mile transmission line through Eastern Oregon, known as the Boardman to Hemingway line, or B2H for short. It is the crucible of Oregon’s energy growth, the single piece of infrastructure that utilities and renewable advocates are most eager to see built. It would connect Idaho green energy suppliers with Oregon data centers that demand loads of electricity.

“Anybody want to guess?” Richins asked his fellow power execs at one point during the show. “State process application. How many pages?”

“10,000,” one offered.

He shook his head, raised his thumb upward. Higher. And higher still.

“It was close to 20,000 pages,” Richins told them.

By the time the executive finished his tale of environmental reviews and land use certificates, he joked that he had tears running from his eyes.

“But then, guess what happens?” Richins said. “We got sued.”

By Gilbert.

Gilbert’s fight against B2H has been her biggest yet. Slicing through 300 miles of land Gilbert desperately wants to keep undisturbed, the line illustrates the stakes she and other rural Oregonians see in ridding grasslands and forests of massive new energy projects.

One of Gilbert’s “Stop B2H” allies, John Williams, owns the last remaining swath of what was once a sprawling family ranch and timber estate, just a few minutes’ drive from Gilbert’s home. Bushwhacking through wildflowers along his property line on a recent day, Williams, Gilbert and the Kreiders looked out on Twin Lake, its surface carpeted in yellow pond lilies and dotted with nesting birds. The activists worry the line will harm birds and that construction and maintenance crews driving through the transmission line corridor will carry in noxious weeds and invasive species.

Williams said Idaho Power’s proposed path, which runs through his property, has evolved over time — for the worse. “It’s lipstick on a pig,” he said, “but the original route I think made a lot less damage. It was lower in elevation. It took less timber.”

Idaho Power spokesperson Sven Berg told OPB and ProPublica the company has altered the transmission line’s path numerous times in response to public feedback and that the project is better for it.

About an hour west of Twin Lake the next day, Gilbert sat with Sam Myers, who runs a fourth-generation wheat farm that the B2H line would transect. Myers said he worries the high-voltage lines could spark wildfires or electrocute people operating farm machinery nearby. (Idaho Power says planting and harvesting crops near the B2H will still be safe but cautions farmers against using machinery taller than 15 feet underneath. The company says its equipment meets or exceeds industry standards, that this equipment is closely monitored, and that the tall, metallic structures used for lines like B2H pose less fire risk than with smaller ones.)

Myers said he’s turned down developers offering “huge amounts of money” to put solar panels on his property.

“I don’t want to change farm ground to solar,” he said he’s told them. “Is there a way we can have a coexistence?”

Gilbert’s Stop B2H coalition, with 1,000 members, raised more than $350,000 against the project. (Kreider, the group’s treasurer, said the vast majority of donations — aside from larger checks from a few landowners and two historic preservation organizations — were less than $1,000 and came from individuals in Oregon and eastern Idaho. She said the money went mainly to legal fees.)

B2H opponents filed a total of 117 challenges to the power line project, keeping the appeals process going long after the state approved construction in 2019.

In late March, though, the opponents lost their final appeal in court. Idaho Power began construction last month.

If Richins, the utility’s COO, feels exasperated by the two decades it took to overcome complaints from Gilbert and others, Gilbert thinks mainly about the outcome for her side.

For all its delays, the state’s energy council, in practice, does not reject proposed projects. And despite the claims that she’s gumming up the state’s process with her appeals, Gilbert has never actually reversed a council decision.

“My perception is that I’m ignored,” she said.

Oregon’s energy law

It might seem paradoxical that Gilbert considers herself an environmentalist while standing in the way of what most environmentalists today see as progress. But her right to do so has its roots in Oregon’s storied conservation movement of the 1970s.

Portland General Electric, a leading utility, prompted a fierce public backlash when it announced construction in 1967 on the Trojan Nuclear Plant about an hour outside of Portland. To address concerns about the safety of nuclear power and radioactive waste, Oregon lawmakers created the Nuclear and Thermal Energy Council.

PGE would eventually shutter Trojan after decades of regulatory violations, forced shutdowns, construction flaws, costly repairs and constant harrying from antinuclear activist Lloyd Marbet through the state council. Marbet’s tactics also delayed PGE’s efforts to build two more plants on the Columbia River until voters passed a ballot measure in 1980, creating strict rules for nuclear power that effectively killed the industry in Oregon.

The council lived on, rebranded as the Energy Facility Siting Council to cover more than just nuclear power.

Oregon is one of only 10 states with statewide energy standards, and renewable energy developers consider its approval process one of the country’s most rigorous. Covering everything from environmental safety and wildfire risk to sites of archaeological significance, Oregon’s law requires developers to follow many of the same steps federal regulators require.

The process is supposed to take no more than a year. But the energy siting council will suspend the deadline anytime someone formally objects to a project’s approval. A protest triggers a hearing, after which an administrative judge can ask the council to reverse itself, after which the council can agree or disagree, after which anyone can file a lawsuit, after which years of litigation may begin.

Oregon’s assistant director for energy siting, Todd Cornett, said public involvement can slow projects down, but that’s what the Legislature intended. While most of the power gets consumed on the more populous west side of the state that includes Portland, he noted, the new windmills and solar arrays are generally destined for dry, windy and rural Eastern Oregon.

“We want to make sure that we’re taking into consideration all of the issues and concerns that people who are going to have to live with these facilities raise in the process,” he said.

Cornett denies this process has held back renewables, noting that projects have stalled even after the council’s approval. But he also acknowledged such holdups arise because new wind and solar farms will need more transmission lines to carry their output. There aren’t enough, in part, because it’s so difficult to get new ones through Cornett’s agency.

Some Oregon progressives give a nod to the bureaucracy that once mired nuclear reactors and say it’s time to give windmills and solar panels a faster pass.

“The process back in the early ’70s was meant to be a little bit more plodding,” said Oregon Rep. Ken Helm, a Democrat from the Portland suburbs, during a House floor speech in April. “Now that we are many, many decades past that time, we’re finding that the procedures EFSC operates under are really too slow for the relatively low-risk renewable energy that we’re seeking.”

Yet lawmakers have balked at meaningful changes.

Two years ago, they rejected a bill to create committees of farmers, developers, tribes and conservationists to identify places in each county for transmission lines and energy production. The bill also would have directed state agencies to streamline the renewable energy approval process.

This year, lawmakers rejected a bill to promote solar farms that coexist with cropland. Research at Oregon State University has found that the shade from solar panels increased crop yields and that, in turn, the crops can make solar panels work more efficiently by keeping the air around them cool.

With Gilbert’s long battle against B2H dragging on earlier this year, some lawmakers became galvanized. The fact that it took 20 years to get the project on track was “ridiculous,” said Rep. Mark Gamba, a Portland-area Democrat who is vice chair of the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment.

In February, Gamba introduced legislation to overhaul the state’s approach to siting and permitting energy facilities. Among the proposed changes: a tight restriction on appeals from members of the public. The provision would require that any lawsuit challenging the state’s approval of a project be fast-tracked to the state Supreme Court.

“So the NIMBYs will only get one bite at the apple,” Gamba said, using the acronym for “not in my backyard” that refers to people considered reflexively opposed to development near them.

The Legislature was coming after the gadflies like Gilbert.

An overachiever for the underdog

When members of the Stop B2H coalition gather in Gilbert’s living room, a computerized display of properties in the path of the project sits on a chair just beneath a portrait of a Native American man in a headdress of fur and bison horns. One of Gilbert’s brothers made the canvas from the hide of an elk he shot, and another painted it.

Both brothers died of Huntington’s disease, a genetic disorder that began to severely debilitate them during their 30s. Gilbert, who had the same likelihood of inheriting the disease but did not, said losing them turned her into an overachiever who always wanted to fight for the underdog.

“I think I kind of try to compensate for what they weren’t able to do,” she said.

Fights against energy and transmission projects have been her mainstay for more than a decade. She said she sometimes awakens in the middle of the night, struck by an idea about a rule or statute that might be of use.

“Most of the people in Stop B2H believe that we need more energy. And I agree, we need more energy. But we cannot provide the energy needs of this country or this state by taking all of the farmland,” Gilbert said. “There’s a point where we aren’t going to have the land needed to produce food.”

When Gilbert heard about Gamba’s bill to upend her main means of objecting, she did not panic. She did what she has always done. She spoke up.

On a recent May afternoon in Salem, Gilbert sat on a window bench outside a Capitol hearing room where she’d testified against Gamba’s bill.

“I remember you!” exclaimed Gilbert’s state representative, Republican Bobby Levy. “You’re one of the smartest people. You do your research.”

Levy said she was working to oppose the bill.

Gamba in the end was disappointed with what the Legislature was able to pass. After setting out to overhaul Oregon’s energy siting bureaucracy, he said the scaled-back legislation only “dabbled around the edges.” It might shave 10% off approval times for green energy, he said.

What did survive was Gamba’s effort to move lawsuits filed by people like Gilbert directly to the Oregon Supreme Court. Gilbert was dismayed to lose the chance to build a case over time. But it won’t stop her.

Now that the Boardman to Hemingway line is actually getting built, Gilbert said, it will bring a rash of new applications from people seeking to build wind and solar farms along the power line’s route. Gilbert will be standing by to file challenges.

Historically, though, the US is still responsible for more emissions than China, but China makes up now about a third of global emissions.
Jo Lauder: Yeah.
Jo Lauder: Yeah, it's interesting because climate is always a factor in this, and China was concerned about it.
Sam Hawley: Yeah.","Sam Hawley: In April, China installed more solar power than Australia has throughout history in just that month. China is also now home to half of the world's wind power and half of the world's electric cars. So how has the Communist Party managed to electrify the nation so quickly? Today, climate reporter Jo Lorder on why China is becoming the world's first electro-state. I'm Sam Hawley on Gadigal Land in Sydney. This is ABC News Daily. I'm Sam Hawley on Gadigal Land in Sydney. Jo, for a long time, if you mentioned Beijing, your mind would just go to pollution. It was one of the most polluted cities in the world, wasn't it?

Jo Lauder: Yeah, it was really, really bad. So often there was this really, really thick smog and it was becoming a health crisis, it was becoming a bit of a political crisis.

News report: Toxic Beijing is back. Severe air pollution is again being recorded here. It's extremely severe. There are a lot of people coughing and not in good health.

Jo Lauder: In 2013, on average, there was just over 101 micrograms of PM2.5 particles. What the World Health Organisation kind of recognises as, like, you know, healthy, it shouldn't exceed five micrograms. So really, really bad. And this happened because this was after years of really heavy industrial emissions and pretty quick industrialisation in China. It really became the world's factory. You know, countries like Australia, we ended up offshoring a lot of our manufacturing. These factories are really, really energy intensive. So there's burning lots of coal to be able to produce all these products to sell to the world. So China was modernising its economy really quickly in this period, having huge economic growth, but pulling people out of poverty. But it's also causing these really, really significant environmental issues in terms of air pollution, environmental degradation and pollution. And it was becoming a really big problem.

Sam Hawley: Yeah, so it's developing really, really quickly. And at the same time, greenhouse gas emissions are going through the roof, I presume.

Jo Lauder: Yeah. So around this period after this massive industrialisation is where we see China becoming one of the largest and then the largest polluter in the world in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. So in 2006, China overtook the US as the world's biggest emitter. Historically, though, the US is still responsible for more emissions than China, but China makes up now about a third of global emissions. It does have a really big population. So interestingly, per capita, Australia, the US per capita still has higher emissions, but China, it's a really big player. Like it's a third of global emissions. So this is kind of an issue for everybody, not just China.

Sam Hawley: All right. Well, the Communist Party, Jo, then came to a point where it really needed and wanted to do something about this pollution crisis it had found itself in. So that's when it tried to turn things around. Just tell me about that.

Jo Lauder: Yeah. So about a decade ago, it introduced a plan called Made in China 2025. And so this was a 10-year plan and it was really outlining how China was going to reshape its manufacturing capability. It wanted to stop just making kind of cheap, low-quality stuff to send to the world, focus on more high-end products. And really, they were interested in the ones that are going to address climate change. They could see that this is a huge economic opportunity. The world is going to be wanting these products. They'll be able to sell them for more. And so China began to invest in all the components, all the different parts for renewables, really, especially around wind and solar, electric cars, and then batteries as well, because if you're making the cars, you make the batteries. And so then that's household batteries, energy storage. And so the superpower really put its economic might, its willpower behind renewable technologies. And this is phenomenal because this is really accelerating the end of the fossil fuel era. And it's bringing about what people are calling the age of the electro state.

Sam Hawley: Interesting. All right. So just to explain that further, though, this wasn't so much about cutting greenhouse gas emissions for China. It was actually just trying to get rid of this smog, this pollution that was becoming a huge problem for the population.

Jo Lauder: Yeah, it's interesting because climate is always a factor in this, and China was concerned about it. But it wasn't really the number one thing going on here. It was, as you said, it was this smog and this pollution crisis in the cities. They wanted to lean into green technology as well because they saw this economic opportunity to sell this to the rest of the world and get ahead of everyone else. The other reason as well is energy security. One of the reasons China really has pivoted to electrification is because they're quite dependent on imported fossil fuels. It's the world's biggest oil importer. And China has lots and lots of coal. That's why in that period of rapid industrialisation they really heavily relied on coal. But they don't have much gas. They don't really have much oil. And they really see this as a weakness. So they saw electrification as an opportunity to get off that dependence.

Sam Hawley: All right. Okay, so, Jo, now, today, China has become a global powerhouse in renewable energy. So let's step through that. How has it electrified and become a so-called electro state?

Jo Lauder: Yes, Sam, it's pretty phenomenal. So, you know, we hear a lot about targets in Australia and our 2030 renewables targets. China just hit its target six years early. So it is just streaking ahead. In April this year, China installed more solar power than Australia has in all of its history in just one month. That's what it's doing. And it is, you know, month after month it is doing this. And Australia is not even bad at solar either. Like, we have the highest per capita uptake of rooftop solar. We're a pretty sunny country. We're doing all right. But that just shows, like, China is just miles ahead. It's got half of the world's solar, half of the world's wind power, half of the world's electric cars, all in China. And there's more to come as well. Like, China has nearly twice the amount of wind and solar capacity under construction in 2024 as the rest of the world combined. So this is going to keep continuing. And the other one as well is EVs. They've been this huge driver of electrification. Half of electric cars all around the world are in China. And so these â€“ and this is going to keep continuing. EV sales are really, really significant there. And so these things are all bringing about this structural change in China.

Sam Hawley: And the reason, I guess, China is moving so quickly, Jo, is because the government, the Communist Party, is really investing a lot of money in this, isn't it?

Jo Lauder: Yeah, they really put the whole state behind this. They put huge government subsidies and support behind it. The International Energy Agency found that last year China's clean energy investments were worth more than $625 billion US. That's double from when they started this project. So it's really significant. And

Sam Hawley: it's also helping China's economic growth, right? Because it's actually exporting this clean tech too.

Jo Lauder: Yeah, so this is the thing. They're exporting it. They're also implementing it themselves in China to deal with these issues. And this is a huge economic opportunity. They're not just doing this out of, like, goodwill and concern. You would notice most days now you see more and more Chinese-made electric cars on the road in Australia. A lot of our solar panels are made in China. And that's also bringing costs down for everybody around the world. And this is really important because the transition won't happen if it's too expensive, especially for countries in the global south. Like, it has to be cheap. And so China is really bringing that about for everybody. And this is going to have a global impact on emissions. So last year alone, there were some studies done, and it found that China's clean energy exports just from last year have shaved off 1% of global emissions outside of China. And they will keep doing that. They'll take 1% off every year for the next 30 years. And so that's just going to keep happening, is that this year there'll be more as well. So it's having a really big impact.

Sam Hawley: Yeah, it's amazing. But there is a flip side to this.

Jo Lauder: There is a but.

Sam Hawley: There is a but because China's also building dirty coal-fired power stations still.

Jo Lauder: Yeah, I know. This is the dissonance. And it's really interesting because China is often talked about. You know, people are like, it's doing great. And everyone's like, yeah, but it's also still the highest emitter and it's building all these coal-fired power stations. And so what's happened is, as China has had this massive kind of push of this new industrialisation around the Made in China plan, that takes a lot of energy as well to run those factories. And it's also got a growing middle class. This has meant that there's just more and more power demand. And so what's been happening is there's this kind of race that's going on as China has more energy demand every year, but then they're building more renewables. And it's just been up until now the demand has kind of been outstripping renewables. But it looks like that might be changing. But in the meantime, they have been building more coal-fired power stations. But what we're seeing is they're starting to use them less, which is interesting.

Sam Hawley: Yeah. Okay. So are China's emissions actually coming down? Maybe. Right.

Jo Lauder: Potentially. So as we said, China is still the world's biggest emitter, but there has been some interesting analysis. Carbon Brief is one of the groups that are doing some analysis around this. And they found that emissions dropped in the first quarter of 2025 for China by 1.6%. And it doesn't sound like much, but that's actually pretty significant. And there's some other modelling done. People are saying that it looks like the emissions might have peaked. And because they are adding more and more renewables all the time, there's this structural kind of change that is happening that emissions will start coming down. And this is really significant for the whole world because, as we said, they make up a third of the world's emissions. The other thing as well is, as we're talking about more and more EVs, China's crude oil imports have been falling. They fell for the first time in two decades. They're expected to hit peak oil in 2027, which is earlier than what was expected. So we are seeing all these positive signs happening. So people are optimistic that their emissions are going to start coming down.

Sam Hawley: All right, so Joe, China is clearly pulling off this massive transition. Do you think that should be a blueprint for the rest of the world, so we could all transition to become an electro-state?

Jo Lauder: It's interesting because this is obviously easier for China to make these changes. They are an authoritarian regime. They've been putting huge government subsidies into this. And so a lot of these parts of electrification have been easier for China to accomplish. It's also got massive scale. Like, China is a huge country. It's a huge economy. It means as well that they have this really fast learning curve. So they can really quickly improve and bring down costs. And that's what we're seeing. But I think that what it shows is that this transition can potentially happen extremely quickly if the resources are put into it. And it also shows all the other co-benefits. That's what I find really interesting as well. Like we said, you know, energy security, air pollution, like economic benefits. These are the other things that are happening as well that we tend to just focus on the climate side a lot of the time. But there's heaps of other things going on as well.

Sam Hawley: How long do you reckon, Jo, then, until Australia could be an electro-state? We're a little slower, of course.

Jo Lauder: Yeah, but the economics have fundamentally changed. And I think China's electrification, as we've been saying, is really making the whole world start moving away from petro products. In Australia, you know, the political realities are a bit more difficult. It's going to be happening slower. It's happening... It's a bit messier. But I think these changes are still happening. And then the other impact for Australia that I think is really interesting as well is what happens when these other countries electrify, that China is selling products to. They'll no longer need Australia's coal and gas. And, you know, from what we've seen in China, this could happen faster than we realise. So this is happening around the world. It's just a question of the speed in different countries.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8956355979cecba2062706a282394b6e?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1688&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=656&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-08-17 14:00:29.308539

The new IRS guidance eliminates this so-called ""5% safe harbor"" rule for large wind and solar farms, although it keeps it in place for rooftop solar projects and other smaller solar installations.
Renewable energy industry groups criticized the move, which comes as the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of new restrictions on federal permitting for wind and solar projects across the country.
The new tax guidance has its origins in the debate earlier this year over Trump's domestic policy bill.
While many renewable energy projects will remain competitive without subsidies, the group found, some will no longer be economically viable.","WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued new rules that would restrict the ability of wind and solar companies to claim federal tax breaks, a move that analysts said could threaten the viability of many renewable energy projects under development.

President Donald Trump's giant domestic policy bill, which was signed into law on July 4, was already set to rapidly phase out lucrative tax credits for new wind and solar farms unless they began construction in the next 12 months. The new IRS guidance would add further restrictions by tightening long-standing rules for what counts as the ""beginning of construction,"" which will make it harder for many projects to qualify.

Previously, a wind or solar farm was said to have begun construction if the developer spent at least 5% project cost, which many companies did by purchasing electrical transformers or other large equipment ahead of time. The developer could then claim any tax breaks that were in effect that year, as long as they finished construction within the next four years.

The new IRS guidance eliminates this so-called ""5% safe harbor"" rule for large wind and solar farms, although it keeps it in place for rooftop solar projects and other smaller solar installations.

Renewable energy industry groups criticized the move, which comes as the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of new restrictions on federal permitting for wind and solar projects across the country.

""This is yet another act of energy subtraction from the Trump administration that will further delay the build-out of affordable, reliable power,"" said Abigail Ross Hopper, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. ""American families and businesses will pay more for electricity as a result of this action, and China will continue to outpace us in the race for electricity to power AI.""

The new tax guidance has its origins in the debate earlier this year over Trump's domestic policy bill.

While nearly all Republicans voted to end Biden-era tax credits for wind and solar power as part of that bill, some senators successfully pushed for a slightly slower phaseout of the credits in order to limit industry disruption. That angered many House conservatives, who had wanted an immediate termination of the subsidies.

To assuage those concerns, Trump issued an executive order shortly after the bill passed, directing the Treasury Department to limit the ability of wind and solar projects to qualify for the fast-disappearing tax credits.

That move faced pushback from some in Trump's own party. This month, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed holds on three of Trump's nominees for the Treasury Department, saying he was concerned that the agency would flout the intent of Congress.

The removal of federal subsidies means that the amounts of new wind energy and solar energy added in the United States over the next five years are expected to be 50% lower and 23% lower than previously projected, according to BloombergNEF. While many renewable energy projects will remain competitive without subsidies, the group found, some will no longer be economically viable.

Those projections do not account for the Trump administration's most recent restrictions, which experts say could cause turmoil for hundreds of wind and solar projects that were expected to start construction over the next year in order to claim the credits.

Under the new IRS guidance, wind and solar companies can still qualify for the credit if they begin certain physical construction activities over the next year, such as digging the foundations for a wind farm or installing the racks that hold solar panels, and then work continuously to complete the project. While many of the biggest and most sophisticated developers may be able to meet this ""physical work test,"" many smaller and medium-size developers might struggle to qualify, experts said.

The stock prices for some of the nation's largest renewable energy developers, including NextEra Energy and Clearway Energy, rose more than 2% Friday shortly after the release of the guidance, an indication that those companies may fare better than many of their smaller competitors who are not listed on stock exchanges.

The carve-out for rooftop solar installations appeared to come as a surprise to many investors, as stock prices soared more than 15% Friday for several companies involved in the rooftop solar business, including Sunrun and SolarEdge Technologies.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/17/210829748_210547464-830fef508ffe4c55b9bf424f53ad7d3b_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-17 13:03:29.364364

The Department of Energy says it’s committed to ensuring infrastructure safety across 33 states and maintaining the stability of the electricity grid.

Modernization of hydropower facilities to ensure grid resilience

The Biden-Harris administration is behind the massive undertaking to invest in America’s hydroelectric infrastructure, which generates around 27% of all renewable energy in the US. The average age of these facilities is 79 years, so they’re due for modernization. The upgrading program, which falls under the Investing in America agenda, has three objectives:

To facilitate access to affordable, clean power

To mitigate the impact of hydroelectric plants on fauna and flora

To increase dam security

The Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives program will be administered by the GDO (Grid Deployment Office) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and will also protect the employment of more than 6,000 hydropower workers and the contracts of numerous vendors and contractors.

Funding of the Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives program

California is the state that’s receiving the most attention with 39 projects being upgraded, and then New York with 35. A funding threshold of $5 million per project has been decided on, with the federal government footing 30% of the total costs. Private funding accounts for $2.38 billion, showing that power companies are also committed to protecting hydroelectric assets.

Preventing failures and stabilizing the power grid

There are two parts to the Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives program: projects enhancing dam safety (149) and those focusing on the resilience of the grid (84). There are also 60 projects that have a purely environmental focus and nothing to do with generation capacity, and a number involving recreational upgrades and installations.

One of the project’s considerations is that while modernization and upgrading are going on, it’s important not to disrupt the balance of the current energy mix, which would have the opposite effect of destabilizing the electricity grid.

Strengthening grid resilience

The following systems will be upgraded to strengthen grid resilience:

Control systems

Cables and transformers

Penstocks (which transport water to turbines)

Turbines or generators (including replacement where necessary)

Improving dam safety

These projects will be carried out to improve dam safety and strengthen infrastructure to protect against extreme weather:

Upgrading dam gates

Upgrading dam walls to prevent water spilling over (overtopping)

Upgrading emergency spillways, whereby water is channelled during heavy rainfall

Replacing ageing concrete to prevent water seepage

Repairs to water conveyance systems to improve water movement

Rehabilitation of erosion in the areas around dams

Environmental and recreational improvements

These projects will make improvements to recreational facilities and support the environment around hydroelectric plants:

Fish ladders or other equipment will be installed to facilitate aquatic species to pass through, over, or around dams or turbines. A number of projects will expand or develop the natural environment.

Special turbines will be installed to reduce the loss of oxygen in the water during electricity generation. Improving the water quality will have a knock-on positive effect on habitats downstream and also protect protected species or species of cultural importance to Indian tribes.

Recreational endeavors include water access for boating, kayaking, or rafting, or creating walking trails.

Future developments and clean energy goals

The Department of Energy has a second round of funding planned for three more programs, namely the Maintaining and Enhancing Hydroelectricity Incentives, the Hydroelectric Efficiency Improvement Incentives, and the Hydroelectric Production Incentives programs.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/energy-america-Stanford-Doerr-School-of-Sustainability-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:08:06.228164

Switching from gas to electric sounds like a big commitment until you do some math. Once you break down the monthly cost of simply driving, the gap between electric vehicles (EV) and gas-powered rides becomes a lot easier to grasp.

So that’s what GOBankingRates did for you. Using a mix of real-world usage data, government numbers and current energy prices, we compared how much it costs to drive 1,000 miles in a Tesla Model Y versus 1,000 miles in a gas-powered Cadillac XT5. The results speak for themselves.

Monthly Cost To Charge a Tesla Model Y

According to EV analytics firm Recurrent Auto, real-world data from Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD owners shows that the vehicle typically pulls around 295 kilowatt-hours (kWh) from the wall to drive 1,000 miles.

It’s important to remember that EV efficiency ratings, like miles per kilowatt-hour, usually reflect the energy consumed by the motor and battery system and not the energy lost during charging.

Most Level 2 home chargers operate at 83% to 94% efficiency, according to Recurrent, which means 6% to 17% of electricity is lost as heat or powering the car’s internal systems. So while your utility bill reflects 295 kWh, the car itself may only be using about 250 to 270 kWh to actually move you down the road.

At the average U.S. residential electricity rate of 17.45 cents per kWh (as of April 2025), pulling 295 kWh from your electric meter would cost about $51 per month, assuming you charge at home.

In short, even after accounting for energy loss during charging, powering a Model Y for 1,000 miles a month will likely cost you less than $55.

Fuel Cost for a Cadillac XT5

Cadillac reports a combined fuel efficiency of 24 miles per gallon for the 2025 XT5 AWD model. Official U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ratings may vary slightly, but this estimate is in line with third-party reviews from Edmunds and Car & Driver.

If you drive 1,000 miles per month, that means you’ll burn through about 42 gallons of gas. At the current national average of $3.15 per gallon (July 2025, according to AAA), you’re looking at a monthly fuel cost of around $132. That’s more than double the cost of charging a Tesla Model Y at home.

Real-World Factors That Affect Driving Costs

1. Charging Inefficiency

As mentioned earlier, EVs draw more power from the wall than what actually goes into the battery. This charging inefficiency (typically around 6% to 17%) is often overlooked but directly impacts your electric bill.

2. Weather and Driving Conditions

Cold weather hits electric vehicles harder than gas-powered ones. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that EVs can lose up to 40% of their range in cold temperatures, while gas vehicles like the XT5 typically see only a 5% to 15% drop in fuel efficiency.

Final Take

If you drive about 1,000 miles a month and have access to home charging, the Tesla Model Y is significantly cheaper to drive day-to-day. You’ll spend less than $55 to charge it compared to $132 or more to fill up a Cadillac XT5.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/telsa-model-3-2023_iStock-1477630587.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:06:22.168068

WASHINGTON (AP) — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency’s new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,” he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That’s a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university’s Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn’t make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.” She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and “a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,” Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, “gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa’s farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project “has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest” and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There’s also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were “carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it’s fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,” he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

The Elevated Velocity concept was unveiled on August 15 at the Quail, a motorsports gathering in Carmel, California as part of Monterey Car Week.","America’s storied luxury brand Cadillac has revealed a new, all-electric high-performance crossover concept with gull-wing doors.

The Elevated Velocity study rides on 24-inch wheels and imagines an all-terrain 2+2 crossover that blends the speed exploits of the brand’s fast V-Series models such as the CT5-V Blackwing, and the size and functionality of a crossover with off-road grit, but using electric power.

It follows in the path of the electric Cadillac Lyriq-V and Optiq-V production models as replies to the growing demand for electric high-performance luxury crossovers. The new concept takes things further by adopting different settings for various moods: Elevate, Welcome and Velocity.

A welcome mode greets the driver and the vehicle floor, seats, instrument panel, doors and steering wheel illuminate in a soft white light. The gull-wing doors lift skyward, and a welcome animation on the steering wheel of shifting desert sand is activated.

Selecting Elevate mode, the vehicle becomes autonomous and the pedals and steering wheel retract as the interior transforms into a recovery space for occupants where the outside and inside temperatures are regulated for relaxation.

The ambient lighting also comes into play, with seat back lighting and backlit doors that synchronise breathing and movement.

In Velocity Mode, the interior lighting features cool white tones that evoke a sense of exhilaration and the white floor lighting dims to aid the driver in focusing on the road while the deployable steering wheel displays speed, time, battery health and temperature. An augmented-reality (AR) head-up display (HUD) navigation shows on the cowl display.

Selectable drive modes alter the responses of the electric drivetrain. The e-Velocity Mode is ideal for fast on-road driving, and Terra mode enables off-road performance, activating the air suspension. Sand Vision is a similar feature to Cadillac’s existing Night Vision technology, which enables the driver to achieve better visibility in a sandstorm.

Elements Defy is another new feature that keeps the exterior clean using a dust-phobic vibration.

The cabin is outfitted in various high-end materials including brushed metal accents, Morello red leather seat upholstery and Garnet, a red bouclé fabric that adorns the seat uppers, door armrests, console armrest and instrument panel.

Fine nappa grain is on the headliner, pillars, door uppers, seat cushions, rear compartment, cabin and cargo floor. Red fabric wraps the interior from the doors to behind the instrument panel. The doors feature a 3D printed pattern in black crystal.

Comfort features include an air purification system that filters dust particles out of the cabin, and compensates for dry air and sudden and extreme temperature shifts, and altitude changes. It also integrates a vault locked compartment to hide items, and a handcrafted polo set of a helmet, gloves, kneepads and mallet.

Federal EV Tax Credit: Act Before September 30, 2025

The Federal EV Tax Credit, enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, offers up to $7,500 in savings for qualifying Range Rover and Range Rover Sport PHEVs leased through Land Rover Cerritos. With the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) expiring on September 30, 2025, now is the time to act.

Eligible Models:

2025 Range Rover PHEV (e.g., P440e SE, P550e Autobiography): Offers ~50 miles of electric range, starting at approximately $105,000.

2025 Range Rover Sport PHEV (e.g., P460e Dynamic SE): Delivers similar electric range, starting at around $90,000.

Leasing Advantage: Through the “leasing loophole” (45W), leased PHEVs are exempt from North American assembly and battery sourcing requirements. Our finance partners, such as Chase, claim the $7,500 credit and pass savings to customers via lower monthly payments or down payments.

Why It Matters: With ~50 miles of electric range, Range Rover PHEVs combine luxury, off-road capability, and reduced emissions. The $7,500 credit significantly lowers the cost of these premium vehicles, but after September 30, 2025, buyers will face full MSRP, increasing monthly payments.

Additional Incentives: California residents may stack local rebates, such as $500–$1,500 from Southern California Edison or up to $9,500–$10,000 through the Clean Cars 4 All program for low-income buyers trading in older vehicles. Contact our team to explore eligibility.

How to Maximize Savings:

Confirm Eligibility: Call Land Rover Cerritos at (562) 356-1000 to verify if your chosen PHEV trim qualifies.

Act by September 30, 2025: Vehicles must be delivered by the deadline to secure the credit. Inventory may tighten as demand surges, so act early.

Consult a Tax Professional: File IRS Form 8936 to claim the credit or opt for point-of-sale transfer with our finance team’s assistance.

Plan for Charging: Install a Level 2 charger (e.g., EVDANCE Flux Tesla 40A, adaptable for Range Rover) by June 30, 2026, to claim the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Property Tax Credit (30C, up to $1,000).

“With the Federal EV Tax Credit expiring soon, there’s no better time to lease a Range Rover PHEV,” said the General Sales Manager, Kasra Ari. “Our team is here to help you navigate the process and maximize savings.”

The coalition argues the cap violates federal regulations, threatens essential operations, and could reduce states’ ability to deliver energy services and meet climate goals.

Per the news release distributed on Friday, August 15: “Attorney General Anthony G. Brown today joined 17 other states in suing to block the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) from imposing a new funding cap that cuts support for vital state-run clean energy and energy efficiency programs. The new DOE policy would limit funding for critical administrative and staffing costs, which have historically been covered by these federal energy grants.

In the lawsuit, the coalition argues that this funding cap puts the states’ ability to meet other grant goals at risk and forces the states to divert limited resources from other programs to cover these costs. The states ask the court to remove this unlawful funding cap and restore support for these essential energy programs.

“Maryland has set ambitious climate goals that promise a cleaner, healthier, and safer future for our children – but this short-sighted federal policy would unlawfully limit our State’s ability to support projects that are crucial to meeting those goals,” said Attorney General Brown. “We’re filing this lawsuit to help our State meet its commitment to advancing clean energy, reducing harmful emissions and supporting Marylanders’ efforts to make energy improvements to their homes.”

For decades, federal law has required agencies like the DOE to negotiate agreements with states that set fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run programs. This includes the basic administrative and staffing costs needed to run these programs. These costs have never been subject to a cap.

On May 8, 2025, DOE announced a new policy that ignores these contractually binding rates, capping reimbursement for these costs at 10 percent of a project’s total budget, leaving states to make up the difference. If allowed to continue, the cap would limit resources states rely on to keep programs operating and prevent federal dollars from reaching the people they are meant to help.

It could force states to make cuts to essential operations and programs, reducing their ability to deliver crucial energy services and potentially delaying or cancelling key projects. State agencies would be forced to divert time and money from other ongoing projects, leaving fewer resources for helping consumers.

The states argue that the new DOE policy violates federal regulations that require agencies to honor indirect cost rates previously negotiated between the states and the federal government. The coalition emphasizes that every court that has ruled on the merits of a cap has found it unlawful, unjustified, and disruptive to essential public programs.

The coalition asks the court to reject DOE’s new policy and stop the implementation of any unlawful funding caps. Joining Attorney General Brown in filing this lawsuit are the attorneys general of New York, Minnesota, Colorado, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‛i, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as the Governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.”",https://mocoshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/attorney.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:10:04.667857

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,"" he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force."" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and ""a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,"" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, ""gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project ""has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest"" and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were ""carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,"" he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/b53514e9-7423-4455-add7-abd950d12e26/20250817T140845/b53514e9-7423-4455-add7-abd950d12e26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 14:01:30.181869

Editor's Note:

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the concept that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,"" also known as the ""two mountains"" concept. From China's constant push for green transformation and ecological civilization to its growing influence in global climate governance, the concept has increasingly gained international attention and resonance. In a recent interview with Global Times (GT) reporter Xia Wenxin, Clifford Cobb (Cobb), a renowned US scholar on sustainable development, noted that China's rapid progress in green development stems from the strong commitment of the Party and the government, offering a model for global environmental governance. He also discussed the deeper meaning of the concept of ""ecological civilization"" and the challenges for the US to engage in its green agenda.

GT: In 2005, President Xi Jinping put forward the concept that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"" in East China's Zhejiang Province. How do you understand this concept?

Cobb: Originally, this concept was introduced to offset the single-minded pursuit of economic growth, which was China's path for about 30 years. I think it can now be understood more broadly to mean that nations should pursue harmonious development that balances many different interests and that monetary values are not necessarily supreme. Thus, we are sometimes able to achieve two goals that seem to be in opposition, such as economic development and a clean environment. We should always try to find new perspectives that go beyond fixed choices.

GT: Why has China's green development progressed so fast in recent years? What are its contributions to global environmental governance?

Cobb: China's progress in green development has clearly resulted from a strong commitment to this goal by the Party and the government. That commitment gives China credibility in the eyes of other nations by demonstrating that dedication to the environment can be combined with the need to lift rural areas out of poverty. Every nation faces the challenge of continuing along a development path while also leaving clean water and healthy soils for the next generation. China's environmental initiatives prove that this balance is possible.

GT: You once commented in an interview that China has influenced the world by adopting terms like ""ecological civilization,"" which you believe is a Chinese idea. In your opinion, what are the connotations of ""ecological civilization""? How should the international community convert this idea into practice?

Cobb: From the beginning, around 5,000 years ago, civilization has developed by exercising control over the rest of nature. Humans dammed rivers, built cities and roads, plowed fields to grow crops, cut down forests, and sailed across oceans. Since humans are a part of nature that uses tools, many of these changes could be considered ""natural."" Humans adapted to environments and also modified those environments for human use. As long as there was a balance between adaptation to nature and modification of nature, civilization retained an ecological quality. However, industrialization created an imbalance. The scale of modification changed, particularly with the development of chemistry in the 19th century and the rapid growth of human populations. In my view, the term ""ecological civilization"" means restoring the balance between adaptation and modification.

GT: You also noted in the same interview that strong leadership in climate change governance is absent at the national level in the US. What led to this lack of leadership? Do you expect it to change in the short term?

Cobb: At one time, the US was in a position of leadership on climate change governance because American scientists, including those from oil companies, conducted the original research that revealed the threat from large-scale carbon combustion. By 1990, both major parties in the US took climate change seriously and might have led the world to take action, but oil companies began a campaign to create doubt, and both parties lost the will to act.

In addition, many Americans think that climate change is a purely technical problem that can be solved with a few innovations. The idea that nature should be forced to accommodate whatever humans want is deeply ingrained in the American ethos. Instead of humans adapting to nature, many Americans expect nature to adapt to humans, as if the American Congress or American engineers could overturn the law of gravity. Thus, the loss of American leadership on climate issues is tied to deep cultural forces and not merely to the shifting sands of American politics.

GT: What could the US learn from China's green development?

Cobb: The US and other countries can learn from the technical advances made in China in the development of green energy production. The US may also learn from efforts in China to slow or reverse the effects of desertification and to develop better methods of water management.

GT: What, in your opinion, is the current approach in US politics to climate change governance?

Cobb: In general, most cultures have viewed the environment as a secondary concern, unless the situation becomes extreme. Military and economic issues always seem urgent; environmental issues are normally treated as future problems that can be ignored. There is always some basis for negotiations over minor environmental issues, but when an environmental issue rises to the primary level, as has happened in the case of climate change, diplomatic conditions change.

In the US, the Republicans believe that actions to limit climate change will damage the economy. Even when the Democrats were in power, they were afraid to take bold action because it would have been unpopular with voters. For 25 years, both parties have avoided taking climate change seriously. Even though the Democrats engaged in international diplomacy with bold rhetoric, they took little action. Meanwhile, China has become the global leader on climate change by promoting the rapid development of renewable energy expected to replace coal. China now sets the global standard for climate action.

GT: How do you see the prospects of China-US climate cooperation, including climate talks, under the current Donald Trump administration?

Cobb: The Trump administration will not address climate change issues because its supporters believe climate change is a hoax. Since the US now repudiates any measures taken to limit the use of fossil fuels, the US has removed itself from international cooperation. At this stage, American companies are more committed than the US government to reducing carbon emissions, so progress will not stop in the US. However, the official policies of the government control diplomacy, and the Trump administration seems to be dedicated to weakening the soft power of the US, while it also undermines the military capacity of the US by financing expensive defense systems without a strategic plan.

Ultimately, negotiations on every issue are controlled by changing diplomatic conditions, and those are dictated by the balance of power in the world. As the US is losing its power and status in the world by inflicting damage on its own economy and by mismanaging alliances, the so-called American Century is over, and that will affect diplomacy among all nations as a new polycentric world order emerges. However, having said that, I am unclear how there can be any discussion between the US and any other nation about climate cooperation for the next few years.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-08-17/28e55385-f74f-42ea-b0a8-5cb6a40cbdf9.jpeg,N,,2025-08-17 12:08:32.979711

Natural Capital and Shrug Capital led Varda’s Series C financing.","Venture capital firms are still raising money, but they’re not raising as much as they used to and it’s taking longer to close new funds. In that context, Hatteras Venture Partners’ recent close of two new funds is notable.

In the first half of this year, $26.6 billion was raised across 238 funds, according to quarterly Pitchbook/NVCA Venture Monitor Report. On an annualized basis, that puts the pace of fundraising near a decade low, following weak momentum from 2024, the report says. As of the end of the second quarter of this year, the median time to close a new fund was 15.3 months, up from 12.6 months in 2024. That’s the longest fundraising cycle in more than a decade, according to the report. Current conditions make limited partners reluctant to commit large sums to new funds, the report said.

Hatteras operates from Durham, North Carolina, and while the firm is one of the top healthcare investors in the southeast, it also invests nationwide. In its 25 year history, the firm has invested in 100 companies. This past week, Hatteras announced more than $200 million in capital commitments from its limited partners. When the firm launched as a seed-stage venture fund in 2000, it started with less than $3 million in capital. Today, the firm manages more than $900 million across seven funds, including the two new funds.

Hatteras focuses on seed- and early-stage investments spanning biotechnology, medical devices, and health technology. The firm’s portfolio includes medical device company HistoSonics, which was acquired earlier this month in a $2.25 billion deal. In biopharmaceuticals, the Hatteras portfolio includes targeted protein degradation therapies developer Kymera, which went public in 2020, and cancer drug biotech G1 Therapeutics, which was acquired about a year ago.

Venture capital firms remain cautious as they look for better clarity and certainty regarding macroeconomic conditions and policy matters, such as tariffs, the Pitchbook report said. But when investing conditions do improve, Hatteras will have capital to participate in new financings. In the meantime, here’s a recap of some recent biopharma financings:

—Women’s health startup Gameto completed a $44 million round of funding, which it will use to complete a Phase 3 test of its lead program Fertilo, an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived therapy that matures eggs outside of the body for invitro fertilization. This technology is already commercially available in some countries; Gameto says five babies have been born with Fertilo and more than 20 pregnancies have been recorded. The Series C round was led by Overwater Ventures. Austin, Texas-based Gameto says the latest round brings its total financing to $127 million.

—Strand Therapeutics secured $153 million to continue clinical testing of lead program STX-001, a programmable genetic medicine designed to lead to expression of the signaling protein IL-12 directly from the tumor microenvironment. During the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Strand reported preliminary Phase 1 data showing STX-001 led to antitumor activity in solid tumors. Kinnevik led the Boston-based startup’s Series B financing. Strand last raised money in 2021, when it closed a $52 million Series A round.

—Shanghai-based Minghui Pharmaceutical raised $131 million to support clinical development its PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody and combination strategies of that asset with antibody-drug conjugates. The funds will also support the planned commercial launch of its topical JAK inhibitor in China. OrbiMed and Qiming Venture Partners joined as new investors in what Minghui described as a pre-IPO financing.

—Artificial intelligence drug discovery company Chai Discovery raised $70 million. The San Francisco-based startup says its technology uses AI to predict and reprogram interactions between biochemical molecules. The company will use the cash to continue to develop its platform and bring on partners. Menlo Ventures led the Series A round, which follows a $30 million seed financing closed last year.

—Clinical-stage radiopharmaceutical developer ARTBIO closed $132 million to continue development of its alpha radioligand therapies (ARTs) for cancers. Lead program AB001 is in Phase 2 testing for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. New investors Sofinnova Investments and B Capital co-led ARTBIO’s Series B financing.

—MapLight Therapeutics closed $372.5 million in financing for its lead program, a drug candidate that could compete against the Bristol Myers Squibb schizophrenia drug Cobenfy. Like Cobenfy, MapLight drug ML-007C-MA is designed to target and activate the M1 and M4 receptors in the central nervous system. Redwood City, California-based MapLight will use the new capital toward ongoing Phase 2 tests in schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease psychosis. Forbion and Life Sciences at Goldman Sachs Alternatives co-led MapLight’s Series D financing.

—Cancer drug developer Dispatch Bio launched, revealing $216 million raised to date in seed and Series A financing. The startup aims to overcomes challenges that have limited the efficacy of immunotherapy in solid tumors. Dispatch’s therapies use an engineered virus to deliver a universal antigen, what it calls a Flare, that tags tumor cells and breaks down the tumor’s inhibitory environment. Dispatch says its Flares act as a beacon to immune cells, which come in to clear cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Dispatch, founded in 2022, said it is on track to enter the clinic in 2026. The startup’s financing was led by founding investors Arch Venture Partners and Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.

—Techbio startup One Biosciences revealed €15 million (about $17.6 million) for clinical development of its platform technology, OneMap, which creates detailed functional profiles of patient tumors. Insights can be used to assist clinical decision making and optimize clinical trials. Paris-based One Biosciences said it would use the proceeds to scale OneMap for potential partnerships with pharma and biotech companies. The Series A round was led by Redmile Group and Blast.

—Avalyn Pharma raised $100 million to support clinical development of therapies for lung disorders. AP01 is Avalyns’s inhalable version of pirfenidone; AP02 is an inhalable formulation of nintedanib. As oral small molecules, both of these now generic medicines became treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). But the pill formulations introduce systemic side effects. AP01 has completed Phase 1b testing in IPF; a Phase 2b study is ongoing in progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Avalyn also plans to start a Phase 2 test of AP02 in IPF. Suvretta Capital Management and SR One co-led Avalyn’s Series D round of funding.

—Varda Space Industries raised $187 million to support its work making drugs in space, processing materials outside the International Space Station. The El Segundo, California-based company says active pharmaceutical ingredients crystalize differently in a gravity-free environment, “creating novel drug formulations that would otherwise be impossible.” Varda is also testing hypersonic reentry technologies that would return the drugs to Earth. Natural Capital and Shrug Capital led Varda’s Series C financing.

—CoRegen closed $93.4 million to support development an immunotherapy leveraging a type of immune cell called a regulatory T cell (Treg). The company makes its therapies by harvesting a patient’s Tregs and engineering them to remove steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3), a protein that prevents Tregs from recognizing cancer cells. The company says its engineered cells attack cancer cells and also permit other immune cells to attack. Houston-based CoRegen’s approach is based on technology licensed from Baylor University. The company described the financing as a private placement with a select number of investors.

—Centivax raised $45 million for Phase 1 testing of its universal vaccine candidate for influenza. The South San Francisco-based company says its technology directs the immune system to focus on regions of pathogens that do not change across strains, which has applications to flu and other pathogens that mutate rapidly. In preclinical research, its vaccine induced universal immunity to all tested influenza viruses, including the currently circulating strain of avian influenza, or “bird flu.” Future Ventures led Centivax’s Series A round.

—Renasant Bio launched with $54.5 million to support its work developing a small molecule drug for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is caused by mutations to two genes. The only approved therapy ADPKD is Otsuka Pharmaceutical’s Jynarque, but this drug is not disease modifying and it introduces the risk of severe liver toxicity. Novartis is pursuing the rare disease through its $800 million acquisition of Regulus Therapeutics and its oligonucleotide drug for ADPKD that’s ready for Phase 3 testing. Berkeley, California-based Renasant is developing small molecules that restore normal function of the proteins coded by those genes. Founding investor 5AM Ventures led the startup’s seed financing.

—Radiopharmaceutical company Nuclidium raised 79 million Swiss francs (about $99 million) to support ongoing development of its copper-based radiopharmaceuticals for cancer. The company’s platform technology links tumor-targeting molecules with copper isotopes: Copper-61 is used for diagnostics and Copper-67 for therapeutics. Kurma Growth Opportunities Fund, Angelini Ventures, Wellington Partners, and Neva SGR (Intesa Sanpaolo Group) led Nuclidium’s Series B financing.

—In other radiopharmaceutical news, Actithera unveiled $75.5 million to advance its lead radiopharmaceutical program to the clinic in multiple indications and support ongoing development of its platform and pipeline. Actithera said its technology creates novel small molecule radioligands with better precision, safety, and efficacy. M Ventures, Hadean Ventures, Sofinnova Partners, and 4BIO Capital co-led Actithera’s Series A financing.

—MIT spinout Syntis Bio raised $33 million to finance Phase 1 testing of SYNT-101, an obesity pill whose compounds form a temporary lining in the upper part of the small intestine. This lining redirects absorption of nutrients to the distal part of the organ, where they stimulate secretion of GLP-1 and other gut hormones that promote satiety. Cerberus Ventures led Syntis Bio’s Series A financing.

Fort Valley had initially endorsed Imola’s visionary plan for an EV plant employing 7,500 individuals.
Yet, despite proclamations of partnerships and commitments to high-paying jobs, his electric vehicle enterprise has yet to exhibit any palpable advancement.
In early 2024, Fort Valley facilitated land rezoning to accommodate the facility, receiving the city council’s endorsement.
Council members were informed that Georgia Power could not meet the energy demands of the electric vehicle endeavor, according to documents from the March 2025 meeting.","Grand Promises and Lingering Silence

Invocations of revitalization echoed through the corridors of struggling municipalities in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Imola Automotive USA, a nascent startup based in Boca Raton, Florida, presented an ostensibly bold vision: the construction of six electric vehicle plants, the creation of 45,000 jobs, and the provision of an entry point into the burgeoning electric vehicle sector.

More than 18 months have elapsed since these optimistic declarations were made, yet not a single plot of land has seen the commencement of construction. Furthermore, Imola’s chief executive officer, whose expertise lies predominantly in television and athletic footwear rather than automotive production, has grown increasingly reticent.

Investigative efforts by Floodlight revealed no evidence of taxpayer losses in locations such as Fort Valley, Georgia; Langston, Oklahoma; or Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Imola sought land, municipal financing, and various incentives. However, industry observers argue that the rush to attract electric vehicle employment opportunities has left economically disadvantaged towns susceptible to unfulfilled commitments.

Rodney Henry, the CEO of Imola, declined repeated interview requests. He communicated solely through a concise statement affirming the company’s ongoing dedication to its objectives, which reportedly involve collaboration with an Italian manufacturer of compact electric vehicles.

“Our schedule has been adjusted due to factors beyond our control,” Henry asserted. “We remain intensely focused on aligning our aspirations. Due to proprietary considerations and non-disclosure agreements, we cannot disclose specifics at this moment.”

This response starkly contrasts with earlier pronouncements. A press release from January 2024 claimed that Imola had already secured multiple sites across various states to establish half a dozen plants and generate a substantial number of jobs.

Experts question the viability of such ambitious promises from a newcomer without relevant experience in automotive manufacturing.

“It’s absurd,” remarked Greg LeRoy, CEO of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit dedicated to analyzing economic development projects. “Establishing large automotive plants necessitates considerable capital, extensive managerial acumen, and proficient engineering and marketing capabilities. Tesla achieved success, but it was not an overnight phenomenon.”

Langston, Fort Valley, and Pine Bluff are but a few towns caught up in the frenzy to secure electric vehicle establishments. Driven by federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, which unlocked billions for private investment and expanded governmental incentives, local authorities nationwide raced to attract lucrative manufacturing opportunities and participate in the expanding clean energy economy.

Since the enactment of the IRA in 2022, over 150 electric vehicle plants have been announced in the United States, according to E2, a bipartisan consortium advocating for environmentally sustainable economic development.

Nevertheless, this breakneck pace may be poised to decelerate. The recently instituted “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which retracts crucial federal tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles, is already inciting turmoil within the sector — potentially stalling or constricting ambitious projects that towns like Langston, Fort Valley, and Pine Bluff were counting on. E2 reports that this year has witnessed the cancellation of 14 EV-related plant proposals.

Unfulfilled Commitments Amidst Confusion

In the three communities where Imola touted significant investments, signs of construction remain conspicuously absent.

Langston, a modest town of 1,600, where over 35% of residents live below the poverty line, never witnessed the fruition of Imola’s ambitious plans.

A 2023 communication to the city council from former Imola chief operating officer Eric Pettus cited “multiple obstacles,” including difficulties in securing adequate land.

“For us to progress with the project, we request that the City of Langston convey any and all vacant properties in its possession,” Pettus stated.

City council member Magnus Scott reported that the company also sought municipal bonds to facilitate the construction of its facility.

However, before any land transfer or bond issuance took place, a representative from the company delivered unexpected news: the deal had been annulled. “Perhaps they encountered financial difficulties,” reflected Scott.

In a subsequent conversation, Pettus, now working as a consultant after leaving Imola, cited a nondisclosure agreement, precluding him from discussing the company’s future endeavors.

Fort Valley had initially endorsed Imola’s visionary plan for an EV plant employing 7,500 individuals. A year later, faced with inertia, the company returned with an entirely different proposal: a sophisticated lighting system for the town instead of an electric vehicle manufacturing facility.

One council member voiced skepticism.

“You expect us to endorse an agreement for 99 years without a car company in sight?” council member Laronda Eason questioned during a March 2025 meeting. “It feels like a bait-and-switch.”

Eason did not respond to communications seeking her views on Imola’s proposal.

In Pine Bluff, where the per capita income barely exceeded $21,000 last year, local officials initially expressed enthusiastic support. In an August 2024 letter to Henry, then-Mayor Shirley Washington pledged the city’s willingness to procure land, develop infrastructure, and issue industrial revenue bonds to realize Imola’s vision.

“With an anticipated workforce exceeding 8,000 jobs,” Washington asserted, “we firmly believe this investment will herald a pivotal transformation for our community.”

Nonetheless, a year down the line, the initiative remained stagnant. “We never got off the ground with that,” Washington lamented during a brief phone conversation.

LeRoy characterized Imola’s approach as a troubling trend.

“This serves as an illustration of how the fervor among governors and mayors to secure the next big breakthrough has led to insufficient vetting,” he remarked regarding the economically distressed communities approached by Imola.

Such locales, he posited, are “easy targets. They’re desperate.”

Visionary Proposals, Elusive Outcomes

Henry, who resides in Florida, boasts a background in television production and the founding of Protégé, a footwear brand. His IMDb profile claims that Protégé contributed one million pairs of shoes to various African nations.

Yet, despite proclamations of partnerships and commitments to high-paying jobs, his electric vehicle enterprise has yet to exhibit any palpable advancement.

Floodlight discovered that Imola’s website — named after the Italian city housing Tazzari EVs — can no longer be accessed without a password. A perusal of the Tazzari website found no references to plants in the United States. However, an archived version of Imola’s site alluded to its compact vehicles “coming soon to America.”

In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA announced a partnership with the Tazzari Group, known for its electric microcars. These vehicles, however, lack the capability for highway travel, as the maximum speed of the Opensky Sport model is approximately 56 miles per hour.

Tazzari did not respond to inquiries submitted by a Floodlight reporter.

Henry indicated that the company preferred Langston and Fort Valley due to their proximity to institutions of higher learning.

“Both locations are ideal,” he proclaimed in the January 2024 press release, “as their closeness to educational facilities will present career opportunities in the rapidly evolving EV Technology and Innovation Industry.”

Many local officials in Fort Valley, Langston, and Pine Bluff did not respond to solicitations for interviews. A limited number of documents were provided in response to Floodlight’s public records requests.

However, it is evident from the scant records that Imola’s promises instilled hope within these communities.

Langston Mayor Michael Boyles described the proposal as “transformative” in a January 2024 press release.

As time progressed, some local leaders began to question the feasibility of the details.

Erica Johnson, a real estate agent and former member of Langston’s economic development commission, noted discrepancies in aspects of the plan. For instance, how would the company house over 1,000 workers in such a diminutive town? And how could they construct a facility without access to utilities or water?

Her skepticism deepened upon learning that Imola sought to secure land agreements without surrendering any earnest money.

“My instinct was that something wasn’t quite right,” she reflected. “Yet I believe the hope for our community partially overshadowed the need to carefully consider the situation.”

Ultimately, that anticipation did not materialize.

“It was disheartening,” Johnson admitted. “We could have devoted our energies and resources to more tangible initiatives.”

Hope Amidst Disappointment

Some inhabitants of Fort Valley continue to harbor optimism.

Mayor Jeffery Lundy articulated, early last year, that attracting a company like Imola Automotive USA was “a priority for my administration.” Local officials shared a collective eagerness for the economic elevation the facility could provide.

At that juncture, Imola claimed it would break ground on a 195-acre site by the third quarter of 2024 and commence operations within 20 months, according to a report in the Macon Telegraph.

During a town hall meeting in February 2024, representatives from Imola assured residents that the plant would offer an average salary of $45 per hour. The community buzzed with enthusiasm, with one eager prospective employee exclaiming, “Apply to me!”

Pettus informed a local television station that most positions would only require a high school diploma.

In early 2024, Fort Valley facilitated land rezoning to accommodate the facility, receiving the city council’s endorsement. Yet, more than 15 months later, there remains no indication of construction plans.

Council members were informed that Georgia Power could not meet the energy demands of the electric vehicle endeavor, according to documents from the March 2025 meeting. A representative from Georgia Power indicated, while the utility does not comment on specific economic development projects, “We are prepared and ready to meet the energy needs of any new customer.”

Makita Driver, one of the enthusiastic Facebook commenters regarding the proposed plant, noted that she would have undoubtedly applied for a position — had the facility ever been realized.

“The salary was truly appealing,” she remarked.

As a medical assistant, Driver professed she currently earns significantly less than what Imola had promised. Ultimately, however, she came to terms with the likelihood that these commitments were overly optimistic.

“Who genuinely earns such a salary as a starting wage?” she pondered.

In a brief conversation with Floodlight on July 11, Mayor Lundy confirmed he remains in communication with Henry.

“We await that groundbreaking with palpable anticipation,” Lundy conveyed.","http://i0.wp.com/images.unsplash.com/photo-1567789884554-0b844b597180?w=1200&h=675&fit=crop&crop=edges&w=1200&resize=1200,675&ssl=1",N,,2025-08-17 12:07:06.327928

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,"" he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force."" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and ""a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,"" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, ""gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project ""has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest"" and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were ""carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,"" he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/b53514e9-7423-4455-add7-abd950d12e26/20250817T140845/b53514e9-7423-4455-add7-abd950d12e26_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 11:02:04.200968

In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.

Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.

The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.

But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.

The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.

“The sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,” said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Gulf Coast

In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline — more than any other state — over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.

The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people — followed closely by Hurricane Rita.

Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.

Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.

Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.

On Louisiana’s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state’s 2029 coastal master plan.

The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been “dying for over a century” because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.

Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.

The same is happening in other states.

In Bayou La Batre, Alabama — a fishing village built in the late 1700s — The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a “speed bump” that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy’s coastal programs director.

The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.

Such efforts won’t prevent all land losses, but in Louisiana, “cumulatively, they could make a big difference,” said Denise Reed, a research scientist who is working on Louisiana’s coastal master plan. “It could buy us some time.”

Pacific Coast

On the West Coast, communities vulnerable to sea-level rise also could see more flooding from increasingly intense atmospheric rivers, which carry water vapor from the ocean and dump huge amounts of rain in a short period of time.

So tidal marshes and estuaries drained for agriculture and industry are being restored along the entire coast, both for habitat and coastal protection.

Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.

But as sediment naturally fills in ponds and marsh plants return, “we’re realizing that … marshes absorb wave energy, storm surge and the force of high tides,” said Dave Halsing, executive project manager at the California State Coastal Conservancy.

That helps protect whatever is behind them, including sea walls and land that otherwise could be inundated or washed away, including some of California’s most expensive real estate, near Silicon Valley.

Projects also are underway along Alaska’s coast and in Hawaii, where native residents are rebuilding ancient rocky enclosures originally intended to trap fish, but which also protect against storm surge.

Atlantic Coast

Thirteen years after Superstorm Sandy swamped the Atlantic coast, communities still are restoring natural buffers and building other protective structures.

Sandy began as a fairly routine hurricane in the fall of 2012 before merging with other storms, stretching for a record 1,000 miles and pushing enormous amounts of ocean water into coastal communities.

But the threat of future storm surges could be even greater because sea levels in some areas could rise as much as three feet within 50 years, said Donald E. Cresitello, a coastal engineer and senior coastal planner for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The Corps rebuilt beaches, dunes and human-made structures from Massachusetts to Virginia and now is turning to areas farther inland that are increasingly vulnerable to more powerful storm surges, Cresitello said.

“If there’s a river coming to the coast, that storm surge has the potential to just ride up that river,” depending on the storm, he said.

A “phenomenal amount” of the U.S. population lives and works along its coasts, so protecting those areas is important to the U.S. economy, said George, the NOAA scientist. But it is also important to preserve generations of culture, he said.

“When you think about why people should care … it’s a whole way of life,” George said.

The fact that the U.S. cannot alone meet this challenge is hardly a reason not to demonstrate global leadership in this context.

To the editor: Kudos to the Los Angeles Times for printing this column about a fair and balanced assessment of climate change, its effects and what we can do about it. This type of discussion is critical for we the people and our elected representatives to navigate an informed path through the minefield of politicized misinformation about climate change.

Climate change is happening, but it is not “the end of the world.” It’s just another challenge among many in a future faced with water shortages, potential depopulation, war-caused malnutrition, etc.

Misallocation of our time, money and intellectual capital by means of politicized decision-making in facing these various challenges could be disastrous.

To the editor: De Rugy mentions the Climate Working Group that wrote the report that Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright commissioned to assess the current state of climate science. Somehow, she fails to name the members of the group. Well, here they are: John Christy, Judith Curry, Steven Koonin, Ross McKitrick and Roy Spencer. Look them up and you will see they live in the world of climate change denial. Given the people chosen for the report, the results should surprise no one. The real harm this report does is to sow further doubt in the mind of the public, thereby delaying actions that would spare us from the worst effects of climate change.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/170d4e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff4%2F28%2F16b20fc4464aa08320c3271f2e61%2F1167025-me-morro-bay-smokestacks-gxc-0006.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:08:11.093225

Stellantis considers using wind to power Jeep models

Forget about using giant wind turbines in fields to generate electricity because Stellantis could put tiny ones on your next Jeep SUV.

Stellantis has been submitting several patents related to a ‘Wind Harness for a Vehicle’. Each design includes several methods to add small wind turbines to the body of a boxy SUV.

According to American Cars and Racing, the turbines are supposed to generate electricity. But the patents don’t specify if the harness is for a fully electric vehicle.

Other automakers have been using solar panels to charge electric vehicles. The Subaru Solterra only gets about two miles of charge per year via solar panels. However, solar panels have been paired with gas-powered vehicles as well.

You’ve probably seen the meme about the Jeep Wrangler being less aerodynamic than a cow. But now its brick shape could add a charge with turbines on the grille, hood, and sides of the vehicle.

The turbines could create drag that creates extra energy to spin them while driving. Plus, the turbines could harness wind while the SUV is parked. But will they be as powerful as regenerative braking systems?

Stellantis has only submitted patents so far. It’s unclear if the turbines will ever make it to a production model. The plans might end up being stored in an endless warehouse like the one from Indiana Jones.",https://www.motorbiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wind-turbines.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-08-17 16:03:05.218128

In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.

Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.

The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.

But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.

The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.

“The sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,” said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Gulf Coast

In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline — more than any other state — over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.

The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people — followed closely by Hurricane Rita.

Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.

Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.

Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.

On Louisiana’s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state’s 2029 coastal master plan.

The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been “dying for over a century” because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.

Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.

The same is happening in other states.

In Bayou La Batre, Alabama — a fishing village built in the late 1700s — The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a “speed bump” that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy’s coastal programs director.

The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.

Such efforts won't prevent all land losses, but in Louisiana, “cumulatively, they could make a big difference,"" said Denise Reed, a research scientist who is working on Louisiana's coastal master plan. “It could buy us some time.”

Pacific Coast

On the West Coast, communities vulnerable to sea-level rise also could see more flooding from increasingly intense atmospheric rivers, which carry water vapor from the ocean and dump huge amounts of rain in a short period of time.

So tidal marshes and estuaries drained for agriculture and industry are being restored along the entire coast, both for habitat and coastal protection.

Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.

But as sediment naturally fills in ponds and marsh plants return, “we're realizing that ... marshes absorb wave energy, storm surge and the force of high tides,” said Dave Halsing, executive project manager at the California State Coastal Conservancy.

That helps protect whatever is behind them, including sea walls and land that otherwise could be inundated or washed away, including some of California's most expensive real estate, near Silicon Valley.

Projects also are underway along Alaska’s coast and in Hawaii, where native residents are rebuilding ancient rocky enclosures originally intended to trap fish, but which also protect against storm surge.

Atlantic Coast

Thirteen years after Superstorm Sandy swamped the Atlantic coast, communities still are restoring natural buffers and building other protective structures.

Sandy began as a fairly routine hurricane in the fall of 2012 before merging with other storms, stretching for a record 1,000 miles and pushing enormous amounts of ocean water into coastal communities.

But the threat of future storm surges could be even greater because sea levels in some areas could rise as much as three feet within 50 years, said Donald E. Cresitello, a coastal engineer and senior coastal planner for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The Corps rebuilt beaches, dunes and human-made structures from Massachusetts to Virginia and now is turning to areas farther inland that are increasingly vulnerable to more powerful storm surges, Cresitello said.

“If there’s a river coming to the coast, that storm surge has the potential to just ride up that river,"" depending on the storm, he said.

A “phenomenal amount” of the U.S. population lives and works along its coasts, so protecting those areas is important to the U.S. economy, said George, the NOAA scientist. But it is also important to preserve generations of culture, he said.

“When you think about why people should care ... it’s a whole way of life,” George said.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency’s new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,” he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That’s a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university’s Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn’t make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.” She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and “a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,” Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, “gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa’s farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project “has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest” and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There’s also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were “carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it’s fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,” he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Projects also are underway along Alaska’s coast and in Hawaii, where native residents are rebuilding ancient rocky enclosures originally intended to trap fish, but which also protect against storm surge.

Atlantic Coast

Thirteen years after Superstorm Sandy swamped the Atlantic coast, communities still are restoring natural buffers and building other protective structures.

Sandy began as a fairly routine hurricane in the fall of 2012 before merging with other storms, stretching for a record 1,000 miles and pushing enormous amounts of ocean water into coastal communities.

But the threat of future storm surges could be even greater because sea levels in some areas could rise as much as three feet within 50 years, said Donald E. Cresitello, a coastal engineer and senior coastal planner for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The Corps rebuilt beaches, dunes and human-made structures from Massachusetts to Virginia and now is turning to areas farther inland that are increasingly vulnerable to more powerful storm surges, Cresitello said.

“If there’s a river coming to the coast, that storm surge has the potential to just ride up that river,"" depending on the storm, he said.

A “phenomenal amount” of the U.S. population lives and works along its coasts, so protecting those areas is important to the U.S. economy, said George, the NOAA scientist. But it is also important to preserve generations of culture, he said.

“When you think about why people should care ... it’s a whole way of life,” George said.

Associated Press

In San Francisco Bay, salt ponds created more than a century ago are reverting to marshland. Along the New York and New Jersey coasts, beaches ravaged by Superstorm Sandy underwent extensive restoration. In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.

Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.

The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.

But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.

The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.

“The sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,” said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Gulf Coast

In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline — more than any other state — over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.

The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people — followed closely by Hurricane Rita.

Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.

Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.

Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.

On Louisiana’s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state’s 2029 coastal master plan.

The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been “dying for over a century” because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.

Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.

The same is happening in other states.

In Bayou La Batre, Alabama — a fishing village built in the late 1700s — The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a “speed bump” that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy’s coastal programs director.

The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.

Such efforts won't prevent all land losses, but in Louisiana, “cumulatively, they could make a big difference,"" said Denise Reed, a research scientist who is working on Louisiana's coastal master plan. “It could buy us some time.”

Pacific Coast

On the West Coast, communities vulnerable to sea-level rise also could see more flooding from increasingly intense atmospheric rivers, which carry water vapor from the ocean and dump huge amounts of rain in a short period of time.

So tidal marshes and estuaries drained for agriculture and industry are being restored along the entire coast, both for habitat and coastal protection.

Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.

But as sediment naturally fills in ponds and marsh plants return, “we're realizing that ... marshes absorb wave energy, storm surge and the force of high tides,” said Dave Halsing, executive project manager at the California State Coastal Conservancy.

That helps protect whatever is behind them, including sea walls and land that otherwise could be inundated or washed away, including some of California's most expensive real estate, near Silicon Valley.

Projects also are underway along Alaska’s coast and in Hawaii, where native residents are rebuilding ancient rocky enclosures originally intended to trap fish, but which also protect against storm surge.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,"" he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force."" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and ""a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,"" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, ""gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project ""has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest"" and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were ""carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,"" he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Their central pitch? The ambitious Gazoduc Pipeline project, a $25 billion infrastructure initiative to connect Nigeria’s gas supply to Moroccan and European markets.

Morocco’s presentation on this crucial international stage marks a significant step toward securing foreign backing at a key time when US investors are actively seeking to boost energy projects across Africa.

Nawfal Drari, Director of Project Finance at Morocco’s National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM), which heads the project, delivered talking points covering the initiative’s progress and investment opportunities, adding that the pipeline has reached a strategic phase.

Launched in 2017 under the guidance of Morocco’s King Mohammed VI and Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, the project now moves closer to its Final Investment Decision — and a show of support from US investors could catapult that progress into an accelerated reality.

Houston: A strategic location

The US-Africa Energy Forum’s location in Houston was not coincidental. Commonly known as the “Energy Capital of the World,” the Texas city is home to over 4,600 energy-related companies, making it a prime location for deep-pocketed investors willing to hold a stake in key international projects in the sector.

One key player is the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which has announced that it is evaluating oil and gas infrastructure investment opportunities across Africa. This signals a shift of broader US backing for more traditional energy assets across Africa away from solely its renewables focus.

DFC Director Selam Demissie spoke at the Texas forum, saying that the agency is “actively looking” at both upstream and downstream oil and gas infrastructure projects.

Against this backdrop, the forum provided ONHYM a prime platform for Morocco to pitch Gazoduc to US investors as a key investment opportunity in Africa’s evolving energy landscape.

The Moroccan national office said that “this strategic project will enable African countries to access a sustainable and affordable source of energy, while also serving as a tool for economic and social integration.”

Gazoduc to set Morocco up as a prime energy transit hub

For Morocco, the pipeline represents more than just energy infrastructure. The government views it as a catalyst for economic transformation that will create thousands of jobs and establish the North African country as a primary energy transit hub connecting Europe, Africa, and the Atlantic basin.

The massive pipeline will stretch approximately 6,000 kilometers across multiple African countries, connecting Nigeria’s natural gas reserves to Morocco and eventually to European markets.

Engineers designed the system to carry between 15 and 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually.

The project promises to transform energy access across the continent. Officials estimate the pipeline will serve about 400 million people in 13 countries, dramatically expanding reliable energy access throughout West and North Africa.

The ambitious project has already overcome several challenging hurdles, with engineers completing detailed design studies in 2024, and teams finishing environmental and social impact assessments for the northern section.

Developers plan to build it in phases, with a holding company overseeing financing and construction. Three separate project companies will handle different segments of the route.

In December 2024, West African leaders approved the Intergovernmental Agreement at the 66th CEDEAO Summit, outlining each country’s rights and responsibilities for the project.

But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.
Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.""
Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.
Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON -- A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,"" he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force."" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and ""a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,"" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, ""gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project ""has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest"" and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were ""carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,"" he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were “carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it’s fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,” he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A year after being lauded for its plan to replace thousands of aging, gas-powered mail trucks with a mostly electric fleet, the U.S. Postal Service is facing congressional attempts to strip billions in federal EV funding.

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency's new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,"" he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That's a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university's Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump's criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn't make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force."" She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and ""a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,"" Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, ""gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa's farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project ""has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest"" and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There's also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were ""carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it's fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

It’s a win for the fossil fuel industry and climate deniers who have hampered progress, both technically and politically, for almost 50 years.

The incentives in Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and other legislation were set to greatly expand renewables in terms of manufacturing and affordability, but Donald Trump and reactionary Republicans in Congress are actively favoring coal, oil and gas like there’s no climate crisis.

We are forfeiting a major industry of the future to the rest of the world, especially China.

It’s rich that the very people who’ve hamstrung clean energy for decades protest that wind, solar and batteries aren’t ready to replace fossil fuels, even though they are now cheaper up front and won’t contribute to floods, hurricanes, fires and crop failures.

Public utilities should serve the public, and that includes future generations.

Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project and Tucson Electric Power may know how to keep the lights and AC on for now, but they have done their part to set back our climate future.

Pipeline tells us the dinosaurs are in charge

Yes, building a 600-mile pipeline does say volumes about Arizona: That the utilities and fossil fuel industry run our energy policy and to an extent, public policy.

In the state that should be leading the nation in solar energy, our utilities instead choose to expand the use of fossil fuels. If completed, this pipeline would not be in operation for at least another four years.

Solar could be online much sooner and have a far smaller impact on the environment.

The dinosaurs (figurative and literal) are in charge.

Arizona's roadless areas need protecting

With the current administration provoking job cuts, rollbacks and chaos, we’ve overlooked an important issue.

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced in June the rollback of the “Roadless Rule” that prohibits construction of roads in about 30% of our national forests.

In Arizona, roadless areas include part of the Chiricahua Mountains in the Coronado National Forest, Cherry Creek in Tonto National Forest and other areas.

These are special protected places for enjoying unspoiled nature. Road construction brings noise and increased fire risk — four times the risk, according to analysis by the Wilderness Society. It also brings habitat destruction.

As a licensed mental health therapist in Arizona for more than 35 years, I have witnessed the profound effects of wilderness on the mental health of our residents.

According to the Mayo Clinic, exposure to natural environments can reduce cortisol, the stress hormone. Being able to experience these places can lower the risk for chronic disease, illness, depression and PTSD.

Let Congress know that allowing road construction in pristine wildlands is not OK. We must preserve these areas for their beauty and for our health and wellbeing.

Lynette Nelson, Phoenix

What motivates Arizona conservatives on solar?

I applaud the solar project cited in Andy Tobin’s op-ed column, “Arizona can’t afford to leave large swaths of federal land idle.”

That there was big bipartisan support for Gosar’s bill to cede the federal land to La Paz County for the project attests to the project’s value.

The only question I have regarding the drive by Tobin and Gosar to realize the project is this: Do they have a financial interest in it?

Drug use has an impact on police officers

The latest update to the City of Phoenix’s Substance Use & Overdose Dashboard shows a disturbing trend in “suspected opioid overdoses.”

Overdoses seem destined to reach more than 5,500 this year, where the past high was 4,554 in 2023. While this may indicate a success of sorts in the fire department’s use of naloxone as an opioid overdose antidote, it is also an indicator of stress on our fire and police departments.

That stress comes from directly responding to deadly overdose situations and indirectly dealing with heat deaths, traffic deaths, crime and homelessness that drugs cause.

Jim McManus, Phoenix

Bridge collapse conjures a terrifying memory

I’m writing about the article on the Oxbow Bridge collapse (“Oxbow Bridge collapse a serious public safety threat, Arizona officials warn”).

It reminded me of a time in 1969 when I was 6 and my little brother was 3. My Dad loved to go for drives, and on this one my Mom and us kids were in the back seat. I was in the middle.

We were somewhere in the Arizona desert when we went over an old bridge, and it suddenly collapsed while we were on it.

The fall was far enough that it deflated all four tires on our 1968 Camaro SS. The fall was also far enough that it knocked all of my front teeth out. My brother was asleep and almost bit his tongue off.

I don’t remember how, but we made it out of there. I hadn’t thought about it until this article about the Oxbow Bridge collapse.

I had to share the story because I don’t know if there are any other old bridges out in the Arizona desert.

Electric vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular amongst consumers. According to Experian’s 2024 Automotive’s Electric Vehicles report, there were around four million EVs in the country last year. That’s roughly 1.4% of all vehicles on the road.

While many automobile manufacturers have started including EVs in their line-up, Tesla has long been a top brand for consumers. But Nissan — the Nissan Leaf in particular — is picking up steam. Since December 2010, the car maker has sold over 1 million EVs worldwide — 650,000 of which are the Leaf, according to Nissan. If you’re considering purchasing either a Tesla or a Nissan Leaf, check out the cost comparisons below.

Also here are the luxury EVs that will have massive price drops before the end of the year.

Cost Comparison: Tesla Vs. Nissan Leaf

This is what it typically costs to charge a Tesla, as per EnergySage’s latest data:

Tesla Model 3: 4 to 5 cents per mile ($11 to $15 for a full battery)

Tesla Model Y: 4 to 5 cents per mile ($14 for a full battery)

Tesla Model X: 5 to 6 cents per mile ($18 for a full battery)

Tesla Model S: 4 to 5 cents per mile ($18 for a full battery)

EnergySage also found the typical charging costs for a 2023 Nissan Leaf range from 9 cents to 33 cents per kWh of electricity. A full charge can cost anywhere from $3.82 (in Washington) to $10.56 (in Hawaii).

The cost of charging either of these vehicles depends on where you live and how much you drive. But as you can see, a Nissan Leaf generally costs less to fully charge than a Tesla.

Distance Traveled on a Full Charge Matters

It’s important to note just how far a full charge can take you — and how often you’ll need to change your EV.

For example, Tesla costs about $50 to charge each month (or $600 a year) across all popular models. This is based on driving 1,100 miles each month and spending an average of 4.56 cents per mile.

According to Consumer Reports, here’s the EPA-estimated range of a fully charged Nissan Leaf:

149 miles for the Nissan Leaf

212 miles for the Nissan Leaf SV Plus

If you drive 1,100 miles a month, you may need to fully charge your vehicle between five and seven times. Total monthly charging costs could be:

Washington ($3.82 per full charge): $19.10 to $26.74

Hawaii ($10.56 per full charge): $52.80 to $73.92

Compare this to the Tesla’s typical $50 a month charging costs and you’ll generally spend less on a Nissan Leaf — depending on location.

Incentives and Other Costs

The Nissan Leaf comes with a limited-time incentive that can lower your upfront costs. Specifically, leasing or purchasing a new vehicle gets you up to two years of free public charging — at level two and when you use the EZ-Charge card, per Nissan.

Both the Tesla and Nissan Leaf may also qualify for up to $7,500 in a federal tax credit, according to the IRS. This means some significant savings when you purchase one of these EVs.

Other cost considerations include:

Starting MSRP: According to Nissan, the 2025 Leaf starts at $28,140. The Tesla starts at $37,490 (including incentives), per Tesla.

Charging efficiency: The average charging efficiency for an EV is 85% to 95%, according to NRG Clean Power.

Local rates: Expect to spend an average of 17.45 cents per kWh, but know that costs can be much higher, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Maintenance and repairs: On average, a Tesla costs $257 to $748 in annual maintenance, per Tesla’s website. A Nissan Leaf costs an estimated $1,105 after five years of ownership, according to CarEdge.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Nissan-LEAF-38-source.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 11:01:18.842102

In June, the Senate parliamentarian blocked a Republican proposal in a major tax-and-spending bill to sell off the agency’s new electric vehicles and infrastructure and revoke remaining federal money. But efforts to halt the fleet’s shift to clean energy continue in the name of cost savings.

Donald Maston, president of the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association, said canceling the program now would have the opposite effect, squandering millions of dollars.

“I think it would be shortsighted for Congress to now suddenly decide they’re going to try to go backwards and take the money away for the EVs or stop that process because that’s just going to be a bunch of money on infrastructure that’s been wasted,” he said.

Beyond that, many in the scientific community fear the government could pass on an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming when urgent action is needed.

Electrified vehicles reduce emissions

A 2022 University of Michigan study found the new electric postal vehicles could cut total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20 million tons over the predicted, cumulative 20-year lifetime of the trucks. That’s a fraction of the more than 6,000 million metric tons emitted annually in the United States, said professor Gregory A. Keoleian, co-director of the university’s Center for Sustainable Systems. But he said the push toward electric vehicles is critical and needs to accelerate, given the intensifying impacts of climate change.

“We’re already falling short of goals for reducing emissions,” Keoleian said. “We’ve been making progress, but the actions being taken or proposed will really reverse decarbonization progress that has been made to date.”

Many GOP lawmakers share President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Biden-era green energy push and say the Postal Service should stick to delivering mail.

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said “it didn’t make sense for the Postal Service to invest so heavily in an all-electric force.” She said she will pursue legislation to rescind what is left of the $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act allocated to help cover the $10 billion cost of new postal vehicles.

Ernst has called the EV initiative a “boondoggle” and “a textbook example of waste,” citing delays, high costs and concerns over cold-weather performance.

“You always evaluate the programs, see if they are working. But the rate at which the company that’s providing those vehicles is able to produce them, they are so far behind schedule, they will never be able to fulfill that contract,” Ernst said during a recent appearance at the Iowa State Fair, referring to Wisconsin-based Oshkosh Defense.

“For now,” she added, “gas-powered vehicles — use some ethanol in them — I think is wonderful.”

Corn-based ethanol is a boon to Iowa’s farmers, but the effort to reverse course has other Republican support.

Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the rollback effort, has said the EV order should be canceled because the project “has delivered nothing but delays, defective trucks, and skyrocketing costs.”

The Postal Service maintains that the production delay of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, or NGDVs, was “very modest” and not unexpected.

“The production quantity ramp-up was planned for and intended to be very gradual in the early months to allow time for potential modest production or supplier issues to be successfully resolved,” spokesperson Kim Frum said.

EVs help in modernization effort

The independent, self-funded federal agency, which is paid for mostly by postage and product sales, is in the middle of a $40 billion, 10-year modernization and financial stabilization plan. The EV effort had the full backing of Democratic President Joe Biden, who pledged to move toward an all-electric federal fleet of car and trucks.

The “Deliver for America” plan calls for modernizing the ground fleet, notably the Grumman Long Life Vehicle, which dates back to 1987 and is fuel-inefficient at 9 mpg. The vehicles are well past their projected 24-year lifespan and are prone to breakdowns and even fires.

“Our mechanics are miracle workers,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. “The parts are not available. They fabricate them. They do the best they can.”

The Postal Service announced in 2022 it would deploy at least 66,000 electric vehicles by 2028, including commercial off-the-shelf models, after years of deliberation and criticism it was moving too slowly to reduce emissions. By 2024, the agency was awarded a Presidential Sustainability Award for its efforts to electrify the largest fleet in the federal government.

Building new postal trucks

In 2021, Oshkosh Defense was awarded a contract for up to 165,000 battery electric and internal combustion engine Next Generation vehicles over 10 years.

The first of the odd-looking trucks, with hoods resembling a duck’s bill, began service in Georgia last year. Designed for greater package capacity, the trucks are equipped with airbags, blind-spot monitoring, collision sensors, 360-degree cameras and antilock brakes.

There’s also a new creature comfort: air conditioning.

Douglas Lape, special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers and a former carrier, is among numerous postal employees who have had a say in the new design. He marvels at how Oshkosh designed and built a new vehicle, transforming an old North Carolina warehouse into a factory along the way.

“I was in that building when it was nothing but shelving,” he said. “And now, being a completely functioning plant where everything is built in-house — they press the bodies in there, they do all of the assembly — it’s really amazing in my opinion.”

Where things stand now

The agency has so far ordered 51,500 NGDVs, including 35,000 battery-powered vehicles. To date, it has received 300 battery vehicles and 1,000 gas-powered ones.

Former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in 2022 the agency expected to purchase chiefly zero-emissions delivery vehicles by 2026. It still needs some internal combustion engine vehicles that travel longer distances.

Frum, the Postal Service spokesperson, said the planned NGDV purchases were “carefully considered from a business perspective” and are being deployed to routes and facilities where they will save money.

The agency has also received more than 8,200 of 9,250 Ford E-Transit electric vehicles it has ordered, she said.

Ernst said it’s fine for the Postal Service to use EVs already purchased.

“But you know what? We need to be smart about the way we are providing services through the federal government,” she said. “And that was not a smart move.”

Maxwell Woody, lead author of the University of Michigan study, made the opposite case.

Postal vehicles, he said, have low average speeds and a high number of stops and starts that enable regenerative braking. Routes average under 30 miles and are known in advance, making planning easier.

“It’s the perfect application for an electric vehicle,” he said, “and it’s a particularly inefficient application for an internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Mrs. G wants more shade. Energy conservation in the landscape is more than just a marital mandate or environmental buzzword. It is a practical, cost-saving approach that every homeowner can put into action. By following Texas A&M AgriLife’s Earth-Kind® principles, gardeners can reduce energy use, improve comfort, and protect the environment, all while enhancing the beauty and value of their property.

One of the most effective ways to conserve energy in the home landscape is through strategic plant placement. Large deciduous trees planted on the south and west sides of a home can lower interior summer temperatures by 8 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. In the winter, these same trees allow sunlight to filter through their bare branches, naturally warming the home. For best results, shade trees should be planted 15 to 20 feet from the side of a home or 12 to 15 feet from a corner to allow proper canopy spread. Smaller ornamental trees such as crapemyrtles, redbuds, and Japanese maples can be planted closer to windows and walls, providing seasonal shading benefits.

Air conditioners also benefit from thoughtful landscaping. The American Refrigeration Institute found that shading the outdoor unit can reduce indoor temperatures by up to 3 degrees. Planting shrubs, vines, or small trees nearby can offer shade, but it is important to allow enough space for proper airflow and maintenance access.

Vertical plantings such as espaliers, trellises, and vines can insulate walls from summer heat and winter cold. They can also reduce dust, glare, and noise. Deciduous vines like American wisteria, Boston ivy, and Virginia creeper offer summer shade while allowing winter sunlight to penetrate. Annual vines such as morning glory or hyacinth bean can provide quick seasonal coverage. Overhead structures including arbors and pergolas placed over windows, doors, or patios can also shield walls and outdoor living spaces from excessive heat, especially when paired with climbing plants such as muscadines or climbing roses.

Groundcovers are another valuable part of an energy-efficient landscape. Turfgrass, ferns, liriope, Asian jasmine, and other low-growing plants keep the surrounding environment cooler than bare soil, asphalt, or concrete. This reduction in heat buildup helps lower the overall temperature around the home, reducing the cooling load. Choosing drought-tolerant, pest-resistant groundcovers also reduces the need for watering, fertilizer, and pesticides, further lowering costs and environmental impact.

Proper plant placement and selection not only saves energy but also enhances wildlife habitat. Trees and shrubs provide shelter and food for birds, bees, and butterflies. Incorporating native species whenever possible increases the ecological value of the landscape while maintaining low-maintenance and water-efficient design.

When planned with energy conservation in mind, the landscape can become a natural extension of the home’s heating and cooling system. By strategically using trees, shrubs, vines, and groundcovers, homeowners can enjoy reduced utility bills, increased property value, and a more comfortable outdoor environment.

Global electricity demand surged by 4.3% in 2024, outpacing GDP growth and fueled by electrification of manufacturing, AI-driven data centers, and cooling needs from extreme weather. Renewables accounted for 38% of energy supply growth, surpassing natural gas (28%) and coal (15%). This trend is accelerating in 2025, with cleantech manufacturing, data centers, and direct air capture (DAC) projected to add 57 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy demand by 2030.

The U.S. is a microcosm of this shift. Data centers alone are expected to drive 44 GW of demand by 2030, with tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon committing to 100% clean energy. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has catalyzed $71 billion in cleantech investments in Q3 2024, with solar and battery storage reshaping domestic supply chains.

Policy Clarity: The IRA and Regulatory Uncertainty

The IRA has become the cornerstone of the U.S. energy transition, offering tax credits and grants that make renewables the lowest-cost option when incentives are factored in. Federal programs like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund aim to deploy 36 GW of renewables and storage by 2030, while state-level green banks are amplifying local projects.

However, regulatory uncertainty looms. The Supreme Court's recent rulings have curtailed administrative enforcement authority, creating ambiguity around methane and carbon emission rules. A potential Trump administration could further delay climate regulations, favoring fossil fuels in the short term. Yet, the long-term trajectory remains tilted toward renewables, as OPEC's demand forecasts and methane regulations deferred until 2035 risk overinvestment in oil infrastructure.

Technological Pivots: AI, Carbon Markets, and Workforce Shifts

AI is revolutionizing energy deployment. Smart grids and virtual power plants (VPPs) are optimizing distribution, while AI-driven automation accelerates solar infrastructure in desert regions. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits are also gaining traction, with sales jumping from 4 million to 6.6 million tons of CO2 between 2023 and 2024. Hedge funds are pairing CDR investments with renewable infrastructure to hedge against regulatory shifts.

Workforce growth in renewables is outpacing the broader economy, with clean energy jobs expanding at twice the rate of traditional sectors. Solar accounts for two-thirds of these jobs, while green hydrogen and long-duration storage (LDES) are emerging as high-growth niches.

Investment Strategies: Timing and Risk Management

For 2025, hedge funds are adopting a dual strategy:

1. Short-Term Oil Exposure: Allocations to E&P and midstream operators like Chevron (CVX) and Occidental (OXY), hedged with oil ETF short positions.

2. Solar Timing Plays: Firms like First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR) are prioritized for projects near the 2027 tax credit deadline, with a focus on domestic supply chain resilience to mitigate FEOC risks.

Carbon arbitrage strategies are also gaining traction, with investments in CDR-focused companies like Climeworks and Carbon Engineering, alongside green hydrogen projects benefiting from IRA incentives.

Macroeconomic Headwinds and Opportunities

Rising term premiums and inverted yield curves are pushing hedge funds toward short-duration assets. Energy ETFs and copper futures are being used to balance exposure across oil and renewables, with allocations adjusted based on inflation and tariff developments. The U.S. debt maturation of $9.2 trillion in 2025 adds urgency to risk-return optimization.

Conclusion: The Case for Renewables

While oil remains a near-term play in a deregulated landscape, the structural advantages of renewables—low costs, modularity, and policy tailwinds—make them a superior long-term bet. The race to meet 57 GW of clean energy demand by 2030, coupled with IRA-driven incentives and AI-enabled efficiency gains, creates a compelling case for strategic reallocation. Hedge funds that prioritize timing, sector-specific risk management, and carbon arbitrage will be best positioned to capitalize on the energy transition's fault lines.

In 2025, the energy sector is no longer a binary choice between oil and renewables. It is a multi-dimensional arena where agility, policy foresight, and technological agility define success. For investors, the path forward is clear: renewables are not just the future—they are the present.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-17 09:01:51.973749

The company has launched work on the 300-MW/1,200-MWhour Nighthawk Energy Storage Project, a lithium iron phosphate battery storage system to serve Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers in the San Diego metro area. San Jose builder Rosendin is EPC contractor for the estimated $600-million project set to operate next year that will link solar and wind energy to a substation on the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar base, Arevon said.

Construction is expected to employ more than 130 workers at peak, it added.

“Nighthawk and other utility-scale battery systems allow electricity to be stored during low demand periods and then efficiently discharged onto the grid, responding quickly at high demand and vital periods,” said an Arevon spokesman.

With its start coming six months after a $400-million fire at Vistra Energy’s Moss Landing battery array near Monterey, Arevon CEO Kevin Smith said Nighthawk's project design includes added safety measures “and will comprise the safest and most advanced batteries on the market.”

Arevon has partnered with the Poway, Calif., Fire Dept. to develop a fire prevention and response plan and provide training specific to the Tesla battery packs to be used. Fisher Engineering is providing third-party fire protection engineering analysis. The union-built project, first announced in 2021, is fully permitted and qualifies for domestic content tax credits available under the Inflation Reduction Act, Arevon said.

Tong joined the attorneys general from 18 other states and the District of Columbia, according to a release from his office.

Together, the group is standing against the DOE policy that would stop states from using important federal funding by limiting reimbursement for important administrative and staffing costs that have traditionally been covered by these federal energy programs.

The coalition feels that capping funding on these programs will jeopardize states’ abilities to keep them functioning. The states ask that the court vacate the cap and restore the required reimbursement rates for the affected energy programs.

“We’re suing to stop Donald Trump from making it harder for states like Connecticut to drive down energy costs and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,” Tong said. “Connecticut families and small businesses are getting socked by skyrocketing utility bills, and now Trump is lawlessly defunding efforts to helps save us.”

Tong added that Trump is taking this action to “funnel even more tax breaks to billionaires” and promised that the coalition won’t let him.

Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Deputy Commissioner Joe DeNicola noted that the policy contradicts past practices and effectively precludes the reasonable use of State Energy Program funds to meet staffing supplies.

“Staffing is a primary expense for most state energy offices, and the arbitrary restriction on this use does not serve any state or federal policy goal,” DeNicola said. “The implementation of this policy would limit our energy options and our ability to deliver affordable and clean energy to Connecticut consumers.”

For many years, federal law has mandated agencies such as DOE to negotiate agreements with states that establish fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run programs, including basic administrative or staffing costs necessary to run federally funded programs.

Tong’s release reports that these “indirect” and “fringe” costs have never been subject to a cap.

On May 8, however, DOE announced a new policy that forgoes this practice by capping indirect and employee benefit costs at 10% of a project’s total budget in lieu of previously negotiated rates.

The coalition says that the cap will limit resources states need to keep programs operating and ensure federal dollars reach the people they are meant to help. The cap could also lead to staffing cuts, smaller operations and a reduced ability to deliver important energy services.

Furthermore, the coalition predicts state budgets would face sudden shortfalls, while agencies would have to spend more time and money navigating DOE’s new budget rules. This would leave fewer resources for direct consumer assistance.

According to Tong’s release, CTDEEP uses State Energy Program funding to facilitate work on energy efficiency, building decarbonization, renewable energy, affordable housing energy retrofits, resilience and transmission and distribution planning.

DOE’s policy to cut indirect costs to 10% of the overall award and include fringe benefits in that cap would significantly limit the flexibility of these funds for Connecticut and prevent the state from using the funds as needed, Tong relayed.

The coalition argues that the new policy violates federal regulations requiring agencies to honor negotiated indirect cost rates between states and the federal government.

The attorneys general add that the policy is like similar caps that federal courts have recently ruled against. They stress that every court to have ruled on the limits of such blanket limits has found them unlawful, unjustified and disruptive to critical public programs.

Ultimately, the coalition is asking the court to vacate DOE’s new policy and stop implementation of the reimbursement caps.

Joining Connecticut in the lawsuit are the attorneys general from New York, Minnesota, Colorado, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. The governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania joined as well.

She’s filed multiple challenges to five wind farms plus one big transmission line since the demise of Antelope Ridge.","During the outcry against nuclear power in the 1970s, liberal Oregon lawmakers hatched a plan to slow an industry that was just getting started. They created a burdensome process that gave the public increased say over where power plants could be built, and the leading anti-nuclear activists of the day used appeal after appeal to delay proposed nuclear plants to death. It had a huge impact: Oregon’s first commercial nuclear plant, the one that spurred lawmakers into action, was also the state’s last.

What those lawmakers didn’t plan for was that 50 years later, an Oregon citizen activist would use that same bureaucracy to hinder some of the very energy projects that today’s liberals want: wind farms and the new high-voltage lines needed to support them.

They didn’t plan for Irene Gilbert.

The 76-year-old retired state employee, former gun store owner and avid elk hunter from La Grande, Oregon, is on a mission to keep turbines and transmission towers from blighting the rural landscape. She has filed more challenges to energy projects — 15 in all, including lawsuits — than anyone in the state, according to Oregon’s Department of Energy.

“I kind of have a reputation,” Gilbert said.

Renewable energy advocates treat activists like Gilbert as relentless gadflies who need to be stopped for the good of the planet.

They say Oregon’s slow process for approving energy projects, with its endless appeals, is one reason the state ranks near last in the country for green energy growth despite setting a deadline to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2040.

Democratic leaders up and down the West Coast are reckoning with liberal policies of the past that they say clash with today’s progressive agenda. In California, for example, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a rollback of environmental review laws to expedite the construction of affordable housing. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has been pushing to roll back her state’s vaunted land-use restrictions for the same reason.

But Oregon leaders have been far less aggressive in confronting the historical artifacts that critics say hold green energy back. One, the Depression-vintage federal agency that runs most of the Northwest power grid, which has set a sluggish pace for upgrades; the other, the energy siting system Oregon created long ago for nuclear power. (The federal agency says it makes financially prudent decisions about construction.)

In the past five years, the Oregon Legislature has repeatedly rejected or watered down bills to streamline permitting of energy projects. The efforts included legislation supported by renewables advocates as well as farming and land conservation groups, both of which share Gilbert’s concerns about development in rural spaces.

In response to questions from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica, the governor’s office acknowledged “existing significant impediments” to renewable energy growth in Oregon.

Kotek is “carefully considering opportunities to streamline Oregon’s energy siting processes,” spokesperson Anca Matica said in an email, “while maintaining opportunities for community input and preventing detrimental impacts.”

In the meantime, Kotek and lawmakers let another effort to modernize the system fall through the cracks this year. A proposal to limit public appeals and speed up permitting decisions resulted in only minor changes to the process. The status quo means developers remain locked in battles with Gilbert and others for years on end.

“I figure I can lose a thousand cases,” Gilbert said. “Even if it doesn’t look like it, I have made a difference.”

An Old Lady With a Laptop

Gilbert was retired from a career in state government and was running the Oregon Trail Trader gun shop with her partner in La Grande when she first heard about the Antelope Ridge wind farm. It was 2009, and only a handful of wind farms existed in the state. But an energy company suddenly wanted to erect 180 turbines across the scenic Grande Ronde River valley just outside town.

Energy infrastructure was a sore spot for Gilbert. Decades ago, she’d married into a ranching and timber family, and a chunk of the forest she owned was bulldozed for a transmission line. She blamed the line when she couldn’t get the timber to grow as she wanted.

She also had a stark memory of how quickly a business can erase a beloved part of rural Oregon. The company that owned Kinzua, the timber town where she grew up, razed it without a trace after shutting down operations in 1978.

Now that she was older, she said, she wanted to give back, and she was motivated by the idea of helping farmers and others protect their land from the government and electric companies.

“I feel like my reason for participating now is to do what I can to help these poor folks,” she said.

Gilbert became the legal research analyst for an opposition group known as Friends of the Grande Ronde Valley.

The tangle of rules governing energy siting was no problem. She’d worked as a trainer for the Oregon Department of Human Services and later Oregon Occupational Safety and Health, where she taught people how to understand the statutes that guided their work.

“So I know how to read government regulations,” she said.

She also enjoys it.

“It keeps my brain working,” she said with a laugh.

Gilbert spoke against the wind farm at public hearings. During one meeting in which she tried to add to her previous comments, she was cut off because the time for public testimony had passed.

She argued against the wind farm before the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council, which has ultimate authority over whether major pieces of infrastructure like wind farms, solar projects, power plants and transmission lines get built. She sent a letter to the governor’s office stating she would sue and make all of the state’s dealings with the energy company public along the way.

That wind farm never materialized. The company backed out in 2013, citing poor market conditions.

“We were successful in stopping that,” she said. “The company would say that it was a financial decision. I think it was more than that.” (The company told OPB and ProPublica in a statement that it was “the lack of strong commercial prospects.”)

Proposals for new wind farms kept cropping up, and she contested as many as she could, even ones three hours from her home. She’s missed only a handful of the energy siting council’s monthly meetings in the past decade, driving all around the state before video conferencing became common. Developers have approached her after meetings, she said, and asked her what it would take to make her happy.

“I’ve been called ‘an old lady who has access to a computer,’” she said. “That’s kind of, I guess, how I’m viewed, and OK … I guess that’s OK.”

She sometimes works at the antique desk in her home office, sometimes from the couch in a living room filled with her grandchildren’s artwork. She’s filed multiple challenges to five wind farms plus one big transmission line since the demise of Antelope Ridge. The transmission line is moving forward. Two of the wind projects were scuttled by developers, while three others got built.

Landowners and lawyers from around the region eventually began seeking her input for filing their own objections to energy projects.

“And my advice is free,” she said.

A committed Republican, Gilbert said she doesn’t do all this because she opposes the idea of clean energy. She owns a cabin powered by rooftop solar panels. She said she doesn’t believe in the need for large-scale solar, but said she did support a solar farm in the scenic Columbia River Gorge after developers listened to public input and took steps to reduce the project’s impact.

But she finds herself quite often at odds with the work of major wind, solar and transmission players, “Just because it’s taking so much land.”

Fuji Kreider, a self-described liberal Democrat who relocated from New York, started a friendship with Gilbert while both campaigned against a major transmission project.

“She calls herself a redneck environmentalist,” Kreider said during a visit at Gilbert’s home.

Kreider’s husband, Jim, chimed in: “A redneck, gun-toting environmentalist.”

“Something like that,” Kreider said.

The Boardman to Hemingway Line

In late summer 2023, Adam Richins, the chief operating officer of the electric utility Idaho Power, sat down in a black leather wingback chair at Paddy’s Bar & Grill in downtown Portland to swap horror stories with other Northwest leaders in the industry on a niche podcast called the Public Power Underground.

One of Richins’ doozies involved Irene Gilbert.

Richins at the time was in year 16 of trying to build a 300-mile transmission line through eastern Oregon, known as the Boardman to Hemingway line, or B2H for short. It is the crucible of Oregon’s energy growth, the single piece of infrastructure that utilities and renewable advocates are most eager to see built. It would connect Idaho green energy suppliers with Oregon data centers that demand loads of electricity.

“Anybody want to guess?” Richins asked his fellow power execs at one point during the show. “State process application. How many pages?”

“10,000,” one offered.

He shook his head, raised his thumb upward. Higher. And higher still.

“It was close to 20,000 pages,” Richins told them.

By the time the executive finished his tale of environmental reviews and land use certificates, he joked that he had tears running from his eyes.

“But then, guess what happens?” Richins said. “We got sued.”

By Gilbert.

Gilbert’s fight against B2H has been her biggest yet. Slicing through 300 miles of land Gilbert desperately wants to keep undisturbed, the line illustrates the stakes she and other rural Oregonians see in ridding grasslands and forests of massive new energy projects.

One of Gilbert’s “Stop B2H” allies, John Williams, owns the last remaining swath of what was once a sprawling family ranch and timber estate, just a few minutes’ drive from Gilbert’s home. Bushwhacking through wildflowers along his property line on a recent day, Williams, Gilbert and the Kreiders looked out on Twin Lake, its surface carpeted in yellow pond lilies and dotted with nesting birds. The activists worry the line will harm birds and that construction and maintenance crews driving through the transmission line corridor will carry in noxious weeds and invasive species.

Williams said Idaho Power’s proposed path, which runs through his property, has evolved over time — for the worse. “It’s lipstick on a pig,” he said, “but the original route I think made a lot less damage. It was lower in elevation. It took less timber.”

Idaho Power spokesperson Sven Berg told OPB and ProPublica the company has altered the transmission line’s path numerous times in response to public feedback and that the project is better for it.

About an hour west of Twin Lake the next day, Gilbert sat with Sam Myers, who runs a fourth-generation wheat farm that the B2H line would transect. Myers said he worries the high-voltage lines could spark wildfires or electrocute people operating farm machinery nearby. (Idaho Power says planting and harvesting crops near the B2H will still be safe but cautions farmers against using machinery taller than 15 feet underneath. The company says its equipment meets or exceeds industry standards, that this equipment is closely monitored, and that the tall, metallic structures used for lines like B2H pose less fire risk than with smaller ones.)

Myers said he’s turned down developers offering “huge amounts of money” to put solar panels on his property.

“I don’t want to change farm ground to solar,” he said he’s told them. “Is there a way we can have a coexistence?”

Gilbert’s Stop B2H coalition, with 1,000 members, raised more than $350,000 against the project. (Kreider, the group’s treasurer, said the vast majority of donations — aside from larger checks from a few landowners and two historic preservation organizations — were less than $1,000 and came from individuals in Oregon and Eastern Idaho. She said the money went mainly to legal fees.)

B2H opponents filed a total of 117 challenges to the power line project, keeping the appeals process going long after the state approved construction in 2019.

In late March, though, the opponents lost their final appeal in court. Idaho Power began construction last month.

If Richins, the utility’s COO, feels exasperated by the two decades it took to overcome complaints from Gilbert and others, Gilbert thinks mainly about the outcome for her side.

For all its delays, the state’s energy council, in practice, does not reject proposed projects. And despite the claims that she’s gumming up the state’s process with her appeals, Gilbert has never actually reversed a council decision.

“My perception is that I’m ignored,” she said.

Oregon’s Energy Law

It might seem paradoxical that Gilbert considers herself an environmentalist while standing in the way of what most environmentalists today see as progress. But her right to do so has its roots in Oregon’s storied conservation movement of the 1970s.

Portland General Electric, a leading utility, prompted a fierce public backlash when it announced construction in 1967 on the Trojan Nuclear Plant about an hour outside of Portland. To address concerns about the safety of nuclear power and radioactive waste, Oregon lawmakers created the Nuclear and Thermal Energy Council.

PGE would eventually shutter Trojan after decades of regulatory violations, forced shutdowns, construction flaws, costly repairs and constant harrying from antinuclear activist Lloyd Marbet through the state council. Marbet’s tactics also delayed PGE’s efforts to build two more plants on the Columbia River until voters passed a ballot measure in 1980, creating strict rules for nuclear power that effectively killed the industry in Oregon.

The council lived on, rebranded as the Energy Facility Siting Council to cover more than just nuclear power.

Oregon is one of only 10 states with statewide energy standards, and renewable energy developers consider its approval process one of the country’s most rigorous. Covering everything from environmental safety and wildfire risk to sites of archaeological significance , Oregon’s law requires developers to follow many of the same steps federal regulators require.

The process is supposed to take no more than a year. But the energy siting council will suspend the deadline anytime someone formally objects to a project’s approval. A protest triggers a hearing, after which an administrative judge can ask the council to reverse itself, after which the council can agree or disagree, after which anyone can file a lawsuit, after which years of litigation may begin.

Oregon’s assistant director for energy siting, Todd Cornett, said public involvement can slow projects down, but that’s what the Legislature intended. While most of the power gets consumed on the more populous west side of the state that includes Portland, he noted, the new windmills and solar arrays are generally destined for dry, windy and rural eastern Oregon.

“We want to make sure that we’re taking into consideration all of the issues and concerns that people who are going to have to live with these facilities raise in the process,” he said.

Cornett denies this process has held back renewables, noting that projects have stalled even after the council’s approval. But he also acknowledged such holdups arise because new wind and solar farms will need more transmission lines to carry their output. There aren’t enough, in part, because it’s so difficult to get new ones through Cornett’s agency.

Some Oregon progressives give a nod to the bureaucracy that once mired nuclear reactors and say it’s time to give windmills and solar panels a faster pass.

“The process back in the early ’70s was meant to be a little bit more plodding,” said Oregon Rep. Ken Helm, a Democrat from the Portland suburbs, during a House floor speech in April. “Now that we are many, many decades past that time, we’re finding that the procedures EFSC operates under are really too slow for the relatively low-risk renewable energy that we’re seeking.”

Yet lawmakers have balked at meaningful changes.

Two years ago they rejected a bill to create committees of farmers, developers, tribes and conservationists to identify places in each county for transmission lines and energy production. The bill also would have directed state agencies to streamline the renewable energy approval process.

This year, lawmakers rejected a bill to promote solar farms that coexist with cropland. Research at Oregon State University has found that the shade from solar panels increased crop yields and that, in turn, the crops can make solar panels work more efficiently by keeping the air around them cool.

With Gilbert’s long battle against B2H dragging on earlier this year, some lawmakers became galvanized. The 20 years it had taken to get the project on track was “ridiculous,” said Rep. Mark Gamba, a Portland-area Democrat who is vice chair of the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment.

In February, Gamba introduced legislation to overhaul the state’s approach to siting and permitting energy facilities. Among the proposed changes: a tight restriction on appeals from members of the public. The provision would require that any lawsuit challenging the state’s approval of a project be fast-tracked to the state Supreme Court.

“So the NIMBYs will only get one bite at the apple,” Gamba said, using the acronym for “not in my backyard” that refers to people considered reflexively opposed to development near them.

The Legislature was coming after the gadflies like Gilbert.

An Overachiever for the Underdog

When members of the Stop B2H coalition gather in Gilbert’s living room, a computerized display of properties in the path of the project sits on a chair just beneath a portrait of a Native American man in a headdress of fur and bison horns. One of Gilbert’s brothers made the canvas from the hide of an elk he shot, and another painted it.

Both brothers died of Hungtington’s disease, a genetic disorder that began to severely debilitate them during their 30s. Gilbert, who had the same likelihood of inheriting the disease but did not, said losing them turned her into an overachiever who always wanted to fight for the underdog.

“I think I kind of try to compensate for what they weren’t able to do,” she said.

Fights against energy and transmission projects have been her mainstay for more than a decade. She said she sometimes awakens in the middle of the night, struck by an idea about a rule or statute that might be of use.

“Most of the people in Stop B2H believe that we need more energy. And I agree, we need more energy. But we cannot provide the energy needs of this country or this state by taking all of the farmland,” Gilbert said. “There’s a point where we aren’t going to have the land needed to produce food.”

When Gilbert heard about Gamba’s bill to upend her main means of objecting, she did not panic. She did what she has always done. She spoke up.

On a recent May afternoon in Salem, Gilbert sat on a window bench outside a Capitol hearing room where she’d testified against Gamba’s bill.

“I remember you!” exclaimed Gilbert’s state representative, Republican Bobby Levy. “You’re one of the smartest people. You do your research.”

Levy said she was working to oppose the bill.

Gamba in the end was disappointed with what the Legislature was able to pass. After setting out to overhaul Oregon’s energy siting bureaucracy, he said the scaled-back legislation only “dabbled around the edges.” It might shave 10% off approval times for green energy, he said.

What did survive was Gamba’s effort to move lawsuits filed by people like Gilbert directly to the Oregon Supreme Court. Gilbert was dismayed to lose the chance to build a case over time. But it won’t stop her.

Now that the Boardman to Hemingway line is actually getting built, Gilbert said, it will bring a rash of new applications from people seeking to build wind and solar farms along the power line’s route. Gilbert will be standing by to file challenges.

That’s almost all Dignity Village had two decades ago when this collective of people who’d been camping in downtown Portland arrived at their new home – a paved piece of a city composting yard just west of the Portland airport.

With ingenuity and effort, the tents were transformed into tiny homes. The self-governing village became an inspirational model, offering one potential solution to a country’s growing struggle with homelessness. But over the years, a major problem remained – the lack of electricity for each of the village’s 43 households.

Now, with the support of the Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund (PCEF) and the nonprofits Verde and Twende Solar, that powerless past has become a memory. After one final upgrade, the village has flipped the switch on donated solar panels and a new electric system, making residents safer and healthier for the next 20 years.

Critical energy needs

They are residents like Lisa Larson and Scott Layman, who moved into the village 14 years ago with the desire to help the group solve its critical energy needs. Their first dream: solar energy. The site had a single utility pole bringing power to a small central area, including the village guardhouse. The tarmac broils in heat waves and freezes when winter storms blast through the Columbia River Gorge. But because the city lease doesn’t allow villagers to penetrate the pavement, there was no simple way to enlarge the energy system.

Villagers came up with workarounds. Some people were using candles, Larson said, even though safety rules don’t permit open flames. Others charged car batteries once a week to power lights and small appliances. A few ran gas-powered generators, but those were polluting, noisy and expensive.

Households with medical needs, like oxygen and CPAP machines, ran extension cords over the tarmac – but that became a problem whenever a car or truck came through. Villagers developed a lift system made of old crutches, hoisting the extension cord network whenever a vehicle needed to pass.

Although most villagers safely use propane for heat, other propane-powered devices have a troubled history. Larson and Layman lost most of their belongings when a malfunctioning propane lantern exploded several years ago. In 2019, a leaky propane-powered refrigerator exploded, destroying one home and damaging its neighbors. The refrigerator’s owner was burned so badly that he had to be hospitalized.

Coming together to create solutions

Not long after the explosion, friends of the village reached out to nonprofits that could help. Verde, an environmental justice group, was already applying for a PCEF grant to build the Goodling Annex community solar installation near the airport; Twende Solar specializes in bringing renewable power to communities without electricity.

Verde’s project manager incorporated the village in its PCEF application. The plan fit PCEF’s mission to help all Portlanders – especially the most vulnerable – become more resilient in the face of climate change, said PCEF Clean Energy Project Manager Ricardo Moreno Gonzalez.

Getting started

The impenetrable tarmac posed a serious challenge. Working with an expert electrician and the city, Twende solved the problem by running rigid conduit from the utility pole to the edge of the village, Executive Director Robin Swanhuyser said. From there, new support posts carried the conduit around the village perimeter to each tiny home, where workers installed lights, outlets and smoke detectors.

In the summer of 2023, 80 volunteers helped villagers build their new green grid, installing donated solar panels on 32 village buildings. Although not every roof had the strength or the correct orientation to support panels, there were enough to create a shared 60-kilowatt system, Swanhuyser said. After the grid installation, grateful villagers hosted a cookout to thank the volunteers for making such a difference in their lives. Even before the solar operation came online, the availability of electric power from the utility made a huge difference.

Larson, current outreach coordinator and former chair of the village board, describes the thrill of getting home from work on a hot afternoon and feeling the breeze of an electric fan. Layman, former head of village security, remembers the first time he casually flicked on the light.“It was a great day,” he said.

As the weather cooled, Verde added an efficient heat pump system to the village’s community meeting space, called The Commons. The building used to fill with smoke in cold weather, when chilly residents piled logs in an aging wood stove. But as ice and snow froze Portland in January 2024, the new heat pump kept The Commons comfortable. During perilous days of record low temperatures, the village even hosted desperate overnight emergency visitors who had been trying to stay warm in cars and recreational vehicles.

“There’s a good chance that the electricity saved someone’s life,” said Ron White of Probity Builders, which worked with Verde on the project.

What’s next?

After final equipment upgrades, including a bi-directional meter, the new solar system was switched on by Pacific Power in June 2025. Although each home is only supplied with a small amount of power, the overall electric bill had quadrupled to about $1,200 a month. Twende covered the excess charges until the new system came online; the electricity generated by the panels is projected to cover the extra cost.

With this project, villagers have been able to savor things most people take for granted – a small refrigerator to cool food and medicine, a small microwave to heat meals, a place to charge a phone or plug in a medical device. Even when there are glitches – even on days that one of the new electric smoke detectors shrieks a false alarm – “we are ecstatic,” Layman said.",https://www.portland.gov/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2025/54706392451_dae763d83c_o.png?h=2af593bb&itok=sKE1BRHc,N,,2025-08-17 12:07:49.705510

Yet Harris still trails most other major U.S. metropolitan counties when it comes to climate anxiety, according to a survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

The Houston Chronicle mapped the survey’s findings below. Use the search bar or select a county on the map to see what share of the population is worried about climate change.

Nationally, concern about the climate has nearly doubled in the past 25 years, as more Americans experience climate change firsthand, noted Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the program and a professor at the Yale School of the Environment. But the pace of that shift has varied across the country, with differences often falling along party lines.

Leiserowitz said the gap stems from partisan differences in how political leaders discuss the issue.

“Unfortunately, there's a real difference between Democratic and Republican leaders in how they talk about climate change,” he said.

This partisan divide is evident even within the Houston metropolitan area, where climate concern varies sharply among counties along political lines.

Compared to nearby counties, Harris has maintained the second-highest level of concern about climate change for the last several years. Only Fort Bend has a higher rate. That aligns with political leanings in the 2024 presidential election, when Harris and Fort Bend counties were the only two in the Houston metro area to vote for Kamala Harris.

Shel Winkley, a Houston meteorologist with nonprofit climate research group Climate Central, also pointed to Texas’ economic dependence on oil and gas to explain the relatively low rates of concern about climate change across the state.

“They grew up knowing that’s where their parents went to work every day,” Winkley said. “But recognizing climate change isn’t about villainizing workers or those who’ve been doing it for their livelihoods,” he added.

For Winkley, raising awareness remains critical as extreme weather events become more frequent in Texas. But even more mild examples of climate change can make people see that it’s happening. He recalled one spring when bluebonnets bloomed unusually early in February, only to be wiped out by a cold front weeks later.

“Everyone was like, what happened to my bluebonnets?” Winkley recalled, and he was able to explain, “Well, this is an impact of climate change.”",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/0/0/0/0/28389294/1/rawImage.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 11:01:37.121986

The latest version of Victoria’s 2025 Transmission Plan, released by state government agency VicGrid on Sunday, revealed a 200,000-hectare increase in the area available to developers.

The plan outlines the parts of the state designated as renewable energy zones and the new transmission infrastructure needed in the next 15 years to connect them to the grid.

The latest version increases areas of land designated as hubs for wind, solar and battery farms from 1.66m hectares proposed in May to 1.88m hectares across six proposed renewable energy zones.

The amendment increases the footprint of these areas to 7.9% of the state, up from 7.0% in the original draft proposal, after industry feedback said larger areas were needed to make projects technically and commercially viable.

The number of distinct zones has been increased to nine from seven, also in response to feedback.

The greatest change will be in the state’s west with an expansion to the Wimmera-southern Mallee zone, while a new area around Coleraine has been added to the south west zone.

The state energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said more than 42% of Victoria’s electricity was produced by renewables in the past financial year, with the state reaching record levels of renewable energy generation.

“Our record investment in renewable energy is paying off,” she said in a statement on Sunday.

“Victoria consistently has the lowest wholesale power prices in the country, helping to slash energy bills for families and businesses.”

Victorians paid an average wholesale price of $107 per megawatt hour, compared with $151 in NSW, $138 in South Australia, $127 in Queensland and $115 in Tasmania, according to government data.

But the latest modelling predicts the cost of connecting Victoria’s renewable energy zones could almost double.

The government initially estimated a $4.3bn cost, but VicGrid puts the latest price tag closer to $7.9bn, taking into account new Australian Energy Market Operator costings for the transmission lines.

The costs are expected to be mostly recouped through higher consumer bills, although the government argues Victorians will overall be better off with wholesale energy costs lowered by the delivery of more renewable energy into the grid.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b409db49422a10025d250d6b0d99fb3010430d9b/832_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0294d1d465ffcffaf124a2ec4e22ec3b",N,,2025-08-17 07:59:25.246753

The move signals increasing international interest in Pakistan’s nascent but promising electric vehicle (EV) sector, bolstered by government incentives and shifting consumer demand.

A delegation of 15 officials from Letin, led by General Manager Xu Zhen, met with Punjab’s Minister for Industries and Commerce, Chaudhry Shafay Hussain, in Lahore to discuss the project. The minister assured full provincial support and detailed a suite of incentives available to foreign investors, particularly those establishing operations in Special Economic Zones.

“New investment in the province is not only strengthening the economy but also creating employment opportunities for thousands of people,” said Hussain. He added that Punjab is offering a 10-year income tax holiday and duty-free import of machinery to manufacturers operating in designated zones.

EV push gains momentum in Punjab

The Punjab government has made clear its intention to position the province as a regional leader in clean transportation. “We are focused on the promotion of EVs and want Punjab to play a leading role in the country’s clean mobility transition,” Hussain said during the meeting.

Letin Auto, which operates under the trade name Levdeo Automobile Group, completed bankruptcy reorganization in China in 2024. Industry analysts suggest that the group may now view Pakistan not only as a strategic base for local sales but also as a potential export hub. With a relatively low 19% tariff on vehicles exported to the United States, Pakistan offers competitive advantages for Chinese EV makers seeking global market access.

Growing Confidence among Chinese EV Firms

Letin’s entry adds to the growing list of Chinese automakers establishing a presence in Pakistan. Brands such as BYD and Changan have already launched EV models, while MG, under Chinese ownership, has gained traction in the local market. This momentum reflects broader confidence in Pakistan’s policy direction, which includes targeted subsidies, tax breaks, and a national EV policy geared toward long-term sustainability.

“The arrival of new Chinese players will further push us to bring our EV technology here sooner,” said a senior official from Hyundai Pakistan. The company has begun feasibility studies for introducing its electric vehicle line locally, in response to the accelerating competition.

Shift from Combustion to Clean Tech

The influx of foreign EV makers is already reshaping the local auto sector. For decades, Pakistan’s automotive market has been dominated by internal combustion engine vehicles from Japanese and Korean manufacturers. Now, these incumbents face mounting pressure to innovate or risk losing ground to faster-moving rivals.

Auto sector analysts believe that growing competition will not only speed up the industry’s shift toward electrification but also stimulate parallel developments in battery manufacturing and component supply chains.

Pakistani consumers, particularly urban middle-class buyers, are also watching the transition closely. With fuel prices continuing to climb, affordable EVs are emerging as a viable alternative.

“With fuel costs constantly rising, many people are actively looking for alternatives,” said Imran Qureshi, a young electric vehicle enthusiast based in Rawalpindi. “If these Chinese EVs hit the market at affordable prices, they could offer the middle class a genuine opportunity to transition to cleaner transport.”

While Pakistan’s EV market remains at an early stage, developments like Letin’s planned plant suggest that transformation is underway. For investors, automakers, and consumers alike, Punjab may soon become a focal point for clean energy transport across South Asia and the broader Middle East.",https://www.islamabadscene.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Letin-Mengo.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 09:01:34.049764

The Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate Program, or HEAR, is a federal program under the Inflation Reduction Act dedicated to helping homeowners save money with the addition of energy-efficient appliances. However, there are a few limitations that homeowners should know about first.

Residents can use the rebates for Energy Star-certified appliances such as heat pumps for space heating and cooling, energy-efficient stoves and cooktops, and insulation. Each household could qualify for up to $14,000 in total rebates, per The Dallas Morning News.

Low- and middle-income families will likely benefit the most from the rebate program. The newspaper reported that single families earning less than the national median household income of $78,171 could have the majority of their costs covered. Those who have a higher income and renters may still be eligible as well.

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, the average home in the United States spends approximately $2,000 each year on electric bills. The addition of energy-efficient appliances could save residents hundreds of dollars a year.

Nearly half of all American households used natural gas stovetops in 2022, according to Earth.Org. However, burning fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal, and oil releases heat-trapping pollution into the atmosphere and contributes to the warming climate.

Appliances that use dirty energy also have an impact on human health. In fact, one study found that almost 13% of childhood asthma cases are associated with gas stoves.

Induction stoves are a better option because they save time on cooking and cleaning while also keeping asthma-causing gases out of the home. With the rebate program, homeowners can get up to $840 off an induction stove.

Eligible residents can also save up to $8,000 on a heat pump with the HEAR program. Heat pumps are also great energy-saving investments for homeowners.

It paints an alarming picture, especially at a moment when Big Oil has taken over the US government via its Republican puppets and is spiking all our efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to move to green energy. Carbon dioxide is a dangerous greenhouse gas, which keeps the sun’s heat from radiating back out into space, and acts like someone set off atomic bombs in the atmosphere. People think nothing of burning gasoline in their cars, or coal and fossil gas for heating or electricity, but would be freaked out if someone detonated atomic bombs in the sky over their homes every day. But it comes to the same thing.

AMS says that the global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to about 422.8 parts per million in 2024, a 52% increase over the level of about 278 ppm that had prevailed in the 18th and previous centuries before the Industrial Revolution.

The last time the atmosphere held this much CO2 was the Pliocene era from 5 to 2 million years ago. Half of Florida was under water and sea level was many feet higher. The seas may not rise as much in our era because we’re coming off a cold period. But Louisiana, Washington, D.C., New York City and the whole countries of Egypt and Bangladesh would suffer tremendously even with just a 15 to 20 foot sea level rise.

Really bad news: from 2023 to 2024, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere rose by a whopping 3.4 parts per million. That equals the growth from 2015 to 2016, the highest rate recorded since the 1960s.

Folks, we’re supposed to cut additional carbon dioxide emissions to zero, not increase them by record amounts.

The average surface temperature of the earth for last year was the hottest ever on record going back to 1850, which probably means the hottest since about 122,000 years ago before recent episodes of ice age.

That’s hot.

Some of the extra heat was owing to the El Niño in the first half of the year, but El Niños are cyclical, occurring every few years because of shifting wind and current patterns in Pacific, and you don’t get ever increasing heat records only because of a cyclical phenomenon. The secular increase is because of the significant augments in CO2. Many new record temperatures were set. The AMS says these temperature highs were reported by those countries that are keeping records. The United States under Trump may fall out of that category, though many individual American states will likely go on keeping their own records.

Entire glaciers definitively died off, including all the ones in Venezuela and the Conejeres in Colombia. Those that survive were put on a diet by the heat; the authors say, “Glaciers lost a record amount of their mass in 2024; all 58 reference glaciers across the globe reported loss.” The earth is a big place and regional climate varies, so it is unusual that all 58 reference glaciers should shrink in concert. It only ever happened once before, in 2023. Things are getting worse.

The oceans used to be cool, but they are rapidly heating up, too. Last year’s average sea surface temperature was hotter than at any time since records began being kept 171 years ago. Heatwaves struck almost everywhere in the oceans, sparing only 9% of their surface.

Global heating and climate breakdown cause hurricanes to be more intense and to drop more water when they make landfall. While there were not more hurricanes than usual in the past two years, the ones we had were doozies. Yagi in the Pacific rose to the level of super typhoon and devastated Vietnam and China, killing 800 people. Hurricane Helene blew down trees and houses from Florida up into the Appalachians and flooded out the latter, killing 200 people. Not since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 had a storm taken that many American lives. Then Milton hit Florida again, only 12 days later.

India Achieves 100 GW Solar PV Manufacturing Capacity under ALMM: India has reached a record 100 GW of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing capacity, as listed under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). This is a remarkable rise from just 2.3 GW in 2014, signalling a decade of strong policy support and industrial growth in the renewable energy sector.

Static GK fact: India’s long-term clean energy roadmap aims for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

Policy Measures Driving Expansion

Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi highlighted that this achievement is the outcome of focused government efforts, particularly initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar Modules. These measures aim to strengthen domestic manufacturing and reduce import dependency.

The ALMM framework has been central to ensuring quality standards and encouraging greater private sector participation.

Development of ALMM

The ALMM Order was introduced by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) on 2 January 2019. The first approved list was released in March 2021 with 8.2 GW of listed capacity and 21 approved manufacturers.

In just four years, the figures have multiplied, with 100 GW capacity, 100 manufacturers, and 123 operational units registered under ALMM as of 2025.

Static GK fact: The MNRE was formed in 1992 and is headquartered in New Delhi.

Building a Competitive and Advanced Ecosystem

The rapid increase in manufacturing capability also reflects significant technological upgrades. Many producers now operate vertically integrated facilities and manufacture high-efficiency solar modules, making India an increasingly competitive player in global markets.

This growth benefits both domestic renewable energy targets and international clean energy trade opportunities.

Strengthening Self-Reliance and Energy Security

The achievement contributes directly to the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, reducing reliance on imported solar equipment and safeguarding against global supply chain challenges. It also ensures that India’s renewable energy transition remains sustainable, indigenous, and future-ready.

In conclusion, T1 Energy's solar supply chain transformation is more than a business strategy—it's a blueprint for U.S. energy independence.","The U.S. solar industry is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by a confluence of policy tailwinds, energy security imperatives, and the urgent need to decarbonize the grid. At the forefront of this transformation is T1 Energy, a rebranded entity formerly known as Freyr Battery, which has pivoted from battery storage to solar manufacturing. Its recent partnership with Corning—a $1.5 billion investment in polysilicon and wafer production—marks a pivotal step in building a vertically integrated, domestically anchored solar supply chain. For investors, this move represents not just a strategic repositioning but a calculated bet on a future where energy independence and policy-driven growth converge.

Vertical Integration: A Shield Against Supply Chain Fragility

T1 Energy's collaboration with Corning is a masterstroke in addressing the U.S. solar industry's most persistent vulnerabilities. By securing hyper-pure polysilicon and solar wafers from Corning's Michigan campus, T1 is closing critical gaps in the supply chain. Polysilicon, a foundational material for solar cells, has historically been sourced from overseas, exposing projects to geopolitical risks and trade tariffs. The partnership ensures that raw materials, wafers, cells, and modules are all produced domestically, creating a closed-loop system that aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) domestic content requirements.

This vertical integration is not merely a logistical convenience—it's a financial imperative. Analysts project that the streamlined supply chain could reduce solar module costs by 15–20% by 2030, driven by economies of scale and the elimination of intermediaries. For T1, this means a competitive edge in a market where cost efficiency is paramount. The G2_Austin facility, set to produce 5 GW of advanced TOPCon solar cells annually, and the G1_Dallas module plant, already generating 443 MW in Q1 2025, form the backbone of this strategy.

Policy Tailwinds: Trump-Era Tariffs and the IRA's Dual Impact

The U.S. solar sector is no longer a niche market—it's a battleground for energy security. Trump-era tariffs on foreign solar imports, initially criticized for stifling growth, have inadvertently accelerated domestic manufacturing. T1 Energy's pivot to solar under its new brand reflects this reality. By avoiding reliance on Chinese components, the company ensures eligibility for the IRA's 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and its domestic content bonus, which could add up to 10% to the credit.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which mandates 10-year recapture rules for ITC claims, further tightens the domestic content requirement. T1's partnership with Corning, which includes wafer production at Hemlock Semiconductor (a U.S. polysilicon leader), ensures compliance with these stringent rules. This alignment with policy frameworks is not accidental—it's a deliberate strategy to future-proof the company against regulatory shifts.

Strategic Rebranding: From Batteries to Solar

T1 Energy's rebranding from Freyr Battery underscores a broader industry trend: the recognition that solar, not batteries, is the cornerstone of U.S. energy independence. While battery storage remains critical, the scale of solar deployment required to meet decarbonization targets dwarfs that of batteries. T1's $850 million investment in Austin and its $340 million acquisition of the Dallas module plant signal a long-term commitment to solar.

The company's decision to abandon its Georgia battery project—a $2.6 billion venture—further highlights its focus on solar. This shift is not without risk, but it aligns with the U.S. Department of Energy's emphasis on solar as a “low-hanging fruit” for rapid decarbonization. For investors, T1's agility in pivoting to solar—while maintaining a diversified energy portfolio in Europe—demonstrates strategic foresight.

Market Positioning: A Long-Term Play in a Surging Sector

The U.S. solar market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 12% through 2030, driven by corporate sustainability mandates and the AI-driven energy demand surge. T1's vertically integrated model positions it to capture a significant share of this growth. By 2026, the company's Austin facility will supply 5 GW of cells annually, while Corning's Michigan plant will produce enough wafers to support 10 GW of module production.

Moreover, the partnership's job creation potential—nearly 6,000 roles across Michigan and Texas—aligns with the Biden administration's industrial policy goals. These jobs are not just economic multipliers; they are political capital for T1, ensuring continued policy support in an era where energy security is a bipartisan priority.

Investment Outlook: A Resilient Bet on the Future

For investors, T1 Energy's transformation offers a compelling case. The company's alignment with policy frameworks, its strategic vertical integration, and its pivot to solar all mitigate downside risks while amplifying upside potential. The IRA and OBBBA create a regulatory environment where domestic producers like T1 can thrive, while global supply chain disruptions make diversification a necessity.

However, risks remain. The success of the Austin facility hinges on timely construction and operational efficiency. Similarly, the solar market's post-2028 outlook depends on sustained demand and regulatory stability. Investors should monitor T1's capital expenditures and production timelines closely.

In conclusion, T1 Energy's solar supply chain transformation is more than a business strategy—it's a blueprint for U.S. energy independence. By leveraging vertical integration, policy tailwinds, and a strategic pivot to solar, the company is positioning itself as a leader in a clean energy economy defined by resilience and self-sufficiency. For those seeking long-term value in a sector poised for explosive growth, T1 Energy represents a rare combination of vision, execution, and alignment with the forces shaping the future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-17 17:01:01.299759

Reversing the Endangerment Finding isn’t just a policy shift — it’s a betrayal.","We can’t let Trump and Big Oil tear it down

There are moments in history when silence is not neutral. When pretending not to know is the most violent thing a nation can do. We are standing at such a moment now.

I was there in 2009, when the Environmental Protection Agency issued a formal declaration grounded in science, shaped by decades of research, and echoed by communities who’d been breathing injustice for generations. It’s called the Endangerment Finding.

It simply states that greenhouse gases — like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide — threaten the health and welfare of current and future generations. With that one declaration, the government admitted something our ancestors already knew deep in their lungs: Pollution kills, and climate change is no accident — it’s policy, profit and power playing god with our survival.

It will not be the politicians or polluters who pay the price. It will be the rest of us.

That declaration gave the EPA the legal authority — and moral obligation — to act. To regulate emissions. To stand between Big Oil and the bodies of children with asthma. To recognize that melting glaciers and flooded streets are not random weather, but human consequences.

It gave us hope that science would be more than a footnote in a political debate. Now, that hope is under assault.

In 2025, America continues to see a scorched-earth approach to science and truth by the Trump administration. They are now placing a crosshair on the Endangerment Finding itself. This administration’s current set of actions isn’t just about dismantling environmental regulations.

It’s about denying reality, un-writing the future, and silencing the warning bells of our time. In its place, they offer lies dressed as liberty, deregulation disguised as freedom, and fossil fuel profits parading as patriotism.

Make no mistake: Reversing the Endangerment Finding would be the equivalent of yanking out the foundation of the house while claiming you’re remodeling. It would erase the federal government’s obligation to regulate the very emissions causing this crisis. And in that vacuum, corporate pollution would flourish while human life withers — especially in communities already pushed to the margins.

Who gets hurt?

It’s not the CEOs sitting in air-conditioned boardrooms. It’s not the politicians whose families will evacuate by private jet when the next superstorm hits. It’s the mother in South Phoenix whose son can’t sleep through the night without wheezing.

It’s the elder in Appalachia whose well water tastes like diesel. It’s the Black child in Louisiana who thinks smoke in the sky is just part of what it means to grow up.

These are the communities that have always borne the brunt of environmental injustice. Poor communities. Black and brown communities. Tribal nations. Immigrants. Those without generational wealth who cannot move to higher ground or buy filters for the air. If the Endangerment Finding is rescinded, these communities will suffer first and suffer worst.

Who benefits?

Follow the money: Oil companies. Coal barons. Gas conglomerates. They win by weakening science and strengthening silence. They win when no one is watching. They win when the people’s voices are buried beneath lobbying dollars and propaganda.

But there’s another cost beyond the moral one. The economic cost of inaction will bankrupt us. Climate-related disasters in the U.S. alone cost more than $165 billion in 2022, and the numbers are only rising. Fires, floods, hurricanes, droughts — each one a result of neglect. Each one is a tax on our denial.

The more we ignore, the more we pay. And it’s not just money — it’s public health. It’s premature births, cardiovascular disease, mental trauma, food insecurity, displaced families, and poisoned air.

And then there’s the cost we cannot measure yet — the debt we are writing into the lungs of our children and their children. A future where summers become death sentences. Where crops fail more than they feed. Where water is more scarce than clean.

Reversing the Endangerment Finding isn’t just a policy shift — it’s a betrayal. A betrayal of the next generation, and the ones after that. We’re not handing them a planet — we’re giving them a problem so monstrous we didn’t have the courage to face it ourselves.

But here’s the thing about tipping points: They go both ways. We are still — barely — on the edge where we can choose a different path.

The science is more precise than ever. The technology exists. The solutions are ready. What we need is the political will and the moral clarity to say enough. Enough denial. Enough delay. Enough pretending this house isn’t on fire.

If we hold the Endangerment Finding as sacred — not just as a legal document but as a promise — then we can still build a future from its foundation. But if we let it fall, the silence that follows will be deafening.

And it will not be the politicians or polluters who pay the price. It will be the rest of us, coughing in the rubble, wondering why we let them turn off the alarm.",https://i0.wp.com/spokesman-recorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/endangerment.webp?fit=2000%2C1335&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-17 09:02:14.303395

Supporting EVs means supporting a stronger, more secure, and more affordable future for our country.","As a retired Air Force veteran, I’ve spent my life focused on protecting America’s security.

Today, that mission looks different than it did during my service. Energy security and economic security are now one and the same. Electric vehicles (EVs) help achieve both by reducing our reliance on foreign oil and shielding families from unpredictable gas prices. EVs give our Orlando-area families and businesses more control over their energy future, especially in a region where commuting and tourism traffic make fuel costs a major household expense.

That is why recent federal policy changes are concerning.

The federal EV tax credits, worth up to $7,500 for new cars and $4,000 for used ones, end for vehicles purchased after September 30. These incentives make EVs affordable for middle-class families, often reducing an EV’s overall price by thousands of dollars. Without them, EV adoption will slow, and Americans will face fewer options for affordable, energy-secure transportation.

In 2024, Americans bought a record 1.3 million EVs, driven largely by these tax credits. Vehicles like the Chevrolet Equinox EV became realistic options for many drivers.

EV sales benefit more than car buyers. They support thousands of American jobs in states like Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina, where automakers and battery producers have invested billions to build vehicles and supply chains in the U.S. Rolling back these incentives risks chilling these important investments and leaving workers vulnerable. All while countries like China continue to grow their EV dominance through aggressive manufacturing and mineral processing strategies.

EVs can run on electricity produced here at home, which insulates Americans from global oil shocks and stabilizes energy costs. When combined with smart charging technology, they can also help support a more reliable power grid. As more industries electrify, from shipping to manufacturing, controlling our own energy sources will determine America’s economic strength.

The U.S. has built a dynamic EV supply chain, created thousands of good-paying jobs, and started to reduce our dependence on volatile global energy markets. Weakening the policies that fueled this progress risks losing our competitive edge and letting foreign governments dictate the future of one of the most important industries of this century.

The choice in front of us is clear: continue strengthening American energy independence and affordability, or fall behind in a race we cannot afford to lose.

Energy independence is a national security imperative. America’s leadership in energy and technology will be shaped by the decisions we make today. Supporting EVs means supporting a stronger, more secure, and more affordable future for our country.

So far in 2025, fewer heat deaths have been reported than in the previous two years.
A disproportionate number of heat deaths occur in El Paso County compared to its population.
Inside Climate News identified 26 people who died in the heat during 2023 and 2024 in El Paso County.
The national heat strategy, published in 2024 by the interagency National Integrated Heat Health Information System, was taken offline this year.","EL PASO—Retired Catholic priest Arturo Bañuelas leaned into the microphone as he urged county commissioners to do something about the growing crisis of migrants dying in the desert just miles from the courthouse where he stood.

“These deaths are occurring right here,” Bañuelas said, wearing his white clerical collar under a black shirt and jacket during a January commission meeting. “Close to our homes, churches and community. We cannot turn away.”

Among the victims were a 75-year-old aficionado of Lowrider cars found in his trailer, a 39-year-old Army veteran out on a hike and a 27-year-old Guatemalan man who perished after crossing the border.

The previous record was set in 2023, when the heat directly or indirectly killed 26 people, according to state data. These were the two hottest years on record in El Paso. Heat-related illnesses also increased significantly.

Despite these alarming totals, neither the city nor the county of El Paso shares with the public weekly data on heat-related illnesses that is available from the state. El Paso’s health information exchange denied a request from Inside Climate News for the data it collects. Neither the city nor county has released the results of any investigations into the rapid increase in heat deaths. And, unlike other heat-afflicted cities like Phoenix and counties like Miami-Dade, El Paso has no staff positions dedicated to heat mitigation. El Paso relies instead on an unfunded high-heat task force made up of volunteers and government employees—all while the Trump administration has cut $3.5 million in public health grants to the city this year.

The day Bañuelas addressed the county commissioners, January 13, the elected officials voted unanimously in favor of a resolution recognizing the crisis of migrant deaths. It was a rare public acknowledgement of the rising death toll. But the vote did not commit the commissioners to any specific actions

Inside Climate News reviewed these two deadly years and found that migrants, the elderly and hikers are the most vulnerable to the heat. Contributing factors to heat deaths, such as whether someone had access to air conditioning, were not always included in public records, Inside Climate News found, limiting officials’ ability to see trends and develop plans to save lives.

Climate change is increasing the risks of extreme heat. The average annual temperature in El Paso has increased 5.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970, according to the nonprofit Climate Central.

Statewide, heat mortality has trended upward in the last decade. Two thousand twenty-three was Texas’ deadliest year on record, with 334 deaths directly attributed to heat. In 2024, heat killed 171 people and contributed to an additional 281 deaths, according to preliminary state data.

The increase in migrant deaths coincided with an increase in the number of people attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years. The number of migrants and asylum seekers arriving at the border declined in 2024 and dropped further this year. So far in 2025, fewer heat deaths have been reported than in the previous two years. But local humanitarian organizations hope public officials will learn from the record-setting years of 2023 and 2024.

Aimée Santillán, policy director at the Hope Border Institute, a faith-based human rights center in El Paso, said that the recent past showed that “massive amounts of deaths” can occur in the area.

“We saw that’s possible,” Santillán said. “We should do everything we can to prevent that from ever happening again.”

As the Temperature Goes Up, So Does the Risk

For Dr. Brian Elmore, working as an emergency medical physician at El Paso’s University Medical Center (UMC) was a crash course in the many ways migrants can be injured or die at the border. In addition to pulling his shifts at the hospital, Elmore co-founded Clínica Hope with the Hope Border Institute to provide medical care to migrants across the border in Juárez.

Elmore recounted in the Texas Observer the story of a woman who was found unconscious in the desert, her body temperature 107 degrees, and rushed to the hospital. She never regained consciousness and died several days later.

“All of these deaths are avoidable, perpetuated by the cruelty of our policies,” he wrote of migrant deaths at the border. “But the heat deaths in particular seem so senseless.”

Elmore told Inside Climate News that he often treated patients who had spent days walking in hot weather or waiting at the border fence. “Climate change and increasing militarization are combining to create dangerous conditions for migrants,” he said.

Doctors like Elmore are seeing the deadly impacts of heat firsthand. But more data is needed to bring the bigger picture into focus. In response, Inside Climate News compiled and analyzed records for the first time from UMC, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), El Paso’s Medical Examiner’s Office and the city’s fire department.

A disproportionate number of heat deaths occur in El Paso County compared to its population. With just under 900,000 people, the county had nearly as many deaths directly attributed to heat in 2024 as Harris County, home to nearly 5 million.

Inside Climate News was only able to identify individuals for whom autopsies were conducted. Autopsies are usually done for unexplained deaths or deaths that did not occur under medical supervision. The identities of individuals who died from the heat in Texas and did not receive autopsies are not public record.

Inside Climate News identified 26 people who died in the heat during 2023 and 2024 in El Paso County. Nineteen were migrants from countries including Guatemala, Mexico and Ecuador. Seven were U.S. residents. The youngest victim was 19 and the oldest 88. All but two of the victims were Hispanic.

Several patterns emerged among the U.S. residents who died from the heat. From 2022 through 2024, one male hiker died each year in El Paso’s Franklin Mountains. Two of the hikers were visiting El Paso from out of state at the time of their deaths. The third was originally from the Rio Grande Valley and had moved to El Paso.

Others who succumbed to the heat were two elderly men who lived alone. One woman died inside her vehicle. A man died walking on the highway after his vehicle broke down. One woman’s death was attributed to methamphetamines, with heat and dehydration listed as contributing factors.

Hot temperatures are nothing new in El Paso. But climate change is driving the region to new extremes. A 2021 report by the Texas state climatologist found that over the previous 45 years, El Paso County had seen the second biggest increase in average temperatures out of the state’s 254 counties.

The temperature surpassed 100 degrees on 70 days during 2023, including a 44-day streak in June and July. Those were both records.

These extreme temperatures offer a glimpse of what’s to come. The state climatologist projected that the number of 100-degree days in Texas will nearly double by 2036 compared to this century’s first two decades.

Task Force Addresses Extreme Heat

“I’m coming to you today with really bad news,” Graciela Ortiz said at a fire station in southeast El Paso on June 5.

First responders, reporters and public officials were assembled for the annual news conference held by El Paso’s Extreme Weather Task Force. Ortiz announced that heat deaths had gone up, again, in 2024.

“What we’re realizing now is, it’s not just the vulnerable, but it’s everybody,” she said. “Our goal is zero deaths.”

The task force coordinates efforts between city agencies, nonprofits and emergency services to connect residents to resources like utility payment assistance and cooling centers. Ortiz joined the task force, which she now coordinates, in 2009.

“All I want is for people to understand that heat does kill,” Ortiz said in an interview. “And there are places to get help if you need it.”

In her day job as a program specialist at the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, Ortiz fields calls from seniors around El Paso. She hears from elderly residents who turn off their air conditioning overnight to save on utility bills, even when nighttime temperatures exceed 90 degrees. Others call in asking for help because they can’t afford to fix a broken unit.

El Paso’s task force relies on donations to purchase box fans that are distributed for free to residents.

“We have a great community that works hard together,” Ortiz said. “People donate. We have no budget whatsoever. But we figure it out.”

El Paso’s population is over 80 percent Hispanic. One in five seniors lives in poverty, double the national average. Many residents struggle to keep up with electric bills during the summer. Rates of chronic health conditions, including diabetes and heart disease, which the heat exacerbates, are higher than average in the city.

Heat has long been deadly in El Paso. The city’s all-time temperature record was set on June 30, 1994, when the mercury hit 114 degrees. That heat wave claimed at least one life, when a 40-year-old construction worker perished.

A string of deaths in the summer of 2002 spurred the city to create the Extreme Weather Task Force. That summer 10 people died of heat stroke, and heat contributed to an additional 11 deaths. A presentation from the task force later described it as “a state of crisis” and said “something had to be done.”

The number of deaths began to decline. Between 2005 and 2021, El Paso recorded fewer than 10 direct heat deaths a year. Until now.

“It just keeps growing,” Ortiz said. “What are we doing wrong? I don’t know.”

An 85-year-old woman became El Paso County’s first heat death of 2025, just a week after the press conference. She was found sitting outside her modest home in the town of Canutillo. On that day, June 12, the temperature hit 103 degrees.

“You Need to Know the Size of the Problem”

Extreme heat is the most deadly weather-related hazard in the United States. But data on its impacts can be hard to access. Record-keeping on migrant deaths at the border is also notoriously spotty.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration partnered with local agencies and universities to host a 2016 workshop in El Paso on the public health risks of extreme heat. The attendees identified “a critical need” to quantify vulnerabilities in the region and recommended collecting data on heat-related illnesses and historical information on heat-related deaths. Nearly a decade later, however, little has changed.

The city of El Paso said it does not track heat-related illnesses. The city referred Inside Climate News to El Paso’s nonprofit health information exchange, PHIX, for that data. However, PHIX declined Inside Climate News’ request to access the data because the organization is set up to fulfill requests from health care professionals and academic researchers.

Several other county and city health departments in Texas maintain dashboards of heat-related illness using data from DSHS. Dallas and Tarrant (Fort Worth) counties make weekly updates to heat-related illness dashboards during the hot season. The San Antonio health department posts the weekly data for Bexar County. Harris County (Houston) and Travis County (Austin) also publish reports on both heat deaths and illnesses.

El Paso officials have also been reluctant to discuss how heat deaths are counted. Inside Climate News and the Texas Tribune reviewed excess deaths data and found that heat deaths are likely undercounted in Texas. The El Paso Medical Examiner’s Office declined interview requests for this story. Eventually, chief medical examiner Dr. Mario Rascon answered questions in writing.

Rascon referenced the College of American Pathologists to explain the office’s protocol to identify heat deaths. If someone with heart disease dies of a heart attack after shoveling snow, he said, the death is not attributed to “environmental cold exposure.”

Rascon applied this logic to say that an individual who died of a heart attack after physical strain in hot weather would likely be considered a natural death, not an accidental heat death. He said that determination could change if there was evidence that the person had an “intrinsic inability” to get out of the heat.

Contributing factors to heat deaths were not always included in public records reviewed by Inside Climate News. For example, after a 75-year-old Hispanic man was found dead at his home in northeast El Paso, the autopsy noted that it was 85 degrees inside his trailer at 8:23 p.m. The high temperature that day, June 11, 2024, was 102 degrees. Three pets were found dead with the man.

His death was attributed to the heat. But neither the autopsy nor the police incident report say whether the trailer had air conditioning or if the unit was turned on. No one seemed to ask why it was so dangerously hot in the home.

Researchers from the University of Texas School of Public Health found, in a 2016 paper, that heat waves were linked to increased risk of death among the elderly in Texas between 2006 and 2011. The correlation was strongest in El Paso County, where the researchers found that the risk of elder mortality was 4.70 times greater during heat waves, compared to days with more normal temperatures.

“Understanding these patterns of who is dying from the heat is extremely important if you want to reduce heat-related deaths,” said Gregory Wellenius, an environmental health professor at the Boston University School of Public Health.

He gave the example of Maricopa County, Arizona, where officials found that many who died in the heat had broken air conditioners. This helped the county focus its efforts on paying to repair air conditioning units for qualifying residents. Phoenix has also restricted access to certain hiking trails on days with extreme heat warnings, which has reduced the number of rescues first responders have to make during the hottest months. The El Paso trails where three hikers have died are in the Franklin Mountains State Park, which remains open during extreme heat warnings.

Maricopa County publishes an annual report with in-depth analysis of all heat-related deaths. El Paso County does not.

“That information is very useful as you’re trying to intervene and help people,” Wellenius said. “You need to know the size of the problem.”

Rose Jones, a Dallas medical anthropologist, advocates for evidence-based public health responses to extreme heat. But she said data that can help communities understand heat risk is under threat as federal scientists are fired or resign under the Trump administration. The national heat strategy, published in 2024 by the interagency National Integrated Heat Health Information System, was taken offline this year.

Jones said local government and community-based organizations will need to step up as the federal government rolls back programs.

“We’re moving into more and more troubled territory,” she said. “Without the data you can’t really tell the story.”

“Show Us the Data”

Ana Fuentes, the director of Amanecer People’s Project in El Paso, said that local residents may underappreciate the heat’s true impact.

“As El Pasoans—as desert people—we think we’re tough,” she said. “We might not realize how much of a health crisis this is.”

That hit home when Amanecer, a climate justice organization, was staffing an informational table at a Coldplay concert on June 14. One member started showing signs of heat exhaustion after standing out in the triple digit weather.

Fuentes said El Paso should tabulate health impacts of the heat. “We need the city and the county to do their part to show us the data, to educate us on really how much of a problem it is,” she said.

It’s not only heat deaths that have gone up. In 2020, 90 people visited emergency departments in El Paso with heat-related illnesses, according to DSHS. That number shot up to 247 and 213 people in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Not all institutions report this data to the state, so this is likely an undercount.

Dr. Jose Burgos, UMC medical director of internal medicine, said the dry desert heat can be deceptive. With low humidity, people sweat less, which makes it harder for the body to regulate its temperature. Dizziness and headaches, some of the signs of heat exhaustion, can be mistaken for other ailments.

“Once the symptoms hit, people don’t even recognize what’s happening,” Burgos said.

UMC saw an increase in the number of patients discharged after treatment for heat-related illnesses in the last two years. In 2022, the hospital discharged 39 patients who had been treated for these ailments, according to data provided in a public information request. That went up 70 percent in 2023, to 67 patients.

“UMC’s data showed that temperature is a key contributor to heat-related illnesses, but other factors may also influence the data,” said Estefanía Morgan, UMC director of public affairs. “For example, behaviors changed during the pandemic when there were fewer large outdoor events, which can impact the number of heat exhaustion cases we see.”

The El Paso Fire Department responded to 110 heat-related emergencies during 2023, in which 92 patients were transported to a hospital. Those numbers declined in 2024, to 60 heat-related emergencies and 49 hospital transports.

Veerinder “Vinny” Taneja, director of the El Paso Public Health Department, said the region is experiencing “longer and more intense heat waves.”

Taneja said the city’s strategy, for now, is public education. The task force encourages the “buddy system” for residents to check in on friends, family and neighbors. Cooling centers have extended their hours.

Still, Taneja expressed interest in testing new strategies.

“I do look at what those other health departments and other communities are doing,” he said. “The issue has been we are in a declining cycle of funding… But if there is funding that comes upon us, we would definitely like to get some more activities going on.”

More than half of the department’s funding comes from grants, according to El Paso Matters, which means the federal cuts hit particularly hard.

Funding has also been on Graciela Ortiz’s mind this summer. The extreme weather task force coordinator said she is preparing for federal budget cuts that could impact social services in El Paso for the populations most vulnerable to the heat.

“Our budget [year] ends Aug. 31,” she said. “We’re bracing ourselves.”

Ortiz said that fewer people are reaching out this year for assistance to cope with extreme heat. She worries that some residents aren’t seeking help because of fear of immigration enforcement.

“Deaths in Our Backyard”

The majority of deaths that Inside Climate News was able to identify were of migrants from Latin America. Heightened, militarized immigration enforcement has pushed migrants to cross the border in more remote locations. Of the migrants who died in El Paso County in 2023, over half were women. Other reports have found that more women are perishing in their attempts to cross the border.

Migrant deaths in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s El Paso sector, which includes New Mexico, hit record highs in 2023 and 2024, according to a Texas Tribune investigation. During 2024, the remains of 168 migrants were recovered in the El Paso sector. Many, though not all, died of heat exposure.

In 2024 Mexico increased its immigration enforcement efforts and the Biden administration restricted access to asylum at the border. The number of migrants reaching the border began to drop. Upon entering office, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation blocking people from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border and deployed National Guard troops to the border. The number of migrants apprehended at the border reached an all-time low in July.

Initial records from the medical examiner’s office during June and July so far show a decrease in the number of heat deaths in El Paso compared to 2023 and 2024. This could be linked to fewer people attempting to cross the border or to the slightly lower temperatures this year. Complete data from DSHS will not be available until 2026.

The low numbers of border crossings may not last; earlier this month U.S. border agents were directed to stop deporting migrants under the asylum ban following a federal court order.

The Hope Border Institute has refocused its efforts to work with migrants on the border. Clínica Hope’s work is on pause as the medical needs of the migrant population have shifted.

“Enforcement measures are not going to work forever,” said Santillán, the organization’s policy director. “People who need to find safety are going to try and find it anyway that they can.”

As the needs in El Paso evolve, Santillán said that local officials and emergency responders should improve coordination to respond to migrants in distress. She said there should be more publicity about the threat posed by heat and a unified strategy between agencies. In comments to commissioners in January, she urged the county to collect more data on the problem through the medical examiner’s office.

“We’re seeing all these deaths in our backyard,” she said. “We know the causes, but we just live with them.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pratje_insideclimate_elpasoheat_031-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 06:58:48.202290

As of the end of 2024, the share of renewable energy in Korea’s power mix stood at 10.6 percent.
In the long term, renewable energy could become cheaper than conventional sources since it does not require fuel purchases after initial facility investments.
Still, many believe raising household electricity rates in Korea is not a simple matter.
Between 2022 and the end of last year, industrial electricity rates for high-voltage users rose to 185.5 won per kWh — a 75.8 percent jump.","Electricity bills may be one of the most sensitive issues for not only consumers, but also corporations, because they impact both household budgets and industrial costs. So when President Lee Jae Myung recently hinted at a potential rate hike, red alerts were turned on across the industry regarding the feasibility of his goals: Would it be possible, and if so, to what extent?

“At some point, electricity prices will inevitably rise if we are to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets,” Lee said during a senior secretary meeting on Thursday. “We need to proactively inform the public and seek their understanding and consent.”

Under Korea's 2035 greenhouse gas reduction targets, the country must significantly boost its share of renewable energy. This will require large-scale investments in power generation. Without relying on additional debt, such costs would have to be covered by electricity bills.

The previous Yoon Suk Yeol administration also pledged to “normalize” — raise — electricity prices but only ended up raising industrial rates, which was seen as a partial increase at best.

As of the end of 2024, the share of renewable energy in Korea’s power mix stood at 10.6 percent. According to the 11th Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand finalized in March, this proportion will grow to 29.2 percent by 2038. Supporting that growth will require major investments to expand power facilities. Offshore wind power — a focus of the current administration — costs 6 trillion to 7 trillion won ($4.3 billion to $5 billion) per gigawatt to develop. Meeting the government's 14-gigawatt goal by 2030 alone would demand roughly 100 trillion won in investment.

Renewables also require complementary infrastructure, including large-scale transmission and distribution networks and energy storage systems. This is especially important because most renewable generation sites are in regions like South Jeolla or Jeju Island, while electricity demand is concentrated in the greater Seoul area. This geographic mismatch is why the administration is pursuing a so-called energy highway along the west coast.

Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) also plans to invest 72.8 trillion won in transmission infrastructure through 2038, but the state-run electricity company is in no financial position to absorb these costs. As of June, its consolidated debt stood at 206.2 trillion won, with a debt-to-asset ratio of 472 percent. Further borrowing would be risky, making an electricity rate hike one of the few viable options to secure funding.

“Improving financial health and securing funding to overhaul the national power grid around the energy highway will be necessary,” said Choi Gyu-heon, a researcher at Shinhan Securities. “The possibility of a rate hike in the fourth quarter, during the off-peak season, should remain open.”

Even without the infrastructure investment, high generation costs remain a burden. According to Kepco, the company paid an average of 134.8 won per kilowatt-hour for electricity last year. When factoring in renewable energy certificates, solar power costs more than 200 won per kWh and offshore wind around 400 won — making it far more expensive than nuclear power, which costs just 66.4 won per kWh.

In the long term, renewable energy could become cheaper than conventional sources since it does not require fuel purchases after initial facility investments. In the United States, for example, the cost of solar power — including facility expenses — is already comparable to that of natural gas, largely thanks to falling panel prices. But unlike countries with vast flatlands, Korea’s mountainous terrain makes large-scale renewable projects more difficult, meaning the cost gap with conventional electricity will likely persist for some time.

The growing electricity demand for AI could also drive up rates. The Lee administration has prioritized establishing Korea as a global AI powerhouse, a goal that will require large-scale data centers — facilities with significant energy needs. In the United States, AI-related electricity demand is already affecting rates. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average household electricity rate nationwide rose by 6.5 percent between May 2024 and May 2025, from 16.41 cents to 17.47 cents per kWh. North Carolina State University predicts that by 2030, average U.S. electricity rates will rise by 8 percent due to data center demand, with tech-heavy states like Virginia seeing increases of up to 25 percent.

Still, many believe raising household electricity rates in Korea is not a simple matter. Such a move could provoke public backlash and drive inflation. The previous Yoon administration avoided the issue by raising only industrial rates.

Between 2022 and the end of last year, industrial electricity rates for high-voltage users rose to 185.5 won per kWh — a 75.8 percent jump. With prices having already surged more than 70 percent in the past three years, major energy-intensive firms are beginning to seek alternatives. In June, LG Chem started sourcing electricity directly from the Korea Power Exchange instead of Kepco. Other companies, including Lotte Chemical, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Hanwha Solutions and Korail, are considering similar moves. Alarmed by the potential exodus of its top corporate customers, Kepco has even proposed cutting industrial rates to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.

“Korea faces the difficult task of striking a policy balance between raising electricity rates and maintaining industrial competitiveness,” said Jang Woo-seok, a senior research fellow at the Hyundai Research Institute, in a June report. “Increases in industrial rates raise manufacturing costs for power-hungry industries, undermining profitability and export competitiveness.”

“Raising electricity rates is inevitable to fund infrastructure like the energy highway,” said Kang Cheon-goo, a professor at Inha University’s Graduate School of Manufacturing Innovation. “Policymakers should proceed cautiously, taking into account falling global energy prices and the sharp industrial rate hikes already implemented.”

The latest version of Victoria’s 2025 Transmission Plan,released by state government agency VicGrid on Sunday, revealed a 200,000-hectare increase in area available to developers.

The plan outlines the parts of the state designated as renewable energy zones and the new transmission infrastructure needed in the next 15 years to connect them to the grid.

The latest version takes areas of land designated as hubs for wind, solar and battery farms from the 1.66 million hectares proposed in May to 1.88 million hectares across six proposed renewable energy zones.

The amendment increases the footprint of these areas to 7.9 per cent of the state’s land area, up from 7.0 per cent in the original draft proposal, after industry feedback said larger areas were needed to make projects technically and commercially viable.

The number of distinct zones has grown from seven to nine, also in response to feedback.

The greatest change will be in the state’s west with an expansion to the Wimmera-Southern Mallee zone, while a new area around Coleraine has been added to the South West zone.

Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said more than 42 per cent of Victoria’s electricity was produced by renewables in the past financial year, with the state reaching record levels of renewable energy generation.

“Our record investment in renewable energy is paying off,” she said in a statement on Sunday.

“Victoria consistently has the lowest wholesale power prices in the country, helping to slash energy bills for families and businesses.”

Victorians paid an average wholesale price of $107 per megawatt hour, compared to $151 for NSW, $138 for South Australia, $127 for Queensland and $115 for Tasmania, according to government data.

But the latest modelling predicts the cost of connecting Victoria’s renewable energy zones could almost double.

While the government initially estimated a $4.3 billion cost, VicGrid puts the latest price tag closer to $7.9 billion, taking into account new Australian Energy Market Operator costings for the transmission lines.

The costs are expected to be largely recouped through higher consumer bills, although the government argues Victorians will overall be better off with wholesale energy costs lowered by the delivery of more renewable energy into the grid.

The solar industry received a significant boost this week as the U.S. Treasury Department provided guidance on tax credits, which is likely to benefit companies like First Solar (FSLR), Sunrun (RUN), and Sun (SUN). The announcement has sparked a rally in the stock prices of these companies.

First Solar (FSLR), the largest producer of utility-scale solar panels in the U.S., saw its shares jump 10% to $198.54. The company's vertical integration, from cell manufacturing to recycling, positions it well to benefit from the tax credit guidance. The Treasury's announcement is expected to support First Solar's ongoing capital expenditures, which are crucial for the company's expansion plans. Notably, the company's Louisiana factory is expected to reach 25GW by 2027, with a significant portion of the expansion driven by the 45X production tax credits [1].

Sunrun (RUN), a leading provider of residential solar and battery storage solutions, saw its shares surge 29% to $13.54. The company's recent operational migration to Oracle Warehouse Management Cloud and its strong performance in grid-scale battery services have positioned it well to capitalize on the tax credit guidance. Sunrun's grid event participation in California, where its battery fleet supplied the majority of distributed energy, underscores its growing influence in the home energy sector [2].

Sun (SUN), a manufacturer of solar energy systems and services, also saw its shares rise. The company's focus on innovation and its expanding portfolio of solar solutions are expected to benefit from the Treasury's tax credit guidance.

The Treasury's guidance on tax credits is expected to provide a significant boost to the solar industry, supporting the expansion and growth of companies like First Solar, Sunrun, and Sun. The tax credits are likely to enhance the financial viability of solar projects, making them more attractive to investors and developers. However, the long-term success of these companies will depend on their ability to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and maintain their competitive edge in the market.

As an investor focused on climate solutions, we are proud to partner with C3H and Equatic to help bring this breakthrough technology to commercial scale,” said James Marshall, CEO of Kibo Invest.

Equatic’s Technology

Since commencing operations in 2023, the Equatic technology has been successfully deployed at two pilot plants in Los Angeles and Singapore. The company is now expanding its operations with a demonstration plant in Singapore, known as Equatic-1, and a commercial-scale plant in Canada. In May 2024, Equatic was recognized as a CDR Purchase Prize semifinalist by the U.S. Department of Energy, acknowledging its high-quality, permanent carbon credits and rigorous Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) practices. In September 2024, Equatic announced a significant climate breakthrough with the U.S. manufacture of oxygen-selective anodes, which unlock scalable hydrogen production through direct seawater electrolysis. That same month, Equatic was named a finalist for The Earthshot Prize, a prestigious international recognition for groundbreaking solutions to repair the planet.

Equatic’s commitment to high-integrity carbon removal is underscored by its adoption of an ISO-14064 standard for MRV, first published by Equatic in May 2023. Subsequently, this standard was validated by two leading carbon removal registries, Isometric and Puro.earth, making Equatic one of the only marine companies capable of issuing high-quality CDR credits under either registry, with full transparency and auditability.

The announcement follows the Government’s decision not to provide direct funding for the bioethanol sector.
The industry had already been thrown into uncertainty after the UK signed a trade deal with the United States.
A spokesperson for ABF said: ""It is deeply regrettable that the Government has chosen not to support a key national asset.
Vivergo in Saltend and Ensus in Redcar both produce green fuel that is blended with petrol to reduce harmful emissions.","Associated British Foods has confirmed that Vivergo Fuels, the UK bioethanol plant based at Saltend, will be shutting its doors.

The announcement follows the Government’s decision not to provide direct funding for the bioethanol sector. Officials argued that such support would not represent value for taxpayers.

The industry had already been thrown into uncertainty after the UK signed a trade deal with the United States. That agreement removed the 19 per cent tariff on ethanol imports, opening the door to cheaper and less tightly regulated products from overseas. Vivergo had previously warned that without this protective barrier, it would struggle to compete.

ABF said it had invested more than £700m in Vivergo over the past decade, ""sustaining operations through extended periods of losses caused by regulatory distortions and market imbalances"".

In May, Vivergo and Ensus, which operates a plant in Redcar, jointly wrote to the Prime Minister, warning that the removal of the 19 percent tariffs on American ethanol made domestic production ""commercially unviable.""

A spokesperson for ABF said: ""It is deeply regrettable that the Government has chosen not to support a key national asset. We have been left with no choice but to announce the closure of Vivergo, and we have informed our people.

""We have been fighting for months to keep this plant open. We initiated and led talks with the Government in good faith. We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the Government's own green industrial strategy.

""In making this decision, the Government has thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber and a sovereign capability in clean fuels that had the chance to lead the world. Hugely significant investment was lined up to go into the area, from ABF and other companies. Jobs in clean energy will now move overseas – principally to the US but also to other countries with a more sensible regulatory environment.

""This plant should always have been profitable under the right regulatory environment, as similar plants in Western Europe demonstrate. The Government's own commissioned analysis spells out that Vivergo could and should be profitable under that environment.

""The loss of Vivergo will be felt most acutely by our dedicated workforce and their families and by the thousands whose livelihoods depend on our supply chain – from farmers to hauliers and engineers. We are hugely disappointed, on their behalf, that the press was informed of this decision before we were told – and before we had a chance to communicate to our staff. Our focus is now on supporting the working people at our plant in Hull.""

Ensus said it was currently exploring options to continue to supply from its facility.

Grant Pearson, chairman of Ensus UK, said: ""I met with Sarah Jones, the Minister for Business, today to receive the Government's response to our request for financial support and the policy changes required to ensure that the Ensus facilities can continue to operate. The Minister confirmed that they value both our contribution to the UK economy, the jobs we provide, and support in the North East of England, and in particular our production of biogenic CO2, which is a product of critical national importance.

""They are therefore looking at options to secure an ongoing supply of CO2 from the Ensus facility. This is positive news, however, it is likely to take time to agree upon and finalise, and therefore urgent discussions will be taking place to provide a level of assurance to the Sudzucker and CropEnergies Boards that there is a very high level of confidence that an acceptable long-term arrangement can be reached.""

At present, the UK has only two bioethanol production plants. Vivergo in Saltend and Ensus in Redcar both produce green fuel that is blended with petrol to reduce harmful emissions. Beyond fuel, Vivergo also plays a significant role in the agricultural sector. It makes animal feed and carbon dioxide, creating a vital market for approximately 150 million pounds of wheat each year. Much of this wheat comes from farms in East Yorkshire and is of a grade unsuitable for bread or pasta.

The closure will have wide-reaching consequences. Around 160 people are directly employed at the Saltend site, but the company estimates that about 4,000 additional jobs across the supply chain depend on its operations.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_dbeb6000373c4b22a4e918bc820b3671~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_dbeb6000373c4b22a4e918bc820b3671~mv2.png",N,,2025-08-17 08:00:15.681618

The company says this is the first time an American company will manufacture LFP cells and pack them domestically without a foreign joint venture.

At nearly a mile long, the site is among the largest domestic battery plants dedicated to EV production.

Production equipment used to create the final prototype cells, known as C-samples, is already operating off-site so work in the new facility can begin without delay.

Establishing US battery production

Ford's BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is purpose-built to scale up battery production in the US.

The plant’s cell facility runs 0.6 miles along the core of the site and will soon enter its next phase.

Once equipment is fully installed, the company transitions each zone into clean room status, following strict protocols.

Clean rooms are highly controlled environments designed to eliminate dust and contaminants, essential for battery production.

Floors are polished to a specific finish and the atmosphere is tightly regulated to maintain product quality.

“We remain on track to start production of these batteries next year,” says Lisa Drake, Vice President, Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems at Ford.

By manufacturing batteries domestically, Ford controls both the process and the intellectual property.

What LFP means for Ford's EV ambitions

LFP refers to lithium iron phosphate, or LiFePO4. It is a type of cathode material used in lithium-ion batteries.

This chemistry is popular for its combination of affordability, long cycle life and rapid charging capabilities.

In practice, these batteries can be charged and discharged more than 3,000 times and, in ideal conditions, more than 10,000 cycles.

Because it is safer and less expensive than other battery types, LFP has become an appealing option for electric vehicles.

Ford views this chemistry as the foundation for a cost-effective and scalable EV portfolio.

LFP batteries are not only cheaper to produce, but also improve safety and energy density while allowing for faster charging.

Ford says reducing EV costs depends on both innovation and scale.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5fe0f8e7a5175b3f5730383ad6ba7bb3:0103b409e12e810e4740c9703ef3f6ee/blue-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 04:58:41.512374

Now, a Swiss startup wants to tap it to heat and cool buildings, all without drilling a single borehole.

Globally, heating accounts for nearly half of all energy consumption. That could make decarbonizing it a half-trillion-dollar market, according to a BloombergNEF analysis. Using the Earth’s heat offers one route to cut emissions, but traditional geothermal projects can be costly and require space to operate drilling equipment, making them a poor fit for cities.

Startup Enerdrape’s system uses energy-harvesting panels in manmade underground spaces, though, which could allow it to gain a toehold in cities. The Swiss company focuses on older multifamily buildings, which are harder to decarbonize than newer builds. In New York, residential structures built before 1960 make up more than 64% of the housing stock, though not all of it is well-suited for the panels.

“There really aren’t many companies doing this,” said BNEF analyst Stephanie Diaz. “They are truly a novel approach in how to decarbonize buildings,” though the company will have to figure out how to scale its technology to work with a wide variety of buildings.

Enerdrape’s technology is the product of decades of research spearheaded by Lyesse Laloui, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Lausanne. A five-time startup founder, he’s spent the last 15 years tackling the question of how to turn underground structures into energy sources.

Initially, he created a solution for new construction, but realized that it only addressed a small part of the decarbonization puzzle compared to existing buildings. He and his team developed a prototype heat-exchanging panel in 2015.

Enerdrape’s panels affix to concrete infrastructure, which can hold large stores of heat. (Think of how hot a subway station gets in the summer, for example.) Enerdrape taps that heat using a system of prefabricated panels that absorb geothermal energy from the ground or the air. Even when underground spaces aren’t sweltering, the ground temperature, at several feet of depth, stays relatively constant throughout the year.

During the summer, Enerdrape’s system uses the underground as a heat sink to absorb a building’s heat and cool it. In the winter, it does the opposite, using the ground like a battery to warm things up.

The system requires installing one panel for roughly every 110 square feet (10 square meters) of a building’s floor area. The panels are connected to heat-transferring fluid, working in tandem with one or more heat pumps.

“Enerdrape moves heat from where it’s not needed to where it is,” co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Alessandro Rotta Loria said.

Rotta Loria, who was Laloui’s former PhD student, likened it to an underground solar panel that feeds on heat rather than the sun’s rays. Enerdrape says its panels can meet 100% of the space heating, cooling and hot water needs for buildings up to 10 stories in height.

The company, which launched in 2019, has projects across Europe, including with Switzerland’s largest retailer, Coop Immobilier, small businesses like a dental office in Spain, utilities and multiple Swiss cities.

It also teamed up with Engie, one of Europe’s largest gas and renewable energy suppliers, to provide energy to 72 homes with Paris Habitat, France’s largest affordable housing provider. Enerdrape said its 145 panels provide 70 megawatt-hours of heat per year and cover 25% of homes’ domestic hot water needs while avoiding 15 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.

Despite many urban areas setting ambitious climate goals and a growing number of residential electrification programs, few companies target affordable housing, according to a 2022 report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Decarbonizing heat first is the most cost-effective way to electrify affordable housing, the group found.

Low-income housing tends to be old buildings that are more expensive to retrofit, said Thatcher Bell, who leads climate tech accelerator The Clean Fight’s programs. High upfront cost for replacement, financial constraints and the large number of stakeholders in these buildings make operators less likely to install new technology. The accelerator selected Enerdrape for a recent cohort of startups focused on low-cost, low-construction ways to cut emissions from older units, without displacing residents. The need for those types of solutions is growing.

In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul calls for building 800,000 electrified or electrification-ready homes by 2030. New York City, meanwhile, passed a law to tackle building emissions, which account for approximately 70% of the city's carbon footprint. Similar measures in cities like Boston and Seattle have followed.

The majority of New York City residential buildings covered by the law are pre-war construction of six stories or less, according to the Urban Green Council. That provides plenty of opportunities for technology like Enerdrape’s. However, the startup faces some challenges.

Heat pump adoption is higher in parts of Europe, and Enerdrape will have to contend with slower adoption in the US due to cost. Upfront cost, which includes panel installation and heat pump connection, is typically between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on a building’s available surface area that can be activated as a heat source. Political headwinds in the US are another issue, with President Donald Trump curtailing federal support for heat pumps.

The system can cut electricity costs, though. According to the company, it can deliver energy at 3 to 4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to the average US gas price of 17 cents per kWh. Enerdrape says its solution is cheaper in Europe, where fuel costs are 3 to 5 times higher than in the US.

The system also won’t help with larger buildings, which are some of New York’s biggest energy users. “We’re not going to be able to do much” with a 60-floor high-rise, Rotta Loria said.

Elizabeth Krear, vice president of J.D. Power’s EV practice, says consumer interest in EVs reached an “all-time high” in October, with 29% of new-vehicle shoppers saying they are “very likely” to consider an EV. Last month’s retail sale rose to a record 9% of the total car market.

“With expanding product availability and ongoing market development, [market] share is expected to reach 13% by the end of 2024 and 19% by the end of 2025,” Krear continues.

Thanks to federal tax credits, incentives and carmaker price cuts, EV affordability has been improving. However, Krear says that as prices fall, consumers are trading pricing concerns for “charging anxiety.”

“Critical issues affecting the pace of adoption continue to revolve around public charging infrastructure availability; reliability; and availability and affordability of mass-market products — particularly in high-volume segments,” she explains.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.","Ford Motor Company will invest nearly US$2 billion retooling a Kentucky factory to produce electric vehicles that it says will be more affordable, more profitable to build, and will outcompete rival models.

The automaker’s top executive unveiled the new EV strategy at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant which, after producing gas-powered vehicles for 70 years, will be converted to manufacture electric vehicles.

“In our careers, as automobile people we’re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,” CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. “And I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.”

The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as the Trump administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump’s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to US$7,500 on a new electric car.

Yet Farley and other top executives in the auto industry say that electric vehicles are the future and there is no going back.

The first EV to be produced by the revamped Louisville production process will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup truck in 2027 for domestic and international markets, the company said on Monday.

The new electric trucks will feature plenty of interior space to fit five adults, and pack enough power to have a targeted ‘0 to 60’ time as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, but with more downforce, Ford said

The electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a US$3-billion investment to build the battery factory.

The automaker sees this as a “Model T moment” for its EV business – a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company’s founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will upend how electric vehicles are made in the US.

“It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,” Farley said.

The company said it will use a universal platform and production system for its EVs, essentially the underpinning of a vehicle that can be applied across a wide range of models.

The Louisville factory – one of two Ford assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city – will be revamped to cut production costs and make assembly time faster as it’s prepared to churn out electric vehicles.

The result will be “an affordable electric vehicle that we expect to be profitable”, Farley said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the announcement. “This is an example of us rejuvenating our US plants with the most modern manufacturing techniques.”

The new platform enables a line-up of affordable vehicles to be produced at scale, Ford said. It will reduce parts by 20 per cent versus a typical vehicle, with 25 per cent fewer fasteners, 40 per cent fewer workstations dock-to-dock in the plant, and a 15 per cent faster assembly time, Ford said.

The traditional assembly line will be transformed into an “assembly tree” at the Louisville plant, the company said. Instead of one long conveyor, three subassembly lines will operate simultaneously and then join together, it said.

Other specifications for the midsize electric truck – including its reveal date, starting price, EPA-estimated battery range, battery sizes and charge times – will be announced later, the company said. Farley revealed that the truck will have a targeted starting price of about US$30,000.

Ford said its investment in the Louisville plant will secure 2,200 hourly jobs.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on Monday that the automaker’s plans for the Louisville plant will strengthen a more than century-old partnership between Ford and the Bluegrass State.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state, it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the centre of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Beshear said.

Ford said its combined investment of about US$5 billion at the Kentucky assembly plant and Michigan battery plant is expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 direct jobs between the two plants, while strengthening the domestic supply chain with dozens of new United States-based suppliers.

Ford previously forecast weaker earnings growth for this year and further losses in its electric vehicles business as it works to control costs. Model e, Ford’s electric vehicle business, posted a full-year loss of US$5.08 billion for 2024 as revenue fell 35 per cent to US$3.9 billion.

Ford’s new EV strategy comes as Chinese automakers are quickly expanding across the globe, offering relatively affordable electric vehicles.

“We’re not in a race to build the most electric cars,” Farley told the AP, when asked about competition from China. “We’re in a race to have a sustainable electric business that’s profitable, that customers love.

“And this new vehicle built in Louisville, Kentucky, is going to be a much better solution to anything that anyone can buy from China,” he added.

Ford could have opted to launch its EV project overseas to reap lower-cost labour and currency advantages,but, instead, is “taking the fight to our competition” from the plant in Kentucky, Farley said at Monday’s event. But the Ford CEO cautioned that “there are no guarantees” with project.

“We’re doing so many new things, I can’t tell you with 100 per cent certainty that this will all go just right,” he said. “It is a bet. There is risk. The automotive industry has a graveyard littered with affordable vehicles that were launched in our country with all good intentions. And they fizzled out with idle plants, laid-off workers, and red ink. And at Ford ... we set out to break that cycle.”",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/08/17/3204458/8351442.jpg?itok=oDU3mCXF,N,,2025-08-17 04:00:42.465232

The government plans to expand nuclear power capacity 12-fold by 2047, and has already begun easing restrictions to allow foreign players to take minority stakes in nuclear power plants. Since the start of 2025, several measures have been rolled out to accelerate this programme, revealing the urgency with which New Delhi is pursuing atomic energy.

The government is now considering a fundamental shift: permitting private firms to mine, import, and process uranium. Such a move would end the decades-old state monopoly in the sector and potentially attract billions of dollars in private capital. If realised, nuclear energy could account for about 5 per cent of India’s total energy needs, a modest share but one that strengthens energy security.

Globally, uranium powers about 10 per cent of electricity through more than 440 reactors. It is valued for its high energy density and role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, concerns about radiation safety, waste management, and proliferation continue to cloud its adoption.

India’s uranium mining challenge

India’s uranium reserves, estimated at 76,000 tonnes, can support 10,000 megawatts of nuclear power for three decades. However, rising demand means domestic resources can only cover a quarter of the projected increase. Imports, along with expanded processing capacity, will therefore be unavoidable.

Policy Circle is now on WhatsApp. Click here to join the channel

Allowing private companies into uranium mining could ease shortages and encourage innovation. Countries like Canada, the United States, and South Africa already permit private participation in this field. India cannot achieve its nuclear targets without similar reforms, though the balance between private entry and strategic control will remain delicate.

Expanding partnerships

The dismantling of the state monopoly could also create space for foreign collaboration. India has long pursued the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, under which Washington would supply nuclear reactors. More recently, discussions with France have centred on cooperation in small modular reactors (SMRs), a promising technology for lowering costs and improving safety.

American firms such as NuScale Power, General Electric, and Westinghouse are well placed to contribute, while French expertise in SMRs adds another dimension. Together, these partnerships could strengthen India’s nuclear infrastructure and diversify its clean energy mix.

Safety and strategic concerns

Despite the economic case, the risks are real. The government has so far kept tight control over uranium mining and processing because of fears about diversion, misuse, and radiation hazards. It plans to retain authority over reprocessing spent fuel and managing plutonium waste, in line with global practice.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Any move to allow private participation will therefore require a robust regulatory framework. Discussions are underway on policies for safe mining, as well as allowing private firms to supply control systems and equipment for nuclear plants. The credibility of the programme will rest on effective regulation and transparency.

Obstacles to nuclear expansion

Beyond uranium, India’s nuclear ambitions face steep challenges. Nuclear plants are capital-intensive, with long gestation periods and frequent cost overruns. Installed capacity today is just 8,180 MW, far short of the Atomic Energy Commission’s vision of 650 GW by 2050. Public opposition, sharpened by memories of Chernobyl and Fukushima, continues to delay projects. Protests around plant sites highlight the need for greater public engagement and trust-building.

The potential of nuclear energy in helping India reach its net-zero goal is significant, but progress will depend on overcoming bottlenecks. Indigenous technologies such as pressurised heavy water reactors must be scaled up, while research into thorium-based reactors—where India has a natural advantage—needs faster development.

If reforms proceed as planned, India could unlock investments worth Rs 4–6 lakh crore ($50–70 billion) by 2035, enabling projects like Kovvada and Chhaya-Mithi Virdi to move forward. Strategic partnerships with the US and France will deepen, but New Delhi must also align its liability regime with global standards to reassure investors.

Nuclear energy will not provide the bulk of India’s electricity, but it can serve as a reliable low-carbon backbone. The challenge is to modernise the sector, balance security with openness, and build public confidence in an industry where a single failure can undermine decades of progress.",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nuke30.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:08:23.448956

Both are now sleeker, smarter and much more fun than their early-2000s selves.

Think of them as queer kickball teammates: The Leaf is the quiet nerd who’s secretly hilarious, while the Prius is the glam social butterfly who somehow knows everyone.

NISSAN LEAF

$30,000

Range: 149 to 215 miles

0 to 60 mph: 7.4 seconds

Cargo space: 23.6 cu. ft.

PROS: Cute. Maneuvers easily. Feels spacious inside.

CONS: Limited in range, charging options and cubbies.

IN A NUTSHELL: Ditching its bug-eyed looks, the latest Nissan Leaf flaunts a trendier style—not too edgy, but not bland either. You can dress this electric vehicle up in colors like Deep Blue Pearl or Scarlet Ember, making it flamboyant enough for a Pride parade. Inside, the design is practical but not frumpy: enviro-friendly fabrics, a logical layout for gauges and an interior that feels airy.

The standard Leaf S comes with a 147-horsepower electric motor and 149-mile range, while the Leaf SV Plus offers more oomph: a 214-horsepower motor and 215-mile range. Either ride is powerful enough for daily commuting or shortish weekend getaways. But while you can “fast charge” the battery pack to 80% in about 40 minutes—enough time to grab a latte and spill some gossip—the rather dated port mechanism needs an adapter for use at many of today’s charging stations.

Still, this EV feels nimble and ready to play in tight spaces. Another plus: The regenerative braking—with easygoing one-pedal driving—makes it feel like you are gently teleporting to destinations.

While a bevy of new EVs offer more range, power and features, it’s the Leaf’s low MSRP that is such a draw. This means the list of base-model amenities is solid but not overflowing: steel wheels with plastic covers, automatic headlights, remote entry and smartphone integration.

Step up to the Leaf SV Plus for larger wheels, power driver’s seat, nav system and better stereo. An app also lets you remotely cool or heat the cabin, as well as check for battery-charging time, range and even nearby stations—because nothing kills a vibe like running low on juice mid-trip.

For me, the Leaf is a low-drama, high-reliability EV. Not as flashy as some newcomers, but still able to hit all its marks.

TOYOTA PRIUS

$30,000

Mpg: 57city/56 highway

0 to 60 mph: 7.1 seconds

Cargo space: 23.8 cu. ft.

PROS: Steller fuel economy. Quicker and sexier now.

CONS: Reduced rear headroom. Bit noisy at times.

IN A NUTSHELL: Remember when the Toyota Prius was the butt of car jokes? Those days are over. The latest version is a full-on glow-up story—new look, new attitude, same eco-friendly heart. If the old Prius was sensible sandals, this one is a designer sneaker (or Prada heels, even) that still supports your arch.

Exterior colors are quite outré, such as Wind Chill Pearl, Supersonic Red and Cutting Edge—a metallic silver with a sparkling finish that changes depending on the lighting. Yep, bling!

Under the hood, the hybrid system pairs a 2.0-liter engine with two electric motors for a combined 194 horsepower (or 220 horsepower in the all-wheel-drive Prius Prime plug-in, which can go up to 44 miles on battery power alone). This Prius is quicker than any previous model and still delivers incredible fuel economy. Oh, and braking is better than ever, too.

Steering feels more responsive, the ride is composed and the lower stance means this hybrid corners with actual confidence. You won’t confuse it for a sports car, but you might just take the long way home.

Inside, the cabin is modern and minimalist, with an emphasis on clean lines and quality finishes. The digital gauge display is now front and center (finally!), and the infotainment system is quick and easy to use. Smartphone integration and a full suite of driver-assist features are standard. There’s enough room for four adults to ride comfortably, and the hatchback layout means it can swallow IKEA flat-packs without complaint.

The Prius has gone from quirky wallflower to confident main character. Efficient, practical, and unexpectedly attractive—it’s like Cinderella, who finally realized she was gorgeous all along.

Today’s SUVs are the golden retrievers of the car world: everywhere, predictable and sometimes oversized for what you really need. But for anyone who appreciates a bit more finesse, there’s something undeniably chic about a well-designed sedan.

Cue the Honda Accord and Kia K5. These two midsizers offer sleek styling, advanced tech and enough cargo space for both your gym bag and your weekend drag.

And the price? Lower than many similarly equipped crossovers, leaving money for, well, those little extras that bring us joy. Like weekend getaways. Pride merch. Or bottomless brunch.

HONDA ACCORD

$29,000

MPG: 29 city/37 highway

0 to 60 mph: 7.3 seconds

Cargo space: 16.7 cu. ft.

PROS: Dashing design. Comfy cabin. Renowned reliability.

CONS: Barebones base-model. No all-wheel drive.

IN A NUTSHELL: The latest Honda Accord has a timeless blazer-and-jeans energy: tailored and unfussy, but sharp enough to impress at a Sunday tea dance. Think Jonathan Bailey in a turtleneck.

Inside, the vibe is clean and calming. The minimalist dash, high-quality materials and solid construction feel a lot more premium than the Accord’s price suggests. And that 12.3-inch touchscreen? It finally makes Honda’s infotainment system seem less like dating in the early 2010s (clunky and confusing) and more like a seamless swipe-right experience.

The base 1.5-liter turbo-four is quiet, efficient and perfectly fine—kind of like your straight friend’s go-to Spotify playlist. But the real diva here is the hybrid setup: a 2.0-liter engine paired with two electric motors delivering faster delivery and up to 48 mpg combined. No, none of the Accord trims are going to light up the racetrack. But the overall handling is clean and crisp—agile enough for a spirited backroads drive, yet comfortable for your daily Target runs (or, let’s be real, your third Trader Joe’s visit of the week).

Inside, wireless smartphone integration comes standard. So does Google built-in, which integrates voice commands, maps and app downloads. And Honda’s driver-assist suite of safety features is like your car’s own personal guardian angel. Best of all, cabin tech is intuitive and responsive, which means fewer moments shouting, “Ugh, why is it doing that?”

Other plusses: Plenty of legroom and headroom, especially for rear-seat passengers, and a trunk larger than many competitors. As for cupholders, there are enough for everyone and their iced oat-milk lattes.

The Accord won’t necessarily get hearts racing—but maybe that’s the point. To me, this ride is the emotionally mature boyfriend of midsize sedans: refined, dependable, and secretly a little wild when the feeling is right. IOW, the car you take home to meet your chosen family.

KIA K5

$28,000

MPG: 26 city/37 highway

0 to 60 mph: 7.4 seconds

Cargo space: 16.0 cu. ft.

PROS: Snazzy styling. Plenty of power. Gizmos galore.

CONS: Reduced rear headroom. No hybrid.

IN A NUTSHELL: If the Honda Accord is an Eagle Scout, then the Kia K5 is a full-blown rebel: sharp, daring and a rule breaker. Many automakers have pulled back on producing midsize sedans, but Kia doubled down on the K5.

With a sloped-back profile, crisp creases and tiger-nose grille, this car looks like it was designed by someone who actually enjoys driving. Dramatic daytime running lights give the K5 a snarling front-end appearance, and the wide stance hints at the sporty soul beneath.

This year Kia updated the front and rear fascias on certain trims and added new wheel options. There’s also a new Sapphire Blue color that absolutely pops in sunlight. Vogue photoshoot, anyone?

Slide inside and the interior feels upscale: high-quality materials, tight panel gaps and a driver-focused dash. Higher trims bring in a 10.25-inch screen, thumping Bose stereo and even ventilated seats.

Under the hood, the base K5 comes with plenty of power for commuting and merging. But if you want real fun, opt for the GT trim.With its 2.5-liter turbo cranking out 290 horsepower, the GT rockets to 60 mph in just 5.5 seconds. A dual-clutch transmission operates like in a real sportscar, and paddle shifters keep you in control. (Bonus: The GT gets launch control. Yes, on a Kia sedan!)

The suspension is firmer than the Honda Accord, especially in the GT, but never harsh. The payoff: confident handling and a car that feels dialed-in at highway speeds. And AWD? It’s available—though, oddly, not on the GT.

While the K5 seats five comfortably, the sexy coupe-like roof makes backseat headroom a bit tight for taller passengers. Trunk space is decent, though, and the rear seats fold down to make space for skis, IKEA runs or emergency drum kits.

Sleek, tech-savvy and surprisingly athletic: The K5 is a four-door statement for drivers who don’t want to disappear into a sea of crossovers. You know, the cool kid of midsize sedans.

“Drop the top, baby!… Drop the pedal and go!”So croons Aretha Franklin in “Freeway of Love,” her classic song about a joyride in a pink Cadillac convertible.

Those free-spirited lyrics came to mind recently each time I got behind the wheel of an equally exquisite ride: the Mercedes CLE 450.

MERCEDES CLE 450 CONVERTIBLE

$76,000

MPG: 23 city/32 highway

0 to 60 mph: 4.2 seconds

Cargo space: 9.6 cu. ft.

PROS: Dreamy design. Divine handling. Dazzling amenities.

CONS: Cramped cargo area. Kinda impractical for everyday driving.

IN A NUTSHELL: Who needs two fine open-top chariots when one fabulous convertible will do? That seems to be the thinking at Mercedes, which recently replaced two of its cabriolets—the compact C-Class and midsize E-Class—with the brand-new CLE 450.

While the wheelbase is a wee bit shorter than on the outgoing E-Class model, the CLE is longer overall than either of its two former siblings. The result: more legroom than expected, especially for anyone in the front seats. Even backseat occupants may feel comfy (OK, perhaps not Brittney Griner or Carl Nassib, but still…).

Alas, trunk space is slightly scrunched, thanks to the folding fabric roof. But that power-operated top—available in black, gray or red—can be raised and lowered with the car traveling at speeds up to 37 mph. And the triple-layer acoustic material provides excellent insulation and greatly reduces outside noise. In fact, I often had to remind myself this was the CLE convertible and not the hardtop coupe.

There’s also a wind-deflector apparatus that, when activated, elevates airflow off the windshield and reduces backflow with a rear mesh screen. For added pampering, an AIRSCARF system lives up to its name, sending warm air onto the necks of front-seat passengers. (Don’t tell my husband, but I felt like an invisible suitor was wooing me, seductively blowing kisses my way.)

Convertibles usually are not as structurally rigid as their hardtop counterparts. But here again, Mercedes works its magic: The chassis—made of aluminum and high-strength steel—is so incredibly stiff that there’s absolutely no shake and shimmy. This solid body structure also provides for a safe vehicle shell.

Under the hood, there’s a spirited 375-hp turbo engine, augmented by grippy all-wheel drive and a graceful nine-speed automatic transmission. As a crazed soccer fan, I think it’s not too much of a stretch to say the driving experience combines the speed, sass and savvy of a star athlete (think Megan Rapinoe).

Inside, there are plenty of premium styling cues, as well a glitzy dashboard with 12.3-inch digital cluster and 11.9-inch multimedia touchscreen. Yes, the CLE borrows heavily from the C-Class and E-Class. But somehow—perhaps because of the low ground clearance and multi-contour seats (which include heating, ventilation and massage functions)—this cabin feels and functions more like a true cockpit.

Along with all the driver-assistance features, there are 11 airbags (including rear head airbags), pop-up roll bars and a drowsy-driver alert monitor. In case of an impending crash, an accident-preparedness system immediately tightens seatbelts, adjusts seats and closes windows.

I could go on about all the amenities, including a 17-speaker Burmester surround-sound stereo, the 64-color ambient-lighting system and more. But why bother? This is a Mercedes, after all, so you expect such babying.

What wasn’t expected? How much I keep missing this beauty after my weeklong test drive ended. It’s not as if soft-tops are practical, like minivans and SUVs. And two-door rides—coupes or cabrios—now account for less than 4% of all new-vehicle sales.

But Aretha would have understood. Classy convertibles, like her pink Caddy and the Mercedes CLE 450, represent open-air freedom and the promise of adventure.

“So jump in, it ain’t no sin. Take a ride in my machine.”

It’s official: Tariffs are here, and the result is financial chaos.

So, what to do when purchasing a new vehicle? If you need one in the not-so-distant future, buy sooner (like yesterday) rather than later. Expect prices to rise quickly, as inventory dwindles, demand soars, and automaker incentives evaporate. Of course, if a new ride isn’t a priority for at least a year or three, then hold off until the dust settles.

But for those of you looking for new wheels now, I recently drove two sport sedans that were a pleasant reprieve from the usual plethora of pickups, minivans, and SUVs.

BMW 530i xDRIVE

$63,000

MPG: 28 city/35 highway

0 to 60 mph: 5.5 seconds

Cargo space: 18.4 cu. ft.

PROS: Rakish looks. Race-car vibe. Rock-star amenities.

CONS: Rad-but-quirky infotainment system. Rich price.

IN A NUTSHELL: Classic good looks, from the iconic grille and swept-back headlights to chiseled side panels and a tasteful tush. For a gearhead like me, the BMW 530i xDrive — completely redesigned last year — is as rapturous as Michelangelo’s David. Everything here is in proportion, from the design to the drivetrain, which — along with a gutsy 255-hp turbo and all-wheel drive — helps deliver a divine experience behind the wheel. Even better, my test car came equipped with the heavenly M-Sport Package: 21-inch wheels, athletic suspension, and assorted styling upgrades.

A tech-laden cabin is outfitted with a sparkly 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 14.9-inch touchscreen infotainment system. With the windshield head-up display and a slew of knobs and toggle switches in the center console and on the steering wheel, I wondered if this is how it feels to pilot the Space Shuttle. There is even a back-lit interaction bar with touch-sensitive controls to adjust vent direction and other climate control settings.

All this gadgetry takes some getting used to, but the overall effect is dazzling. While a 12-speaker Harman Kardon stereo comes standard, I was jammin’ to the 16-speaker Bowers & Wilkins premium audio. Of course, such options add up quickly (on my test car, the extras totaled $13,000).

Just how fun is this car? In my favorite episode of “Hacks,” sassy Jean Smart drives a rockin’ Rolls Royce Wraith. Trust me, this four-door BMW is every bit the badass as that $300,000 super coupe.

MERCEDES AMG CLA 35

$58,000

MPG: 22 city/29 highway

0 to 60 mph: 4.8 seconds

Cargo space: 11.6 cu. ft.

PROS: Slick styling. Spiffy cabin. Sublime seats.

CONS: Smallish trunk. So-so rear headroom and legroom.

IN A NUTSHELL: Need a smaller sedan that’s just as marvy as the midsize BMW i530? Look no further than the compact Mercedes CLA-Class, which is 14 inches shorter. That’s a benefit when jockeying for parking or navigating rush hour.

Another plus: This is Mercedes’s least expensive sedan, available in three trim levels. All come with the same potent turbo but in varying power levels. The base model starts at $46,000, but I tested the first of two high-performance versions: the AMG CLA 35, which costs $12,000 more. You can open your wallet even further to snag the $67,000 AMG CLA 45.

But why bother? The AMG CLA 35 is plenty quick — faster than the BMW i530 — and boasts sport-tuned brakes, deft handling and a gritty-sounding exhaust system. The laundry list of standard features includes all-wheel drive, automated parking, gobs of the latest safety gizmos and even something called “safe-exit assist,” which prevents passengers from opening a door into traffic or speeding cyclists.

The interior is pure Mercedes, with top-notch materials, customizable ambient lighting and Burmester surround-sound audio. The overall layout—sleek and modern, but with elegant stitching in the seats and on the door panels and dashboard—is comfortable and user-friendly. Digital displays and touchscreens are similar to what’s in the BMW i530, just smaller.

Size matters, of course, which is why this vehicle’s shorter length can be a blessing but also a curse, especially when trying to squeeze passengers with longer legs into the backseats. And the dramatically sloped roofline, attractive from the outside, limits the amount of rear headroom and cargo space. Thank the automotive gods for panoramic sunroofs, which—at least for anyone in the front seats—makes this cabin feel surprisingly spacious.

Looking to roll into something new? With all the buzz about 25% tariffs, it’s the perfect time to grab a new ride before prices soar—especially for electric vehicles, which may soon wave goodbye to those oh-so-attractive federal tax credits. Whether you are an eco-conscious commuter or just need a chariot for weekend getaways, these three green machines offer some serious swagger.

FORD MUSTANG MACH-E PREMIUM

$42,000

Range: 250-300 miles (depending on battery pack)

0 to 60 mph: 5.2 seconds

Cargo space: 29.7 cu. ft.

PROS: Zippy. Sporty feel. Ample battery range.

CONS: Bit bumpy over potholes. Limited seat adjustments.

IN A NUTSHELL: With sleek curves and a design that’s hotter than a drag queen’s heels on the runway, the Ford Mustang Mach-E blends both power and flair. The exterior colors are vibrant and unapologetically bold, just like the rainbow after a storm. Three trim levels, but opt for the spiffy Premium version—which was what I drove and is a nice step up from the $37,000 base model. It also costs a lot less than the gutsy GT, which tops $55,000.

Inside, the Mach-E is like driving a chic lounge on wheels. Toggling through the 15.5-inch touchscreen feels like navigating through the latest TikTok trends. A panoramic glass roof and faux-leather upholstery come standard, but assorted add-ons—standard features with the Premium trim—include hands-free power liftgate, multicolor ambient lighting and 10-speaker Bang & Olufsen stereo. There’s also plenty of space for all the essentials: totes, coats and besties.

And let’s not forget about battery range—there’s enough juice here to take you through a whole day of driving without needing a recharge. With Ford’s fast-charging network, it’s easy to be powered up quicker than you can say, “Ride ‘em, cowboy!” Well, almost.

How popular is this EV, which looks more like a hot hatchback than an SUV? Last year, sales spiked 27% and outsold the iconic gas-powered Mustang. So yes, the Mach-E Premium isn’t just any vehicle—it’s an experience that’s, well, electric.

KIA SPORTAGE PHEV X-LINE PRESTIGE

$44,000

MPGe: 84 city/highway combined

0 to 60 mph: 7.1 seconds

Cargo space: 39.6 cu. ft.

PROS: Comfy. Comely cabin. Oodles of passenger room.

CONS: Clunky dual-use dashboard controls. Bit noisy interior.

IN A NUTSHELL: Next up: the 2025 Kia Sportage PHEV X-Line Prestige, a compact plug-in hybrid that combines style, strength and versatility into one dazzling package. If the Mach-E Premium is a glam EV star, I found the Sportage PHEV to be an SUV showstopper.

Under the hood, power comes from an electric motor and gas-powered backup, so you get the best of both worlds—whether cruising on green energy or unleashing your inner diva. The all-electric range is almost 35 miles, and all-wheel drive is standard—which helps keep things steady, no matter the weather.

Inside, it’s pure comfort. While there are two hybrid trim levels, even the base-model—the X-Line—is fairly loaded: LED headlights/taillights, dual-zone automatic climate control, remote start, power liftgate, nav system, wireless charging pad, smartphone integration and more.

For my weeklong test vehicle, I was spoiled with the X-Line Prestige, which is full of a ridiculous number of amenities and safety gear. Let’s just say the clever cabin design would make the folks at Ferrari blush. Oh, and thanks to the pristine acoustics from the Harmon Kardon audio, I could have sworn the cast of “Hamilton” was right there with me belting out each tune. “Blow Us All Away,” indeed.

MERCEDES AMG C 63 S E

$87,000

MPGe: 40 city/highway combined

0 to 60 mph: 3.3 seconds

Cargo space: 11.6 cu. ft.

PROS: Snazzy. Lightning fast. Haute handling.

CONS: Pricey. Quirky steering-wheel controls.

IN A NUTSHELL: Jonesing for an exciting, eco-friendly sedan? Then look no further than the Mercedes AMG C 63 S E plug-in hybrid, which gets the adrenaline pumping each time you slip behind the wheel.

Under the hood, there’s a staggering 671 horsepower—enough to leave competitors in the dust and make them more than a little jealous. This AMG-tuned Mercedes—the quickest C-Class ever—blasts from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds, faster than your heart rate when seeing your next crush at a circuit party. And that’s not even the best part—the shapely contours of this sportster are as chiseled as Luke Evans’ check bones.

Inside, the cockpit is like a designer outfit made for a fab night out—high-quality material everywhere, as well as branded sport seats with top-tier upholstery and stitching. One downside: the steering-wheel controls, which look tasteful but can be a tad too touch-sensitive at times.

Still, this elegant ride exudes more than enough bells and whistles to maintain a constant state of euphoria.

Not too basic, not too complicated. That’s what I enjoyed most about three spiffy SUVs recently. Call it the Goldilocks effect, but each ride—two Mercedes and a Mini Countryman—seemed just right. That’s a big plus in today’s world of extremes.

MERCEDES AMG GLA 35

$59,000

MPG: 22 city/28 highway

0 to 60 mph: 4.7 seconds

Cargo space: 15.4 cu. ft.

PROS: Affordable luxury, smooth suspension, zippy.

CONS: Bit noisy inside, so-so storage, costly options.

IN A NUTSHELL: The subcompact GLA—the most affordable Mercedes sold in the U.S.—comes in two trim levels. With the average price of a vehicle topping $48,000, the base-model GLA 250 is a bargain at $43,000. On paper, the stats for acceleration, handling and braking look spot on. Ditto the fine amenities, including faux-leather seats, ambient lighting, wireless charging pad and power liftgate. Toss in numerous safety features—including forward-collision warning, blind-spot alert, an automated parking system—and what could be better? The answer is the sport-tuned AMG GLA 35, which is the vehicle I tested. Zippier, grippier and ritzier than its entry-level sibling, this saucy SUV is also pricier. And beware: The long list of options—such as head-up display, surround-view camera, illuminated door sills—can add up quickly. But oh, what a thrill. Stomp on the accelerator, and the GLA 35 scoots from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.7 seconds—a full two seconds quicker than the GLA 250. Along with a more powerful engine and all-wheel drive, there’s now a 48-volt hybrid-assist system. The GLC 35 also flaunts aggressive styling, including a sexy rear spoiler, large dual exhaust tips and bigger wheels. Fave feature: the flat-bottom, performance-oriented steering wheel with spiffy paddle shifters and a panoply of user-friendly buttons and dials.

MERCEDES AMG GLC 43 COUPE

$70,000

MPG: 18 city/24 highway

0 to 60 mph: 4.7 seconds

Cargo space: 19.2 cu. ft.

PROS: Posh styling, potent power, quiet cabin.

CONS: Pricey, limited rear visibility, reduced cargo room.

IN A NUTSHELL: Stepping up from the baby Mercedes GLA, the larger GLC—though technically a compact—is 12 inches longer. What’s more, this hauler comes with choice of five trim levels. And you can choose from either a traditional square-back design or sloped coupe-like styling. Confused? Don’t be. Just trust that the AMG GLC 43 Coupe, which is really an SUV, checks all the boxes. There’s plenty of drama here, with a bulging snout and sinuous shape that any diva would love. There’s also plenty of power, with a gritty turbo that allows the GLC to accelerate just as fast as the much lighter GLA. And the interior is stunning: NASCAR-like bucket seats, gigantic infotainment touchscreen and reinforced window glass to better insulate the cabin. A clever nav system can project traffic and other info onto the head-up display on the windshield, and rear automatic braking helps anticipate and prevent a back-end collision. Sure, the low-slung roofline cuts into rear-seat headroom and cargo space. But for me, the sacrifice was worth it. After all, it’s hard to imagine any other glam-but-gutsy ride equally at home on a fashion runway or at the racetrack.

MINI COUNTRYMAN ALL4

$40,000

MPG: 24 city/32 highway

0 to 60 mph: 5.9 seconds

Cargo space: 24.9 cu. ft.

PROS: Bigger, faster, better.

CONS: Almost too big, bit less playful, higher MSRP.

IN A NUTSHELL: Fully redesigned for 2025, the Mini Countryman enjoys a slew of up-market changes but retains some of its retro quirks. Larger than before, this latest model—with so much extra room for passengers and cargo—feels comfy and spacious. Almost too much so. At first blush, I was reminded of a Subaru Forester or Outback. Both fine vehicles, but without that familiar Mini vibe. Luckily, the steering wheel, head-up display and large Frisbee-shaped infotainment display all channel the previous Countryman. Ditto the overall exterior, which now boasts a redesigned grille, sleeker headlights and refined rear treatment. Yet I missed seeing all the toggle switches and some other playful touches. In their place, though, is a groovy dashboard with nifty LED lighting that changes colors based on the driving mode. While some digital readouts initially seemed too techy, they ended up being very user friendly. And there are two standout features: a huge panoramic moonroof and the use of sustainable materials for the carpeting, seats and such.

Electric vehicles are charging ahead, despite recent saber rattling by politicians. After testing a bevy of EVs, the rides below certainly got my motor running.

BMW iX (midsize SUV)

Price: $89,000-$113,000

Range: 288 to 324 miles

0 to 60 mph: 4.0 seconds

Cargo space: 35.5 cu. ft.

WHAT’S TO LIKE: Fun styling. Funky steering wheel. Floating center console. Oh, and cameras, radar and other sensors hidden in the grille, which has a special coating to magically erase minor scratches and dings. I was blown away when the BMW iX debuted in 2022. Three years later, the thrill is still there. Acceleration, cornering and braking? All breathtaking, in both the base model xDrive50 and high-test M60. Gizmos now include eye-tracking software so you can change lanes simply by glancing toward one of the side-view mirrors. An expansive digital monitor above the dash holds both a 14.9-inch infotainment display and 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. And many materials — such as carpet and floor mats — are recycled. A truly eclectic electric? You bet.

CADILLAC LYRIQ (midsize SUV)

Price: $60,000-$70,000

Range: 314 miles

0 to 60 mph: 5.7 seconds

Cargo space: 28.0 cu. ft.

WHAT’S TO LIKE: If a BMW iX is cutting edge (say, like “Transformers One”), then a Cadillac Lyriq is old-school cool (a la “Deadpool & Wolverine”). Handsome design. Familiar feel. Quiet cabin. Handling is more affable than athletic. Ditto the acceleration. The land-yacht aura extends to the seats, which are cushy instead of taut. For older — er, more mature — drivers, this is a plus. But there’s plenty of tech here, too: 33-inch digital display, tri-zone climate control, hands-free driving, wireless charging pad and so on. When first sliding behind the wheel, I wished the navigation/infotainment interface was more intuitive. But a stellar voice-assistant system more than made up for it.

KIA EV 9 (large SUV)

Price: $57,000-$76,000

Range: 230 to 304 miles

0 to 60 mph: 4.9 seconds

Cargo space: 20.2 cu. ft.

WHAT’S TO LIKE: A cyborg in the city? With Robocop styling and Tron-like finesse, the Kia EV9 looks and feels out of this world. Three-row seating, with scads of passenger room. Lowering all the rear seats expands cargo capacity to fit more than 15 suitcases. And unlike most EVs, the EV9 can tow up to 5,000 pounds. Yet the hulky hauler behaves like a nimble ninja, easily darting in and out of traffic. At almost 6,000 pounds, the King Kong Kia is three tons of fun —literally. There are so many creature comforts — self-leveling suspension, ambient lighting, massage seats, rear-window shades, 14-speaker Meridian audio—you would think this was a Range Rover.

MERCEDES EQE (midsize SUV)

Price: $80,000-$110,000

Range: 265 to 307 miles

0 to 60 mph: 5.6 seconds

Cargo space: 14.0 cu. ft.

WHAT’S TO LIKE: Luxury is as luxury does and Mercedes does luxury well. With a dashing design, silken ride and hushed interior, the EQE sets a high bar. Four trim levels, including the awe-inspiring AMG with 617 horsepower. Everything is state-of-the-art: powertrains, suspension, safety, multipixel headlights, cabin air purifier, Burmeister stereo and more. An augmented-reality nav system monitors traffic, weather and such, then conveys this info into graphic overlays on the head-up display. And the standard faux leather seats? They look and feel like the real thing. One downside: minimal cargo space. But then, there’s always a full-size EQS topping out at $180,000.

NISSAN ARIYA (compact SUV)

Price: $40,000-$56,000

Range: 205 to 289 miles

0 to 60 mph: 7.5 seconds

Cargo space: 22.8 cu. ft.

WHAT’S TO LIKE: Cute, compact, comfy. It’s easy to like a Nissan Ariya, with its cheeky exterior, composed handling and low price. Choice of two battery packs, as well as two-wheel or all-wheel drive. Base-model pricing is hard to beat, but beware the tradeoffs: pokey acceleration and reduced range. Luckily, the other trim levels offer more oomph. All Ariyas come loaded: LED headlights, heated steering wheel, heated front/rear seats, nav system, head-up display and lots of safety gear. Notable options: panoramic sunroof, hands-free liftgate, limited hands-free cruise control, automated parking and illuminated kick plates. Overall, I found the ride smooth, though not sporty. Racing mavens may want to look elsewhere, but it’ll cost you.

SUBARU SOLTERRA(compact SUV)

Price: $40,000-$47,000

Range: 222 to 227 miles

0 to 60 mph: 6.1 seconds

Cargo space: 27.7 cu. ft.

WHAT’S TO LIKE: The first EV from Subaru — the Solterra — boasts origami-like flair. Built in tandem with the quirkily named Toyota bZ4X, both SUVs fall a bit short in battery range —less than 230 miles. But the Solterra comes standard with all-wheel drive, roof rails and front cross-traffic alert. Plus, it now has faster charging times, as well as hands-free driving at up to 25 mph and an automatic lane-changing system used in conjunction with the turn signal. While not a true off-roader, this “Subie” has above-average ground clearance — 8.3 inches — to better tackle snow and potholes. And I liked all the storage compartments, along with dual-level cargo floor to fit extra luggage.

I’ve written before about my first car: a used-but-pristine sports coupe, bought by mom for my 16th birthday. Recent test drives in two cool coupes brought back a flood of fond memories from those gawky teenage years.

But while a two-door ride may not be the most practical vehicle for a decades-older me, it’s easy to appreciate the fast-and-furious allure.

After all, buying a sports car is often associated with a midlife crisis. So who knows, there still may be room—or vroom!—for a sportster in my future.

FORD MUSTANG ECOBOOST

$33,000

MPG: 22 city/33 highway

0 to 60 mph: 5.6 seconds

Cargo space: 13.5 cubic feet

PROS: Muscle-car moxie. Surefire handling. Tech-laden cabin.

CONS: Snug backseat. Pricey options. Intra-model competition.

IN A NUTSHELL: Introduced in 1964, Ford hoped to sell 100,000 Mustangs annually. But by tapping into the Boomer zeitgeist, almost 700,000 units were sold the first model year. Mustang is now the automaker’s longest running nameplate and the best-selling sports car in the world.

This was the original “pony car,” with a high-test engine, long hood and affordable price tag. Luckily, the latest Mustang — recently redesigned and in its seventh generation — has stayed true to its roots.

So, too, has the EcoBoost engine. Developed 15 years ago as a more enviro-friendly powerplant, these turbos often have been used on base models. The latest EcoBoosts — there are more than half a dozen — are 20% more fuel efficient and produce 15% fewer emissions than other Ford engines. And while the original could barely eke out 122 horsepower, today’s four-cylinder EcoBoost in the Mustang delivers 315 horsepower.

The only bummer: no manual transmission. For that, you need to dig deeper into your wallet — much deeper. The Mustang GT, with a 486-horsepower V6, costs $50,000. And the boffo Dark Horse trim level, boasting a 500-horsepower V8, is $62,000. These MSRPs are without any options, which add up quickly.

But the Mustang EcoBoost still offers plenty of features: LED headlights, keyless entry, smartphone integration and Wi-Fi hotspot. Various driving aids—blind-spot monitor, rear-parking sensors, lane-keeping assist, forward collision warning with automatic braking—are all standard.

The stodgy interior has been replaced with a mod, techno cabin with better upholstery and soft-touch surfaces. Various configurations of the digital instrument panel can be viewed at the whim of the driver. And the larger, 13.2-inch infotainment screen is user-friendly.

Such upgrades remind me of the Mustang Mach-E. Though purists initially derided the use of the Mustang label on a four-door electric SUV, the Mach-E was the fourth best-selling EV last year. Similar in price and acceleration to a traditional gas-powered ‘Stang, the Mach-E is arguably just as fun. But add in the retro-cool factor, and there’s no comparison.

SUBARU BRZ

$33,000

MPG: 20 city/27 highway

0 to 60 mph: 6.6 seconds

Cargo space: 6.3 cubic feet

PROS: Sporty. Zippy. Fits anywhere.

CONS: Low ground clearance. Bouncy. Tiny trunk.

IN A NUTSHELL: The Subaru BRZ may not have the aura of a Ford Mustang, but this compact coupe still checks plenty of boxes.

Porsche-like styling. Precision steering. Punchy power. Even pricing is a plus, with a top trim level less than $37,000.

Despite Lilliputian dimensions — the BRZ is a third smaller than a Mustang — there’s still more passenger room than in the rival Miata. As a tallish driver, I appreciated the unexpected amount of headroom and legroom in the front seats.

But trunk space is another matter. With less than half the stowage space of a Mustang, don’t expect to haul more than a few grocery bags. And while you literally have to climb into certain jumbo SUVs and pickups, the opposite is true with the low-slung BRZ. These seats are so close to the chassis that it feels like sitting in a go-kart. Luckily, once I scooched myself down into the cabin, it didn’t take long to get used to the seating position.

Three trim levels, all with rear-wheel drive, dual-zone climate control, push-button start and Subaru’s renowned EyeSight package: adaptive cruise control, automatic high-beam headlights, lane-departure warning and automatic emergency braking. Step up to the Limited version for larger wheels, heated seats, fancier upholstery, extra safety gear and a better sound system. The performance-oriented tS comes with sport-tuned suspension, premium Brembo brakes, dark gray metallic wheels and sporty interior stitching.

Only one engine is available: a very capable 228-horsepower four cylinder. My test car also came with the six-speed manual transmission, which added more gusto.

With such a short wheelbase, the ride is firm but controlled. And keeping weight down on the BRZ must have meant installing less insulation. After all, there’s some noticeable road noise, especially on the freeway. But then, you also hear the constant purring and revving of the engine, which is music to the ears of sports-car aficionados.

I’m a bit of a size queen when it comes to electric vehicles. After all, the bigger the battery pack, the lower the range anxiety. And EVs — with no engine or other components found on traditional gas models — can flaunt their larger cabins. Most EVs also deliver lickety-split acceleration, which can boost the size of any ego.

I recently test drove two David and Goliath EVs: one an itty-bitty roadster and the other a behemoth pickup.

So which was better? In the end, the answer was a matter of size.

MINI COOPER COUPE EV

$31,000

Range: 114 miles

Fastest charging time: 103 miles in 30 minutes (80% charged)

0-to-60 mph: 6.9 seconds

Cargo capacity: 8.7 cu. ft.

PROS: Quick. Nimble. Fun.

CONS: Battery range. Low chassis. Limited storage.

IN A NUTSHELL: With kicky styling, perky engines and quirky interiors, a Mini Cooper always makes me smile. The EV coupe is no exception, with funky yellow accents on the wheels, badging and side mirrors to distinguish this car from a typical Mini.

For such a compact car, there’s ample headroom and legroom. But cargo space is tight. Luckily, lowering the back seats triples the stowage area.

Up front in the Euro-chic cabin, there are plenty of retro toggle switches and tasteful chrome accents. As with other EVs, a digital readout indicates the exact time the vehicle will be fully charged. The nav system, which displays a “range circle” to show how far the Mini can go without running out of juice, also maps out the best “green” route to travel. That’s a nice touch, because the driving range here is only 114 miles. Luckily, the regenerative braking system is extra-grippy to help conserve energy. And by just barely lifting your foot off the accelerator, this coupe slows so dramatically that you only need to brake when coming to a full stop.

Best of all, handling is exceptional. Despite the low ground clearance — just 5.6 inches — the Mini Cooper easily handles speed bumps and torn up roads. And during my daily commute, this go-kart wannabe easily scooted through a sea of overbearing semis and SUVs on the Beltway.

Overall, the Mini Cooper EV is affordable and fits anywhere. It may even put a smile on your face.

FORD F-150 LIGHTNING

$58,000

Range: 240-320 miles

Fastest charging time: 201 miles in 42 minutes (80% charged)

0-to-60 mph: 4.1 seconds

Cargo capacity: 52.8 cu. ft.

PROS: Lightning fast. Sedan-like comfort. Super storage.

CONS: Pricey trims. Increased competition. Towing saps the battery.

IN A NUTSHELL: Compared with a Mini Cooper EV, the Ford F-150 Lightning is a Maximus chariot. At 19 feet long and more than six feet tall, this pickup is seven feet longer and two feet taller than the miniscule coupe. The Lightning also weighs 6,000-plus pounds, which makes it three times heavier than the Mini. And the Lightning’s towing capacity — at up to 10,000 pounds — is four times greater.

Despite the gargantuan proportions, this Herculean beast rides and handles like a lithe sedan. No, the Lightning is not as nimble as a spritely Mini, but it’s surprisingly close — especially for a hauler with land-yacht proportions.

A fave feature: major storage space, including two glove boxes, an acres-long truck bed, a huge center console, and a frunk that can hold almost twice as much gear as the rear cargo bay in a Mini Cooper. The funky frunk is also water-resistant, drainable, lockable and has four 120-volt outlets and two USB chargers. There’s even an emergency release latch, just like in a standard trunk. Coolest of all, with just two taps to the key fob, the frunk’s lid opens and closes electronically—which makes the Lightning look like some sort of Leviathan sea monster.

Power comes from two electric motors configured to provide standard all-wheel drive. Add in the extended-range battery for more horsepower and torque, and the Lightning lives up to its Thor-like bona fides. Such wickedly fast acceleration is thrilling and, frankly, a bit scary.

Inside, the well-insulated cabin boasts many fine options, including max-recline seats, hands-free driving system, Bang & Olufsen premium stereo, twin-panel moonroof and a 15-inch infotainment screen that looks and behaves like an iPad.

When it comes to size, the Lightning is larger, faster and full of more storage space than a Mini Cooper. Yet the coupe costs half as much and is a better urban adventurer. It also seems a bit more practical, at least in the city.

Small versus large? It all depends on which size fits you best.

While the Fourth of July may be over, other fireworks continue with two bangin’ rides: the Ford Maverick pickup and Subaru Crosstrek SUV. Both are affordable compacts, though neither can be considered barebones and each vehicle offers some fresh surprises.

FORD MAVERICK LARIAT

$35,000

MPG: 22 city/29 highway

0-to-60 mph: 5.9 seconds

Cargo capacity: 33.3 cu. ft.

PROS: Very low price. Peppy. Lotsa storage.

CONS: Spartan base model. Bumpy ride. Pricey options.

IN A NUTSHELL: When I wrote a few years ago about the Ford Maverick, which was replacing the long-time Ranger, it was a pleasant surprise to learn this new pickup came standard as a hybrid. Such fuel efficiency—42 mpg in the city, 33 mpg on the highway—is still impressive. But this year Ford switched the Maverick’s powertrain availability, which means the hybrid is now a $1,500 option and the more powerful turbo engine comes standard. That’s a downer for fuel-conscious buyers, but a plus for anyone seeking more oomph under the hood.

Hybrid or no, the starting price of a base-model Maverick is still low: less than $25,000. This makes it the least expensive compact pickup out there. Available only as a four-door crew cab, there’s plenty of passenger and cargo room.The low-slung truck bed—which can carry cargo up to 1,500 pounds—makes loading and unloading easy. And despite its small size, this tough hauler can tow up to 4,000 pounds. Built on the same platform as two popular Ford SUVs—the Escape and Bronco Sport—the Maverick boasts handling more like a sedate sedan than a stiff truck. Well, at least that’s the case on the freeway. In town, the ride is bumpier than expected over potholes and such.

Three trim levels available: XL, XLT and high-end Lariat, which is what I test drove for a week. The XL is basic—with 17-inch steel wheels, cloth seats and a six-speaker stereo—while the XLT adds alloy wheels, power-locking tailgate and a rear armrest with cupholders. But the Lariat offers unexpected amenities, such as keyless entry, push-button start, synthetic leather upholstery, power-sliding rear window, heated seats, heated steering wheel, wireless charging pad and eight-speaker Bang & Olufsen stereo.

All Mavericks come with forward collision warning that automatically applies braking when necessary. But the Lariat adds adaptive cruise control, rear parking sensors, blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, and evasive steering that kicks in to help avoid collisions.

For all you alphas, there’s a Tremor Off-Road package, which adds rough-and-rugged features like elevated ground clearance, advanced four-wheel drive, skid plates, off-road suspension, locking rear differential, all-terrain tires, full-size spare, and more aggressive styling and badging.

Alas, such options add up and can bump the sticker price close to $45,000.

SUBARU CROSSTREK WILDERNESS

$34,000

MPG: 25 city/29 highway

0-to-60 mph: 8.5 seconds

Cargo capacity: 20 cu. ft.

PROS: Off-road capability. Roomy. Comfy seats.

CONS: Plasticky interior. Bit noisy cabin. No speed demon.

IN A NUTSHELL: Subaru has its own maverick in the showroom: the tiny-but-mighty Crosstrek. Redesigned for 2024, the Crosstrek retains much of its quirky styling and adept handling. That’s a good thing, considering how hot this SUV has been the past few years.

There’s also a brand-new trim level: the Wilderness. While I was already a big fan of the Crosstrek, the Wilderness ratchets things up a lot.

Except for the BRZ sports car, all Subarus come standard with all-wheel drive. Yet the off-road prowess of the Crosstrek Wilderness is enhanced by front skid plate, extra drive modes, a tighter suspension and higher ground clearance (9.3 inches versus 8.6 inches on other Crosstreks). No, this is not a Jeep Wrangler or Toyota Land Cruiser, but the Wilderness is no slouch when tackling rutty roads or sandy terrain.

As for looks, the rugged styling includes hexagonal fog lights, 17-inch black alloy wheels with thick treads, black front and rear bumpers, and black cladding on the wheel arches to protect against scrapes. Faux copper accents—especially on the roof rack and steering wheel—signal that this is not your average Crosstrek.

With the back seats down, cargo space in all Crosstreks is 55 cubic feet (an impressive two-and-a-half times the area when the seats are up). As for towing, standard Crosstrek models can haul an impressive 1,500 pounds. But the Wilderness can tow even more—a whopping 3,500 pounds.

Inside, the high roofline makes the cabin feel surprisingly large. The gauges and displays—functional but not glitzy—are the same across the Crosstrek lineup. Notable options include power moonroof, 10-way power driver’s seat and 10-speaker Harmon Kardon audio.

The main difference between the Wilderness and other Crosstrek trims are the comfortable, water-resistant seats (made of synthetic leather upholstery) and the rubber floor mats emblazoned with the Wilderness logo.

All in all, this Crosstrek turned out to be a practical urban ride that also brought out my inner Paul Bunyan on weekends.

Sometimes it’s good to be a fairy godmother. That’s how it was for me when organizing a surprise dinner party for my husband Robert, who was celebrating a milestone birthday.

Event planning isn’t my thing, yet somehow the stars aligned. It seemed like all I had to do was wave a wand and — voila! — the magic began.

Make reservations at a fave intimate restaurant, which often gets booked months in advance? Zing! Ensure that family and childhood friends from across the country could all attend the same weekend? Zing! Find a handsome pianist to serenade us with Broadway show tunes. Zing again!

The only thing missing: a stunning chariot. But then, at the last minute, my test car for the week turned out to be—zing!—the all-electric BMW i7 xDrive60 glam sedan.

BMW i7 xDrive60

$121,000

MPGe: 87 city/95 highway

Range: 291 to 321 miles

Fastest charging time: 212 miles in 34 minutes (80% charged)

PROS: Hyper fast. Sublime cabin. Dazzling tech.

CONS: Pricey. So-so cargo area. A sedan in a world of SUVs.

IN A NUTSHELL: To drive or not to drive, that’s the question with the BMW i7. Rarely is it more exciting to be the passenger than the driver in a sports sedan, especially a Bimmer. But as I chauffeured my husband to the restaurant on his birthday, he seemed to be having way too much fun enjoying the dizzying array of creature comforts.

Spa treatment. The futuristic seats, made of quilted Merino leather, are as plush and comfortable as anything from Roche Bobois. But the optional cashmere/wool fabric looks and feels even better. All seats—both front and rear—come with ventilation and heating that activates much quicker than in most cars. The superb massage function does bodywork like a real masseur—but without the need to tip 20% when your session ends.

Concert-hall acoustics. Other high-priced rides offer premium audio, but the standard Bowers & Wilkens stereo in the i7 is bravo: 18 speakers and 655 watts. Better yet, my test car had the much-ballyhooed Diamond Surround Sound System, with 36 speakers powered by a 1965-watt amplifier. Yes, two of those speakers use actual diamonds to increase clarity. The result is perhaps the best-sounding vehicle acoustics ever.

IMAX-like screen. The Rear Executive Lounge Seating package adds a reclining right rear seat with footrest and a center console with foldable table that serves as a floating desk. Think first-class seating on an airplane. Most impressive is the huge, 31-inch 8K theater screen that drops down from the ceiling and comes with Amazon Fire capability. All rear window shades lower and the panoramic-glass roof shade closes when in theater mode. Built tastefully into the armrest on each rear door is what looks like an Apple iPhone to control the rear lighting, movie screen and other functions. Any home theater system should be so good.

Racecar features. Up front, the driver is spoiled with many other goodies. A curved digital screen, the same as in the cutting-edge BMW iX SUV, houses a 12.3-inch instrument cluster and 14.9-inch infotainment monitor. Two motors—one for each axle—creates an impressive 536-horsepower. Press the accelerator and—whoosh!—the i7 sprints from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.1 seconds. The amazing auto-leveling suspension absorbs potholes and speed bumps as if this 6,000-pound sedan were floating on air.

Rolls-Royce aura. BMW, which also owns Rolls-Royce, has sprinkled the i7 with stately design cues. This includes softer, more graceful styling and none of the severe, chiseled angles of previous BMWs. Other plusses: Swarovski crystals in the headlights and 22 precision-focused LEDs in the high beams. But the illuminated grille, while impressive, has a more ominous vibe. (Stephen King’s Christine, anyone?)

Full-size comfort. The i7 is a full-figured ride, more than 17-feet long and 6.4-feet wide. Here’s where the automatic parking comes in handy, allowing this BMW to parallel or perpendicular park itself. Trunk capacity is 18 cubic feet, which is decent but less than some competitors. Inside, though, there are plenty of clever storage compartments.

A pretty penny. Full of options, my test car was a wallet-busting $152,000. But that’s a bargain—well, sort of—compared with the high-performance i7 M70. With 650 horsepower and a 0-to-60 time of 3.5 seconds, the M70 is the fastest all-electric M car ever made. It also costs $169,000.

On August 11, the truck manufacturers filed suit against the CARB.
As part of the agreement, the companies promised to meet state vehicle emission standards and adopt zero-emission technology, regardless of any challenges to California’s authority under the CAA.
Under the former President Joe Biden’s administration, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted such a waiver, allowing California to set its own emission standards for heavy trucks.
On June 12, California joined 10 other states in suing the Trump administration, challenging the legality of the act.","The US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit against California on Thursday, seeking to prevent the state from enforcing its own emission standards for heavy trucks. The suit came three days after major manufacturers, including Daimler and Volvo, filed a related complaint against the California Air Resources Board (CARB), stating that they were “caught in a crossfire between two sovereigns who are openly hostile to one another.”

The new complaint is one of several related filings. On August 13, the American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce filed a memorandum against Steven Cliff, the executive officer of the CARB, in support of the DOJ’s suit. A connected complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against Cliff, saying, “Defendant Cliff’s ongoing defiance of federal constitutional and statutory law must stop: His enforcement of preempted California emissions standards grossly intrudes on the exclusive authority of the federal government… And it harms ordinary citizens from coast to coast by diminishing the use of fossil-fuel powered heavy-duty trucks.”

According to a press release from the DOJ, “These actions advance President Donald J. Trump’s commitment to end the electric vehicle (EV) mandate, level the regulatory playing field, and promote consumer choice in motor vehicles.”

The DOJ seeks to protect federal sovereign interests and its authority to mandate uniform vehicle emission standards through the Clean Air Act (CAA). The government seeks permission to intervene under rules 24(a) or (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

On August 11, the truck manufacturers filed suit against the CARB. The manufacturers are part of the Clean Truck Partnership (CTP), an agreement with the CARB. As part of the agreement, the companies promised to meet state vehicle emission standards and adopt zero-emission technology, regardless of any challenges to California’s authority under the CAA. In exchange, the truck companies received flexibility and support in meeting those standards.

However, Congress passed the Congressional Review Act in July, which repealed Section 209 of the CAA. This section allowed the federal government to grant waivers to California for the CAA. Under the former President Joe Biden’s administration, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granted such a waiver, allowing California to set its own emission standards for heavy trucks.

The Congressional Review Act repealed this waiver. On June 12, California joined 10 other states in suing the Trump administration, challenging the legality of the act. While the case is pending, California has continued to try to enforce the CTP. On August 7, Adam Gustafson, the acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, sent a cease-and-desist letter to the manufacturers, in which the companies were ordered to end CTP compliance.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/Otto_trucks_in_San_Francisco.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 04:00:12.195147

As companies like GeoPura lead the charge, the promise of hydrogen as a clean energy source is being explored, although significant economic and logistical challenges remain. This article delves into the transformative potential of hydrogen in construction and the hurdles that need to be addressed.

The Rise of Hydrogen Fuel Cells in Construction

The construction sector’s adoption of hydrogen fuel cells marks a pivotal move away from traditional energy sources. These fuel cells, largely driven by innovators like GeoPura, are positioned to replace diesel generators, notorious for their high carbon emissions. By offering a cleaner and more efficient power alternative, hydrogen fuel cells aim to decarbonize one of the world’s most polluting industries. However, the path to widespread adoption has its setbacks. In 2024, several hydrogen-focused companies encountered difficulties, casting doubt on the scalability and economic viability of this technology.

Despite these challenges, the HS2 project in the UK serves as a beacon of hope. This vast infrastructure project leverages hydrogen fuel cells to energize construction sites, demonstrating how these technologies can be integrated into large-scale endeavors. While the potential for hydrogen in construction is immense, its broad adoption will depend on overcoming economic and logistical obstacles. The progress observed at the HS2 project offers a promising outlook for hydrogen’s role in reshaping the construction landscape.

Joyner said current projections are that the region is more likely to see a wetter and warmer climate where intense weather events happen closer together.
""My expectation over the next five, 10 or 15 years is more of these kinds of intense rainfall events interspersed with flash droughts, where you'll go through a period where you're not going to get rainfall,"" he said.
The research found that in that region the frequency of extreme hurricane rainfall has increased 300% in the past 40 years.
""With a warmer and wetter atmosphere, the potential for these events to happen kind of back-to-back again has increased.","This story was originally published in the Daily Yonder. For more rural reporting and small-town stories visit dailyyonder.com.

Tennessee State Climatologist Andrew Joyner of Eastern Tennessee State University said the events will grow more frequent and more intense in the coming years. Joyner, who is helping state and local governments throughout Appalachia plan emergency mitigation strategies, said states and communities in the region need to be prepared to handle extreme weather over the next 10 to 15 years.

""The big picture is we are getting warmer and wetter,"" Joyner said in an interview with the Daily Yonder. ""We've observed that, not even projecting into the future, we see these types of hurricanes increasing in intensity, just like Helene kind of did, and so it points to the increasing chances that we would have more of these events in the future.""

In 2024, Hurricane Helene hit western Tennessee and eastern North Carolina, resulting in heavy flooding and widespread damage to roads, infrastructure and communities. Weather forecasters said the flooding stemmed in part due to the excessive rain that had fallen in the region the week before the storm blew into the mountains.

It wasn't the first time it's happened, he said. In July 1916, another similar extreme event occurred after western North Carolina saw nearly a week of rain. When the weather cleared, instead of a period of hot, dry weather, a hurricane struck Charleston and Mobile, dumping heavy rains on the Great Smoky Mountains. Mitchell County, in the western Piedmont region of the state, recorded 19 inches of rain in 24 hours, according to the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

The 1916 floods that followed killed an estimated 80 people and damaged nearly all of the railroads west of Winston-Salem and most of the highway bridges across the Catawba and Yadkin rivers. The French Broad River crested at about 21 feet, 17 feet above flood stage, while the Catawba rose almost 21 feet above previous high-water marks.

""The 1916 flood shows that this type of event, or this set-up of events, has happened before, and it's not necessarily unique,"" he said. ""You have more than 100 years apart that you had those two events, so no one alive today has seen an event of that type happen. They'll continue to happen as the wetter, warmer weather gives more ingredients for that type of event to happen more often.""

In June of this year, eastern Tennessee saw another flooding event in which torrential rains led to flash flooding. Thunderstorms led to heavy rainfall, a mudslide and flash flooding, according to the National Weather Service. That flood closed a portion of I-40 in Cocke County near the Tennessee/North Carolina state line.

Chattanooga on Tuesday received over 6 inches of rain, the bulk of which fell within a few hours, causing flash flooding that contributed to four deaths.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts this year will see more hurricanes than last year, forecasting between 13 and 19 named storms, of which between six and 10 will become hurricanes and between three and five will become major hurricanes.

""As we witnessed last year with significant inland flooding from hurricanes Helene and Debby, the impacts of hurricanes can reach far beyond coastal communities,"" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement earlier this year.

Joyner said current projections are that the region is more likely to see a wetter and warmer climate where intense weather events happen closer together.

""My expectation over the next five, 10 or 15 years is more of these kinds of intense rainfall events interspersed with flash droughts, where you'll go through a period where you're not going to get rainfall,"" he said. ""That's a real concern, especially for farmers and producers who need to know when these flash drought events are going to happen. Last summer, for Tennessee, we had three different drought events -- one in June, one in August and one in October. The one in June had a big impact on corn crops. The one in August had an impact on soybeans, and the one in October was really impactful on livestock. That kind of erratic, really wet, really dry back-and-forth is probably going to continue.""

Max Dugan-Knight, climate data scientist with Deep Sky Climate, agrees. Deep Sky's recent report shows similar outcomes even in southern Appalchian states like Mississippi, Georgia and Alabama, as well as parts of South Carolina, Florida, Texas and Louisiana. The research found that in that region the frequency of extreme hurricane rainfall has increased 300% in the past 40 years. Dugan-Knight said that means rainfall so extreme it only occurred once every 100 years will now happen at least every 25 years. The research also found that the severity of these kinds of event has increased 33%.

""In general, climate change is causing more extreme rainfall across North America so the rest of the Appalachian region is not immune from this trend. Extreme rainfall systems and catastrophic flooding is not new to the Appalachian region, the difference is these are getting more common and more intense,"" he said in an email interview with the Daily Yonder.

Climate change is also increasing how long the region will be under the threat of hurricanes.

""It is clear that climate change is extending the length of hurricane season,"" he said. ""Hurricanes can only form at warm ocean temperatures, which is why the warmest summer months into early fall is historically the most active period. Ocean temperatures are rising overall, meaning that they become warm enough to support hurricane formation earlier in the season, and they stay warm longer.""

The weather changes will also have an efect on winters, ETSU's Joyner said. East Tennessee has seen a decrease in winter storms over the past 30 years, he said, but in middle and west Tennessee, winter weather has increased with more ice storms and polar vortex events.

""The number of days where you could experience a freeze has definitely gone down across the whole state, and the timing of those frost freeze days is becoming more erratic ... . We used to be able to have a set time (where you'd see freeze days) usually into mid-April, but maybe that needs to be moved back into March now,"" he said.

Joyner said his office's mission was not one of advocacy or activism, but to provide data and information that decision makers can use to act on.

""One of the biggest projects that we've done is to help Tennessee write their last state hazard mitigation plan, and as part of that, we did all of the risk assessments -- really digging into the data,"" he said.

""As part of that, we have seen changes over the past number of years in intense precipitation events, in temperature, in severe storms and in winter weather. So, we will point those documents out, and it's up to the state or local government to make decisions based on that information.""

From irrigation systems to more flood management systems to less development in flood plains, there are options state and local leaders can take to mitigate the effects of these extreme weather events, he said. And the data suggests that there is a real need for policymakers to take steps to prepare for what a warmer, wetter region will look like.

""These events have happened before. It's not new,"" Joyner said. ""With a warmer and wetter atmosphere, the potential for these events to happen kind of back-to-back again has increased. It doesn't mean it will increase. But the ingredients are there for this to happen more often.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/17/103752146_AP25189736002817_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-17 12:09:29.197156

The incident brought into sharp focus both the promise and the risks of Battery Energy Storage Systems, a technology critical to our clean energy transition.

Since then, conversations across the region have been lively and urgent. The challenge is clear: how do we protect our natural environment while safely integrating new technologies that allow us to store and use renewable energy when we need it most?

Battery Energy Storage System facilities store excess renewable power, especially from solar and wind, for use during periods when generation is low. They help stabilize the grid, meet peak demand and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. But with their rapid growth comes legitimate concerns about safety, environmental impact and emergency readiness.

To address these questions, the Santa Cruz County Commission on the Environment launched a public panel series to help the community learn directly from experts. Each session examines a different aspect of the technology, from cutting-edge battery chemistry to facility safety standards and emergency response planning.

“These workshops are a chance for the community to engage with world-class experts and better understand the opportunities and risks associated with large-scale energy storage,” said commission Chair Kris Damhorst. “As we respond to the climate crisis, it’s essential that we examine how new technologies align with our values, safety needs and long-term environmental goals.”

June: The case for renewable storage

The first Commission on the Environment public panel in June explored how energy storage can help achieve 100% renewable energy. Stanford professor Dr. Mark Jacobson made a compelling case for electrifying all sectors and powering them through wind, water and solar, with the support of robust storage systems.

Jacobson highlighted the economic, health and environmental benefits of this shift, including significant cost savings and fewer air-pollution-related deaths. He compared battery types, from lithium to sodium and addressed mineral sourcing, recycling and fire safety concerns.

Dennis Dyc-O’Neal of Central Coast Community Energy detailed how storage improves grid reliability and flexibility, putting California on track to meet its 100% renewable goal by 2030. Both speakers stressed the urgency of acting now to integrate storage and avoid the most damaging effects of climate change.

July: Beyond lithium

The July meeting turned to long-duration energy storage. Looking at technologies that store energy for more than four hours, Scott Murtishaw, executive director of the California Energy Storage Alliance, outlined promising non-lithium options.

These included non-flow chemical batteries made with iron, zinc or iron-sulfur that can store energy for six to 100 hours; flow batteries, which use electrolyte tanks for four to 24 hours of storage; and mechanical storage such as pumped hydro, gravity systems and advanced compressed air, offering eight to 24 hours of storage and lifespans of up to 60 years.

While lithium-ion still dominates due to cost and efficiency, California is beginning to look at technologies that can discharge for 12 hours or more and even multi-day storage, an essential step for a fully renewable grid.

Safety and standards

Safety has been a constant thread in these discussions. In March, Sen. John Laird introduced SB 283, a bill that would require new Battery Energy Storage System facilities to meet the National Fire Protection Association’s gold standard for battery storage safety. The bill is under consideration for the 2025-26 legislative session.

Retired Assistant Fire Marshal Michael Nicholas also briefed the Commission on the Environment on best practices for safe design, operation and emergency response. His recommendations included using UL 9540/9540A-certified systems, National Fire Protection Association-compliant explosion prevention, and fire alarms and proven large-scale fire test results.

Modern codes and manufacturing improvements have already reduced Battery Energy Storage System failure rates by 97% since 2018. But Nicholas emphasized that safety is an ongoing responsibility. Operators must maintain strong ties with local fire departments, test equipment regularly, keep clear maintenance records and conduct multi-agency drills to ensure readiness.

Best practices now favor early gas or smoke detection and controlled ventilation over suppression systems inside enclosures. Safety protocols should include hazard and fire risk analyses, detailed emergency plans and routine reporting to fire authorities.

Continuing the conversation

The Commission on the Environment’s next meeting will be Aug. 20, from 5-8 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Government Center, 701 Ocean St., 5th Floor. We will host community experts as we focus on battery chemistry and fire safety.

So far, this public panel series has given our community an in-depth look at both the potential and the challenges of large-scale battery storage. It has connected the dots between global climate goals and local emergency preparedness, reminding us that the path to a carbon-free grid must be navigated with care, transparency and technical rigor.

As these discussions make clear, California’s energy transition is not just about building the infrastructure; it’s about building the knowledge, safety culture and community trust to support it. On Aug. 20, the conversation continues. Join us as we learn, question and work together to ensure that the solutions we choose protect both our environment and the generations to come here in our ocean backyard.

On July 4, a bill signed by President Trump cut around $500 billion in clean energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, dealing a heavy blow to the most ambitious climate policy in U.S. history.

The move was widely criticized by both environmental advocates and business leaders, especially in states where wind, solar, and electric vehicle investment had been growing rapidly thanks to IRA tax credits.

But while the repeal is a serious setback, researchers say it doesn't mean the strategy behind the IRA has failed. In fact, it may highlight what needs to happen next.

What is the Inflation Reduction Act?

The Inflation Reduction Act is a landmark 2022 law that, among other things, aimed to lower pollution and fight the effects of global overheating by offering government support to companies investing in clean energy.

These included incentives for industries like solar and wind power, electric vehicle manufacturing, battery storage, and even geothermal and nuclear energy.

Unlike past climate efforts, the IRA was designed not just around environmental goals but around economic opportunity. It brought together an unlikely coalition of traditional climate advocates and major industries, many of which had historically resisted change.

Part of this support included ensuring a proper transition for dirty fuel workers into clean energy jobs, a strategy that, according to Planet Forward, garnered industry-wide success.

Why does this strategy matter?

The most important development to note is that industries that could go green became powerful allies in the climate fight.

These ""decarbonizable"" industries saw the writing on the wall. Rather than fight new climate policies, they accepted government incentives to switch to cleaner technologies.

This occurred both to future-proof their businesses and to compete with global leaders like China, which had already made massive investments in renewable energy. As a result, the IRA created a framework that made climate action politically viable in a country where it had long stalled.

""The core obstacle to climate action has never been public attitudes, long-term economic concerns, or a failure of diplomacy,"" said the authors of the Foreign Affairs analysis, pointing to industrial opposition.

What happens now?

Despite the IRA cuts, many clean energy incentives still survived, including support for geothermal, nuclear, and clean manufacturing.

In other wealthy countries, similar policies are gaining traction as well.

To protect future progress, experts say policymakers must speed up permitting and funding timelines so communities see benefits faster. The Inflation Reduction Act may have been weakened, but the blueprint it created still works, according to Foreign Affairs.

By aligning economic interests with environmental goals, it proved that serious climate action is possible and popular. The challenge now is making that progress stick.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Inflation-Reduction-Actimage-recwDNcXud62mKFuo-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 01:02:43.367527

In Europe, BYD's sales in the first half of the year were more than 300% higher than over the same period in 2024.
BYD's fleet shows no signs of slowing down.
Recently, BYD's fleet has deployed its ""shuttle service"" strategy in Mexico.
Germany-based auto analyst Matthias Schmidt told Business Insider that most of BYD's sales in Europe were to companies and dealerships, rather than consumers.","Elon Musk had a problem. As Tesla struggled to ramp up sales in October 2022, it faced a critical shortage of ships to deliver its EVs.

""There weren't enough boats, there weren't enough trains, there weren't enough car carriers,"" Musk told investors, after Tesla announced it had delivered tens of thousands of cars fewer than it made over the previous quarter.

As Tesla struggled, its biggest Chinese rival devised a novel solution.

BYD, which is on course to surpass Tesla this year as the world's top seller of EVs, decided in 2022 to build a fleet of seven giant ships, each capable of carrying thousands of cars.

Unlike most of its Western rivals, which typically buy space on car carriers operated by shipping companies, BYD has cut out the intermediary as it doubles down on ambitious plans to sell half its cars outside China by 2030.

Six of BYD's giant ships, which are emblazoned with the company's livery and a striking red and white color scheme, have entered service in the past year.

Data obtained by Business Insider from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic shows how the Chinese carmaker is using this fleet to drive an unprecedented international expansion, flooding ports in Europe, Brazil, and Mexico as it takes the fight to Tesla and overtakes legacy automakers.

EVs on the high seas

BYD's first ship set sail in January 2024, when the BYD Explorer No.1 — a 200-meter-long, 13-deck, roll-on roll-off behemoth — went into service.

In July, the Zhengzhou, which can carry up to 7,000 vehicles, became the seventh vessel to join the fleet. The largest ship in BYD's armada, the Shenzhen, has a capacity of over 9,000 vehicles, making it one of the world's largest car-carrying vessels.

The massive ships have been busy. After launching, Explorer No.1 immediately began a 41-day voyage to Europe, the first of three separate trips there in 2024.

Explorer No.1 has also made three voyages to Brazil since May 2024. In May this year, it docked in the Brazilian port of Portocel in its second visit in four months, with two other BYD ships, the Hefei and the Shenzhen, also arriving in Brazil in April and May.

All three arrived fully laden and left empty as BYD raced to deliver its vehicles to Brazil ahead of a planned EV tariff rise in July.

The voyages to Europe and Brazil coincide with BYD's sales surging in both markets.

BYD, which did not respond to a request for comment for this story, sold just 2,500 vehicles in Brazil in the first half of 2023. It's sold over 56,000 vehicles there so far this year, per data from Brazil's National Federation of Automotive Vehicle Distribution.

That's more than Nissan, Renault, and Ford, and it has seen BYD take a dominant position in one of the world's fastest-growing EV markets.

In Europe, BYD's sales in the first half of the year were more than 300% higher than over the same period in 2024.

The Chinese carmaker sold more pure battery-electric vehicles than Musk's automaker in Europe for the first time in April, and its global EV sales have outpaced Tesla's for the past three quarters.

Stian Omli, a senior vice president at logistics intelligence firm Esgian, told Business Insider that BYD was essentially operating a ""shuttle service"" between its production hubs in China and key ports in Europe and Brazil.

BYD's strategy is shaking up the car shipping industry, which has been dominated historically by a handful of established shipping companies that usually plan and invest on cycles of a decade or longer.

Companies like Norwegian logistics giant Wallenius Wilhelmsen and Japanese firm NYK Line sell space aboard their ships to multiple companies, then try to stop at as many ports as possible and pick up cargo for the return voyages. But Omli said BYD's strategy was to go direct, dump a massive number of EVs at one or two destination ports, and often return to China empty.

""Just like they have changed the competitive landscape when it comes to cars, the Chinese are also changing the competitive landscape when it comes to the car carriers,"" Omli said.

China's brutal EV market forces BYD to go global

Stephen Dyer, managing director at auto consultancy AlixPartners, told Business Insider that the Chinese EV industry's drive to expand overseas is driven by a ""never-ending"" price war at home, as over 100 EV brands fight it out in the world's most brutally competitive car market.

""If you can succeed outside China, you gain credibility with your core market consumers in China,"" said Dyer.

BYD could do with a boost. In July, the automaker's sales fell for the first time this year, putting its target of selling 5.5 million cars in 2025 at risk.

BYD's decision to operate its own ships had its roots in a post-COVID supply crunch between 2021 and 2023, when high demand combined with a shortage of specialised car carriers. This crunch sent the price of one car carrier for a yearlong charter soaring as high as $125,000 per day, far above the typical pre-COVID high of around $25,000, Omli said.

This is what made Musk rage and prompted BYD to embark on its radical strategy just as it was beginning to enter international markets in earnest.

BYD's setup allows the company to avoid being caught out if prices soar again, Omli said, and also gives it more flexibility to send its cars where and when it wants.

Control over its supply chain is a key part of BYD's formula for building EVs quicker and cheaper than its rivals. The company manufactures almost all of its own parts. Executive vice president Stella Li previously said that the tires and windows of BYD's Dolphin hatchback were the only parts not made in-house.

""Developing your own component suppliers gives BYD not only some cost leverage over other suppliers, but also the flexibility to do things much faster,"" Dyer said.

""When you have your own fleet, it's the same idea. It allows you to do things quickly and flexibly. You can divert them to anywhere that you want to go, even part of the way on the voyage. You're assured of supply,"" he added.

A costly gambit

BYD is not the only Chinese EV company to dabble in deep-sea shipping.

Rivals such as SAIC Motors have built even larger fleets, and Omli estimated the share of the global deep-sea car carrier fleet controlled by Chinese companies will rise from 10-15% to as much as 25% in the next few years.

It's a hefty investment. Omli estimated that building the first four ships in its fleet cost BYD around $500 million, with such ships typically costing between $100 and $130 million each to build.

BYD's fleet shows no signs of slowing down. The automaker's monthly vehicle exports in July were nearly three times higher than a year ago, per company figures, and its vessels have made six voyages to Europe so far this year.

Recently, BYD's fleet has deployed its ""shuttle service"" strategy in Mexico. The 200-meter-long Changzhou became the first BYD vessel to arrive in the country in June, before criss-crossing the Pacific and returning with another load a month later.

The Explorer No.1 has just made the same journey, docking at the Mexican port of Lazaro Cardenas on 14 August.

BYD recently abandoned plans to build a factory in Mexico, but the company's EVs are still in high demand there. Executives say they expect sales to double this year.

Data from Esgian shows that the four BYD vessels it tracks — The Explorer No.1, Shenzhen, Hefei, and Changzhou — have visited the Mexican ports of Mazatlan and Lararo Cardenas, along with Portocel, more than any other ports outside Asia this year.

No risk, no reward

While BYD's shipbuilding surge has given the company the flexibility to export its EVs at unprecedented volume, the strategy has risks.

The company and its Chinese rivals have shipped so many vehicles to Europe over the past two years that it has put shipping infrastructure under pressure and turned some ports into giant parking lots.

Germany-based auto analyst Matthias Schmidt told Business Insider that most of BYD's sales in Europe were to companies and dealerships, rather than consumers.

Schmidt said he believed BYD's strategy was to flood the market through corporate channels and build enough momentum to become a recognisable brand for European consumers.

The shipping supply crunch that pushed BYD to build its fleet has now mostly abated. A wave of car-carrying ships has been launched in the past two years, easing the shortage and bringing prices down to around $50,000 per day for one car carrier on a one-year charter, with Omli estimating they will probably fall to around $30,000.

With shipping via external carriers a more affordable option, Schmidt said BYD now has to justify the massive costs of running its own fleet by exporting more vehicles.

""That's probably partly behind the high number of vehicles coming to Europe right now. They need to ship those vessels relatively full to maximise utilisation,"" Schmidt added.

Alexander Brown, a senior analyst at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies, said that ""a lot has changed"" since BYD went all in on its own ships three years ago.

Since then, Western economies have raised trade barriers to protect their own auto industries from Chinese carmakers, and the Trump administration has set about reordering global trade with tariffs.

With this protectionism in mind, BYD has another big investment: factories. It recently began production at its new factory in Brazil, on the site of a plant Ford closed in 2021 after years of poor sales and big losses, ending a century of Ford production in the country.

The Detroit automaker also shut down multiple plants in Europe, and Chinese automakers are now filling that gap. BYD is building production sites for the European market in Hungary and Turkey.

Brown added that, if BYD had known how much tariffs would rise after going all in on cargo ships, ""they may have done things a little bit differently.""

The Buncombe County Environmental and Energy Stewardship Subcommittee convened on August 16, 2025, to discuss key initiatives aimed at enhancing the county's sustainability efforts. The meeting began with procedural matters, including the approval of the agenda and minutes from the previous meeting.

One of the primary topics addressed was the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (CPACE) program. Nick Welsh, a representative from Renewables Solar and Electric, presented insights on CPACE, highlighting its potential to drive commercial solar development in North Carolina. Welsh noted that while the program is still in its early stages, there is significant interest from clients, and it could facilitate project development amid diminishing clean energy incentives. The subcommittee discussed the need for a resolution to formally adopt the program, which would also allow other jurisdictions in Buncombe County to participate automatically.

The conversation then shifted to transportation and emissions reduction, led by Rachel from the Sunrise Movement. She emphasized the importance of public transit in addressing climate change, expressing concern that it has not been prioritized in county discussions. Rachel pointed out that the city is currently conducting a comprehensive operations analysis of its transit system, which could inform future developments. She also introduced an ordinance from another North Carolina county that mandates electric vehicle (EV) charger-capable spaces in new parking developments, urging the subcommittee to consider similar measures.

The meeting concluded with a call for further discussions on these topics, particularly regarding the CPACE resolution and transportation initiatives. The subcommittee plans to reconvene in November to continue these discussions and explore actionable steps moving forward.",https://assets.pipeline.soar.com/5590749-5af3c4fe9bed88388cff4958fd16971a/thumbnail_399.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 04:59:12.766264

Now, a Swiss startup wants to tap it to heat and cool buildings, all without drilling a single borehole.

Globally, heating accounts for nearly half of all energy consumption. That could make decarbonizing it a half-trillion-dollar market, according to a BloombergNEF analysis. Using the Earth’s heat offers one route to cut emissions, but traditional geothermal projects can be costly and require space to operate drilling equipment, making them a poor fit for cities.

Startup Enerdrape’s system uses energy-harvesting panels in manmade underground spaces, though, which could allow it to gain a toehold in cities. The Swiss company focuses on older multifamily buildings, which are harder to decarbonize than newer builds. In New York, residential structures built before 1960 make up more than 64% of the housing stock, though not all of it is well-suited for the panels.

""There really aren’t many companies doing this,” said BNEF analyst Stephanie Diaz. ""They are truly a novel approach in how to decarbonize buildings,” though the company will have to figure out how to scale its technology to work with a wide variety of buildings.

Enerdrape’s technology is the product of decades of research spearheaded by Lyesse Laloui, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Lausanne. A five-time startup founder, he’s spent the last 15 years tackling the question of how to turn underground structures into energy sources.

Initially, he created a solution for new construction, but realized that it only addressed a small part of the decarbonization puzzle compared to existing buildings. He and his team developed a prototype heat-exchanging panel in 2015.

Enerdrape’s panels affix to concrete infrastructure, which can hold large stores of heat. (Think of how hot a subway station gets in the summer, for example.) Enerdrape taps that heat using a system of prefabricated panels that absorb geothermal energy from the ground or the air. Even when underground spaces aren’t sweltering, the ground temperature, at several feet of depth, stays relatively constant throughout the year.

During the summer, Enerdrape’s system uses the underground as a heat sink to absorb a building’s heat and cool it. In the winter, it does the opposite, using the ground like a battery to warm things up.

The system requires installing one panel for roughly every 110 square feet (10 square meters) of a building’s floor area. The panels are connected to heat-transferring fluid, working in tandem with one or more heat pumps.

""Enerdrape moves heat from where it’s not needed to where it is,” co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Alessandro Rotta Loria said.

Rotta Loria, who was Laloui’s former PhD student, likened it to an underground solar panel that feeds on heat rather than the sun’s rays. Enerdrape says its panels can meet 100% of the space heating, cooling and hot water needs for buildings up to 10 stories in height.

The company, which launched in 2019, has projects across Europe, including with Switzerland’s largest retailer, Coop Immobilier, small businesses like a dental office in Spain, utilities and multiple Swiss cities.

It also teamed up with Engie, one of Europe’s largest gas and renewable energy suppliers, to provide energy to 72 homes with Paris Habitat, France’s largest affordable housing provider. Enerdrape said its 145 panels provide 70 megawatt-hours of heat per year and cover 25% of homes’ domestic hot water needs while avoiding 15 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.

Despite many urban areas setting ambitious climate goals and a growing number of residential electrification programs, few companies target affordable housing, according to a 2022 report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Decarbonizing heat first is the most cost-effective way to electrify affordable housing, the group found.

Low-income housing tends to be old buildings that are more expensive to retrofit, said Thatcher Bell, who leads climate tech accelerator The Clean Fight’s programs. High upfront cost for replacement, financial constraints and the large number of stakeholders in these buildings make operators less likely to install new technology. The accelerator selected Enerdrape for a recent cohort of startups focused on low-cost, low-construction ways to cut emissions from older units, without displacing residents. The need for those types of solutions is growing.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul calls for building 800,000 electrified or electrification-ready homes by 2030. New York City, meanwhile, passed a law to tackle building emissions, which account for approximately 70% of the city's carbon footprint. Similar measures in cities like Boston and Seattle have followed.

The majority of New York City residential buildings covered by the law are pre-war construction of six stories or less, according to the Urban Green Council. That provides plenty of opportunities for technology like Enerdrape’s. However, the startup faces some challenges.

Heat pump adoption is higher in parts of Europe, and Enerdrape will have to contend with slower adoption in the U.S. due to cost. Upfront cost, which includes panel installation and heat pump connection, is typically between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on a building’s available surface area that can be activated as a heat source. Political headwinds in the U.S. are another issue, with President Donald Trump curtailing federal support for heat pumps.

The system can cut electricity costs, though. According to the company, it can deliver energy at 3 to 4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to the average U.S. gas price of 17 cents per kWh. Enerdrape says its solution is cheaper in Europe, where fuel costs are 3 to 5 times higher than in the U.S..

The system also won’t help with larger buildings, which are some of New York’s biggest energy users.

Trump EPA Seeks Reversal Of Ruling That Typical Levels Of Drinking Water Fluoridation Present An Unreasonable Risk To Health: As reported in our February 13, 2025, blog item, on January 17, 2025, the Biden EPA filed a notice of appeal of the September 2024 lower court decision finding that the plaintiffs established by a preponderance of the evidence that the levels of fluoride typical in drinking water in the United States pose an unreasonable risk of injury to the health of the public. Food & Water Watch v. EPA (No. 25-384). At that time, it was unknown how the Trump EPA would proceed. On July 18, 2025, EPA filed its opening brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the lower court’s decision should be reversed. EPA’s arguments include:

Plaintiffs’ only relevant standing declarant has water that naturally contains fluoride, and Plaintiffs do not ask that the water utility remove naturally occurring fluoride. Thus, according to EPA, Plaintiffs’ injury is not caused by the addition of fluoride to drinking water, and no available remedy will redress it.

EPA states that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California violated TSCA Section 21 by “permitting Plaintiffs to rely on evidence not first presented to EPA in the petition and reviewed by EPA in denying the petition.”

EPA claims that the court “abused its discretion by commandeering the trial and administrative proceedings in violation of the party-presentation principle.”

EPA Submits Draft Proposed Risk Evaluation Framework Rule To OMB For Review: On August 4, 2025, EPA submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a proposed rule entitled “Further Reconsideration of Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).” As reported in our March 14, 2025, memorandum, on March 10, 2025, EPA announced its intent to reconsider the May 2024 rule amending the procedural framework rule for conducting TSCA risk evaluations. EPA intended to review whether the approach taken by the Biden Administration to make a single risk determination for a chemical is consistent with TSCA, whether the Agency must evaluate all conditions of use at the same time in the three years generally allotted by Congress to conduct the review, and whether and how the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial controls in an occupational work environment should be incorporated into risk evaluations. The draft proposed rule submitted to OMB is not publicly available.

EPA Releases Preliminary 2024 TRI Data: On August 5, 2025, EPA published preliminary Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data about chemical releases, waste management, and pollution prevention activities that took place during 2024 at more than 21,000 industrial and federal facilities. EPA notes that it is also making a routine update to its online TRI tools to include new reporting from submissions, revisions, and withdrawals from 2023 and earlier that EPA has processed since October 2024. EPA states that these updated data are, in part, the result of its work to assist industrial facilities in collecting and submitting accurate TRI data. EPA plans to publish a revised version of the data set later in 2025 that will include late submissions and revisions submitted by facilities. The preliminary data are accessible on EPA’s Envirofacts website. They are also available for download from the TRI website.

EPA Releases Draft TSCA Risk Evaluations For Phthalates BBP And DIBP For Public Comment: EPA announced on August 6, 2025, the availability of the draft TSCA risk evaluations for the phthalates butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) for public comment. 90 Fed. Reg. 37855. According to EPA, the purpose of TSCA risk evaluations is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, and without consideration of costs or non-risk factors. EPA states that it used the best available science to prepare the draft risk evaluations and to determine preliminarily, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that BBP and DIBP pose unreasonable risk to health and the environment driven primarily by certain conditions of use analyzed in the draft risk evaluations. Comments are due October 6, 2025. More information is available in our August 15, 2025, blog item.

EPA Seeks Stakeholders To Participate As Small Entity Representatives On Small Business Advocacy Review Panels On Asbestos And Formaldehyde: EPA announced on August 8, 2025, that it seeks self-nominations from small businesses, governments, and not-for-profits to participate as Small Entity Representatives (SER) providing advice and recommendations for two separate Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) Panels. One SBAR Panel will focus on EPA’s development of a proposed rule to address unreasonable risk identified in the TSCA risk evaluation for asbestos part 2. A separate SBAR Panel will focus on EPA’s development of a proposed rule to address unreasonable risk identified in the TSCA risk evaluation for formaldehyde. EPA states that other representatives, such as trade associations that exclusively or at least primarily represent potentially regulated small entities, may also serve as SERs. Nominations for the formaldehyde SBAR panel are due August 22, 2025. Nominations for the asbestos part 2 SBAR panel are due September 7, 2025.

EPA Accelerates Review Of LVEs: EPA announced on August 11, 2025, the results of process improvements to accelerate the review of Low Volume Exemptions (LVE) in the TSCA New Chemicals Program. At the end of March 2025, EPA identified 79 LVEs waiting for review and established a dedicated team of risk assessors. EPA states that it completed the risk assessments and made preliminary decisions for all 79 cases during April and May 2025. According to EPA, 80 percent of these LVEs have received final decisions from EPA and the remaining 20 percent are awaiting information from the submitter before a final decision can be made. EPA also completed risk assessments for an additional 27 LVEs, for a total of 106 LVE risk assessments completed over two months.

The process improvements, including grouping similar cases, designating discipline-specific expediters, and using just-in-time communication, helped to gain speed and efficiencies. EPA states that it “recorded detailed data on assessor timeliness and identified periods of down time that can be shortened or eliminated, resulting in more opportunities for additional efficiency gains in the future.” EPA intends to continue making improvements to decrease the review time for LVEs with the target of assigning an assessor and completing the review within 30 days.

EPA Releases Update To TSCA Inventory: EPA announced on August 14, 2025, that it has released the latest TSCA Inventory. The TSCA Inventory is a list of all existing chemical substances manufactured, processed, or imported in the United States under TSCA that do not otherwise qualify for an exemption or exclusion. EPA notes that this biannual update to the TSCA Inventory includes EPA’s regular posting of non-confidential TSCA Inventory data. EPA plans the next regular update of the TSCA Inventory for winter 2026. EPA states that it is also updating the TSCA Master Inventory File, “which includes the full, specific chemical identities claimed as confidential.” According to EPA, the TSCA Master Inventory File now contains 86,862 chemicals of which 42,578 are active in U.S. commerce. Other updates to the TSCA Inventory include updates to commercial activity data, unique identifier data, and regulatory flags (e.g., SNURs and test orders). EPA continues to perform ongoing confidential business information (CBI) reviews resulting in a number of chemicals that no longer have confidential claims to the chemical name and have been moved to the non-confidential portion of the Inventory.

Trump Grants Regulatory Relief From Biden EPA Emission Standards: On July 17, 2025, President Trump signed four proclamations that grant two years of regulatory relief from Biden-era regulations that impacted various sectors vital to national security. According to the White House’s July 17, 2025, fact sheet, the proclamations cover coal plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities, and certain chemical manufacturers that produce chemicals related to semiconductors, medical device sterilization, advanced manufacturing, and national defense systems. The proclamations allow certain of these facilities to comply with standards that were in place before the Biden Administration rulemakings for two years. The fact sheet states that the exemptions “ensure that these facilities within these critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs to comply with, in some cases, unattainable compliance requirements.”

EPA And CSB Announce “First-Ever” Settlement To Resolve Violations Of The Accidental Release Reporting Rule: EPA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) announced on July 28, 2025, a settlement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) to resolve a violation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the 2020 Accidental Release Reporting rule. EPA notes that “[t]his is the first time EPA has taken an enforcement action and reached a settlement with a company for violations of the 2020 rule.” According to EPA, on June 8, 2023, an accidental release of natural gas from a PG&E pipeline in San Jose, California, caused a serious injury to a PG&E employee. PG&E failed to report the incident to the CSB. EPA states that under the settlement, PG&E will pay a civil penalty of $45,273 for failing to report the incident. PG&E has submitted a report to the CSB containing the required information about the incident.

GAO Publishes Report On EPA’s Analysis Of Costs For PFAS NPDWR: On July 30, 2025, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) publicly released a report entitled “Persistent Chemicals: Information on EPA’s Analysis of Costs for its PFAS Drinking Water Regulation.” According to GAO, the joint explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024 includes a provision that GAO review the cost estimates supporting EPA’s PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR). GAO notes that “[b]ecause this issue is the subject of ongoing litigation, GAO’s work focused on whether EPA sought and published public comment on various elements of the analysis of costs, as required by [the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)].” GAO found that EPA did publish and seek public comment as required.

EPA Proposes Reconsideration Of 2009 Endangerment Finding And GHG Vehicle Standards: EPA published a proposed rule on August 1, 2025, that would repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines to effectuate the best reading of CAA Section 202(a). 90 Fed. Reg. 36288. EPA proposes that CAA Section 202(a) “does not authorize the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns and, on that basis, propose to rescind the Administrator’s prior findings in 2009 that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare.” EPA further proposes, in the alternative, to rescind the Administrator’s prior findings in 2009 because EPA “unreasonably analyzed the scientific record and because developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings.” Lastly, EPA proposes to repeal all GHG emission standards on the alternative bases that no requisite technology for vehicle and engine emission control can address the global climate change concerns identified in the findings without risking greater harms to public health and welfare. On August 15, 2025, EPA extended the comment period. 90 Fed. Reg. 39345. Comments are due September 22, 2025. EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on August 19-20, 2025, on the proposed rule. 90 Fed. Reg. 36125.

EPA Will Convene Hazardous Waste e-Manifest Advisory Board For Virtual Public Meeting: On August 7, 2025, EPA will convene the Hazardous Waste Electronic System (e-Manifest) Advisory Board for a three-day virtual public meeting on September 23-25, 2025. 90 Fed. Reg. 38146. EPA states that the purpose of the meeting is to seek the Board’s consultation and recommendations regarding the e-Manifest system (Meeting Theme: “Accelerating the Future: Phasing out Paper Manifests to Unlock the Full Potential of e-Manifest”). EPA will post the meeting materials in the public docket under docket number EPA-HQ-OLEM-2025-0391 as soon as they become available.

FDA Requests Information For “Ultra-Processed Foods”: On July 25, 2025, FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) requested “data and information to help develop a uniform definition of ultra-processed foods (UPF or UPFs) for human food products in the U.S. food supply.” 90 Fed. Reg. 35305. FDA notes that there “is a clear need for a uniform definition of UPFs to allow for consistency in research and policy. With this Request for Information, we seek data and information that would enable us, as part of a joint federal agency effort, to define UPFs.” Comments must be submitted by September 23, 2025.

FDA Releases Tool For Toxicity Screening For Chemicals In Food: On July 30, 2025, FDA released its Expanded Decision Tree (EDT), a chemical toxicity and risk screening tool that FDA identifies as a New Approach Method that may “leverage large data sets to achieve faster and less expensive informative new approaches to chemical assessments that can inform risk management decisions and actions.” Additional details for the tool are available at online.

Former FDA Chief Files Citizen’s Petition On Processed Food: On August 6, 2025, Dr. David A. Kessler, a former head of FDA, filed a citizen’s petition arguing that certain ingredients in ultra-processed food should not be considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS), stating that “science no longer supports that determination.” Dr. Kessler asserts in the petition that “[p]ast GRAS determinations are based on outdated data and fail to assess the long-term eﬀects on insulin dynamics, blood lipid parameters, energy partitioning, inﬂammatory markers, brain reward signaling, or visceral adiposity. These past determinations do not reﬂect chronic exposure, synergistic eﬀects with other additives, or lifetime health consequences. Today there is no expert consensus that reﬁned carbohydrates in ultraprocessed foods are safe under present conditions of use, as is required to ﬁnd that use of reﬁned carbohydrates is GRAS.” Dr. Kessler’s petition requests that FDA: (1) declare that it no longer considers certain processed carbohydrates as GRAS; (2) revoke existing GRAS regulations for these processed carbohydrates; (3) inform industry that continued use requires notifying FDA; and (4) remove certain products from commerce unless their use in food is authorized by a food additive petition.

NANOTECHNOLOGY

EC Scientific Committee Issues Final Opinion On Hydroxyapatite (Nano) In Oral Products: On July 1, 2025, the European Commission’s (EC) Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) issued a final opinion on hydroxyapatite (nano) in oral products. The EC asked SCCS if it considers hydroxyapatite (nano) safe when used in toothpaste up to a maximum concentration of 29.5 percent and in mouthwash up to a maximum concentration of ten percent according to the specifications as reported in the submission, taking into account reasonably foreseeable exposure conditions. According to the opinion, based on the data provided, SCCS considers hydroxyapatite (nano) safe when used at concentrations up to 29.5 percent in toothpaste, and up to ten percent in mouthwash. More information is available in our July 28, 2025, blog item.

EPA Issues Final SNUR For Graphene Nanoplatelets (Generic): On July 29, 2025, EPA issued final SNURs for certain chemical substances, including graphene nanoplatelets (generic), that were the subject of PMNs and a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN) and are also subject to an Order issued by EPA pursuant to TSCA. 90 Fed. Reg. 35624. The SNURs require persons who intend to manufacture (including import) or process any of the chemical substances for an activity that is designated as a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. EPA states that the chemical substance identified generically as graphene nanoplatelets (PMN P-22-54) is subject to reporting for the significant new uses described in the SNUR. EPA notes that the requirements do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely reacted or cured; or embedded into a permanent solid polymer form that is not intended to undergo further processing, except mechanical processing or physical blending. The final SNUR will be effective September 29, 2025. More information is available in our August 6, 2025, blog item.

European Court Of Justice Upholds Decision Annulling Harmonized Classification And Labeling Of Titanium Dioxide: On August 1, 2025, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued a judgment upholding the 2022 decision of the General Court annulling the 2019 harmonized classification and labeling of titanium dioxide as a carcinogenic substance by inhalation in certain powder forms. As reported in our December 6, 2022, memorandum, the court annulled the EC’s decision to classify titanium dioxide as a suspected human carcinogen.

LEGISLATIVE

Safer Beauty Bill Package Would Update Federal Cosmetics Laws: In July 2025, Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade reintroduced the Safer Beauty Bill Package with Representatives Lizzie Fletcher (D-TX), Doris Matsui (D-CA), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). According to Schakowsky’s July 17, 2025, press release, the bill package includes four separate bills that “offer progressive updates to an increasingly outdated set of federal cosmetics laws.” The press release states that the package “builds upon the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA), which passed under President Joe Biden and expanded FDA oversight to include the regulation of the cosmetics industry, including mandatory recall authority, adverse event reporting, and requiring facility registration, and more.” The bills include:

The Toxic-Free Beauty Act (H.R. 4433): Bans 18 chemicals and two classes of chemicals (phthalates and formaldehyde-releasing preservatives) that have been banned by the European Union and a number of states, including California, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont;

Cosmetic Supply Chain Transparency Act (H.R. 4434): Requires suppliers of raw materials, ingredients, and private label products to provide full ingredient disclosure and safety data to cosmetic companies;

Cosmetic Hazardous Ingredient Right to Know Act (H.R. 4435): Requires product label and website disclosure of “secret, unlabeled, and often toxic chemicals in our personal care products”; and

Cosmetic Safety Protections for Communities of Color and Salon Workers (H.R. 4436): Funds research, resource materials, education and outreach, and the development of safer chemicals to protect the health of women of color and salon workers. The bill also requires FDA to regulate the safety of synthetic braids, “which can contain toxic chemicals.”

Legislation Introduced To Amend FIFRA To Establish A Private Right Of Action For Injuries Caused By Pesticides: On July 17, 2025, Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced legislation that would establish a private right of action for injuries caused by pesticides (S.2324). The introduction of S.2324, the Pesticide Injury Accountability Act of 2025, if enacted, is intended to allow cases against pesticide manufacturers for alleged harm caused by their pesticide products. In his press release, Booker states: “Rather than providing a liability shield so that foreign corporations are allowed to poison the American people, Congress should instead pass the Pesticide Injury Accountability Act to ensure that these chemical companies can be held accountable in federal court for the harm caused by their toxic products.” Specifically, the legislation would amend FIFRA by adding the following language:

“Sec. 34. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR INJURIES CAUSED BY PESTICIDES.

(a) IN GENERAL.— Any person the property or person of which is injured by a pesticide may bring a civil action in Federal district court against a registrant of the pesticide for monetary damages for injury to the property or person caused by the pesticide.

(b) RECOVERABLE DAMAGES.— Monetary damages that may be recovered in a civil action under subsection (a) — (1) include compensatory and punitive damages, at the discretion of the court; and (2) do not include attorney’s fees or court costs.

(c) EFFECT.— Nothing in this section shall preempt any State law claim.”

More information regarding the Senate legislation is available here. B&C’s insightful commentary on the legislation is available in our July 23, 2025, blog item.

House Appropriations Committee Approves FY 2026 Interior, Environment, And Related Agencies Appropriations Bill That Would Prohibit Funding For The IRIS Program: On July 22, 2025, the House Appropriations Committee approved fiscal year (FY) 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (H.R. 4754) by a vote of 33 to 28. According to the Committee’s July 22, 2025, press release, the bill would reduce EPA funding by 23 percent. The bill would prohibit funding to “develop, finalize, issue, or use assessments” under EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program.

Bipartisan Permitting Reform Legislation Introduced In The House: On July 25, 2025, Representatives Bruce Westerman (R-AR), Chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, and Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R. 4776). According to the Committee’s July 25, 2025, press release, the SPEED Act will modernize the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) “to help streamline the permitting process and return the law to its intended purpose.” The press release states that the bill will shorten permitting timelines and reduce the frequency of “frivolous litigation.” This legislation will simplify the analysis required in NEPA documents, thereby easing the burden on agencies. The bill will also clarify when NEPA is triggered by clarifying the definition of “Major Federal Action.” Lastly, the bill will establish judicial review limitations for NEPA claims, including a 150-day deadline for filing claims, a new standard of review, and the elimination of procedural moves that stop projects from moving forward.

Bipartisan Legislation Would Reduce PFAS Contamination At Military Sites And In Surrounding Communities: On July 28, 2025, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) PFAS Discharge Prevention Act (S. 2472). According to Gillibrand’s July 28, 2025, press release, the bill would facilitate the implementation of best management practices (BMP) at DOD facilities to mitigate PFAS pollution at the source, before it contaminates drinking water. The bill would use a small portion of existing PFAS remediation funding to:

Require DOD to monitor regularly for PFAS at DOD installations; and

Facilitate the implementation of base-specific BMPs to limit PFAS-laden stormwater runoff at DOD facilities.

Research For Healthy Soils Act Reintroduced In The Senate: Senator Jeff Merkley announced on July 29, 2025, that he reintroduced the Research for Healthy Soils Act (S. 2500). According to Merkley’s press release, the legislation “would unlock federal funding at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service to conduct research on microplastics in biosolids and help us better understand their potential impacts on soil health, crops, public health, and the environment.”

MISCELLANEOUS

A Snapshot Of Extended Producer Responsibility In 2025: 2025 has been a busy year for extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy, especially for packaging and paper products. States have enacted new EPR programs and laws to assess the need for EPR. Existing programs have been altered or updated. Compliance deadlines have come and gone. EPR legislation has been introduced in many states. With so many moving parts, the status of EPR in the United States can be hard to follow. More information on the overview of changes and developments in the EPR landscape in 2025 is available in our July 16, 2025, memorandum.

DOD Publishes 2025 Update On Critical PFAS Uses, Recommends Risk-Based Approach To Defining PFAS: DOD published a July 2025 report entitled Update on Critical Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Uses. The report presents DOD’s plan to research alternatives to mission critical PFAS uses and evaluate and review key technical standards for PFAS critical materials “to ensure that the standards are effective, accurately represent the required performance, and ensure that viable PFAS-free alternatives are not artificially excluded.” The report states that the collective international, federal, and state regulatory actions to manage the environmental impacts of PFAS and identify and eliminate PFAS from the market, and the resulting market responses, pose increasing risks to DOD operations due to possible product obsolescence and reformulations. These issues are exacerbated by the variability in how the regulatory authorities define PFAS. According to the report, PFAS are critical to the national security of the United States, and there is a need “to ensure that the dwindling number of domestic PFAS manufacturers remain able to and capable of providing PFAS critical to national security, including those producing the feedstock minerals (fluorspar and possibly others) and chemicals and all the intermediate chemicals leading to the manufacture of fluoropolymers, fluorinated gases, and other critical fluorochemicals broadly defined as PFAS.” More information is available in our July 24, 2025, blog item.

Minnesota Extends January 1, 2026, PFAS Reporting Deadline To July 1, 2026: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) announced on July 23, 2025, that it will extend the January 1, 2026, deadline for reporting products containing intentionally added PFAS to July 1, 2026. In its announcement, MPCA also notes updates to the 2025 PFAS in product prohibitions. Consistent with MPCA’s recommendations, the Minnesota legislature amended the statute so that intentionally added PFAS found in internal components and electronic components of products are now exempt from Minnesota’s 2025 PFAS prohibitions. Intentionally added PFAS in these components will be prohibited beginning January 1, 2032, unless the use of PFAS is determined to be a currently unavoidable use (CUU). The legislature also amended the statute to clarify the definition of “juvenile products” to exclude all-terrain vehicles (ATV), motorcycles, snowmobiles, e-bikes, and replacement parts for these products designed for children.

Safer States Publishes Takeaways From 2025 Legislative Session On Toxic Chemicals And Plastics, Including PFAS And Microplastics: On July 23, 2025, Safer States published its takeaways from the 2025 legislative session on toxic chemicals and plastics. According to Safer States, in 2025, ten states have adopted at least 22 policies intended to reduce exposure to toxic chemicals and advance safer solutions. Safer States notes the following trends from the 2025 legislative sessions:

States are leading the charge to prevent exposure to PFAS, toxic plastics, and other harmful chemicals;

States are addressing pollution and cleaning up toxic contamination;

States are successfully defending hard-won protections; and

States are protecting drinking water as federal action falters.

Safer States anticipates that this momentum will continue in the states that still have active legislative sessions. Safer State’s bill tracker allows stakeholders “to keep up to date on adopted and moving state legislative policies that help move the needle forward toward achieving a healthier world.” More information is available in our July 31, 2025, blog item.

Comments On Maine’s Proposed CUU Amendment Due September 2, 2025: The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) began a public consultation on July 30, 2025, on a proposed amendment to Chapter 90: Products Containing PFAS. The proposed amendment would add two designations for CUUs of intentionally added PFAS in cleaning products subject to sales prohibition beginning January 1, 2026. Each determination will remain in effect until the date listed below:

The use of PFAS in a cleaning product container internal cartridge valve within the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) classification 3926.90.4510, that are used in the industrial sector with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 561210 and 561720, is a CUU until January 1, 2031; and

The use of PFAS in a cleaning product container vented cap liner within the HTS classification 3921.19.0000, 7607.20.5000, and 3923.50.0000, that are used in the industrial sector with the NAICS code 322299, is a CUU until January 1, 2031.

EPA Publishes Guidance On Referrals For Potential Criminal Enforcement: EPA published a notice on July 31, 2025, describing its plans to address regulatory offenses that give rise to criminal liability under Executive Order 14294 on “Fighting Overcriminalization in Federal Regulations.” 90 Fed. Reg. 36044. EPA advises the public that by May 9, 2026, the Agency, in consultation with the Attorney General, will provide to the OMB Director a report containing: list of all criminal regulatory offenses enforceable by Agency or the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ); and for each such criminal regulatory offense, the range of potential criminal penalties for a violation and the applicable mens rea standard for the criminal regulatory offense. The notice also announces a general policy, subject to appropriate exceptions and to the extent consistent with law, that when the Agency is deciding whether to refer alleged violations of criminal regulatory offenses to DOJ, officers and employees of EPA should consider, among other factors:

The harm or risk of harm, pecuniary or otherwise, caused by the alleged offense;

The potential gain to the putative defendant that could result from the offense;

Whether the putative defendant held specialized knowledge, expertise, or was licensed in an industry related to the rule or regulation at issue; and

Evidence, if any is available, of the putative defendant’s general awareness of the unlawfulness of his conduct as well as his knowledge or lack thereof of the regulation at issue.

EPA notes that it “has historically considered each of these factors as a matter of formal policy and in practice, not only in referring alleged violations of criminal regulatory offenses to DOJ, but also in deciding whether to open a formal investigation in the first place.”

IRS Modifies List Of Taxable Chemical Substances To Include 21 Chemicals: On August 4, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a notice of determinations that modifies the list of taxable substances to include the following 21 substances: polyphenylene sulfide, cellulose acetate (degree of substitution = 1.5-2.0), 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlorohydrin copolymer, nylon 6, caprolactam, methyl ethyl ketoxime, iso-butanol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol phenyl ether, methoxytriglycol, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, propylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol n-propyl ether, propylene glycol phenyl ether, di-isobutyl carbinol, di-isobutyl ketone, methyl isobutyl carbinol, cyanuric acid, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, and sodium chlorite. 90 Fed. Reg. 36520. For each of the substances, an importer, an exporter, or an interested person petitioned the IRS for a determination under Section 4672(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to add the substance to the list. According to the IRS, for each substance, the petition represented that the taxable chemicals constitute more than 20 percent of the weight of materials used to produce the substance, based on the predominant method of production. After reviewing each petition, the Secretary determined that taxable chemicals constitute more than 20 percent by weight of the materials used to produce the substance, based on the predominant method of production. Therefore, each of the substances is added to the list as required under Section 4672(a)(2) and (4). The effective date for purposes of the tax under Section 4671 of the Code for the taxable substances added to the list is January 1, 2026. For the effective date for purposes of refund claims under Section 4662(e) of the Code for the taxable substances added to the list, the IRS states that stakeholders should see the determination for each substance. The notice “also modifies the list included in Notice 2021-66 by correcting a typographical error in the spelling of the name of the taxable substance sodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate and prescribing a tax rate for sodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate.” The tax rate for sodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate is effective July 1, 2022.

Federal Court Grants Minnesota’s Motion To Dismiss Challenge To Its PFAS Ban In Cookware: On August 11, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota granted MPCA’s motion to dismiss the Cookware Sustainability Alliance’s (CSA) suit for failure to state a claim. CSA v. Kessler (No. 0:25-cv-00041). As reported in our January 14, 2025, blog item, CSA filed suit in January 2025, claiming that Minnesota’s January 1, 2025, ban on the sale of cookware containing intentionally added PFAS violates the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause, the First Amendment, and the Supremacy Clause. After MPCA moved to dismiss the complaint, CSA voluntarily dismissed its causes of action under the First Amendment and the Supremacy Clause. The court granted MPCA’s motion to dismiss, dismissing CSA’s dormant Commerce Clause claims in the Complaint with prejudice and the voluntarily dismissed claims without prejudice. More information will be available in a forthcoming blog item.

EPA Relaunches Comprehensive Guidance Document Website: On August 13, 2025, EPA announced the relaunch of EPA’s Guidance Portal, “a streamlined website for accessing important guidance documents related to air quality, water protection, hazardous waste management, and more.” According to EPA, the website serves as a resource for all guidance documents managed across EPA’s headquarters environmental programs. EPA designed the website to be a “one-stop shop to help users and small businesses easily and quickly locate and follow EPA’s active guidance documents on topics of interest.” EPA notes that guidance documents are “agency statements of general applicability, intended to have future effects on the behavior of regulated parties, that set forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue, or an interpretation of a statute or regulation, with some exceptions.” According to EPA, the portal does not contain documents excluded from this definition, “such as internal guidance directed to EPA or other federal agencies that is not intended to have future effect on the behavior of regulated parties, rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice, and internal executive branch legal advice or legal opinions addressed to executive branch officials, among others.” EPA’s guidance documents generally lack the force and effect of law.

Petitions Filed To Add Chemicals To List Of Chemical Substances Subject To Superfund Excise Tax: On August 15, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that petitions have been filed to add the following chemicals to the list of taxable substances:

A growing market has been established for products that minimize damage to the environment, and in a 2024 survey, 46% of consumers said they are purchasing more sustainable products to help the environment.

However, greenwashing litigation is evolving worldwide, with distinct drivers and enforcement priorities across regions and countries.

So, what exactly is greenwashing? What are the risks that come with greenwashing? Which companies are likely to use greenwashing?

What is Greenwashing?

The United Nations defines greenwashing as misleading the public to “believe that a company or other entity is doing more to protect the environment than it is,” all while promoting false, distracting solutions to the climate crisis.

Examples of how a company can greenwash include making unsubstantiated net-zero claims; spotlighting minor improvements when a product meets its minimum regulatory requirements; and highlighting single attributes while disregarding a product’s broader environmental impact.

“Greenwashing occurs mostly when companies ‘overcommunicate or under-communicate’ on sustainability performance,” said Andreas Rasche, a professor at Copenhagen Business School in Denmark. “Misleading branding, vague claims, and unregulated labels on products make it difficult for consumers who are aiming to reduce their environmental footprint to make informed decisions.”

What are the risks of greenwashing?

The risks of greenwashing can be damaging not only to consumers, but the companies as a whole.

Companies can experience increased legal risks and complexity resulting from an insufficient global alignment on sustainability regulations. This problem alone makes compliance more challenging.

“We see an increase in NGOs being very active because there is a pushback on sustainability as a whole, and the different governments around the world push now even harder in relation to greenwashing or even climate change litigation,” said Daja Apetz-Dreier, Partner & Co-Leader of the ESG & Sustainability Advisory Group at Morgan Lewis.

Which companies use greenwashing?

Manufacturing enterprises are among the companies where greenwashing has become prolific, especially those specialized in oil and gas, consumer products, and transportation sectors.

“From a comprehensive perspective, both governmental and public entities have been identified as crucial actors in the governance of greenwashing behaviors,” a study says.

Companies have been advised to provide legal guidance and comprehensive training to help mitigate the risk of costly greenwashing claims.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/08/GettyImages-2229282093.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 22:59:45.867692

Meanwhile, EV sales in Europe have jumped 30% to 2.3 million this year.
Though EV sales have continued to rise in North America, sales were comparatively meager, rising just 1.0 million, a 2% increase.
EV sales outside of China, Europe, and North America rose fastest in relative terms, jumping 42% in the first part of 2025.","North America fell far behind China and Europe in terms of EV adoption in the first part of 2025 amid declining government incentives and anti-electrification policies in the US, but interest in EVs is on a roll globally.

According to UK market research firm Rho Motion, worldwide EV sales jumped 21% between July 2024 and July 2025, topping 10.7 million in the first seven months of the year.

Europe and China led the charge. Sales in China hit 6.5 million, a 29% year-to-date increase. It's down month-over-month, but so are overall passenger car sales, Rho Motion says.

Meanwhile, EV sales in Europe have jumped 30% to 2.3 million this year. Some European markets performed particularly well, including Italy and the UK, which jumped 40% and 30%, respectively, though France had an 11% year-on-year decline.

Though EV sales have continued to rise in North America, sales were comparatively meager, rising just 1.0 million, a 2% increase. Rho Motion attributes the poor performance to the “multi-billion-dollar hit” from tariffs, partially offset by reduced requirements to purchase ZEV credits.” However, the research firm did suggest that Ford’s plans to launch its “Universal EV Platform,” as well as a $30,000 electric midsize pickup with LFP batteries in 2027, could boost sales.

EV sales outside of China, Europe, and North America rose fastest in relative terms, jumping 42% in the first part of 2025. Absolute numbers were less impressive, as only 0.9 million EVs were sold. It’s important to note that countries like China have impressive subsidies in place for those willing to switch to EVs. But American EV buyers haven’t been nearly so lucky.

“The power density of AI chips is approximately ten times higher than that of typical servers and is expected to rise another five to ten times in the coming years,” it said.
Data centres — typically, unlovely warehouses stacked to the rafters with server racks — require vast amounts of power to handle computing tasks.
The dawn of the AI age represents a step change in power demand.
Either scenario hinges on building enough solar arrays and wind farms, and nuclear and gas plants, to power that fabulous future.","Yet despite the geopolitical wrangling and breathless headlines about semiconductors — the brains of these systems — arguably the more important chokepoint that has emerged is the electricity that will be needed to run them. “Energy is the biggest bottleneck right now,” said Rihard Jarc, a tech investor.

Brookfield Asset Management, one of the world’s largest data centre owners, published a report this month forecasting that $500 billion worth of new power plants and transmission lines will have to be built to power the AI revolution.

“The power density of AI chips is approximately ten times higher than that of typical servers and is expected to rise another five to ten times in the coming years,” it said. “The energy and utility sectors are facing unprecedented pressure — and opportunity.”

Soon after it swept to power last year, the Labour government designated data centres as critical national infrastructure, and it has since laid out plans for a fleet of British data centres that would require six gigawatts of reliable energy — a third more than the capacity of Drax, Britain’s single-biggest power producer.

The BBC reported last week that the number of data centres in the UK is set to increase by almost 100 — there are currently an estimated 477 in the UK — with the majority to be built in the next five years. To meet that coming demand, the National Energy System Operator, the state-controlled group that moves high-voltage power around the country, has called for a “once-in-a-lifetime expansion of our electricity network and clean power generation”.

The electricity grid is already groaning under the strain, and it is showing up in strange ways. The government last week issued much-mocked guidance to delete old photos and emails, because the data centres in which they are housed require large amounts of water for cooling — water that, in a “nationally significant” drought, might have more noble uses than preserving snaps from that Ibiza holiday in 2016.

Data centres — typically, unlovely warehouses stacked to the rafters with server racks — require vast amounts of power to handle computing tasks. But they also have to be kept extremely cool to prevent chips from melting. So they rely on power-hungry air-conditioning systems and pumps that push thousands or even millions of gallons of cool water through pipes that run alongside the servers.

The dawn of the AI age represents a step change in power demand. Nvidia’s Rubin chip, which is set to hit the market next year, will require 600 kilowatts per rack — a 12-fold increase from the H100 models that it released in 2022.

So what does that mean for you and I? A typical query to ChatGPT requires 1,224 joules, or 0.34 watt-hours of power, according to Sam Altman, OpenAI’s founder. That is equivalent, he wrote in a recent blog post, to “about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency light-bulb would use in a couple of minutes”.

That same query uses about a third of a millilitre of water, or roughly one-fifteenth of a teaspoon.

Consider now that ChatGPT, from a standing start three years ago, has 700 million users peppering its bot with questions every week. Google, meanwhile, offers “AI overviews” and recently rolled out “AI Mode” for more in-depth questions, all of which require more computing power, and thus more power, than before.

It all adds up. And that is just the beginning. Silicon Valley’s hyper-scalers are banking on a future in which AI will be used by everyone, all the time. That is the only way in which their $3 trillion building bonanza can make sense.

It is worth noting, however, that most of the big AI companies do not readily share their power figures, and actual consumption can vary wildly depending on the type of chatbot query. A recent analysis by the MIT Technology Review, a magazine from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that a five-second AI-generated video can require as much as 3.4 million joules — equivalent to running a microwave for an hour. A simple text query to one of the most rudimentary large language models, on the other hand, might use 114 joules — equal to running a microwave for one-tenth of a second.

The other important factor that companies are reckoning with is the difference between “training”, the months-long process of feeding data into a model, and “inference”, the industry term for the model actually being used by people.

It is estimated that OpenAI trained GPT-4, the predecessor to its current model, for three months on at least 20,000 A100s, one of Nvidia’s most advanced chips. The power consumed to run the chips, plus the associated cooling, has been estimated at about 50 gigawatt hours — enough juice to power all of London for 12 hours.

Yet most demand will be driven by inference: the 1,200-joule requests for dad jokes, the 3.4 million-joule cat videos, which are already running into the billions each day. This is what has the energy market aflutter. Because even with vast improvements in the energy efficiency of these systems — OpenAI’s Altman said the cost per “unit of intelligence” falls ten-fold every year — demand is growing even faster.

This phenomenon — and the idea that efficiency leads to more use, not less — is known as the “Jevons paradox” after British economist William Stanley Jevons, who observed in the 1860s that more efficient steam engines spurred increased coal consumption.

It is why Microsoft plans to revive the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. It is why start-ups such as Starcloud, the Washington DC company founded by British entrepreneur Philip Johnston, have raised millions to build solar-powered data centres in space. It is why OpenAI recently announced Stargate Norway, a vast new data centre to be built near a hydropower plant outside Bergen.

But such mega-projects barely scratch the surface. Anthropic, maker of the popular Claude chatbot, predicted last month that America will need to build 50 gigawatts of new power plants — roughly twice the capacity used on a typical day in Britain — by 2028 to meet surging data centre demand. The San Francisco company called for a slashing of red tape and leasing of government land for new infrastructure, framing the drive for new plants as “a national security and economic imperative”.

Behind the mania is a mixture of greed, excitement, and a strain of techno-optimism that wafts through the air from Silicon Valley to Wall Street. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, previously declared that AI could ultimately prove “more profound” than the invention of electricity or the harnessing of fire. Dario Amodei, chief executive of Anthropic, claimed that the technology has put the world on the cusp of an unprecedented era of humanity flourishing.

“We will, in a few years, make all the progress in biology and medicine that we would have made in the whole 21st century,” he wrote.

Among Amodei’s forecasts: we will double the average lifespan, eliminate most cancers and cure most mental illness. Or perhaps we will just have better dad jokes.

Either scenario hinges on building enough solar arrays and wind farms, and nuclear and gas plants, to power that fabulous future.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fb15b0fbd-6393-4c19-a6f9-6598a2d6e76f.jpg?crop=2420%2C1361%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-16 21:02:04.638512
,Indiana American Energy ,2025-08-17 00:27:42+00:00,Greeley Tribune,(Commentary) Jonathan Thompson: Coal gets a boost as renewables are gutted - Greeley Tribune,Jonathan Thompson,,,,,https://www.greeleytribune.com/2025/08/16/jonathan-thompson-coal-gets-a-boost-as-renewables-are-gutted/,"That’s because a fleet of massive coal-fired power plants in the region churned out haze-producing pollutants, harming humans and the ecology and blotting out vistas from the San Juans to the Sandias.
But over the last decade, the failing economics of coal shuttered those power plants.
That means the air on the Colorado Plateau — when not sullied by the ever-lengthening wildfire season — has become cleaner as the coal industry faded away.
It’s true that delaying implementation of the mercury rule will enable the Colstrip coal plant in Montana — one of the nation’s dirtiest facilities — to continue operating without expensive new pollution control equipment.
They just can’t compete with natural gas, solar, wind and other, cleaner energy sources.","A few years back, my friend Norm told me that when he was growing up in northern New Mexico in the 1950s and early ’60s, his family often drove up to the La Plata Mountains in southwestern Colorado. From there he could see all the way to the Sandia Mountains outside Albuquerque, some 200 miles away.

His statement saddened me, since in all the time I spent on Four Corners high points, a persistent haze always limited my visibility to maybe 50 or 60 miles, blurring Shiprock’s sharp spires into a fuzzy silhouette. That’s because a fleet of massive coal-fired power plants in the region churned out haze-producing pollutants, harming humans and the ecology and blotting out vistas from the San Juans to the Sandias. It seemed as if I’d never get a view as clear as Norm’s.

But over the last decade, the failing economics of coal shuttered those power plants. That means the air on the Colorado Plateau — when not sullied by the ever-lengthening wildfire season — has become cleaner as the coal industry faded away.

The shuttered plants include Mojave, Navajo, Nucla, Escalante, San Juan and, most recently, Cholla. The closures certainly sharpened the view of folks all over the region. But more importantly, they kept tens of millions of tons of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and oodles of harmful pollutants (arsenic, mercury, sulfur dioxide and soot) out of the lungs of nearby residents, many of them on the Navajo Nation.

Yet in defiance of the free market that has boosted renewables, the Trump administration is acting to undo those positive changes and make the air dirty again by throwing multiple lifelines to the flagging coal industry.

It has eviscerated environmental protections limiting mercury and other toxic air emissions, ended Obama-and Biden-era freezes on new federal coal leases, and rescinded limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The administration has also blocked utilities from shutting down plants that are old, dirty and more costly than other power sources.

Trump purports to do this in the name of “unleashing” coal from regulatory constraints so it can be mined and burned to achieve American “energy dominance.” Yet it’s unlikely that unleashing the industry will reverse its decline.

It’s true that delaying implementation of the mercury rule will enable the Colstrip coal plant in Montana — one of the nation’s dirtiest facilities — to continue operating without expensive new pollution control equipment. Generally, though, utilities such as Xcel Energy, Intermountain Power Agency and Tri-State Generation & Transmission are moving forward with plans to retire their coal plants, namely because the aging facilities are dirty, inefficient, inflexible and, most of all, no longer profitable. They just can’t compete with natural gas, solar, wind and other, cleaner energy sources.

When signing one of his fossil-fuel-friendly orders, Trump said he would “save” the Cholla coal plant near Holbrook, Arizona, from destruction, adding, “We’re going to have that plant opening and burning the clean coal, beautiful clean coal, in a very short period of time.”

But its operator, Arizona Public Service, said it had already procured cleaner, cheaper generation for the plant, and had no desire to keep burning coal at Cholla. There was no save needed.

If Trump were truly interested in energy dominance and abundance, he would have supported the fastest-growing energy sources — wind and solar power. Instead, his administration is doing all it can to stifle them, from eliminating production tax credits for renewable energy in his “big, beautiful” budget bill, to slowing down permits for clean energy developments on public lands. Both utility-scale and rooftop solar will be affected, boosting the prospects of oil and gas, coal and nuclear.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, in an Economist column, revealed the philosophy behind the administration’s fossil-fuel fetishization. He wrote that climate change is “not an existential crisis,” merely a “byproduct of progress.” He said he was willing to take the “modest negative trade-off” of climate change — along, presumably, with ever more devastating heat waves, wildfires and floods — “for this legacy of human advancement.”

He is probably correct in saying that climate change and the sullied air over the Colorado Plateau are byproducts of so-called progress. But they are also nasty, deadly and avoidable. Ultimately, going backward toward coal will not only wreck progress, but perhaps life on Earth as we know it.

Sales growth has decelerated to a mere crawl, with projections indicating only a modest uptick compared to the explosive expansions seen in prior years.

Globally, the EV surge signals a tipping point, with one in four cars sold being electric in 2025, per BloombergNEF insights shared on X.","In the bustling world of automotive electrification, a stark divergence is emerging: while electric vehicle (EV) sales are accelerating at breakneck speed across much of the globe, the United States finds itself mired in a slowdown, hampered by shifting policies and economic headwinds. Recent data paints a picture of robust international growth, with global EV sales surging 27% year-to-date in 2025, reaching an impressive 10.7 million units, according to reports from Electrek. This momentum is largely propelled by powerhouse markets like China and Europe, where incentives and infrastructure investments continue to fuel adoption.

Yet, in the U.S., the story is markedly different. Sales growth has decelerated to a mere crawl, with projections indicating only a modest uptick compared to the explosive expansions seen in prior years. Analysts attribute this lag to the Trump administration’s decisions to eliminate federal tax credits for EV purchases and scale back investments in a nationwide charging network, as detailed in a recent analysis by PCMag. These moves have chilled consumer enthusiasm, leaving automakers to grapple with excess inventory and recalibrated strategies.

Policy Shifts Reshaping U.S. Demand

The elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit, a cornerstone of EV affordability since its inception, has directly impacted buyer calculations. Industry insiders note that without this incentive, many potential EV owners are opting for hybrids or sticking with traditional internal-combustion engines, especially amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty. A quarterly report from Cox Automotive highlights that U.S. EV sales increased by just over 10% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025, a far cry from the triple-digit growth rates of yesteryear, with General Motors driving much of the gains while Tesla experiences declines.

Compounding these challenges are supply-chain disruptions and tariff battles. China’s dominance in battery production—accounting for over 60% of global output—has led to U.S. export restrictions on critical minerals like lithium, further inflating costs for American manufacturers. Posts on X from users like BloombergNEF underscore this tension, noting that while emerging markets are “taking off” with EV adoption, the U.S. is facing a “slowdown” due to these policy-induced barriers, reflecting broader sentiment in real-time discussions.

Global Momentum Contrasts with Domestic Hurdles

Internationally, the narrative is one of triumph. China’s EV market alone has seen sales skyrocket, contributing to more than half of the global total, bolstered by aggressive subsidies and a vast charging ecosystem. Europe, meanwhile, has witnessed a 30% sales increase, driven by stringent emissions regulations and consumer shifts toward sustainable transport, as outlined in the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025. These regions are not only outpacing the U.S. but also innovating rapidly in battery technology and vehicle-to-grid integration.

Forecasts suggest this global upswing will persist, with Statista projecting the worldwide EV market to expand by nearly 7% annually through 2029, reaching a valuation of over $1 trillion. In contrast, U.S. projections from BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook indicate flat retail share at around 9% for 2025, marking the first plateau in years, as echoed in X posts from automotive analysts like Car Dealership Guy.

Industry Adaptations and Future Implications

Automakers are responding with a mix of caution and innovation. Legacy players like Ford and GM are pivoting toward hybrids to bridge the gap, while startups focus on cost-cutting measures. The rise of leasing and shared mobility services, as noted in a GlobeNewswire outlook report, offers flexible alternatives that could soften the blow of high upfront costs.

Looking ahead, the U.S. market’s trajectory hinges on potential policy reversals or breakthroughs in domestic battery production. Globally, the EV surge signals a tipping point, with one in four cars sold being electric in 2025, per BloombergNEF insights shared on X. For industry insiders, this dichotomy underscores the need for resilient strategies amid geopolitical fluxes, ensuring that electrification’s promise endures despite regional setbacks.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-083b4a5e-c844-4b6b-89ef-c0cb427697b1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-16 21:01:51.300393

Its electric ""Infinity Train"" ran nearly 685 miles without needing a single refuel or charge, reported Electrek.

That's because the train, which the company conceptualized in 2022, uses regenerative braking to recharge its batteries. According to J.D. Power, regenerative braking ""captures the kinetic energy produced by a car when it slows down or comes to a stop. It is then converted into electrical energy and stored in a battery or capacitor for later use.""

Because it's battery-electric, the train doesn't use fuel or need oil changes, which can save a lot of time and money on typical maintenance. Plus, regenerative braking recaptures energy instead of relying solely on friction, so the train's braking components can last longer.

But this train also benefits the environment. According to Fortescue, the train will help save more than 21 million gallons of diesel fuel, Electrek reported. That's the equivalent of taking hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles — and their polluting emissions — off the road.

Of course, some may still be skeptical about the pollution created during electric vehicle battery manufacturing, which requires intensive element mining. This is a valid concern for the Infinity Train, which requires a battery to operate.

However, the roughly 7 million tons of minerals needed annually for this purpose is much lower than the estimated 16.5 billion tons of dirty fuels taken from the Earth each year.

When those dirty fuels get burned, they lead to pollution and overheating, and aren't reusable the same way minerals are.

""What a great use of imagination and engineering!"" exclaimed an Electrek commenter.

Another commented, ""The decarbonization of the EV supply chain is proceeding faster than I anticipated. Well done!""

On a much smaller and personal scale, swapping to an EV can make a similar impact. When you drive electric, you cut tailpipe emissions entirely and reduce long-term costs compared to gas-powered vehicles. As charging networks expand to make EVs more accessible, making the switch is becoming an easier choice for many.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Infinity-Trainimage-recrnP6PODlzReWGJ.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 21:59:22.946767

David Whitley, DRW Planning Studio project manager, said 28 sensors throughout the corridor are collecting information about temperature, pollutants and other factors that impact climate. He says data gathered will help determine where trees are planted.

""We’re able to model how different design solutions might affect thermal comfort based on all these data points,"" he explained. ""So, we can put in the arrangement of trees that we’re thinking about and see, how will that perform.""

The medical district is Dallas’ largest urban heat island. The trees are expected to reduce the temperature in the corridor by at least 15 degrees. An eight acre signature park will be built between the three hospitals.

Lannie McClelen, program director, Southwestern Medical District, said a survey of employees and medical students shows they need a place to unwind from the stress of their jobs, and added that the greenspace is designed to improve their overall mental health.

This landmark accomplishment marks a dramatic rise from just 2.3 GW in 2014, reflecting the country’s accelerated progress in building a robust and self-reliant solar manufacturing ecosystem.

It aligns with the national vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and reinforces India’s commitment to the global clean energy transition. Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, highlighted the achievement as a testament to the transformative leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the impact of initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar Modules.

The minister said that this growth strengthens India’s path towards energy self-sufficiency and supports the national target of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030. The government’s strategic interventions have catalysed the expansion of solar PV manufacturing, positioning India as a key player in the global solar value chain.

The ALMM framework, introduced by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in January 2019, has played a pivotal role in this growth. The first ALMM list, published in March 2021, featured an initial capacity of 8.2 GW and 21 manufacturers. In just over four years, this capacity has grown more than twelvefold, crossing the 100 GW threshold.

The number of manufacturers has also surged to 100, operating across 123 manufacturing units nationwide. This expansion reflects not only the scale of production but also the diversification and competitiveness of the sector.

“This is a transformative moment where Ford will lead America’s transition to electric vehicles and usher in a new era of clean, carbon-neutral manufacturing,” says Ford executive chairman Bill Ford. “With this investment and a spirit of innovation, we can achieve goals once thought mutually exclusive – protect our planet, build great electric vehicles Americans will love and contribute to our nation’s prosperity.”

Ford will also spend $525 million - $90m in Texas, alone - “to train skilled technicians to service connected, electric zero-emission vehicles.”",,N,,2025-08-17 04:00:53.538201

Those blue EnergySTAR labels are the most widely recognized symbol when Americans search for energy-efficient appliances. A joint effort between the EPA and the Department of Energy, the program is estimated to have saved $500 billion in energy costs and 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions since 1992. The EnergySTAR label is only offered to appliances and homes that meet their product-specific high standards.

However, earlier this year, the Trump administration initiated plans to cut the EnergySTAR program, despite protests from economists, environmentalists and consumer advocates. With the EnergySTAR label disappearing, consumers should know how to still make energy-efficient decisions in their homes.

Another label that appears on appliances is the yellow Energy Guide, managed by the Federal Trade Commission. It lists the estimated annual energy cost ($) and electricity use (kilowatt/hour), and shows a scale comparing the product to similar models. While useful for reference, it’s important to remember that these are based on national averages, and your costs may increase if you use the appliance more or live in an area with higher average living costs.

The Consortium of Energy Efficiency places energy-efficient appliances on a Tier List from 1 through 4, with Tier 1 being equivalent to the minimum EnergySTAR standards, and Tiers 2, 3, and 4 showcasing increasing exceptional performance. While they don’t provide stickers on products, CEE has an online directory, where you can check the tier rating once you find an appliance you like and are thinking of buying.

Finally, the U.S Department of Energy and organizations like SoCalGas have guides on saving energy and electrical costs in your home. These include tips for buying new appliances, such as looking for blue-flame gas stoves or testing the seal on fridge doors. There’s advice for improving the energy usage of your current appliances, like adjusting your thermostat when away from home.

Even regular cleaning of appliances can ensure they are working as efficiently and safely as possible. A 2022 study by researchers at San Jose State University found that the most impactful way for consumers to cut energy usage and costs isn’t by changing out older appliances for more energy efficient new ones but by changing their own behavior in terms of energy consumption choices based on household profile, no matter what equipment they have.

Although it’s discouraging to see the EnergySTAR program potentially cut, it’s valuable for households to make an effort to improve their energy usage or buy energy-efficient appliances, in whatever steps possible for them.

Basically — very basically — gas engines have lower rpm limits and narrower torque bands than electric motors and have to use gears to make up for it.
That also affects engine torque, because if an engine is spinning too slowly, it won't be able to draw in enough fuel/air to make adequate amounts of power.
The second gear ratio of roughly 8:1 is for enhanced efficiency and is actually used for most driving.
Toyota and Ford both have patents for EV transmissions that can make it feel as if you're shifting for yourself.","Even though North America is being left behind when it comes to EV sales, there's no doubt customer tastes have begun to shift on a global basis. But what's not being shifted are the vehicles themselves. With a few rare exceptions, EVs don't have multi-speed gearboxes, and that's because they just don't need them. To understand why, however, let's first look at what traditional transmissions do in cars with internal combustion engines.

It all starts with how fast those engines can spin and when those rpm produce peak torque. Basically — very basically — gas engines have lower rpm limits and narrower torque bands than electric motors and have to use gears to make up for it. The lower rpm limits are a factor of physics, since the engine's part can only move so fast before causing wear and damage, and the engine's valves can't properly adjust the fuel-air mixture once they exceed a certain speed. That also affects engine torque, because if an engine is spinning too slowly, it won't be able to draw in enough fuel/air to make adequate amounts of power.

By their nature, electric motors can deliver full torque almost immediately, plus they can spin at up to 30,000 rpm. Let's do some small amount of math to show how all this works.

We're going to take our lead — and our numbers — from Engineering Explained. First, keep in mind that it's not that EVs have no gears, it's that their transmissions use a single gear. The car from Engineering Explained, for instance, is from Formula E, home of some of the best racing on the planet, and has a gear ratio of 11.4:1. This means the motor has to spin 11.4 times for the wheels to turn once. With the motor having a redline of 20,000 rpm, and taking into account the tire circumference, the result is a top speed of about 225 kph (140 mph).

If a gas engine has the same gear ratio 11.4:1, its lower redline — say, 6,000 rpm — would only be good for a speed of 67.5 kph (42 mph). If you wanted to go 140 mph, and who wouldn't, the gear ratio would have to be 3.4:1 using the same formula. Yet if you wanted to putter around the neighborhood in your gas car at 20 kph (12 mph), the same ratio would mean your engine would be sputtering at a mere 530 rpm — not fast enough for normal operation. So that's two different gears for two ends of the speed spectrum, and more are used for optimum driving at other velocities. The electric motor, remember, makes peak torque even while running at low rpm, and with no worries about air or fuel, allowing you to use the same ratio at any speed.

Of course, that doesn't mean EV motors can't be used with multi-speed transmissions. The original Tesla Roadster had a two-speed transmission when it debuted in 2008, and today, the Porsche Taycan Turbo trims — which, to be clear, are EVs without turbochargers — and the Audi e-tron GT, which rides on the same platform, have two-speed setups.

In the Taycan, the first has a ratio of about 15:1 and is meant for maximum acceleration. It more than delivers, too, as the Turbo S takes a mere 2.8 seconds to move from 0 to 62 mph. The second gear ratio of roughly 8:1 is for enhanced efficiency and is actually used for most driving. You have to put the Porsche into Sport or Sport Plus modes to enjoy first gear.

And for next-level thrills, track-day fans will love the Taycan Turbo GT that upgrades performance to lower its 0-60 time to 2.1 seconds (with the available Weissach Pack). The Audi variants aren't quite as quick, with the RS e-tron setting the pace with a mark of 2.4 seconds in the 0-60 sprint. True, that's a fairly pricey pair of cars, but people with more normal budgets can take heart. Toyota and Ford both have patents for EV transmissions that can make it feel as if you're shifting for yourself.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/why-most-electric-cars-dont-need-a-traditional-transmission/l-intro-1754777171.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 21:02:25.513667

Shipments from Hyundai Motor Group’s EV plant in Georgia — Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA) — have been declining for three consecutive months this year, according to auto industry sources on Sunday.

Ioniq 5 shipments fell from 8,074 units in April to 6,292 in May, 3,558 in June and 2,641 in July. Ioniq 9 shipments slid from 2,382 units in May to 1,803 in June and 670 in July.

Kia’s U.S.-made EV6 and EV9 models have also seen declines since May, with the EV6 falling from 1,800 to 1,300 to 880 units and the EV9 from 3,800 to 3,250 to 1,600 units during the same period this year.

Production is being throttled back in anticipation of weakening demand following the end of federal tax credits, according to industry observers. The U.S. government currently offers up to $7,500 in credits for EV purchases, but under the Donald Trump administration’s recently announced “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” the end date has been moved up from December 2032 to Sept. 30 of this year.

A Federation of Korean Industries report last month estimated that early termination of the credit could slash EV sales by U.S.-based manufacturers by 37 percent annually, or about 310,000 units. Sales by Korean carmakers could drop by up to 45,000 units, or $1.96 billion in revenue.

Hyundai appears poised to offset the slowdown in U.S. EV demand with hybrids. While EV shipments have fallen, hybrid output remains steady. The Santa Fe Hybrid produced at Hyundai’s Alabama plant recorded shipments this year of 5,357 units in May, 7,579 in June and 6,888 in July. From next year, HMGMA, currently an EV-only facility, will begin producing hybrids as well, enabling flexible output based on demand.

Carmakers are also aggressively marketing to capture what they see as a “golden hour” for purchases before the credit ends. Tesla’s U.S. website opens with a notice reading, “$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending, Limited Inventory — Take Delivery Now.”

EV maker Rivian is promoting its models with the message, “Lock in the $7,500 EV lease credit before it's gone,” while Ford Motor is extending free home charger installation on certain EV models through Sept. 30.

The push is giving EV sales a short-term boost. According to Cox Automotive, cited in a recent CNBC report, U.S. EV sales in July this year reached 130,100 units — the second-highest monthly total on record after December 2024’s 136,000.

In the longer term, automakers are moving to lower EV prices to make them competitive without subsidies, especially against internal combustion and hybrid vehicles.

Ford Motor announced plans on Monday to produce a midsize electric pickup truck and crossover SUV at its Louisville, Kentucky, plant, with the pickup starting at $30,000 — well below the $54,780 starting price of the F-150 Lightning. The cost reduction will be achieved through a new flexible EV platform and the use of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in budget models.

General Motors (GM) is also planning to reintroduce its entry-level EV Chevrolet Bolt equipped with LFP batteries at a price in the $30,000 range. The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 7 that GM will use LFP batteries for its most affordable EVs to maintain price competitiveness.

Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.

Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.

Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.

“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.

Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”

But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.

“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.

The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.

The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.

Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Effective immediately and running until 31 December 2030, the framework outlines the process for national aid applications, which remain subject to European Commission approval.

For the first time, EU governments are permitted to subsidise electricity costs for heavy industry. If implemented effectively, these measures could help European businesses gain greater access to the competitive and climate benefits of solar-based electrification. Crucially, the framework ensures that support applies equally across all forms of electricity procurement—on-site solar PV, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and traditional supply contracts—maintaining a level playing field. At the same time, stakeholders have cautioned that subsidies should not artificially lower fossil fuel costs at the expense of affordable renewable energy, which remains the structural solution to competitive energy prices.

The rules are particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Unlike in the past, SMEs will no longer be required to go through complex auction processes to install rooftop solar, reducing barriers to clean energy adoption. Utility-scale PV installations also remain eligible for aid even during periods of negative pricing, provided they are curtailed and do not feed electricity into the grid.

However, the framework leaves significant gaps for solar manufacturers. The temporary support offered for electricity costs of existing heavy industries does not appear to extend to new solar manufacturing projects. Industry voices are urging the Commission to take further steps by leveraging the EU budget to establish a Clean Tech Manufacturing Bank, including a Solar Manufacturing Facility.

While ESG initiatives remain a cornerstone of long-term sustainability, the risk of regulatory backlash—exemplified by the Texas probe—demands a recalibration of investment strategies.","The 2024 Texas wildfires—specifically the Smokehouse Creek and Windy Deuce Fires—have ignited a regulatory and financial firestorm for utility companies, exposing the volatile interplay between ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives and public safety. As Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's investigation into Xcel Energy, Osmose Utilities Services, and Southwestern Public Services Company unfolds, the case study underscores a critical question for investors: Can ESG-aligned energy stocks withstand the growing scrutiny of regulatory bodies prioritizing infrastructure reliability over ideological agendas?

The Texas Wildfire Probe: A Regulatory Flashpoint

The Smokehouse Creek Fire, which burned over 1 million acres and destroyed hundreds of homes, was traced to a snapped utility pole operated by Xcel Energy. While the company admitted its facilities “appear to have been involved” in the ignition, it denied negligence. However, Paxton's investigation has shifted the narrative, alleging that ESG and DEI priorities may have diverted attention from infrastructure maintenance. This aligns with broader anti-ESG rhetoric in Texas, where regulators have targeted financial institutions for “radical climate agendas” and pushed banks to abandon the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.

The financial fallout is already severe. Xcel Energy faces $300 million in damage claims, with insurance coverage capped at $500 million. Its stock price plummeted 4.5% following the probe's announcement, and its market capitalization has since fallen to $28 billion—its lowest since 2018. Subsidiary Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) and Osmose Utilities Services are also under fire, with lawsuits alleging failure to maintain critical infrastructure.

Historical Precedents: ESG Litigation and Financial Exposure

The Texas case is not an isolated incident. Regulatory actions against ESG missteps have grown increasingly punitive. In 2022, the SEC secured a $55.9 million settlement from a Brazilian mining company for misrepresenting environmental safety practices after a dam collapse. Similarly, shareholder lawsuits against companies like Enviva Inc. (accused of greenwashing) and Danimer Scientific (over biodegradability claims) highlight the legal risks of overstating ESG commitments.

The SEC's Climate and ESG Task Force, established in 2021, has intensified scrutiny of climate-related disclosures. A 2022 court ruling in Moab Partners v. Macquarie reinforced the materiality of omitting regulatory risks, such as impending environmental laws, in financial filings. For utilities, this means underestimating the impact of ESG-linked regulations—or failing to disclose them—could lead to costly litigation.

The Investment Dilemma: Hedging Against ESG Volatility

The Texas probe exemplifies a broader trend: regulators are increasingly weaponizing ESG frameworks to hold companies accountable for tangible harms, such as wildfires, rather than abstract sustainability goals. For investors, this raises two critical concerns:

1. Regulatory Uncertainty: Anti-ESG legislation in states like Florida and Texas, coupled with federal proposals to restrict ESG considerations in retirement funds, creates a fragmented regulatory landscape.

2. Financial Exposure: Companies prioritizing ESG initiatives over operational safety risk lawsuits, fines, and reputational damage. The $240 million settlement in the Signet Jewelers case (over DEI misstatements) illustrates how ESG-related litigation can erode shareholder value.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Divest from High-Risk ESG-Linked Utilities: Companies with aggressive ESG commitments but weak infrastructure maintenance records (e.g., Xcel Energy) should be scrutinized. The Texas probe demonstrates that ESG initiatives can backfire if they compromise operational safety.

Hedge with Energy Infrastructure Firms: Invest in utilities with robust regulatory compliance frameworks and diversified energy portfolios. These firms are better positioned to navigate evolving ESG regulations without sacrificing reliability.

Monitor Regulatory Developments: Track state-level anti-ESG legislation and federal climate disclosure rules. For example, the SEC's proposed climate risk reporting standards could force utilities to disclose liabilities previously hidden in opaque ESG reports.

Conclusion: The ESG Paradox in Energy

The Texas wildfires have laid bare the fragility of ESG-aligned energy stocks in a regulatory environment increasingly skeptical of ideological commitments over tangible outcomes. While ESG initiatives remain a cornerstone of long-term sustainability, the risk of regulatory backlash—exemplified by the Texas probe—demands a recalibration of investment strategies. For now, hedging or divesting from high-risk ESG-linked utilities appears prudent, as the market reckons with the reality that ESG is no longer a shield against accountability.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-17 03:00:57.771984

The deal includes all intellectual property, related technologies, a planned pilot production facility, and members of SAFFiRE’s leadership team. Financial details were not shared.

The acquisition gives Conestoga access to SAFFiRE’s exclusive license for a pretreatment technology developed at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab. The process converts corn stover, a common agricultural by-product in the U.S., into ethanol with an extremely low carbon footprint.

The pilot plant will be built alongside Conestoga’s Arkalon Energy facility in Liberal, Kansas, and is expected to start operations in 2026. The project will help the company move forward with larger-scale commercial production facilities based on lessons learned during the pilot phase.

SAFFiRE’s production process uses a range of agricultural feedstocks to make low-carbon intermediates for several end products, including ethanol for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The method works at low temperatures and normal pressure, uses standard industry equipment, and delivers strong results with fewer enzyme requirements. It also avoids many of the challenges faced by older cellulosic biofuel production methods.

“This move puts us in a strong position to help meet the aviation industry’s urgent need for sustainable fuel while opening new opportunities for American farmers,” said Tom Willis, CEO of Conestoga Energy.

Key members of SAFFiRE’s team will also join Conestoga, including Chief Technology Officer Marykate O’Brien and Director of Engineering Nitin Kolhapure.

The announcement comes shortly after Conestoga completed drilling its first Class VI well near its Bonanza BioEnergy ethanol plant in Garden City, Kansas.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful.
Stripping out requirements The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers.
As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project.
""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises.","The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures, that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it.

The Department of Transportation froze the funds in February, and months passed with no indication of when funding would be restarted. A coalition of more than a dozen states sued the federal government, alleging that the administration was violating the law and defying the will of Congress. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements.

Officials made it clear they haven't changed their minds about the merits of funding chargers — but they're acknowledging the separation of powers that give Congress, not the executive branch, authority over spending decisions.

""While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the states' lawsuit against the freeze, said it was ""encouraging"" news that the administration is restarting the program. But, he said, it's not an automatic end to the legal challenge.

""It is promising that we're seeing some responses to our lawsuit and we're seeing some effort to give us the money that Congress has mandated,"" he told NPR. ""We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately.""

Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause.

""It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,"" Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement.

Stripping out requirements

The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers. To access the funds, states had to submit a plan for where and how they would build chargers. Once the plan was approved, each state's department of transportation would work with companies to install chargers, and then get reimbursed by the federal government.

It took more than two years after the law's passage for the first chargers to open to the public. As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project. But after the slow start, the same dataset shows that funding awards were accelerating through 2024 — until the Trump administration hit the brakes.

The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from ""a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy.""

The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. States will no longer be required to engage with rural or underserved communities while planning charger locations. They do not need to direct benefits toward disadvantaged communities. They don't need to demonstrate that they've factored in labor or safety standards, or provided opportunities for minority-owned businesses. They won't need to address evacuations, snow removal or extreme weather in their plans.

Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. States will have more discretion on charger locations.

The DOT didn't respond to NPR's requests for an interview. But in a statement posted on the department's website, Duffy said this new guidance would speed things up. ""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let's cut the waste and do it right,"" he wrote. ""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.""

Mixed reviews from the EV charger world

Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies.

""We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape,"" wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. ""Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs.""

The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was ""encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers.""

""We're optimistic,"" says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. ""They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program."" He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space.

Of course, removing some requirements won't eliminate the need to find locations and contract with builders and pull permits, all of which takes time.

And there's a common refrain in the EV charger world: While people don't mind the changes to the guidance, they are frustrated by the delay and disruption they caused.

Alex Laska of Third Way — who had been sharply critical of the inefficiencies of the Biden program — gave mixed reviews to the Trump administration revisions. He noted that some forms of ""red tape,"" like requirements about the type of charger, remain.

And other requirements have been deleted after states had already completed the work to meet them, meaning it won't actually save any time or effort.

Aside from loosening the requirements on location, the change is ""kind of a nothingburger,"" he says. ""This guidance was not worth holding up the program for, you know, now over half a year.""

Andrew Bennett, the CEO of DRIIVZ, a company that builds software for charging stations, says the freeze disrupted a lot of projects that might have gotten greenlit this year.

In the meantime, while chargers have been built with private money, Bennett says, it's not enough: ""We need about six times more just to keep up.""

Lost opportunities mean lost jobs, reduced tax base, and diminished competitiveness.” These two plans are on top of the company’s existing Clean Heat Plan, Transportation Electrification Plan, Wildfire Mitigation Plan, Demand Side Management/Beneficial Electrification Plan, as well as its $1.7 billion Power Pathway project.
Xcel said it plans to invest $22.3 billion in energy in Colorado from 2025 through 2029.
A public comment session on Xcel Energy’s $4.9 billion Distribution System Plan will be held from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, August 26.","Colorado’s largest utility company is proposing a $4.9 billion plan to modernize the power grid, accommodating vehicle and building electrification, as well as distributed electric generation and storage.

The goal, Xcel Energy added, includes enhancing reliability, resiliency, and safety benefits, as required by a recently adopted state law.

The five-year plan is expected to cost Colorado residential ratepayers approximately $8.71 more per month, while business customers will pay about $10.24 more per month by 2029.

The grid modernization plan includes adding 3.1 gigawatts of new capacity to the distribution system, which the company said would be enough to serve nearly 500,000 homes, along with 100 new or replaced distribution substation transformers, 36 substations and more than 300 new feeder lines by 2029.

“The projects in this plan reimagine a grid that can proactively meet the rapidly evolving electrification expectations and needs of our customers and communities — today and in the future — in a safe, reliable, affordable and equitable manner,” Robert Kenney, president of Xcel Energy-Colorado, said in the release.

In addition to this plan, Xcel is seeking approval for Phase 1 of its “Just Transition” energy resource plan, which proposes building 5,000 megawatts of new generation at an as-of-yet-unknown cost to meet predicted future demand increases resulting from factors such as artificial intelligence, data centers and vehicle electrification.

The Metro Mayors Caucus, which represents 38 municipalities across the metro Denver area, sent a letter to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission this week asking it to support Xcel’s request for new generation. The letter stated that Colorado risks power shortages, higher costs, economic slowdowns, and setbacks in clean energy if the utility’s capacity request is not approved.

“Large employers like advanced manufacturers, clean technology companies, and data centers require guaranteed power before committing to a site,” said the group’s chair, Broomfield Mayor Guyleen Castriotta. “Competitor states such as Texas, Utah, Arizona, and North Carolina are actively building capacity to win these projects. Lost opportunities mean lost jobs, reduced tax base, and diminished competitiveness.”

These two plans are on top of the company’s existing Clean Heat Plan, Transportation Electrification Plan, Wildfire Mitigation Plan, Demand Side Management/Beneficial Electrification Plan, as well as its $1.7 billion Power Pathway project.

The latter is currently in progress in eastern Colorado. It seeks to provide high-voltage transmission backbone to bring distributed renewable energy on the eastern plains, such as wind and solar, to the power grid to serve the metro Denver area’s increasing power needs.

Trump halts $27.6 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects: How will it impact the broader clean energy industry?","Donald Trump’s return to the presidency in January 2025 has created an abrupt disruption in the United States’ clean energy manufacturing sector. Trump halts $27.6 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects, according to data from Wellesley College’s Big Green Machine. This shift coincides with rising tariffs, subsidy reversals, and legislative rollbacks targeting solar, wind, battery, and electric vehicle investments.

How Severe Is the Slowdown?

The Big Green Machine reports that in the first six months following Trump’s inauguration, 26 clean energy manufacturing projects, totaling $27.6 billion in capital and nearly 18,849 jobs, were paused, canceled, or closed. Meanwhile, just 29 new projects were launched, worth $3 billion and creating 8,334 jobs.

By contrast, in the same period of 2024, 54 new projects generated $15.9 billion in investments and over 25,900 jobs, while just eight projects valued at $4.1 billion were halted, affecting 3,820 jobs.

Why Disadvantaged Communities Bear the Brunt of This Impact

Trump halts $27.6 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects, which disproportionately affect disadvantaged regions. According to the Wellesley report, these communities account for 70 percent of slowed investment compared to 30 percent for non-disadvantaged areas. This exacerbates existing inequality by removing economic opportunities where they are most needed.

What Policy Shifts Are Driving These Disruptions?

The slowdown stems from a cascade of policy changes, including:

A massive rollback of federal support, impacting loans, grants, and tax incentives previously used to fuel clean energy manufacturing.

The One Big Beautiful Bill that accelerates the phase-out of renewable energy tax credits and tightens eligibility for funding.

High tariffs, such as a 93.5 percent levy on graphite imports, inflate the cost of critical EV battery components.

Cuts to programs like Solar for All and cancellations of offshore wind leasing in federal waters.

These measures have created an unstable policy environment that undermines investor confidence and throttles project momentum.

What Was Once a Boom Is Stalling Across the Clean Energy Economy

Beyond the headline figures, broader analyses show even more profound disruption:

A climate advocacy group reports 20,000 clean energy jobs lost, with an additional 40,000 at risk, spanning nearly 100 projects worth over $71 billion in solar, wind, battery, and hydrogen manufacturing.

Environmental organization E2 estimates 35 projects cancelled or downsized, resulting in $22 billion in lost investments and 16,500 jobs lost, particularly in the electric vehicle and battery sectors.

Industry analysis additionally signals a sharp decline in renewables deployment over the next decade, with up to $263 billion in renewable infrastructure and $110 billion in manufacturing investments at risk.

The governor’s current stance on Solar for All contrasts starkly with praise his administration had for the program last year.
“Through this program, Louisiana can create a sustainable foundation for long-term impact and benefit for those most threatened and most in need,” Gray said last year.","(Louisiana Illuminator) – Gov. Jeff Landry is voicing a change of heart regarding the Solar for All program, launched under President Joe Biden to provide cleaner power and reduce electric bills for some 900,000 low-income Americans.

After his administration initially supported plans for the $156 million given to Louisiana in April 2024 – and dubbed the state’s initiative Solar for Y’all – the governor now considers the program a “green pipe dream” of the left that he says would bleed taxpayers and drive up electricity rates.

The Trump administration announced last week it was ending the $7 billion Solar for All program. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed in a social media post Friday that Congress “eliminated” the Solar for All program in Republicans’ recent tax and spending law, labeling it a “grift” from which middlemen have profited with very few projects having materialized.

Until Zeldin’s announcement, the Landry administration seemed fully onboard with the program. It saw the money as another pool of federal resources to put into storm resiliency and energy infrastructure.

On Monday, however, the governor quickly turned against the solar program.

Landry took to social media to criticize the program and made similar comments when the Illuminator asked what he would say to Louisiana companies and community organizations that have already invested in the initiative.

“The left’s green schemes have only resulted in higher bills, weaker grids, and more debt,” Landry said Wednesday through a spokesperson. “Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Administrator Zeldin we are ending wasteful spending and putting America first.”

There’s no data to back up the governor’s claims because Solar for Y’all projects have yet to take shape. Although the federal funds had been allocated to Louisiana, the state was still in the process of creating its program when Trump halted the grant with an executive order shortly after taking office in January.

The governor’s current stance on Solar for All contrasts starkly with praise his administration had for the program last year.

Tyler Gray, Landry’s handpicked secretary of the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, described Solar for All as a unique opportunity to build backup power systems in areas of the state at high risk from hurricanes and severe storms.

“Louisiana is in a uniquely positioned to benefit from this federal investment, with so much of its population in the areas of highest risk for devastating storms, such as Hurricanes Ida and Laura in recent years, that create widespread and long-lasting power outages,” Gray stated in an April 22, 2024 news release.

Backups for storm power outages in question

Created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Solar for All has spurred major investments in traditional and clean energy production in Republican-controlled states. The solar grants, one of many components of the law, provided funding to state agencies, municipalities, tribal governments and nonprofit organizations to deliver affordable energy to low-income households.

The Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources was among its 60 grant recipients. A portion of its $156 million was slotted to pay for solar panels on single-family homes and small multifamily units, with the goal of helping residents save a minimum of 20% on their utility bills. Paired with battery storage systems, the household solar arrays were intended to reduce household grid dependence during peak electricity demand.

Solar for Y’all also planned to offer low-interest loans for community solar projects, which provide neighborhood-level emergency backup power and can sell extra electricity to the larger grid.

Gray expressed support for using the federal money for these local solar hubs, which would help communities avoid long power outages after hurricanes and other severe weather. In 2021, the average Louisiana utility customer experienced more than 80 hours of power outages as a result of extreme weather, compared with a national average of seven hours, according to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

“Through this program, Louisiana can create a sustainable foundation for long-term impact and benefit for those most threatened and most in need,” Gray said last year.

Local solar hubs have already gained traction. The nonprofit civic and church coalition Together Louisiana has so far helped develop 15 “community lighthouses” and envisions more than 80 total around the state. Its idea caught on in 2021 after many household gas and diesel generators ran out of fuel or broke down in the wake of Hurricane Ida. The initiative is funded with a mix of federal, state, local and private dollars.

One such “lighthouse” is at a Catholic convent in New Orleans East, where the Sisters of the Holy Family live and work. The nuns have been working with Together New Orleans to lease out an adjacent tract of land for the development of a separate, larger-scale community “solar garden.” The solar garden, which is slightly smaller than a solar farm, would deliver power to about 700 nearby homes in the low-income area.

The convent project was counting on a loan from Solar for Y’all to help pay for the $15 million solar garden, according to Nathalie Jordi, a New Orleans hotel owner who is helping develop the project. With planning completed and construction contracts secured, the convent solar garden was likely going to be the program’s pilot project, she said.

“This kinda pulls out the rug from all of us,” Jordi said. “It’s definitely a stressful time.”

The developers have been able to find financing elsewhere and are on track to close their loan this month.

Economic models expected the $156 million in federal funding would be paired with roughly $74 million in private capital, according to the Louisiana Clean Energy Fund, a nonprofit grant subrecipient that was going to manage solar program loans. The Gulf States Renewable Energy Industries Association estimated the $156 million in federal money would yield a total economic impact between $468 million and $780 million in Louisiana.

Louisiana could keep federal dollars

Although the Trump administration claims Solar for All was repealed, Congress rescinded only the funds that had not been obligated at the time the One Big Beautiful Bill was approved, according to lawyers with the program.

The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation’s fiscal impact at the time and determined only $19 million was still uncommitted. The vast majority of the Solar for All funds, including the $156 million slated for Louisiana, was already allocated through contracts with the grant recipients.

Attorneys for nonprofit groups invested in the program are urging grant recipients to enforce those contracts.

Jillian Blanchard, an attorney with the advocacy group Lawyers for Good Government, said language in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is very clear — it does not touch obligated funds. The Trump administration knows it would probably lose in court, so they make these shocking announcements just to try to scare the grant recipients into folding, she said.

“This is legally completely unfounded what they’re doing,” Blanchard said. “It’s really, really important for states, no matter their political leanings, to protect the rule of law …This should not be a political analysis by the state. This should be pure economics.”

Blanchard said Louisiana could easily keep the money if Gov. Landry wanted it. The state has just less than three weeks left to file a legal challenge against the EPA’s decision, she said.

If the state refuses to act, Blanchard said grant subrecipients could mount their own legal challenges against the Trump administration.

“They’re setting a terrible precedent right now for businesses and industries,” she said. “If this [president] does not stand by its contracts and promises … complete markets are created and ruined by these types of things. … For people who care about this, now’s the time to make their voices heard.”

Virtual Power Plants: Where Home Batteries are Saving Americans from Blackouts (msn.com)

Puerto Rico expects 93 different power outages this summer, reports the Washington Post.

But they also note that ""roughly 1 in 10 Puerto Rican homes now have a battery and solar array for backup power"" which have also ""become a crucial source of backup power for the entire island grid."" A network of 69,000 home batteries can generate as much electricity as a small natural gas turbine during an emergency, temporarily covering about 2 percent of the island's energy needs when things go wrong... ""It has very, very certainly prevented more widespread outages,"" said Daniel Haughton, [transmission and distribution planning director for Puerto Rico's grid operator]. ""In the instances that we had to [cut power], it was for a much shorter duration: A four-hour outage became a one- or two-hour outage.""

Puerto Rico's experience offers a glimpse into the future for the rest of the United States, where batteries are starting to play a big role in keeping the lights on. Authorities in Texas, California and New England have credited home batteries with preventing blackouts during summer energy crunches. As power grids across the country groan under the increasing strain of new data centers, factories and EVs, batteries offer a way for homeowners to protect themselves — and all of their neighbors — from the threat of outages. Batteries have been booming in the U.S. since 2022, when Congress created generous installation tax credits for homeowners and power companies.

Home batteries generally come as an option alongside rooftop solar panels, according to Christopher Rauscher, head of grid services and electrification for Sunrun, a company that installs both. More than 70 percent of the people who hire Sunrun to put up solar panels also get a battery. With the tax credits — and the money saved on rising electricity costs — solar panels and batteries make financial sense for most American homes, according to a study Stanford University scientists published Aug. 1. About 60 percent of homes would save money in the long run with solar panels and batteries...

Those batteries can have broader benefits, too. Utilities pay customers hundreds of dollars a year to sign their batteries up to form ""virtual power plants,"" which send electricity to the grid whenever power plants can't keep up with demand. California's network of home batteries can now add 535 megawatts of electricity in an emergency — about half as much energy as a nuclear power plant...

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!

The U.S. White House has finally released the five billion dollars in NEVI funding it had held hostage for more than six months… because politics.

Back in February, shortly after taking office, President Trump froze large portions of previously approved funding for green energy and transportation projects, attacking his predecessor and spreading misleading claims about EVs and clean energy. Many questioned whether this was legal, and multiple states sued to get the funds released. This week, the U.S. Department of Transportation finally freed the money, along with new guidance on how it should be spent. Requirements for consumer protections, emergency plans, and environmental concerns are gone, as are rules ensuring stations serve rural, underserved, and disadvantaged areas. Maximum distance rules between stations have also been removed, meaning how appropriate the funded infrastructure is… will depend on the individual states.

Sticking with U.S. news, the Department of Energy has announced up to one billion dollars in funding to advance domestic mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies for critical minerals and materials.

The funding includes one hundred thirty-five million dollars for domestic rare earth supply chains, fifty million dollars to accelerate refining of rare earth magnets and other metals, and five hundred million dollars for battery raw materials mining, refining, and recycling — some of which will support EV and semiconductor industries. It also sets aside two hundred fifty million dollars for materials recovery at fossil fuel production facilities, including coal operations. While the administration hails this as a win for the U.S., it’s worth noting that the one billion dollars is far smaller than the roughly thirty-five billion dollars earmarked under President Biden for domestic supply chain development and EV production.

We’re heading north of the forty-ninth parallel now to Canada, where the Canadian government has announced a new funding program for zero-emission vehicles.

As confirmed on Wednesday, Natural Resources Canada has approved more than twenty-five million Canadian dollars in funding for thirty-three new projects aimed at improving EV charging availability, decarbonizing freight transportation, and accelerating the adoption of medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks. The funding is split between nine point seven million Canadian dollars to install eight hundred fifty new EV chargers across Canada, eight million dollars for the Energy Innovation Program for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and nearly eight million dollars for NRCan’s Green Freight Program.Well done, Canada! And as someone who finally got her Canadian passport, all I can say is: elbows up to the nonsense from south of the border!

It’s small, it’s cute, and no longer sold new — but the Smart ForTwo ED, unfortunate suffix and all, remains one of my favorite electric runabouts of the past fifteen years.

If you own a 451-series Smart ED3 built between twenty twelve and twenty fifteen, you’ll be frustrated to hear that this week Mercedes-Benz confirmed it has run out of replacement battery packs. The packs used German-made Li-Tec cells, from a factory Daimler bought outright in twenty fourteen and shut down a year later, leaving only a limited stock. That’s a problem, because the ED3 has a known flaw: if the 12-volt battery fails, the main pack can drain beyond recovery. With no new packs available, these cheerful city cars risk the same fate as other orphaned EVs. The silver lining? A few independent specialists can still repair or rebuild your pack — but it’ll be aftermarket, and you might not have one nearby.

Sticking with batteries, we learned this week that both BMW and GM may temporarily source Chinese-made packs for U.S.-built EVs.

According to the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, GM plans to import CATL-made lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries from China for its soon-to-launch Chevrolet Bolt EV. While the long-term goal is to produce LFP cells domestically, the move would let GM start Bolt production before its U.S. cell plant comes online. Similarly, Automotive News reports that BMW is weighing the import of Chinese-made cells for future U.S.-built EVs. BMW’s planned South Carolina battery plant—developed with partner AESC—recently saw construction halted, with AESC allegedly scrapping its U.S. build in favor of making cells in China and selling them to BMW. Neither automaker has confirmed the reports, but if true, it will be a blow to the idea of domestic EV battery production.

Zero Motorcycles has been a leading name in the electric motorcycle world for more than a decade. While the brand has consistently pushed the envelope with rapid innovation, its bikes have always carried a premium price.

Late last year, Zero unveiled its X-line of electric motorcycles and mopeds, aiming to provide a more cost-effective option. This week, the company celebrated the start of deliveries — the first Zero models to be produced in China. Primarily designed as off-road machines for adventure and all-terrain riding, the new X-line leans heavily into Zero’s dirt-bike heritage. Street legality will depend on where you live: in the U.S., they’re sold strictly off-road, while in Europe, buyers can register them for road use.With torque-focused gearing and a top speed of around fifty miles per hour (eighty kilometers per hour), these bikes are clearly built to ride hard off-road, not to handle the daily commute.

As we previewed last week, Ford held a live-streamed event on Monday promoting its next “Model-T Moment” — the Ford Universal EV Platform.

The Louisville, Kentucky event revealed little about the first vehicle on the platform, except that it will be a mid-size pickup with a starting price of thirty thousand dollars, RAV4-like interior space, Mustang EcoBoost-level performance, and a structural LFP battery pack. Thanks to significant weight savings in its design, Ford says the truck will deliver roughly the same range as today’s models while using a pack two-thirds the size of current vehicles. On the production side, Ford’s Universal EV Platform uses a new methodology with large single-cast components and parallel assembly lines that merge near the end. While Ford portrayed it as revolutionary, Tesla, Rivian, and many Chinese automakers have been using similar techniques for years. We can expect more details on the first model — the truck — in the coming months.

Aided by an administration keen to roll back clean-air and pro-EV policies, Daimler Truck, International Motors, Paccar, and the Volvo Group have sued California over its Clean Truck Partnership program.

The companies argue the state lacks authority to enforce heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards and say the Advanced Clean Trucks rule and other regulations harm their ability to design, develop, manufacture, and sell trucks and engines. They’re seeking a declaratory judgment against the Governor and the California Air Resources Board, plus injunctive relief. The lawsuit follows a twenty twenty-three agreement between the truck makers and CARB, which President Trump asked the FTC to investigate as anticompetitive. Before the suit, the Justice Department told the companies to stop complying with California’s rules, claiming they conflicted with federal law. Whether pressured to sue or not, the result is the same: fewer electric trucks — exactly what the government wants.

Adding to the pushback on EVs, German business newspaper Handelsblatt published an interview this week with Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius (Shel-eh-nyoos) — and he seems less convinced about EVs than before.

Warning that the EU’s planned ban on new internal combustion engine vehicles in ten years could “implode” the auto industry, shel-eh-nyoos argued that ICEs still need to exist for the transition to work. He called for a “reality check,” acknowledging the need to decarbonize the auto industry but insisting it must be done in a “technology-neutral” way. Mercedes-Benz has recently signaled a step back from EVs, ending U.S. sales of EQE and EQS-based vehicles and citing Trump-era tariffs and the end of EV incentives as the reason. While the company may still plan future EV models, the message is clear: automakers are again trying to prolong the life of polluting vehicles, leaving the consequences for everyone else to deal with.

I hate being right. When fossil fuel giant Shell acquired the ad-supported charging network Volta a few years back, all of us at the channel sounded the alarm.

Volta stood out from most charging networks by installing Level 2 stations at easily accessible public locations and offsetting costs with electronic billboards. This model gave EV owners heavily discounted — or even free — charging, making it especially popular with drivers without off-street parking. Volta also installed more stations in historically underserved neighborhoods, improving access to EV infrastructure. But after a few years of rebranding these stations under the Shell name, the oil giant has announced it will remove its Level 2 Volta chargers. Over the next four months, more than two thousand stations will be taken offline across the U.S., replaced with high-speed chargers at Shell gas stations. Like I said. I hate being right… We told you so.

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support our show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

The EV world seems awash with range record attempts. First Lucid, then Chevrolet, and now Polestar, each trying to see how far a single charge can really take them.

This week, a Polestar 3, driven by hypermiling experts Sam Clarke, Kevin Booker, and Richard Parker, covered 581.3 miles (925.4 km) on a single charge in a stock Polestar 3 Long Range Single Rear Motor. The nearly 23-hour journey, on public roads in and around my home county of Norfolk, UK, because Norfolk’s kinda flat (unless you’re going up Gas Hill), averaged about 25 mph (40 km/h) for the entire run. While it’s fantastic to see people pushing the boundaries of electric mobility, as I noted last week, this is very much an ‘extreme case’ rather than something everyday drivers can expect. And yes, I’m still planning my video on that topic, because while it’s a nerdy thrill and an incredible achievement—and well done, guys, by the way—I’m not convinced the general public always gets it.

And finally,

We’ve got a bit of an ongoing joke on the channel about being the kiss of death for companies. In our time covering cleaner, greener vehicles, I think we’ve featured three or four companies who, shortly after we went and filmed with them , declared bankruptcy.

One of our most recent ‘victims’ was German solar car company Sono Motors. Shortly after bringing its solar electric car prototype to the U.S. for a tour, the company entered insolvency. While it’s been reborn as Sono Solar, ditching plans to make its own EV, it’s not the first time we’ve had that unfortunate timing. Sono’s restructuring left many supporters out in the cold, but for those still dreaming of a Sono Sion, there’s a chance to bid for one: the company’s former automotive assets are being auctioned online until September 9. Ten Sion prototypes are up for grabs, with the most functional starting at six hundred euro. It’d certainly be a different vehicle to drive—and you’d be on your own for licensing, servicing, and everything else. How about it?

And on that note, we’re done for today!

Before I go, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all. Join the EVA today to find out how to become an EV educator, meet like-minded fans, get help to make your own transition to electric – help that includes a low-interest loan program to help finance your next step!

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we’d really appreciate it. YouTube is now a cesspool of AI nonsense and trolls, has yet-again reduced creator ad payout, and while we’d love to host elsewhere there’s not really a good alternative right now (and no, Nebula is invite-only). So right now, Patreon really is our only reliable form of income. If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position. Right now, we’re surviving on the occasional generous stipend that helps boost our coffers, but I’m not going to lie, the lack of YouTube revenue has led to many a sleepless nights. Our team does deserve normal things – like healthcare and a living wage.

I should also note we’re available for third-party video production work in the Portland Oregon area, if you have a business or project you’d like us to work with you on, reach out. You’ll also find merch at our swag store, and amazon affiliate links in this video description or on our website that you can use to support TE when you worship at the altar of Bezos.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

And in closing, some important message.

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what hateful sods try to claim.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

I have no words for the true horror of the current news cycle, especially if you’re in a minority group – and if you’ve needed to turn off the news or take a rest and step back from the outside world, please know that’s okay. It’s important to take care of yourself. So, when you’re feeling better, you can come back, stronger than before, to stand up for decency, community and justice. Don’t let the … you know what… win. Especially JK Trolling. But, because it’s my show and I can do this, I want to quickly add two very special messages to this week’s show.

First, Happy Anniversary to my wonderful wife. Friday marked sixteen years since we officially said “I Do” and then drove off into the sunset in a super-rare nineteen eighties Volkswagen City Stromer. We’ve been a couple far longer – twenty-two years – but it’s good to be officially too.

Second, our love from the team goes to Tom and Peggy – who are not only celebrating their forty-fourth anniversary – and some very good health-related news this week. Thank you both for your ongoing support and awesomeness.

Finally, Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

As always, Keep evolving!",https://www.transportevolved.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ten_545_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 21:01:55.583186

Companies like Tesla and Rivian are reeling from the double-whammy of Trump’s BBB ending the $7,500 Federal EV tax credit early and killing the market for carbon tax credits, which provides EV car brands with hundreds of millions of dollars, almost overnight. Still another part of the bill that’s getting a lot of publicity is the death of the 30% tax credit for home solar systems at the end of 2025, which has led many Americans who have been “on the fence” about adding a solar or solar + storage solution to their home to believe they waited too long to go solar.

The good news? It’s not too late. Homeowners who get solar installed and operational by December 31st can still claim a full 30% federal tax credit for 2025, and any unused portion of that credit rolls over to the next tax year.

The better news? Even without the solar tax credit, adding a home solar system with battery backup storage can still deliver a positive ROI.

Solar benefits go beyond tax credits

The most obvious benefit of home solar plus battery storage is that you can produce your own energy (or, if you’ve been following along for a while, electric fuel) for less than it would cost you to buy that energy from your local utility. That’s been true for a while, but it’s about to become even more true.

Outlets like The Washington Post and The Guardian are predicting that household energy bills in Republican-leaning states could rise by more than $600 next year, based on their analyses of the BBB. One study, by energy and climate think tank Energy Innovation, showed energy prices rising by much as 18% by 2035 as a result of Trump’s policies.

Energy Innovation’s analysis skews left, and tends to focus on “left of zero” outcomes. Still, when the corporatist rags start quoting bad numbers and bear markets, you should probably pay attention. Some of the key takeaways of the EI study include:

Power generation capacity will fall 340 gigawatts by 2035, raising costs to meet growing demand and damaging industrial competitiveness

Wholesale electricity prices will increase 25 percent by 2030 and 74 percent by 2035; electricity rates paid by consumers will increase between 9-18 percent by 2035

Household energy costs will increase $170 annually by 2035

America loses $980 billion in cumulative GDP through the budget reconciliation window

Florida, Texas, Kentucky, and both North and South Carolina stand to be hit the hardest by rising energy costs over the next ten years

Beyond insulating your household budget from rising energy costs, a home solar system can help to insulate your home, too – which means you’ll need less of that lower cost electricity you’re generating to keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter.

That’s not just me saying that. A study by the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego study found that during the day, ceilings under tilted solar panels were about 5°F cooler than exposed ceilings, thanks to the panels acting as a shade and creating an air gap that helps dissipate heat. In cool weather, the panels helped homes retain heat, leading to a dual benefit across multiple seasons.

“There are more efficient ways to passively cool buildings, such as reflective roof membranes,” explains Jan Kleissl, a professor of environmental engineering at UC San Diego. “But, if you are considering installing solar photovoltaic, depending on your roof thermal properties, you can expect a large reduction in the amount of energy you use to cool your residence or business.”

Keeping your own personal costs at bay while putting clean, excess energy that’s not stored in your home batteries back into the grid is a win-win that not only reduces your own energy bills but also puts downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices.

What’s more, because the rising costs of energy prices are outpacing interest rates, it might even make sense to finance a solar package – but definitely don’t take my word for that. Talk to a certified financial planner or someone with a fiduciary interest in your money to work the numbers before you start signing stuff.

The programs help lower energy costs, reduce greenhouse gases and help with transitioning to clean energy sources, and the programs' basic administrative or staffing costs — or indirect costs — have never been subject to a cap before, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit, which was filed Friday in federal court in Eugene, argues that the policy is unlawful, and in capping funding for these particular programs, the Department of Energy is violating federal regulations and jeopardizing the states' ability to keep the programs running.

The ultimate goal is for the court to prevent the cap and restore the programs' reimbursement funds.

“Oregonians count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean, and our bills manageable,” said Rayfield in a statement. “This cap strips away the resources we need to keep that work going — and the people and expertise behind it. We can’t meet Oregon’s energy needs if the federal government pulls critical infrastructure that supports the people and expertise behind this work midstream.”

In 2024, for instance, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal funding to support local clean energy work, with nearly half going to ""essential operating costs,"" such as staff benefits.

According to the report, these lawmakers have accepted over $105 million in political donations from oil and gas companies throughout their careers.

The legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, was signed into law last month and includes significant financial benefits for oil and gas companies while scaling back supportive measures for clean energy initiatives such as electric vehicles and renewable resources, which had been established by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The voting record indicates that nearly all GOP House members and most Republican senators backed the budget bill, including representatives from districts that benefited from the environmentally friendly credits provided by the IRA. Notable figures include Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York and Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Curtis of Utah, both of whom spent considerable time advocating for renewable energy tax credits before shifting their stance to support the budget bill.

The Climate Power report details that House members supporting the bill collectively accepted approximately $54.4 million from the fossil fuel sector, while Senate supporters took in around $51.5 million. The analysis criticized these lawmakers, stating, “These Republicans in Congress are caught red-handed taking massive donations from the oil and gas industry and voting to give them billions while damaging their own state’s clean energy industries.”

With the upcoming midterm elections on the horizon, the analysis also scrutinized fossil fuel donations to 15 House Republicans viewed as vulnerable in their upcoming bids for re-election. It was found that these 15 members accepted over $3 million from the fossil fuel industry despite previously indicating support for clean energy tax credits.

The lawmakers, representing states such as Colorado, Iowa, Arizona, New Jersey, California, Michigan, and New York, are from regions that have reaped the benefits of the IRA’s incentives for renewables and battery manufacturing. The new legislation is projected to jeopardize upwards of 110,000 jobs in these sectors within their districts, while also likely raising consumer energy bills by up to $200 annually by 2030, according to the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation.

Some members on the list, including Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks from Iowa and Jeff Hurd from Colorado, previously criticized the bill yet ultimately voted for it. Miller-Meeks, who accepted nearly $230,000 in oil and gas contributions, had voiced support for clean energy initiatives but diverged on this key piece of legislation. Hurd, despite opposing the bill on Medicaid cuts, also supported the final vote.

Pete Jones, a director at Climate Power, emphasized the expectations of constituents in moderate swing districts, stating, “These members chose who to stand up for, and they picked their billionaire donors.” The findings highlight a potential disconnect between voter priorities and the actions of elected officials benefitting from fossil fuel contributions.

During the last election cycle, the fossil fuel industry reportedly spent an astonishing $445 million to sway Trump and Congress to its interests. This included contributions of over $19 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, illustrating the deep financial ties at play.

Since his return to the White House, Trump has not only advanced the One Big Beautiful Bill Act but has also issued numerous executive orders and policies aimed at undermining clean energy efforts while bolstering the interests of oil and gas companies.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Republican-Lawmakers-Who-Backed-Trumps-Anti-Environment-Bill-Linked-to-Over.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 18:02:53.022412

Residential solar systems still will be able to qualify under prior guidance and the new rules won’t be applied retroactively. Larger projects will be limited to a standard that requires a certain amount of physical construction to qualify for the credits.

“This is much better than expected,” said Phil Shen, a clean energy analyst with Roth Capital Partners, who added the changes were minimal overall.

Sunrun Inc., the nation’s biggest residential solar installer, jumped 33% Friday and home solar equipment provider SolarEdge Technologies Inc. rose 17%. NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest large-scale solar and wind developer, climbed 4%. NexTracker Inc., a solar equipment provider, was up 12%.

The issuing of the rules follows an executive order by President Donald Trump directing the Treasury Department to place new limits on the tax credits, part of an escalating campaign waged by the administration against wind and solar power. The crackdown includes policies that could halt the construction of renewable projects on public and private lands. It arrives as the country is scrambling to add more power supplies to meet soaring electricity demand from data centers running artificial intelligence.

Under Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill signed into law July 4, solar and wind developments are eligible for tax credits if they begin construction within 12 months.

Until now, projects were considered eligible for the credits if developers had spent at least 5% of the planned projects cost. The new rule eliminates the 5% standard for large solar and wind projects, instead requiring developers prove “physical work of a significant nature” has been taking place on an ongoing basis. However, solar facilities not greater than 1.5 megawatts can still use the 5% of planned project expense standard to qualify.

“There was some expectation that the rule-making would make it very onerous to safe harbor tax credits, but this seems pretty straight forward,” said Robert Barnett, a clean energy analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “This is particularly favorable news to the residential and small commercial solar companies.”

More than 2,500 announced wind and solar projects — with a combined generating capacity equivalent to roughly 383 nuclear reactors — that have yet to begin construction could be affected by the decision, according to data from BloombergNEF.

“It’s not the worst thing in the world,” said Rhone Resch, chief executive officer of Advanced Energy Advisors, a risk management consulting firm for renewable energy development. “What it is going to do is reward sophisticated companies that have projects that are further along in their development. The companies that are going to suffer are the smaller medium sized developers that aren’t going to be able to meet this time frame.”

Large renewable energy developers have expressed confidence they can withstand the policy change. Executives with NextEra Energy said recently they have started construction on enough projects before the passage of Trump’s bill that they can meet their development plan through 2029. AES Corp. said most of its backlog of projects won’t be subject to the new guidance.

Still, the stricter requirements for big projects will add another hurdle to an industry already reeling from the Trump administration’s attacks.

“This is yet another act of energy subtraction from the Trump administration that will further delay the build-out of affordable, reliable power,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive officer of the Solar Energy Industries Association.

US annual clean energy installations are projected to plunge 41% after 2027, due to the rapid phase out of wind and solar tax credits, according to an analysis from BloombergNEF published before the latest Treasury tax guidance.

Trump has also threatened tougher sanctions if there is no progress.

Here is how sanctions have impacted Russian energy exports since the start of the conflict.

NATURAL GAS AND LNG

Russia was the top supplier of natural gas to Europe before the war. Most gas travelled through four pipeline routes: Nord Stream running under the Baltic Sea, the Yamal line crossing Poland, transit via Ukraine, and the Turkstream line.

Europe also imports Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG).

In 2021, total Russian gas imports to the EU totalled 150 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, or 45% of its total imports, and have fallen to 52 bcm or 19% since, according to the European Commission.

While the EU has not imposed sanctions on Russian pipeline gas imports, contract disputes and damage to Nord Stream caused by an explosion, have cut supplies.

As part of a fresh round of sanctions announced in July, the European Union has now banned transactions including any provision of goods or services related to Nord Stream, which albeit damaged could be revived as a gas supply route.

Transit via Ukraine ended at the end of 2024, leaving just Turkstream as a functioning route for Russian pipeline gas to Europe.

The European Commission has also proposed a legally binding ban on EU imports of Russian gas and LNG by the end of 2027, but this has not been passed into legislation yet.

The U.S. in 2024 imposed sanctions on companies supporting the development of Russia’s Arctic LNG 2 project, which would become Russia’s largest plant with an eventual output of 19.8 million metric tons per year.

OIL

The U.S., UK, and EU all prohibited the import of seaborne crude oil and refined petroleum products from Russia during the first year of the war in Ukraine.

In addition to the embargoes, the G7 group of countries (including the US, UK, and EU) imposed a price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil for third countries at $60 per barrel in December 2022, and a cap on fuels the following February.

The EU and UK altered the crude price cap level in June 2025 to $47.60, or 15% below the average market price, but the U.S. did not back the move.

The price cap aims to reduce Russia’s revenues from oil sales by prohibiting shipping, insurance and reinsurance companies from handling tankers carrying crude traded above the cap level.

Western powers have also imposed sanctions on more than 440 tankers belonging to the so-called shadow fleet that transports sanctioned oil outside of Western services and the price cap. Russia’s leading shipper Sovcomflot is also under sanctions in the West.

The U.S. has also sanctioned major Russian oil companies including Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegaz.

The measures banning Russian oil imports in the west and restricting Russian oil trade elsewhere have redirected Russian oil flows towards Asia, with China, India, and Turkey emerging as the major buyers for Russian crude.

The price cap was meant to keep Russian oil flowing to prevent a spike in global oil prices which would have followed a halt or severe drop in Russian exports.

Trump has, however, signalled a change in policy in recent weeks by threatening to impose secondary sanctions on India and China for buying Russian oil to put pressure on Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

COAL

The European Union banned imports of Russian coal in 2022, seeing volumes drop from 50 million metric tonnes in 2021 to zero by 2023, according to data from Eurostat.

Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment in Energy Infrastructure The collaboration between ASP Isotopes and Fermi America is emblematic of a broader trend: the reimagining of energy infrastructure through public-private innovation.
For investors, the key takeaway is clear: early positioning in next-generation nuclear infrastructure offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on a market poised for exponential growth.","The global energy landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as nations race to decarbonize while maintaining energy security. At the intersection of this transformation lies a critical enabler: next-generation nuclear energy infrastructure. For investors, the convergence of private innovation and public policy is creating unprecedented opportunities. A prime example is the joint venture between ASP Isotopes Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPI) and Fermi America, a collaboration that not only addresses the U.S. demand for High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) but also positions the HyperGrid Campus as a cornerstone of the clean energy transition.

The Strategic Imperative of HALEU and Domestic Production

HALEU, a specialized nuclear fuel with uranium-235 concentrations between 5% and 20%, is indispensable for advanced reactor designs such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and Generation IV systems. These technologies promise safer, more efficient, and scalable nuclear power—a critical component of decarbonization strategies. However, the U.S. currently lacks commercial-scale HALEU production capabilities, relying heavily on foreign suppliers. This gap represents both a vulnerability and an opportunity.

ASP Isotopes and Fermi America's TX JV HALEU Project aims to fill this void. By leveraging the HyperGrid Campus—a site pre-qualified for nuclear deployment due to its proximity to the DOE-operated Pantex Plant—the joint venture bypasses many regulatory hurdles. The Pantex Plant's existing infrastructure and environmental approvals provide a foundation for rapid deployment, a rarity in capital-intensive energy projects. This strategic location, combined with Texas Tech University's institutional oversight, creates a public-private partnership model that aligns with U.S. national security priorities.

HyperGrid Campus: A Scalable Energy and Data Ecosystem

The HyperGrid Campus is more than a nuclear fuel production site; it is a hybrid energy and data infrastructure hub designed to meet the surging demands of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and clean manufacturing. Fermi America's vision includes four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, generating over 11 gigawatts of electricity to power data centers and industries. This integration of nuclear energy with digital infrastructure is a masterstroke, addressing two of the 21st century's most pressing challenges: energy resilience and computational capacity.

For investors, the scalability of the HyperGrid Campus is compelling. The project's modular design allows for incremental expansion, reducing capital risk while enabling revenue diversification. For instance, the campus could simultaneously produce HALEU, stable isotopes for medical and semiconductor applications, and electricity for high-demand sectors. This diversification mitigates sector-specific risks and enhances long-term value.

Public-Private Partnerships as a Catalyst for Growth

The success of the TX JV HALEU Project hinges on its ability to leverage public resources and regulatory frameworks. The Pantex Plant's sovereign status under the DOE ensures that the HyperGrid Campus benefits from pre-vetted environmental and safety protocols. Additionally, the U.S. government's push for domestic HALEU production—driven by the 2022 CH2M HILL et al. report estimating a $100 billion market by 2040—creates a favorable policy tailwind.

Fermi America's leadership, including co-founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer (a former U.S. Energy Secretary), further strengthens this alignment. The company's partnership with Hyundai E&C for reactor construction and its collaboration with ASP Isotopes on stable isotope production demonstrate a strategic focus on execution. For investors, this blend of political capital, technical expertise, and industry partnerships reduces the risk profile of what is inherently a high-stakes endeavor.

Investment Thesis: Positioning for a Nuclear Renaissance

The U.S. nuclear fuel market is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.5% through 2035, driven by SMR deployments and international demand. ASP Isotopes' existing supply agreements with TerraPower and its UK government discussions underscore its role as a key player in this ecosystem. The company's dual focus on HALEU and stable isotopes—critical for quantum computing and nuclear medicine—positions it to capture multiple growth vectors.

For early-stage investors, the joint venture represents a strategic entry point into a market with limited supply and inelastic demand. The HyperGrid Campus's potential to become a global energy hub—coupled with ASP Isotopes' proprietary isotope production capabilities—creates a scalable value proposition. While regulatory and technical risks remain, the project's alignment with U.S. energy security goals and its access to pre-qualified infrastructure mitigate these concerns.

Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment in Energy Infrastructure

The collaboration between ASP Isotopes and Fermi America is emblematic of a broader trend: the reimagining of energy infrastructure through public-private innovation. As the U.S. seeks to decarbonize its grid and secure its technological edge, projects like the TX JV HALEU Project will play a defining role. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: early positioning in next-generation nuclear infrastructure offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on a market poised for exponential growth.

In a world where energy security and climate action are inextricably linked, the HyperGrid Campus is not just a project—it is a blueprint for the future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-16 16:01:55.956991

LAS CRUCES — Leaders from the business community, local conservation groups, representatives speaking on behalf of New Mexico congressional members, and the Center for Western Priorities called on President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to stop attacking and instead fully fund America’s parks and public lands.

At a press conference co-hosted by the Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce, the Keep Parks Public tour highlighted the ongoing threats to American public lands, including an attempt to reduce protections for New Mexico’s Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument. Other risks of these attacks include diminished earnings for local businesses that depend on public lands, offering millions of acres to extractive industries and limiting the public’s access, and selling national public lands to private interests.

“Our public spaces are critical, not only for the conservation and environmental importance, but to our local businesses that depend on tourism dollars from visitors to our community, local residents who like to support businesses with shared values, and the national recognition Las Cruces receives from the out-of-state marketing of our national monument,” said State Senator and CEO of the Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce, Carrie Hamblen. “In a time where our small businesses are struggling with increased tariffs and costs, changing the monument status would severely impact them and our local economy.”

“Let’s be frank—over the last seven months of this administration we’ve seen an unprecedented assault on our public lands, on the health and sustainability of the environment that we all depend upon,” said U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján in a statement to attendees at the press conference. “This attack is unlikely to relent, I hate to say. But we’re not going anywhere. We’re going to stand together in the days and months and years to come to protect this land we call home, and safeguard it for future generations.”

“For those of us who call Southern New Mexico home, the Organ Mountains and surrounding landscape are a cherished part of our community,” said U.S. Representative Gabe Vasquez in a statement to attendees at the press conference. “More than just a vital place for hunting, fishing, and recreation, the Organ Mountains are central to our culture, traditions, and economy—they help define who we are. Any attempt by the administration to weaken protections for these public lands or sell them off to fund tax cuts for the wealthy is unacceptable. I will continue working with local advocates, leaders, and conservationists to keep our treasured public lands in public hands.”

“The citizens of the Town of Mesilla deeply value our public lands for their recreational, economic, cultural, and spiritual significance,” added Mesilla Mayor Russell Hernandez. “As a business owner, I know firsthand how public lands contribute to our local economy. As a father, I want to ensure my kids and grandkids will always have the same access to New Mexico’s treasured public lands, including Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument.”

“Public lands are part of our shared cultural heritage,” added Ángel Peña, Executive Director of Nuestra Tierra Conservation Project. “Local communities are leading the efforts at the grassroots level to protect our shared public lands for the benefit and enjoyment of all. The Trump administration is threatening to take away access to the lands we know and love in our own backyard at the expense of current and future generations of New Mexicans.”

“Our national parks, forests, and monuments belong to all Americans,” said Lauren Bogard, Senior Director of Advocacy at the Center for Western Priorities, which organized the Keep Parks Public campaign. “Attacks on New Mexico’s public lands and the dedicated public servants who steward them are a direct attack on communities.”

The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument, designated in 2014 and located east of Las Cruces, attracted over 600,000 visitors in 2022, injecting approximately $35 million into the local economy each year. This revenue boost has supported businesses ranging from hotels and restaurants to outdoor outfitters and art galleries. The monument is one of six national monuments Interior Department officials have identified to lose federal protections. President Trump’s proposed 2026 budget reductions—including cuts to National Park Service operations, Forest Service management, and scientific research—further threaten New Mexico’s rural economies along with New Mexican’s ability to access and enjoy public lands across the state.

Across New Mexico and the country, funding and staffing shortages have left national parks, monuments, and forests scrambling to serve summer visitors:

At Carlsbad Caverns National Park, 20 percent of the workforce has been cut, impacting the availability of tours.

In the Gila National Forest, a trail crew lost five of seven members in a single layoff sweep—despite high-performance reviews. These crews were vital for maintaining trails, keeping recreation areas safe, and assisting with fire response.

At Yosemite National Park, some seasonal employees worked for up to six weeks without pay. Staff members at the park, including scientists and hydrologists were reassigned to cleaning tasks and acted as gate attendants to keep the park running.

At Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in Colorado, all custodial staff have been terminated, and a third of the park’s 74 positions remain vacant.

At the nearby Curecanti National Recreation Area, four out of ten campgrounds were closed due to short staffing.

At Montana’s Bitterroot National Forest, between 30 and 40 of the 208 employees have been fired or taken buyouts.

In Utah, local rangers received just $2,500 to manage all 57 pit toilets along Mirror Lake Highway in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest.

CWP’s Keep Parks Public tour kicked off in Denver on August 13 before arriving in Las Cruces, and continues on to Tucson, Salt Lake City, and Grand Junction, making stops along the way to talk to former park employees and community members affected by the Trump administration’s attacks on national park staffing and funding. Public land advocates can follow along on the Keep Parks Public Instagram feed.

Since 2012, the Center for Western Priorities has been a leading source of accurate information about energy and public lands across the West. CWP advocates for responsible uses of American lands, including recreation, conservation, and renewable energy.

The Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce has been in existence since 2010, advocating for locally owned businesses, helping create sustainable communities, and working to protect our air, land, and water.

On the back of an executive order supporting the industry-wide push, a truckload of US auto figures pledged their support to creating a robust EV industry in the US.

“Today, Ford, GM and Stellantis announce their shared aspiration to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual US volumes of electric vehicles (battery electric, fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles) by 2030 in order to move the nation closer to a zero-emissions future consistent with Paris climate goals,” according to a rare joint statement from the Detroit Big Three. “This represents a dramatic shift from the US market today that can be achieved only with the timely deployment of the full suite of electrification policies committed to by the administration in the Build Back Better Plan, including purchase incentives, a comprehensive charging network of sufficient density to support the millions of vehicles these targets represent, investments in R&D, and incentives to expand the electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains in the United States.”

As of today (August 16), all 22 cars have been signed off by the Department for Transport (DfT) at the reduced £1,500 amount.

Some motorists, failing to understand the convoluted grant scheme, have reportedly been walking into showrooms demanding the £3,750 discount in full.","Five new EVs have been added to the list of models that qualify for the Government's Electric Car Grant (ECG), with volume sellers from Volkswagen, Cupra and Peugeot now eligible and taking the full quota to 22 discounted models.

However, to date, every car announced so far has only qualified for the ECG's lower £1,500 allowance, with Labour's strict emissions-based requisite to receive the full £3,750 subsidy having a 100 per cent strike rate to date.

Launched on 14 July, the grant is a two-tier discount scheme for electric models priced below £37,000 aimed at boosting appetite for EVs amidst the catastrophic slowdown in private sales in recent years, which threatens to derail the Government's green targets.

The most sustainably made EVs qualify as Band 1 and receive the full £3,750 discount, while Band 2 cars are subject to just £1,500. Models deemed not green enough are rejected from the scheme entirely.

As of today (August 16), all 22 cars have been signed off by the Department for Transport (DfT) at the reduced £1,500 amount.

Dealers have lashed out at the scheme, saying buyers have been delaying purchases to understand which models might get the full £3,750 discount. As such, they say there's been no dramatic increase in sales of EVs as yet.

Retailers blamed the 'shambolic' system deployed by ministers, which has seen a drip feed of models qualifying for the grant, which has only intensified consumer uncertainty.

Industry insiders also pointed to major confusion among motorists, with car manufacturers - many assuming they will not qualify for the ECG at all - launching their own grants offering the same discounts as the official government scheme.

Volkswagen's smallest electric car, the ID.3, which starts from £30,860, is one of the five EVs now eligible for the Government scheme.

The hatchback, which is the electric equivalent to the iconic VW Golf, offers a range of 240 to 369 miles depending on trim.

However, it wasn't VW's best-selling electric car last year.

That was the ID.4 SUV, which starts from below £37,000 but is not yet confirmed for the grant.

The ID.5 coupe SUV, like the ID.4, starts from £36,995 and technically does qualify on price grounds alone. However, the ID.5 is due to be axed next year.

While the ID.3 is now eligible, customers were already able to save £1,500 on the price thanks to Volkswagen Group providing its own £1,500 'Grant Guarantee' scheme as of 4 August.

A limited selection of ID.4s are included in the manufacturer-provided discounts, too.

In a statement given to Daily Mail, the company said: 'Eligibility for further ID models in the Volkswagen range is due to be confirmed by the Government soon.'

The ID.3's eligibility for Labour's grant comes in the wake of the German company introducing a controversial new subscription-based 'optional power upgrade' for the EV.

Customers purchasing certain versions of ID.3 are being offered the chance to pay £16.50 a month to unlock the extra 27bhp that's available from the powertrain but being kept out of reach of owners who don't pay the subscription fee.

As well as the ID.3, the sister Cupra model - Born - also qualifies for Labour's official ECG. Like the ID.3, it too has been discounted by £1,500 by Volkswagen Group's own Grant Guarantee since the start of the month.

The other three ECG-eligible cars added to the full list are all Peugeot models.

The French manufacturer announced last month that it had 'formally submitted' applications to the grant scheme for the e-208, e-2008, e-308, e-308 SW, e-408, e-Rifter, and e-Traveller models.

Today's announcement sees just the 208, 2008 and e-Rifter make the cut for the £1,500 discount for now.

Peugeot said in a statement that ahead of official government confirmation, it will underwrite the ECG amount of £1,500 on new e-408, e-308, e-308 SW, and e-Traveller purchases from today.

The DfT said the addition of these five new models will help 'put money back in the pockets of millions of drivers' and 'make it cheaper and easier to own an EV while supporting jobs and growth as part of the Plan for Change'.

However, not a single model has yet to meet the requirements to be awarded the full £3,750 discount.

The previous round of EVs qualifying for £1,500 grants released a week ago today included Nissan models, with the exclusion of the new Leaf EV, which is due to arrive later this year.

Produced in the UK and powered by locally supplied batteries, Nissan has told us it is 'anticipated it will get the highest-level grant of £3,750' when the DfT comes round to approving it.

However, there is still no clarification around which other EVs will be issued the full grant amount.

Dealers say drip-feed of ECG models is doing nothing for customer appetite

Trade magazine Car Dealer has been told by dealers that the ECG is causing 'chaos' in showrooms, with drivers withholding purchases while they wait to see which cars receive the grant - and, more importantly, which will receive the higher Band 1 discount of £3,750.

Peter Smyth, director of retailer group Swansway, told the title that the roll-out of the scheme has been 'shambolic', adding that it should have been far simpler than what he dubbed a 'typical government bureaucratic mess'.

Other retailers told Car Dealer the grant has been 'ill thought out' and as such has created a logjam of customers waiting to get the full picture of which EVs will qualify for the grant and the size of the discount before committing to purchases.

Some motorists, failing to understand the convoluted grant scheme, have reportedly been walking into showrooms demanding the £3,750 discount in full.

Another boss of a 'large dealer group' told Car Dealer of its frustration that models are being added almost on a weekly basis, rather than a comprehensive list of all eligible EVs being provided from the start.

The drip-feed of qualifying cars is due to the scheme requiring manufacturers to apply for discounts via an online portal.

Once the DfT deems if the vehicles qualify at all, it then has to determine the band based on the car's 'sustainability criteria'.

This includes the emissions produced during the battery's manufacturing, the vehicle's assembly, and the 'carbon intensity' of the electric grids in the countries where the car is made.

It took the DfT three weeks to announce the first batch of qualifying cars on 4 August due to the procedure.

The DfT has said it is processing applications 'as quickly as possible' and on a first-come, first-served basis.

The sustainability criteria is also ruling out a large number of manufacturers from the Band 1 £3,750 discount - especially those using batteries produced in China.

This has led to many car makers launching their own schemes. On our last count, 16 brands have launched their own grants in response.

Commenting in response to criticism of how the grant has been handled, a DfT spokesperson told the Daily Mail: 'We expect dozens of models to be eligible for the Electric Car Grant with 22 models announced to date and many more to come, providing a substantial boost for the industry and saving drivers thousands of pounds.

'The list of eligible models is published online and regularly updated with discounts available for the public at dealerships.

'We have also published comprehensive guidance for manufacturers who we will continue to work with alongside dealers to help more of their customers access the grant.'

The DfT added that it will update the list of eligible cars 'on a regular basis', and any new models are accompanied by communications to support consumer awareness'.

It added that application guidance is targeted at manufacturers and dealers because 'consumers don’t need to do any paperwork to access grant funding'.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/15/13/101252321-0-image-m-22_1755260167328.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 16:01:34.737555

In 1990, Congress passed, and President Bush signed the Global Change Research Act which mandated the compilation, every four years, of a National Climate Assessment.
The First National Climate Assessment (NCA) was published in 2000.
Climate change does not ’cause’ the flooding, it makes it worse and more frequent.
Climate change does not ’cause’ heatwaves, it makes them more frequent and more intense.","You cannot stop climate change with an executive order.

Misinformation is defined as politically motivated actors spreading false or misleading information to reinforce their beliefs. While it can be harmful, it is more of a symptom than a disease. Research shows that misinformation does not change the beliefs and actions of those who encounter it; it merely tends to reinforce them. Misinformation is simply bad actors preaching to the choir.

Republicans don’t want to hear that the climate is changing because it challenges their beliefs. The erasing of most climate-related information from government communication in Republican jurisdictions is a political act, not a scientific one. When you fire the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics because your policies are losing jobs, that is a political action, not an economic one. Spreading misinformation about the causes of failure provides false comfort to the uninformed.

In 1990, Congress passed, and President Bush signed the Global Change Research Act which mandated the compilation, every four years, of a National Climate Assessment. The assessments were intended to assemble scientific subject-matter experts from 15 federal agencies to “inform the nation about already observed changes, the current status of the climate, and anticipated trends for the future”.

Republicans don’t want to hear it. The Trump administration is dismantling the scientific foundations of our government. When it encounters information it doesn’t like, it simply eliminates it. Thus, it has removed past assessments from the public, then selected a handful of sketchy, like-minded ideologues to re-write the most current one to conform to his political, not scientific, beliefs. We will all suffer because of it.

The First National Climate Assessment (NCA) was published in 2000. There have been five in total. One key finding from the fourth assessment stated:

“[G]lobal efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades.”

The fifth assessment was published in 2023. Among its many findings, it stated that with each additional increment of global warming, climate impacts in the US are projected to be more severe. In the Northeast, the most noticeable evidence of this is rainfall. Annual average US rainfall has increased rapidly, and more rain falls during the most extreme precipitation events. Since the 1950s, such events have become more frequent. These changes have contributed to increases in river and stream flooding. The Fifth National Climate Assessment found that the Northeast has experienced the largest regional increase of extreme precipitation in the U.S., with a 60% increase in recent decades.

Since the 1950s, there has been a 49% increase in the number of days with over 2 inches of rain, a 62% increase in the number of days with over 3 inches of rain, an 84% increase in the number of days with over 4 inches of rainfall, and a 104% increase in the number of days with over 5 inches of rainfall. This is data measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service. These are the facts and the facts are not political. Hiding those that disagree with your beliefs is.

Climate change does not ’cause’ the flooding, it makes it worse and more frequent. It does not ’cause’ wildfires, it makes them bigger, more destructive, and more frequent all over the world. Just look out your window at the smoke-filled sky. Climate change does not ’cause’ heatwaves, it makes them more frequent and more intense. An increase in extreme precipitation is only one result of human caused global warming. There are many others and the cost is adding up. Pretending the facts don’t exist won’t make us safer, lower our insurance rates, lower food prices, or prevent us from getting sick from unhealthy air.

When you fail to “inform the nation about already observed changes, the current status of the climate, and anticipated trends for the future”, you will also fail “to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades.”

These are the EVs you can lease for less than $300 a month

You can still find a few EVs that you can lease for less than $300 per month.

These deals often include a significant down payment, but then the monthly fee is quite reasonable.

The Hyundai IONIQ 5 and 6 are both included on the list, with a monthly payment of $129 and $169 respectively.

The Honda Prologue, Chevy Equinox EV, Kia Niro EV and VW ID.4 are also available, all under $200 per month.

Then there’s the Toyota bZ4X, which recently starred in Superman, and goes for $189 per month.

The only Tesla available in this price segment is the Model 3, but it’s more expensive than the others at $299 per month.

What’s going on with the EV market in the United States

The EV market in the United States is sending mixed signals, mainly because there’s a huge gap between states when it comes to EV adoption.

In EV-friendly California – even though apparently the state wants to ban Teslas – around 20 percent of new cars registered are EVs.

Obviously that still pales in comparison to places like Norway, but it’s still pretty good for the US.

Especially when you compare it the states where people don’t really buy EVs like Alaska or West Virginia.

This is probably also due to the fact that studies and surveys about electric vehicles also produce contradictory results.

There are studies that confirm that EVs are actually less reliable than gas cars, and other studies that confirm that EV batteries can outlive internal combustion cars.

Scientists warn that climate change, caused mostly by the burning of fossil fuels, is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather.","A new report suggests the time is right for Georgia to create a state office aimed at planning for the effects of climate change.

But the words “climate change” hardly appear in the report released Aug. 4 by the University of Georgia’s Institute for Resilient Infrastructure Systems (IRIS) and the Pew Trusts.

Echoing suggestions in a report prepared for state lawmakers in late 2024 after the devastating storms Debby and Helene, it calls for Georgia to improve its efforts at “resilience” and highlights what neighboring South Carolina is doing at its Office of Resilience.

As it relates to climate change, resilience means mitigating and recovering from flooding, drought, extreme temperatures, wildfires and other natural disasters.

But it doesn’t address “climate change” per se.

That’s what Eric Fossmeyer, the director of the South Carolina Office of Resilience, calls “the elephant in the room.”

“The word ‘climate change’ has been so politicized,” Fossmeyer said. “And we just encourage folks to approach it from an apolitical position.”

Speaking during a workshop addressing the report before it was released, Fossmeyer stressed that the data is clear about the frequency of natural disasters.

The report said that Georgia already has experienced more major natural disasters in the past five years than in the two preceding decades.

“Those disasters affect everybody,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what your political party is. It doesn’t matter what your race is. It affects everybody. And that became a real selling point for our resilience planning effort.”

Full report available to read at end of this story

Who would need to be sold on resilience in Georgia? State lawmakers, for one.

The General Assembly would have to authorize and fund a resilience office, while also funding other priorities.

South Carolina’s Office of Resilience costs the that state $126 million a year, according to its fiscal year 2025-2026 budget, although $40 million of that amount appears to be one-time expenditures related to Hurricane Helene.

The report suggests that spending on resilience prevents disaster recovery in the future.

“The cumulative cost of disaster recovery continues to far exceed the upfront costs of proactive investments in hazard mitigation,” the report said.

According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for every dollar spent on resilience, governments save $13 in disaster recovery.

Some examples of resilience spending include stormwater improvement projects, buying out homes in areas that flood repeatedly, and investing in human jobs required to coordinate everything involved in resilience.

Data is a key concern for Fossmeyer.

He said that while billions of dollars are being invested into stormwater and other infrastructure projects, they’re based on storm data and other data that’s long out-of-date.

But good data requires funding and some entity to make it happen.

“There is a strong desire or appetite for state level leadership and coordination,” director of IRIS Brian Bledsoe said at the same workshop.

He said he based that opinion on the 15 virtual and in-person meetings that IRIS held across the state to prepare the report.

“Things are at a critical juncture here in Georgia where the elements seem to be in place and it’s time to bring together the scattered pieces in a cohesive way,” he said.

The 2024 Georgia House of Representatives report recommends that a state Office of Resilience be administratively attached to the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.

The IRIS-Pew report doesn’t get that specific on how lawmakers should implement its recommendations.

Its 137 pages, not including footnote titles, contain just a single reference to “climate change” — and it’s in a section that notes the Atlanta Regional Commission’s focus areas for resilience.

Scientists warn that climate change, caused mostly by the burning of fossil fuels, is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather.

But while Americans largely believe the government should play a major role in disaster mitigation and recovery, a recent poll shows less consensus about whether the government should be involved in combating climate change.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles. Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That’s after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina — including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They would all continue to regulate the combined utility.

“It is a big deal,” said Darren LaShelle, president and CEO of NorCal Public Media.

That rollback includes a projected loss of nearly 10% of NorCal Public Media’s $6 million annual budget, LaShelle said.","An Emmy-winning locally made documentary series telling the stories of Californians confronting climate change is set to air across the country early next year.

“Climate California,” a 10-episode series produced by Rohnert Park-based Northern California Public Media, made its debut on Sonoma County public television station KRCB in October 2024, featuring inspiring profiles of individuals across the state working to solve pressing climate issues.

So far, eight episodes have aired on the local PBS station, with the final two episodes set to premiere at the end of August and September, respectively. This month, NorCal Public Media announced that the entire series will begin running on PBS stations coast-to-coast in early 2026.

“It is a big deal,” said Darren LaShelle, president and CEO of NorCal Public Media. “It’s our first full series that’s been on PBS nationally.”

The show was conceived in the wake of a 2022 PBS announcement that the organization would put a major focus on climate issues in its programming, according to LaShelle.

“We’re a small station, but we thought, let’s do everything we can to put something together locally,” he said.

Already known for its strong environmental reporting, NorCal Public Media brought together Bay Area natives and filmmakers Charles Loi, Jeremy Jue and Hannah Lee to “tell the story of climate change in California,” LaShelle said.

“It’s been a real adventure,” LaShelle said. “They’ve been all over this state for the past two years, it’s been a huge project for us.”

Loi, who served as co-writer, director and host of the series, said he was thankful to be able to exercise his creativity on the project.

“Long story short, we did this show with a lot of heart, a lot of ambition,” he said. “Showing it to people, and having it really resonate with people has been worth it. The reception has been really gratifying.”

The series has been resoundingly praised by viewers, LaShelle said, and in June earned a Northern California Area Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in the category of Environment/Science – News or Long Form Content, for its second episode, “The Songs of Strangers,” which featured conversations with Sonoma sound ecologist Bernie Krause on how to connect with the natural world by listening, and award-winning science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson, best known for his “Mars” trilogy of novels, on how to build cities that allow for nature to flourish.

The episode also looked at Whale Safe, a tool developed by the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara that uses AI to help shipping companies avoid whale collisions.

When NorCal Public Media showed the program to PBS, the organization was “all in” on giving the series nationwide distribution, LaShelle said.

Loi, who has worked for Disney and made films in China and Hong Kong, said the goal of the series was to look at a specific time and place while offering a wider audience something relevant.

“We tried to make something that we really believed in, that was beautiful and funny and engaging and exciting,” Loi said. “And have it be something that somebody in Texas or New York or Ohio or Louisiana can watch and feel like it speaks to them.”

The announcement of the airings comes amid a time of uncertainty for NorCal Public Media, after Congress last month approved a sweeping rollback of federal support for NPR and PBS stations nationwide. That rollback includes a projected loss of nearly 10% of NorCal Public Media’s $6 million annual budget, LaShelle said.

“If that had happened two years ago, we never would have embarked on this series,” LaShelle said. “So, what does that say about the future? Stations are going to have to make a lot of hard decisions.”

The first eight episodes of “Climate California” are currently available to stream on pbs.org.

The show’s ninth episode is set to premiere Aug. 26 at 9 p.m. on KRCB.

The government’s decision creates uncertainty over a further 4,000 jobs in the industry’s supply chain including farmers and hauliers.
We have been left with no choice but to announce the closure of Vivergo and we have informed our people.
The US trade deal was a victory for the car industry which had tariffs slashed from 27.5% to 10%.
The steel industry is still facing 25% tariffs but the UK government is hoping these will be scrapped after further negotiation.","The UK’s largest bioethanol plant is to close after being dealt a body blow by Keir Starmer’s trade deal with Donald Trump.

The owner of the Vivergo plant in Hull, owned by Associated British Foods (ABF), said it would close with the loss of 160 jobs, just hours after the government said it would not fund an industry rescue package. The first redundancies will be made on Tuesday.

The government’s decision creates uncertainty over a further 4,000 jobs in the industry’s supply chain including farmers and hauliers. Bioethanol is a petrol substitute produced from agricultural products.

Vivergo opened a redundancy programme in June. At that point the government held talks with the company, more than a month after ABF warned that the US trade deal was an “existential threat” allowing US producers, for the first time, to compete litre-by-litre under a new duty free agreement for American ethanol.

ABF and Ensus, the owner of the other major bioethanol plant in the UK, said the US deal would have a huge knock-on effect on wheat farmers who supplied their plants, as well as the UK’s lead in clean fuels.

A spokesperson for ABF said on Friday: “It is deeply regrettable that the government has chosen not to support a key national asset. We have been left with no choice but to announce the closure of Vivergo and we have informed our people.

“We have been fighting for months to keep this plant open. We initiated and led talks with government in good faith. We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the government’s own green industrial strategy.”

ABF had warned the US trade deal, hailed as a triumph for Starmer, was a killer blow because it scrapped tariffs on a quota of 1.4bn litres of imports from the US, the exact size of the UK production, as part of the agreement with Trump in May.

The US trade deal was a victory for the car industry which had tariffs slashed from 27.5% to 10%. The steel industry is still facing 25% tariffs but the UK government is hoping these will be scrapped after further negotiation.

Government sources said they had to prioritise the 320,000 jobs in auto, steel and aerospace and added that the ethanol plants had faced financial problems before the US deal.

Sources in the National Farmers’ Union believe Trump’s negotiators had said that in exchange for slashing tariffs on cars and steel they wanted US farmers to have access to either the British pork or ethanol industries.

A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said it had taken “the difficult decision not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces”.

ABF accused the government of having “thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber” and the opportunity to “lead the world” on clean fuels.

The general secretary of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, said: “This is a shortsighted decision that totally disregards the benefits the domestic bioethanol sector will bring to jobs and energy security.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04c35d123b31cb6df2afbd5df70c00e8640f7695/46_0_1000_800/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fca47e89fd8f95f8c7c7155219a56fa0",N,,2025-08-16 14:03:10.957681

With the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) still shaping the industry's financial landscape and a new administration prioritizing fossil fuels, the question for investors is whether this rally represents a fleeting rebound or a strategic entry point for growth.

Regulatory Shifts: A Double-Edged Sword

The U.S. clean energy sector is navigating a paradox: policy-driven tailwinds from the IRA coexist with regulatory rollbacks favoring fossil fuels. The IRA's tax credits for renewables, energy storage, and carbon capture remain a cornerstone of sector momentum, with Deloitte estimating that its programs could unlock 36 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. However, the new administration's Unleashing American Energy executive order has accelerated fossil fuel permitting while creating uncertainty around environmental reviews and vehicle emissions standards.

The rescission of Biden-era CEQ NEPA regulations, for instance, has left agencies scrambling to establish new permitting frameworks, complicating timelines for solar and wind projects. Meanwhile, the legal battle over California's Advanced Clean Cars II program—challenged after Congress revoked its EPA waiver—highlights the fragility of state-level clean energy policies. For investors, this duality means evaluating companies not just on their alignment with federal incentives but on their ability to navigate a fragmented regulatory environment.

Sector Momentum: Resilience in the Face of Adversity

Despite these challenges, clean energy stocks have rallied, driven by strong demand from data centers, AI infrastructure, and industrial decarbonization. The S&P Clean Energy Index has surged 22% year-to-date, outperforming broader markets. This momentum is fueled by two key factors:

IRA-Driven Infrastructure: The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and tax credit transferability have enabled smaller developers to access capital, accelerating project pipelines. For example, NextEra Energy (NEE) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) have secured IRA-backed financing for offshore wind and solar projects, insulating them from short-term policy volatility.

Technological Innovation: Breakthroughs in green hydrogen, long-duration energy storage (LDES), and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are creating new revenue streams. The Department of Energy's $7 billion hydrogen hub initiative, for instance, has spurred partnerships between renewable developers and industrial clients, diversifying income sources beyond electricity sales.

Long-Term Growth: Navigating Uncertainty with Agility

The sector's long-term potential hinges on its ability to adapt to regulatory shifts and supply chain disruptions. Companies like First Solar (FSLR) and Enphase Energy (ENPH) are mitigating risks by diversifying suppliers and leveraging AI-driven supply chain optimization. Similarly, the rise of high-integrity carbon markets—where direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are gaining traction—offers a new revenue avenue.

However, investors must remain cautious. The potential sunset of IRA tax credits and the administration's push to keep coal plants operational could slow the transition to renewables. For example, the abrupt cancellation of the Empire Wind project underscores the vulnerability of federal approvals. Developers are now prioritizing “safe harbor” timelines to lock in IRA benefits before potential legislative changes.

Strategic Entry Points: Where to Focus

For investors seeking exposure, the key lies in balancing short-term volatility with long-term fundamentals. Here's how to approach the sector:

IRA-Aligned Firms: Prioritize companies with robust IRA tax credit monetization strategies. SunPower (SPWR) and Plug Power (PLUG) are leveraging IRA incentives to scale green hydrogen and solar projects.

Technological Leaders: Invest in firms pioneering 24/7 renewable solutions. Form Energy (FENY) and 136° Energy (136E) are advancing long-duration storage and geothermal technologies, positioning them for a future where grid reliability is paramount.

Carbon Management Play: Companies like Carbon Engineering and Climeworks are capitalizing on the shift from voluntary carbon offsets to high-integrity CDR credits, a market projected to grow to $50 billion by 2030.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Energy Transition

The clean energy sector's rally in 2025 reflects both optimism and pragmatism. While regulatory uncertainty persists, the IRA's legacy, technological innovation, and surging demand from AI and industrial sectors create a compelling case for long-term growth. Investors who adopt a defensive yet forward-looking strategy—focusing on companies with diversified revenue streams, IRA-safe harbor timelines, and technological differentiation—may find this period of volatility a strategic entry point.

As the energy transition accelerates, the ability to navigate policy shifts and supply chain risks will separate winners from losers.

According to UK market research firm Rho Motion, worldwide EV sales jumped 21% between July 2024 and July 2025, topping 10.7 million in the first seven months of the year.

Europe and China led the charge. Sales in China hit 6.5 million, a 29% year-to-date increase. It's down month-over-month, but so are overall passenger car sales, Rho Motion says.

Meanwhile, EV sales in Europe have jumped 30% to 2.3 million this year. Some European markets performed particularly well, including Italy and the UK, which jumped 40% and 30%, respectively, though France had an 11% year-on-year decline.

Though EV sales have continued to rise in North America, sales were comparatively meager, rising just 1.0 million, a 2% increase. Rho Motion attributes the poor performance to the “multi-billion-dollar hit” from tariffs, partially offset by reduced requirements to purchase ZEV credits.” However, the research firm did suggest that Ford’s plans to launch its “Universal EV Platform,” as well as a $30,000 electric midsize pickup with LFP batteries in 2027, could boost sales.

EV sales outside of China, Europe, and North America rose fastest in relative terms, jumping 42% in the first part of 2025. Absolute numbers were less impressive, as only 0.9 million EVs were sold. It’s important to note that countries like China have impressive subsidies in place for those willing to switch to EVs. But American EV buyers haven’t been nearly so lucky.

The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate this unlawful cap and restore the legally required reimbursement rates for these essential energy programs.
“Oregonians count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean, and our bills manageable,” said Attorney General Rayfield.
In 2024, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal funding through the State Energy Program to support local clean energy work.","Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 18 other states, plus the District of Columbia, sued to block the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) from imposing a new funding cap that slashes support for vital state-run energy programs. The DOE policy would prevent states from using critical federal funds by limiting reimbursement for key administrative and staffing costs that have long been covered by these federal energy programs.

The lawsuit was filed today in the U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon.

The coalition argues that by capping certain funding for these programs, DOE is jeopardizing states’ ability to keep them running. The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate this unlawful cap and restore the legally required reimbursement rates for these essential energy programs.

“Oregonians count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean, and our bills manageable,” said Attorney General Rayfield. “This cap strips away the resources we need to keep that work going – and the people and expertise behind it. We can’t meet Oregon’s energy needs if the federal government pulls critical infrastructure that supports the people and expertise behind this work midstream.”

For decades, federal law has required agencies like DOE to negotiate agreements with states that set fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run programs. This includes the basic administrative or staffing costs needed to run federally funded programs. These “indirect” and “fringe” costs have never been subject to a cap. On May 8, 2025, DOE announced a new policy that ignores this longstanding practice, capping indirect and employee benefit costs at 10 percent of a project’s total budget, regardless of previously negotiated rates.

In 2024, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal funding through the State Energy Program to support local clean energy work. Nearly half of that went to essential operating costs — including staff benefits and the basic overhead needed to run programs — with the rest funding on-the-ground energy projects. If these federal dollars are cut, it will directly impact the state’s ability to keep staff, maintain programs, and deliver energy savings for Oregonians.

Attorney General Rayfield and the coalition argue that the new policy violates federal regulations that require agencies to honor negotiated indirect cost rates between states and the federal government. They assert the policy mirrors similar caps that federal courts have recently struck down, and additional federal regulations regarding fringe. The attorneys general emphasize that every court to have ruled on the merits of such blanket limits has found them unlawful, unjustified, and disruptive to essential public programs.

The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate DOE’s new policy and bar implementation of any unlawful reimbursement caps.

Joining Attorney General Rayfield in filing this lawsuit are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

However, while market forces continue to support the expansion of renewable energy capacity, the sector faces critical challenges extending beyond the antagonism of the Trump administration.
Geothermal energy, for example, is poised for explosive growth as one of vanishingly few carbon-free energy solutions with broad bipartisan support, but faces a severe talent gap and punishingly low levels of awareness in potential talent pools.
Targeting strategic alliances with educational institutions is a crucial strategy for creating a skilled workforce, particularly in emerging sectors like geothermal energy.
“The clean energy transition depends on a workforce that can sustain it,” reports Utility Drive.","Despite a discouraging political climate and unprecedented uncertainty in the United States clean energy sector, low costs of wind and solar energy continue to drive growth of the domestic clean energy sector. However, while market forces continue to support the expansion of renewable energy capacity, the sector faces critical challenges extending beyond the antagonism of the Trump administration.

The continued growth of solar and wind power risks being hampered by several mitigating factors, including (but not limited to) intensifying competition over increasingly scarce suitable land plots, stressed and volatile global supply chains, lengthy and unpredictable development processes, Complex and overlapping permitting processes, and a critical talent gap.

The renewable energy labor shortage has been years in the making, but is no less closer to resolution. The issue spans both white collar and blue collar positions, and threatens to kneecap progress in the booming sector. Between the years of 2011 and 2030, it is expected that global levels of installed wind and solar capacity will quadruple. Analysis from McKinsey & Company concludes that “this huge surge in new wind and solar installations will be almost impossible to staff with qualified development and construction employees as well as operations and maintenance workers.”

“It’s unclear where these employees will come from in the future,” the McKinsey report goes on to say. “There are too few people with specialized and relevant expertise and experience, and too many of them are departing for other companies or other industries.”

The solar and wind industries are suffering from a lack of awareness of career paths and opportunities, despite their well-established presence in domestic markets. Emergent clean energies face an even steeper uphill battle. Geothermal energy, for example, is poised for explosive growth as one of vanishingly few carbon-free energy solutions with broad bipartisan support, but faces a severe talent gap and punishingly low levels of awareness in potential talent pools.

But while the outlook is discouraging, industry insiders argue that it’s too soon to sound the alarms. In fact, a recent report from Utility Drive contends that “solutions to the energy talent gap are hiding in plain sight.” The article breaks down those solutions into four concrete approaches: building partnerships with educators, formulating Registered Apprenticeship pathways, updating credential requirements to reflect real-world needs, and rethinking stale recruitment strategies.

Targeting strategic alliances with educational institutions is a crucial strategy for creating a skilled workforce, particularly in emerging sectors like geothermal energy. Businesses can, for example, partner with and sponsor programs at community colleges, creating a pipeline for the next generation of skilled workers. Apprenticeships serve a similar purpose, encouraging hands-on learning outside of the classroom. Such apprenticeships can apply to white collar positions as well as blue collar roles.

“If we can figure out a way to educate the younger generation that you can actually have a career that you can be proud of and help solve a problem the world is facing, but also work in the extractive industry, I think that could go a long way,” said Jeanine Vany, executive vice president of corporate affairs for Canadian geothermal firm Eavor, speaking about the geothermal energy talent gap.

These approaches won’t solve the talent gap overnight – especially as political developments may discourage would-be jobseekers from placing their bets on a career in the renewables sector. But they will go a long way toward mitigating the issue.

“The clean energy transition depends on a workforce that can sustain it,” reports Utility Drive. “To meet the hiring challenges, employers will benefit from looking beyond the next position to fill and working toward a strategic, industry-wide vision for attracting talent.”

For a while, it looked like he might be right. Between 1967 and 1974, U.S. utilities ordered nearly 200 nuclear reactors.

But momentum stalled as cost overruns, regulatory hurdles, slowing demand and accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and later Fukushima eroded public confidence. Projects were canceled, and the nation’s once-robust nuclear manufacturing base faded.

Today, it seems like Seaborg’s prediction wasn’t wrong — just too early. A new generation of nuclear reactors — with advanced designs that safely cool and shut down reactors without the need for power or operator intervention — has made such accidents virtually impossible. Meanwhile, soaring electricity demand, driven by artificial intelligence, and rising geopolitical risks have underscored the need for energy that is clean, safe, reliable and abundant — four boxes that only nuclear energy checks.

I have witnessed nuclear’s resurgence firsthand in my role at the engineering and construction firm Bechtel. We successfully helped bring Georgia Power’s two new reactors online in 2023 and 2024, and are currently working to deliver nuclear projects in Tennessee and Wyoming. Overseas, we’re helping Poland build its first nuclear plant — a reminder that U.S. nuclear leadership also expands our geopolitical influence, rather than ceding it to Russia and China.

Fortunately, the Trump administration understands the stakes and has issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling domestic nuclear capacity by 2050.

With its sights set on a true nuclear renaissance, the government — together with the nuclear industry — should focus on clearing the four biggest hurdles in nuclear’s path.

First, we must confront the elephant in the room: cost. Critics who say nuclear energy is too expensive underestimate both its long-term value and American ingenuity. A nuclear plant’s low operating costs and long lifespan make the cost per unit of energy highly competitive. Meanwhile, each new project helps technology developers and utilities standardize reactors, enabling builders like Bechtel to standardize engineering designs, scale supply chains and deploy new construction methods such as digital execution and modularization. The result is shorter schedules, lower costs and greater certainty of outcome.

Controlling cost is also about reducing “project execution” risk for investors. If we want to expand nuclear energy and unlock efficiency gains, we will need more help from the government to assume some of the financial risk of first-mover projects.

As the industry rebuilds its capability to deliver, new nuclear projects can be susceptible to delays and cost overruns that deter investors. To stimulate the market, the government must absorb some of the early project cost overrun risks — just as other countries are already doing to grow their nuclear power output.

Second, the U.S. should deliver on its obligation under law to establish a sustainable national program for permanently disposing of spent nuclear fuel. While today’s storage methods are designed to work safely for 80 years or more, a long-term solution would resolve this challenge and strengthen public confidence in nuclear power.

Third, regulators must continue modernizing. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in particular, plays an indispensable role in maintaining high industry standards and has made progress in updating its approach to approving projects. But the framework, built in the 1970s, lags behind the modular, standardized and inherently safer designs of today’s nuclear reactors. Significant opportunities remain to streamline approvals without compromising safety. The Trump administration’s new executive order encouraging the commission to reform is a welcome step in the right direction.

Fourth, and perhaps most urgently, we need people. America is grappling with a skilled labor shortage, from welders to electricians and heavy equipment operators. Here, too, the administration can and is beginning to lead by incentivizing partnerships between industry and education and by expanding access to vocational training.

We need to make sure that joining the construction trades is a rewarding, fulfilling and safe career. We need to reshape perceptions that you can only get ahead with a four-year degree, which is simply not true and even misleading to the younger generation. A national campaign should champion these careers as mission-driven, innovative and essential to America’s future.

There are no silver bullets in energy policy. Solar, gas and emerging technologies will all be part of the equation. But failing to realize the full potential of nuclear energy’s promise would be a costly mistake — economically, environmentally and geopolitically.

A strong U.S. nuclear program will produce more than megawatts. It will catalyze life-changing technologies, a robust national industrial base and a brighter future for generations.

If we get it right, maybe someone in 2075 will look back at today as the moment when America glimpsed its energy moonshot and seized the opportunity to lead.

Test the Charge It’s worth testing out a used PHEV’s charging and connecting cables before you take it home.","With sales growth lagging, it’s a weird time in the electric vehicles market. It’s also, oddly enough, a good time to experiment with the plug.

The Donald Trump administration put the kibosh on several US federal policies aimed at boosting the development, production, and purchase of new-energy vehicles. Still, $4,000 tax credits for used battery-electric cars and plug-in hybrids are available for qualified vehicles and buyers (more on that later) until the end of September.

If you want to take advantage of this incentive, you should know that used plug-in hybrids, or PHEVs, are unique beasts. They’re complicated vehicles, engineering-wise, containing both internal combustion engines and electric motors, and using two power sources—electricity and gasoline—to go. There’s also a bunch of variation in the plug-in hybrid world. So there are tricks to picking out the best used one. WIRED asked car experts what to think about if you’re going after a used PHEV.

Shopping for a full electric? Check out our guide to buying the best used EV.

Know Your Terms

If you’re after a plug-in hybrid, make sure first that you're getting the right sort of technology. Plain, old hybrid vehicles, sometimes called HEVs, also come with gas engines plus electric motors. But plug-in hybrids come with bigger electric batteries that can be plugged in and charged. Generally, that means that PHEVs drive on electricity until their batteries are depleted, at which point the gas engine kicks in.

Though PHEVs by definition go both ways, some are more battery-powered than others. First, older PHEV models have very limited electric ranges. Those made before 2019 tend to get less than 17 miles of range per charge, and some closer to 10 miles. Also, some plug-ins are more “gas-biased” than others, which matters if your goal is to save on fueling. The Ford Escape PHEVs’ gas engine comes on when you accelerate or turn on the air-conditioning. The Kia Sorento’s heat system is powered by gas. Other models tend to tap into gas when they’re hauling heavier loads. These biases can change between model years. Investigate the details of your specific used PHEV before deciding on a purchase.

As opposed to full battery-electric cars, PHEVs can’t charge at “fast chargers,” the sort you’ll often find off highways, which can top up a car in around 30 minutes. Instead, PHEVs rely on standard 120-volt wall outlets, which can usually charge up a plug-in hybrid’s electric battery overnight, or faster “level 2” charging.

Know Your Life

Picking a used PHEV—or knowing if a used PHEV is for you, period—will require thinking about whether one can fit into your life. Lots of people think of plug-ins as EV-lites, a gateway drug to the battery-powered car. But that’s not quite right, says Joseph Yoon, the head of consumer insights at Edmunds. Those who want to save money on gas need to make sure that their daily driving is covered by the PHEV’s limited battery range, and that they have the ability to charge their car overnight at home, he says. If drivers can’t meet those conditions, “I don’t think plug-in hybrids are as practical as people think they are.”

In fact, PHEVs tend to be less gas-efficient than even some of their hybrid gas-powered counterparts. So if you’re not able to charge one overnight regularly, it might actually cost you more to fuel. Consider a used hybrid instead.

For those who really want to try a plug and have a slightly bigger budget, it’s probably worth considering a newer used one, which can have battery ranges up to 50 miles per charge and tend to switch between electric and gas propulsion more smoothly.

Know Your Battery

Just as with full battery-electric vehicles, PHEV batteries can be expensive to replace. The good news is that, just as with full battery-electric vehicles, the PHEV batteries have proven more robust and reliable than automakers once feared. Still, make sure you ask the dealer to provide some kind of battery health test. It’s also worth asking how the car was used. If the previous owner tended to forget to plug in their car and drove mostly on gas (really: don’t do that), then the battery might be “newer” and healthier than the car’s age or mileage indicates.

Know Your Warranty

PHEVs come with the typical bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties you see in gas-powered cars. Most will also come with battery warranties, which can cover up to (though sometimes more than) eight years or 80,000 miles, whichever comes first. It’s worth calling up the vehicle’s automaker to make sure that those warranties are transferable between owners.

Warranty coverage is especially important because PHEVs “have an awful lot of moving parts,” says Sean Tucker, the lead editor for Kelley Blue Book. A Consumer Reports analysis of internal combustion engine, electric, and plug-in hybrid vehicles from the last three model years found that PHEVs have 70 percent more problems than gas-powered or hybrid vehicles. (By contrast, EVs have 42 percent more problems.) Tucker says he would be “reluctant” to buy off-warranty PHEVs, especially from brands known for reliability issues. Consumer Reports’ analysis found the least reliable brands to include Cadillac, Jeep, and Volkswagen; most reliable were Subaru, Lexus, and Toyota.

Know Your Mechanic

Because PHEVs are so mechanically tricky, you’ll want a thorough understanding of a used one’s service record. Make sure your dealer gives you access to that. And remember: Unlike an EV, plug-ins need regular oil, filter, and spark plug changes.

Test the Charge

It’s worth testing out a used PHEV’s charging and connecting cables before you take it home. The vehicles can be powered up using 120-volt and 240-volt chargers. Check both.

Check Out Incentives

Until September 30, some used PHEV buyers will have access to US federal tax credit incentives of up to $4,000 or 30 percent of the sale price, whichever is lower. You can find details here, but in short: Qualified vehicles must be priced at or below $25,000, and their batteries must have a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours or higher (most PHEVs, even older ones, do). Buyers qualify if they’ve earned less than $150,000 a year filing jointly, or $75,000 as an individual.

Keep in mind, too, that states, cities, and local power utilities sometimes offer their own new-energy-vehicle incentives programs, and some of those apply to plug-ins. Some also have programs to help new battery-powered-car owners install home charging. Do your research, and maybe you’ll save.","https://media.wired.com/photos/689f6e99781e06fc3ef8d574/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/WIRED-Guide-Buying-Used-PHEV-Gear--2224817200.jpg",N,,2025-08-16 14:02:23.261631

Those looking for value stocks to add to their portfolio may want to use this list as a starting point for further investment research.

Why Focus on Undervalued Energy Equipment & Services Stocks?

Value investors seek to buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value. Long-term returns show that such strategies are advantageous. Value stocks, as a group, tend to outperform growth stocks over extended periods of time. Typically, value investors perform financial analysis of numerous metrics, don’t follow the herd and are long-term investors.

AAII’s A+ Investor Value Grade is derived from a stock’s Value Score. The Value Score is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of the price-to-sales ratio, price-earnings ratio, enterprise-value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, shareholder yield, price-to-book-value ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. The score is variable, meaning it can consider all six ratios or, should any of the six ratios not be valid, the remaining ratios that are valid. To be assigned a Value Score, stocks must have a valid (non-null) ratio and corresponding ranking for at least two of the six valuation ratios.

What Goes Into AAII’s Value Grade?

Stock evaluation requires access to huge amounts of data as well as the knowledge and time to sift through it all, make sense of financial ratios, read income statements and analyze recent stock movement. AAII created A+ Investor, a robust data suite that condenses data research in an actionable and customizable way suitable for investors of all knowledge levels, to help investors with that task.

AAII’s proprietary stock grades come with A+ Investor. These offer intuitive A–F grades for more than just value. It is possible for a stock to appear cheap based on one valuation metric but appear expensive on another. It is also possible for one valuation ratio to be associated with outperforming stocks during certain periods of time but not others. Some stocks may even have null values for certain metrics like the price-earnings ratio or the price-to-book ratio but not others. An example of this would be a company with losses instead of profits or a negative book value because of heavy borrowing. Negative earnings or book value result in non-meaningful ratios that are left blank or null.

6 Undervalued Energy Equipment & Services Stocks

Of course, there are countless value stocks that are worth mentioning, but this is a concise list of the top 6 undervalued stocks in the Energy Equipment & Services industry for Friday, August 15, 2025. Let’s take a closer look at their individual scores to see how they measure up against each other and the Energy Equipment & Services industry median.

The Value Grade is assigned based on how each stock’s composite valuation compares to all other stocks.

The process for assigning grades starts with each variable for a given stock. The percentile rankings for all valid ratios that a stock has are calculated. So, for instance, a stock could have a price-to-book ranking in the 43rd percentile, a price-earnings ranking in the 67th percentile, a price-to-sales ranking in the 23rd percentile, etc. Then, those rankings are averaged for each stock. (A minimum of two valid variables are required, though all six will be used if available.)

Once the average of the individual variables is calculated, that average is ranked against all stocks. Put another way, each stock’s composite valuation is compared to all other stocks. These ranks are then sorted into quintiles from the cheapest 20% (a grade of A) to the most expensive 20% (a grade of F).

As always, we recommend that you conduct proper due diligence and research before investing in any security. We also suggest that investors utilize numerous grades, not just value, when it comes to deciding whether a company is a good fit for their allocation needs.

,EPA,2025-08-16 16:57:01+00:00,Sacramento Bee,Trump administration seeks to block California air quality rules - Sacramento Bee,"Sharon Bernstein, Paul Kitagaki Jr",,,,,https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article311719653.html,"It targets a decision by the California Air Resources Board to continue enforcing the state’s standards even after President Donald Trump signed a congressional resolution aimed at invalidating them.
California is also challenging the congressional resolution in federal court.
The industry’s top manufacturers sued on Aug. 11, and on Thursday the Trump administration filed its motion to join the lawsuit.
Government lawyers met via a video conference to discuss the matter on Aug. 14 and filed their motion the same day, documents in federal court show.
“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June.","The Trump administration has intensified its efforts to limit California’s ability to impose clean air standards, filing a motion in federal court to join a trucking industry lawsuit that seeks to end the state’s Clean Truck Partnership, which includes a plan to switch to battery operated heavy trucks by 2045.

The motion, which would make the federal government a plaintiff in the industry lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Sacramento, is the latest in several actions taken by the administration to weaken California’s air quality regulations, many of which are more stringent than those imposed by the federal law and the Environmental Protection Agency.

It targets a decision by the California Air Resources Board to continue enforcing the state’s standards even after President Donald Trump signed a congressional resolution aimed at invalidating them. A similar motion was filed in a lawsuit in Illinois, and another that takes aim at regulations regarding light-duty vehicles such as automobiles was filed this week in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“In a stunning act of defiance, the State of California is attempting to use its own vehicle and engine emissions standards through a so-called ‘Clean Truck Partnership’ to ban internal-combustion engines in heavy-duty trucks, notwithstanding duly enacted federal statutes specifically providing that those regulatory standards are preempted,” the administration said in its motion.

Trump signed a congressional resolution in June revoking California’s ability to impose its own standards, which had been previously allowed under a waiver of federal rules what would otherwise have banned such state-level regulations.

However, the state continued to insist that an agreement it had reached with the trucking industry two years ago that required a reduction in emissions and a shift to electric trucks by 2045 was still enforceable. California is also challenging the congressional resolution in federal court.

The industry’s top manufacturers sued on Aug. 11, and on Thursday the Trump administration filed its motion to join the lawsuit.

The move highlights the administration’s determination to end what it sees as regulatory overreach by California and other Democratic-led states, and marks the latest in a series of lawsuits that have targeted California’s policies on immigration, rights for transgender people, environmental protection and even the price of eggs.

The motion was filed on the same day that California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a proposal to begin to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor more Democrats in response to actions by the state of Texas to draw more Republican seats as requested by Trump. It names the Air Resources Board, the board’s executive director Steven Cliff and Newsom as defendants.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement Friday.

In their initial lawsuit, truck manufacturers Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar, Inc., and Volvo Group North America said that they were “caught in the crossfire” between the federal government and the state of California.

California, they said, continues to insist on compliance with its stricter rules and has threatened sanctions against the companies if they do not do so. But at the same time, their lawsuit says, the U.S. Department of Justice has sent the manufacturers cease-and-desist letters ordering them to stop complying with California’s demands.

“California demands that (manufacturers) follow preempted laws; the United States maintains such laws are illegal and orders (manufacturers) to disregard them,” the lawsuit says. “This situation is not tenable.”

In its motion, the federal government laid out the timeline for its decision to join the lawsuit. On Aug. 11, the day the trucking companies filed their complaint, a congressional committee sent a letter to the Air Resources Board demanding that it comply with federal regulations, the motions says.

The next day, the U.S. Department of Justice requested consent from the trucking companies to join their lawsuit. Government lawyers met via a video conference to discuss the matter on Aug. 14 and filed their motion the same day, documents in federal court show.

CARB spokeswoman Lynda Lambert said the agency continues to believe that the federal government’s actions limiting the state’s ability to enforce its environmental regulations were illegal.

“On June 12, 2025, President Trump signed unconstitutional and illegal resolutions purporting to overturn three of U.S EPA’s decisions to grant California waivers, including its Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Omnibus regulations,” Lambert said. “CARB disputes the legality and effect of these resolutions, and they are being challenged in court.”

CARB chair Liane Randolph declined to comment on the lawsuit itself.

But she has harshly criticized the administration’s efforts to weaken California’s environmental rules.

“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June. The action, she said, was the latest in a series of “vindictive” moves aimed at trapping consumers into using fossil fuels.

“CARB will use every tool at its disposal to continue our critical work to clean the air and address the climate crisis,” she continued at that time. “The health and well-being of all Californians depends on it.”

A hearing on whether to allow the federal government to join the lawsuit has been set for Sept. 19 in federal court in Sacramento.

In Q4 2024, EV sales increased by 15% year-on-year to 365,824. Full-year sales rose 7.3% to 1.3 million units compared to 2023, boosted by government and automaker incentives plus “excellent lease deals,” Cox notes.

US consumers can currently access purchase tax credits of up to $7,500 for certain vehicles under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Incoming president Donald Trump has threatened to end these benefits when he returns to office.

These changes are feared to hit EV sales growth, but analysts at Cox reckon they “won’t take effect for some time, and many buyers might jump in before changes are made.”

Indeed, the company predicts that 2025 will be “another record for EV volume” with “one out of every four vehicles sold” being electrified. The EV market share is estimated to grow from 8.1% in 2024 to around 10% this year, Kallanish understands.

Across 2024, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai and Ford posted a rise in EV sales, while volumes contracted for Tesla, VW and Mercedes-Benz. Yet, the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 continue to be the best-selling electric vehicles in the country, even though their volumes are declining.

The Trump administration and U.S. producers are racing to wean the country from dependence on imports from China.

Second-term Republican President Donald Trump on March 20 signed an executive order titled “Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production” which is aimed at boosting domestic production of critical minerals and reducing reliance on foreign supplies. China has dominated the often dirty, capital-intensive business of processing critical minerals and rare earths for three decades.

Since 2022, companies planning and building plants in Louisiana that will process rare earths, critical minerals, and components of lithium-ion batteries have received more than $1 billion in grants, loans, and tax credits from the U.S. Departments of Energy and Defense and the state of Louisiana.

The Trump administration Wednesday proposed $1 billion of additional funding for the Department of Energy aimed at sponsoring partnerships to develop and scale up mining and processing technologies in the critical minerals and materials supply chains. The funding proposal includes up to $500 million for the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which is to be used to boost U.S. processing of critical minerals and battery manufacturing.

At England Airpark in Alexandria, Ucore North America Rare Metals Inc. began construction in May on a plant that will separate rare earth metals from oxides shipped to the facility through the Port of New Orleans. Ucore received Department of Defense grants totaling $22.4 million to design and build the plant and was chosen for $15 million in tax exemptions by Louisiana Gov. Jon Bel Edwards in 2023. England Airpark, a repurposed Air Force base, is a duty-free zone.

Ucore’s Alexandria plant will process rare earths neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium to purities of 99.9% for use in the production of permanent magnets, which are crucial in manufacturing a variety of high-tech applications including electric vehicles, wind turbines, cellphones, computer hard drives, robotics and military.

Ucore expects to begin processing at the Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in June 2026 with initial production targeted at 3,000 tons of rare earths per year and output in 2027 projected to reach 12,000 tons per year. Ucore will use a solvent extraction process to separate the metals.

Louisiana Economic Development estimates Ucore’s rare earths processing plant will bring 100 direct jobs and 298 indirect jobs to the Alexandria area. Ucore has received grants and tax credits totaling about $267 million from the Departments of Energy and Defense to support project planning and construction.

In Vidalia, about 70 miles east of Alexandria, Syrah Technologies began production in 2024 at its graphite processing plant near the Mississippi River and the company is now scaling up outputs. Syrah is the only U.S.-based supplier to refine graphite to the 99.5% purity level required by industrial and military users. China is the world’s largest graphite supplier, accounting for 78% of global production in 2024, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey.

Syrah, the U.S. subsidiary of an Australian mining company, is ramping up production at the Vidalia plant as the Trump administration considers imposing Section 232 tariffs of 93.5% on anode graphite imported from China. In July, the Commerce Department found that anode graphite imported from China is being sold in the United States at less than fair market value. In October, the Trump administration will release a Section 232 report on U.S. imports of anode graphite from China which will establish a tariff rate that will go into effect in December.

Syrah’s Vidalia plant processes “flake” or “natural” graphite mined in countries that are part of the U.S. battery supply chain. In 2024, there was no flake graphite mined in the United States, although synthetic graphite was produced. Manufactured synthetic graphite has a carbon footprint five times that of mined and processed flake graphite, and it is also far more costly to produce.

The typical electric vehicle battery contains more than 200 pounds of anode graphite, which has thermal and electrical properties that also make is essential in the production of F-35 fighter jets, the barrels of heavy artillery guns, the cones forming the tips of missiles, and satellites. Syrah signed a deal with Tesla calling for the company in January 2025 to begin supplying spheroid graphite processed for use in EV batteries.

Syrah’s Vidalia processing plant employs 88 people, with a planned expansion expected to result in an additional 88 jobs. In 2022, the Department of Energy awarded Syrah a $220 million grant and loaned the company $102.1 million.

In south Louisiana, construction work has begun on three plants that will produce electrolyte salts critical in battery production. One of the electrolyte production plants is in Jefferson Parish and the other two are in St. Gabriel and Geismar.

In Jefferson Parish, Japanese chemical company UBE Corp. in February began construction on a $491 million facility at Cornerstone Energy Park configured to produce dimethyl carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate, essential components in lithium-ion batteries. Jefferson Parish provided $80 million in tax breaks over the course of 10 years through the Industrial Tax Exemption Program.

In nearby Iberville Parish, United Kingdom-based Koura Global is reportedly retrofitting its existing plant in St. Gabriel to manufacture lithium hexafluorophosphate, known also as LiPF6, a component that allows for the efficient flow of electricity through lithium-ion batteries. Koura has previously estimated the facility would produce 10,000 metric tons of LiPF6 per year.

Koura has said it expects to spend more than $400 million on the project. In 2022, under the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded Koura with a $100 million grant to develop LiPF6 production. It is expected that the plant will become operational in 2026. The plant would be the first of its kind in the United States.

In Ascension Parish, the Energy Department in September 2024 awarded Battery Materials Processing Grants to Element 25 (Louisiana) LLC and Honeywell International Inc. to support production of battery components.

The Energy Department awarded $126.4 million to Honeywell to boost supply of Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, also called LiFSI, which is a critical component in lithium-ion batteries and batteries designed for large-scale energy storage systems. Honeywell’s production facility in Geismar will be the first of its kind in the United States, according to Department of Energy.

The Energy Department’s 2024 grant to Element25 for $166.1 million supports construction of the company’s refining facility in Burnside, which will produce high-purity manganese sulfate monohydrate, or HPMSM, a component in lithium-ion batteries. The plant will be the first of its kind in the nation, federal officials say. Element25 plans to import manganese concentrate from the company’s Butcherbird mine in Australia.

In Louisiana’s northeast, Exxon and other companies are searching for underground brine high in lithium content. Underground brines are high-salinity waters associated with salt deposits deep underground that often contain oil and lithium. Successful extraction of lithium from brines found underground across the state line in northeast Texas and south-central Arkansas indicate the mineral is present in large quantities in Louisiana, too.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Tougher rules on how projects can qualify for federal clean energy tax credits could slow development of new electricity generation at a time of surging power demand driven by artificial intelligence and the digital economy.

KEY QUOTE

“Any regulatory friction that slows down deployment of new generation today directly impacts our ability to meet AI-era electricity demands tomorrow,” the coalition wrote in its letter to Bessent. The letter is dated August 4 but was seen by Reuters on Friday.

CONTEXT

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in July directing Treasury to tighten clean energy tax credit rules, including redefining what it means for a project to have started construction.

The industry has relied on the existing rules for the last decade, and advisory firm Clean Energy Associates projected this week that the United States could lose about 60 gigawatts of planned solar capacity through 2030 if stricter “beginning of construction” rules are implemented.

BY THE NUMBERS

Between 2017 and 2023, the U.S. data center industry contributed $3.5 trillion to the nation’s gross domestic product and directly employed over 600,000 workers, according to the DCC.

WHAT’S NEXT

The Treasury Department is expected to issue updated guidelines as soon as August 18.

Last time it got any serious traction in Washington, D.C., former U.S. Sen. Joe Machin was leading the charge on the Energy Permitting Reform Act. Now, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., is bringing lawmakers’ attention back to the matter in the hope that something will be on the president’s desk by the end of the year.

She’s working with Senate Environment and Public Works Committee ranking Democratic member Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. (She is chairwoman of that committee). This is a bipartisan press.

“It’s not just new pipelines or natural gas. It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said. “I think what we’re seeing here is a convergence of clean energy folks and people like me who are all-of-the-above meeting together with an urgency, and I think that’s why I think we have a better shot at this year than we’ve had over the last few years.”

In other words, this is a wide-ranging effort that streamlines a process that now genuinely impedes progress. It has support from both sides of the aisle and makes sense. And, as Capito points out, “that would be great for West Virginia.”

A text message from his utility said a piece of equipment had failed at 2 a.m. By the time a repair crew showed up eight hours later, the hot, sticky Florida summer was already taking a toll.

""You just don't realize how important your power is until you don't have it,"" says Thomas, a retired air traffic controller. ""In Florida's heat, you just can't live without air conditioning. And this time of year particularly.""

Thomas has invested in energy-saving windows and insulation to keep his house comfortable. But in the heat of the summer, his power bills still top $400 a month.

""It's painful to see that bill when it comes in,"" he says.

Across the country, electricity prices have jumped more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year. That's especially painful during the dog days of summer, when air conditioners are working overtime.

In Pembroke Pines, Fla., Al Salvi's power bill can reach $500 a month.

""There's a lot of seniors down here that are living check to check. They can barely afford prescriptions such as myself,"" says Salvi, who's 63 and uses a wheelchair. ""Now we got to decide whether we're going to pay the electric bill or are we going to buy medication. And it's not fair to us. You're squeezing us between a rock and a hard place.""

Earlier this year, the utility that serves both Thomas and Salvi, Florida Power & Light, applied for a rate increase that would have boosted bills for a typical South Florida resident by about 13% over the next four years.

The AARP launched a petition drive to oppose the rate hike, and quickly gathered tens of thousands of signatures.

""Our members are pretty upset,"" says Zayne Smith, AARP Florida's director of advocacy. ""That's just another way people are getting nickel and dimed out of being able to afford to live here in Florida.""

Last week, Florida Power & Light announced a tentative agreement on rates with commercial and industrial customers. CEO Armando Pimentel said the deal would ensure, ""we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low.""

Details of the new rate proposal have not been made public.

It's not just Florida that's wrestling with high-priced power. Electricity prices have been rising rapidly across the country — thanks to a combination of factors tied to both demand and supply.

Power-hungry AI data centers are one factor driving high prices

Power-hungry data centers have been popping up all over, to serve the boom in artificial intelligence. The Energy Department projects data centers and other commercial customers will use more electricity than households for the first time ever next year. That's a challenge for policymakers, who have to decide how to accommodate that extra demand and who should foot the bill.

""Regulators always play catchup,"" says John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The growth of data centers is far outpacing the response by grid managers, public utility commissions across the country, and they're racing to catch up.""

Natural gas exports also push prices higher

The soaring price of natural gas is also pushing power prices higher. More than 40% of electricity is generated using natural gas. As more gas is exported as liquid natural gas, the competition from foreign customers is driving up the price utilities have to pay here at home.

The Energy Department says the cost of gas used to generate power jumped more than 40% in the first half of this year compared to 2024. Another 17% increase is expected next year.

""Any way you look at it, gas-fired power is expensive,"" Quigley says. ""It's going to be increasingly expensive as natural gas exports increase. The future is to make electricity cheaper and the way to do it is clean energy.""

One in six households already struggles to pay for power

Solar and wind power can be cheaper than gas-fired plants, even without government subsidies. But building new power supplies and the wires to carry it will cost money. And one out of six households already have trouble paying their current electric bills.

""We're not questioning whether the grid needs to be rebuilt,"" says Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which advocates for low-income energy customers. ""We're not questioning whether there needs to be new data centers built. But the problem is, for low income families and people living in poverty, they don't have the ability to pay any more than they're currently paying, without falling even further behind and getting into shut-off situations.""

The federal government currently spends about $4 billion a year to help low-income families with energy bills. But Wolfe says that's not enough to cover rising cooling costs in the summer. And President Trump's proposed budget would end the assistance altogether.

In Boca Raton, Ken Thomas was grateful to have his power restored this week, after about ten hours with no air conditioning. At the same time, he's bracing for his August electric bill.

""I value my utility that I need to stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter,"" he says. ""But I also know that there is a limit to what we can afford to pay.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5184x2916+0+270/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fee%2F4603b8014644a3727bf4e39945b8%2Fken-thomas.jpeg,N,,2025-08-16 14:03:15.950483

More AI means more electric power generation — a lot more.

“Green” or “renewable” energy is not going to cut it, no matter the fantasies of the climate-change doomsday crowd. That means the climate goals of “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, or whatever is the latest movable goal post set by the U.N., federal and state bureaucrats, is a dead letter.

Net-zero always was a farcical, unscientific and unrealistic dogma designed to reorder societies and increase government and bureaucratic control over the economy, with ever-diminishing freedom for individuals.

Artificial intelligence requires large-scale computational capacity housed in data centers that require massive amounts of electrical power. According to a report by the RAND Corp. this year, AI data centers worldwide need more than 20 gigawatts of power to operate, which is twice the total capacity of the state of Utah and its more than 3.5 million people.

In just two years, RAND projects that 68 gigawatts of power will be needed globally to operate more and larger data centers to generate AI, which would double the capacity from 2022, and approach the 86 gigawatts that power the state of California and its 39 million residents. By 2030, more than 300 gigawatts of power are projected globally for AI, though other estimates project lower amounts, according to RAND.

AI data centers require tens of thousands of computer chips, and this number is growing, which explains the importance of harnessing rare earth minerals in the United States and regions globally, including Greenland and Africa. The Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tenn., for example, contains 100,000 computer chips and requires 150 megawatts of power, which approximates the generating capacity of 55 modern wind turbines and 53,000 households, RAND said. In the United States, there are nearly 4,000 data centers, up 40% from 18 months ago. Many more are underway.

From where will the future energy to power AI come?

Not from windmills or solar panels.

Instead, the world over will have to increase more reliable energy sources, particularly coal, natural gas and that other bugaboo of environmentalists, nuclear energy. Like it or not, nuclear power is making a comeback in the United States and natural gas is expanding out of necessity. It is the only way to sustain the rapid growth of AI.

As of 2023, 43% of electricity generated power came from natural gas, nearly 19% from nuclear, 16% from coal, 10% from wind, and 4% from solar, according to the Energy Information Administration. Last year, solar and wind-generated electricity combined eclipsed coal. This may be renewables’ high-water mark.

When it comes to AI expansion, solar and wind won’t cut it. Energy expert Steve Gorham recently wrote that these sources are replete with transmission costs and delays, are scattered over broad areas, and require transmission towers and lines to be built across the countryside to aggregate enough power for a large data center. The Interior Department is scaling back such projects, citing wind and solar as 5,500 times less efficient on a per-acre basis than nuclear energy. That suggests the “green energy transformation” has peaked and will become a more boutique energy source.

There are not a few bitter clingers in the climate change world that are holding onto the green energy dreamscape.

For example, Sumant Sinha, the founder and CEO of ReNew, estimates that $3 trillion will be invested globally in the next five years. Count me as dubious.

How much of this estimate is hoped-for government spending and financial guarantees that will end up illusory? How many nations will follow through on climate change initiatives, which typically fall short?

The Trump administration is curtailing corporate welfare for renewables, and other countries such as Germany are pulling back. AI is moving too fast for expensive and inefficient “renewable” energy to keep up, especially with dwindling taxpayer subsidies.

Which brings us back to “net-zero.” The United States and nations worldwide can pass laws all day long that set goals and timetables to attain net carbon-free generation of electricity. However, cost and physics are determinative, and are transcending renewable energy mandates and net-zero goals, both of which are not worth the computer screen on which they appear.

Artificial intelligence is a growing presence in Americans’ daily lives and is transforming the American and global economy. The gigawatts of electricity to power this expanding technology will mean more nuclear and fossil fuel development and will end the pretense of net-zero carbon electricity. Indeed, the AI revolution will render net-zero a bigger joke and relegate it to the ash heap of history like so many other top-down government dictates.

The United States is home to millions of small businesses that form the backbone of countless communities. Even during the best of times, keeping shops solvent can be a struggle, but when climate-driven disasters strike, the impact on mom-and-pops can be particularly devastating -- and prolonged.

""The news coverage has definitely focused on the physical destruction,"" said Kyle McCurry. He is the director of public relations for Explore Asheville, an organization that promotes the North Carolina city, which Hurricane Helene pummeled with torrential rain and flooding last fall. ""But sometimes what's less visible is the economic impact on small businesses in our community over time.""

Whether it's hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves or ice storms, small businesses are more vulnerable to climate shocks than larger businesses, said Shehryar Nabi, a senior research associate at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program. He co-wrote a recent report outlining the hurdles small businesses face from severe weather. They can be hobbled by a range of challenges, from limited preparation resources to a lack of post-disaster financing.

""One reason we focused on small businesses here is because of their importance to the U.S. economy,"" Nabi said. That was certainly the case in Asheville, a city known for its artists, breweries and boutiques. Helene not only destroyed homes and upended lives, it sent the region's economy into a tailspin.

In 2023, McCurry said, visitors to the area spent $2.9 billion. Last year, Helene hit Appalachia right before the busy fall foliage season, when tourists flock to places like Asheville to see the leaves turn. McMurry said the storm, which knocked out some municipal services for weeks, led to a 20% to 40% drop in annual business revenue.

Ten months later, a slew of businesses haven't reopened: Vivian's restaurant, Pleb Urban Winery and TRVE Brewery, to name a few. Another was New Origin Brewery, which started pouring in 2021 and soon had fans lauding it as their favorite brewery in Asheville. Although the floodwaters inundated the business, the bulk of the destruction occurred when railroad cars floated off nearby tracks and crashed into the building.

""There's not a way to get money for damages in that scenario,"" said Dan Juhnke, one of New Origin's founders. Even after maxing out the brewery's flood insurance claim, it wasn't enough to cover the damage. The only other option was to take on more debt from the federal Small Business Administration, which didn't seem prudent. Ultimately, Juhnke and his business partner decided to apply for a Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded buyout program that purchases flood-damaged property and limits rebuilding as a way to mitigate the damage from future storms.

""We signed up for it and have been waiting almost a year now,"" said Juhnke.

McCurry estimated that, overall, around 85% of Asheville businesses have reopened in some form, which is relatively good news. According to 2014 national data from FEMA and the Department of Labor, 40% of small businesses do not reopen after a natural disaster and another 25% shutter within a year.

These waves of impacts are coupled with limited support options for small businesses in both the long and short term. While FEMA has individual and public assistance programs, there is little if any funding for businesses. The Small Business Administration often offers low-interest loans, but the paperwork can be burdensome and the money might not start arriving for months. Only 14% of businesses were able to rely on support from the federal government, according to an analysis of the 2021 Small Business Credit Survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

""Support makes a meaningful difference,"" Nabi said. ""For a lot of businesses it is the difference between closing down and surviving, but it doesn't reach all the businesses that could benefit.""

State and local governments, private lenders and community fundraising are other potential sources of money. New Origin, for example, raised more than $100,000 via a GoFundMe campaign but fell short of its $300,000 goal. A fund that Explore Asheville established has brought in $2.1 million, which has been awarded to more than 500 businesses.

Still, Nabi said, these avenues don't usually address one of the toughest challenges facing businesses after a storm: liquidity. Even a month or two of disrupted cash flow can devastate some operations, which is why experts point to pre-disaster planning as one of the most effective steps a business can take to help protect itself.

""Often businesses see contingency planning as a distraction from the core thing they want to do,"" said Benjamin Collier, an associate professor in the Department of Risk and Insurance at the Wisconsin School of Business. But things like better understanding your insurance coverage, or where to move inventory in the event of a threat, should be routine steps for business owners and generally aren't expensive.

""The natural tendency for many small business owners (is) to be reluctant to really engage with the risks that they're exposed to,"" he said. ""This is a call to have more buffers and be more cautious.""

Nabi also underlined the importance of planning, but said structural change could help as well. Greater use of parametric insurance, which automatically pays out when a specific event like a disaster happens, would allow quicker access to funds. Shifting more money to pre-disaster preparation could help businesses avoid the worst impacts of a storm, too.

""The financing for preparation is limited compared to what's available post-disaster,"" Nabi said.

Pat Nye is the regional director for the Los Angeles Small Business Development Network. Earlier this year the counties he oversees saw historically devastating wildfires, and one thing that he noticed was that unlike with residential properties, insurance companies hadn't offered small businesses discounts for any improvements they might have made to make their buildings more fire-resilient.

""As it stands, there is no incentive that exists for this work,"" Nye said. ""A lot of stuff just focuses on home owners.""

Governments often don't do enough to include small businesses in their recovery plans either, contends Kristen Fanarakis, the associate director of small business policy and innovation at the nonprofit Milken Institute. She pointed to a landscaper in the Asheville area who spent weeks helping clear debris after Helene without pay and ended up facing eviction. Those are the kind of businesses, she said, that municipalities should be hiring and including in rebuilding efforts.

More broadly, a report Fanarakis wrote called for a cross-agency ""small business resilience czar,"" standardized disaster assistance forms and quicker grant dispersal, among other recommendations. She called the current system ""very reactionary"" and argues for increased attention to not just the immediate impacts of disasters but the long-term economic fallout as well.

""When we think about fortifying small businesses,"" she said, ""it's about going beyond a physical structure.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/17/103746746_AP24276624930458_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-16 13:05:39.330031

A shift in global investment

The report, entitled ""Strong Signals in the Noise"", highlights growing momentum in the global clean economy, driven by energy security concerns, trade realignments and technological breakthroughs.

In 2024 alone, clean energy investments outpaced global oil and gas spending two-to-one, the report states. And Canada, with its vast critical minerals, emissions-free electricity and skilled workforce, could become a clean energy superpower.

According to the report, the clean energy transition is no longer a niche sector, with worldwide investment in clean power, electrification and low-carbon materials growing 22% annually. That shift is being amplified by mounting global concerns over energy security and supply chain resilience, with countries seeking to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

“Canada has the resources, the talent and the trade routes to boost the energy transition around the world while creating stable jobs and driving innovation here at home,” Smith noted.

With 80% of its electricity already emissions-free and critical minerals exploration at a global high, Canada’s clean energy sector has quietly built a strong base. And provinces are starting to take advantage: BC Hydro’s 2024 power call alone will result in $5–6 billion in capital investment, while Ontario has secured major EV and battery deals from multinational firms.

Headwinds to overcome

Despite these strengths, the report suggests that Canada risks losing out in the global energy economy unless a more coordinated approach to policy and investment is defined.

“We need to scale our efforts by ensuring a strong foundation and building market confidence now, to mobilize the capital required to take advantage of this growth potential in Canada,” said Andrea Moffat of Addenda Capital, in a statement.

According to New Economy Canada, U.S. tariff wars, Chinese dominance in clean tech and recent U.S. policy reversals are all part of the challenge that the Canadian government must overcome to maximize this potential.

But industry leaders from sectors like cement, hydrogen and renewables all echoed the sentiment that Canada is facing a huge economic opportunity. “Canada is not just ready to compete globally — we’re ready to lead the clean‑energy transition,” said Matt Harper, president of Invinity Energy Systems, in a statement.

Global talks on curbing dangerous plastics pollution ended early Friday without agreement on a comprehensive treaty. Divisions over whether to mandate enforceable limits on plastic production were too deep to bridge.

“I believe that everybody is very disappointed. However, multilateralism is not easy,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme. “To the people who are disappointed, I am in that group.”

She said discussions about moving ahead will continue, including at the UN Environment Assembly in Kenya in December, where a report on the plastic talks is due.

Failure of the talks means that island-sized rafts of rotting plastic in the world’s oceans will keep growing for the foreseeable future, and that dangerous human health impacts from the production and processing of plastic will increase.

A 2022 resolution passed by UNEA, which includes all U.N. member states, obligated the countries to create a legally binding treaty to address these growing environmental and health threats. Four meetings over the past two years preceded this month’s Geneva talks, which were intended to deliver a full-fledged deal.

Andersen noted that no previous major U.N. treaties had been finalized on such an ambitious timeline.

“And it is important that everyone takes time to reflect on what they have heard,” she said. “Because in the closed groups…in the corridors of these halls, red lines have been mentioned for the first time in a true way which will enable deeper pathway seeking as we move ahead.”

The red lines highlight the deep division between the two blocs. One group of about 80 to 100 countries, including the European Union and numerous developing countries and island nations in the Global South, is calling for global action to address all aspects of plastics pollution.

A smaller group, including fossil-fuel producers, said they would not accept a treaty with limits on production. Gas and oil are the primary raw materials for plastics. The United States doesn’t consider itself aligned with either group, but its positions at the latest round of talks place it closest to the one blocking action.

The deadlock mirrors the situation at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations aimed at limiting the global temperature increase caused by humans, where a similar coalition of oil- and gas-producing countries has long blocked any ambitious measures to reduce fossil fuel use, including for the production of plastics.

To a growing number of people involved in international environmental talks, that’s a sign that the consensus-based system is not working. At Geneva, hallway conversations increasingly explored options for voting on key provisions in the treaty, including whether production and consumption should be addressed.

“A bad process doesn’t lead to good outcomes,” said South African marine biologist Merrisa Naidoo, attending the Geneva talks for GAIA Africa, part of the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives.

“We only care about the achievement of consensus,” she said, speaking during a press conference on Thursday. “But consensus is not democracy. It ignores the will of the vast majority of member states, and has unfortunately started to cater to the wish list of the petrostates and fossil fuel industry.”

For the global majority favoring swift measures to curb plastics, the frustration built up throughout the Geneva talks. Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, head of Panama’s delegation at the talks, at one point said, “We are not here for diplomatic tourism. We are here to negotiate. We’re here to engage. We’re here to get a deal that includes the entire life cycle of plastic, and that means addressing production.”

About half of all plastics produced are used once and then discarded, and that, he said, “is not innovation. This is human arrogance that poisons rivers and robs our children of a safe future.”

Microplastics especially are a dangerous scourge that must be dealt with soon, he added.

“They are in our blood, in our lungs and in the first cry of a newborn child,” he said. “Our bodies are living proof of a system that profits from poisoning us. Behind every microplastic also lies a macro lie, and that lie is that recycling alone will save us.”

But provisions calling for less production would cross red lines for several countries, including the United States, a major plastics maker. The country opposes “restrictions on producers that would harm US companies and the nearly one million American workers employed in plastics and related industries,” according to a statement from the US Department of State.

“There is no one-size-fits-all approach to reducing plastic pollution; the agreement shouldn’t create prescriptive lists of products or chemicals to restrict,” a State Department spokesperson wrote in an email.

Since the start of the second Trump administration, the US has backed away from international engagement and collaboration on environmental topics, but has remained fully engaged in the plastics talks. Its delegation is headed by the same career diplomats who represented the US under the previous administration of President Joe Biden.

And while the Trump administration and Congress are trying to reverse many of Biden’s environmental policies, that’s not the case at the UNEP plastic talks. Under both Biden and Trump, the US has been opposed to legally binding measures requiring a reduction of plastic production and consumption.

The differences between the two administrations are nuanced, said Rachel Radvany, an environmental health campaigner who has been tracking the plastic talks since the beginning for the Center for International Environmental Law.

Under Biden, the US seemed ready to support language that would at least include some aspirational language about capping production, but that is no longer the case, she said.

“What they were supporting was not really a production cap and phase down,” she said. “It was like an aspirational target that would leave us in the same place for plastics as we are for climate, when it’s like, when everyone’s responsible, no one’s responsible.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229381638.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-16 18:02:26.186454

The report provides an in-depth look at the strengths and gaps across the solar supply chain as the nation seeks to expand renewable energy adoption in response to growing electricity demand.
Other critical components, including flat glass and power optimizers, are also underproduced domestically, with current U.S. manufacturing meeting less than 25 percent of projected demand for solar installations.

The report provides an in-depth look at the strengths and gaps across the solar supply chain as the nation seeks to expand renewable energy adoption in response to growing electricity demand.

According to the analysis, the United States has no existing capacity to manufacture polysilicon ingots and wafers key building blocks of solar panels and only limited capacity to produce solar cells. Other critical components, including flat glass and power optimizers, are also underproduced domestically, with current U.S. manufacturing meeting less than 25 percent of projected demand for solar installations.

Alisa Petersen, Federal Policy Manager with RMI, stated, “A more robust domestic supply chain means more good jobs and more affordable energy for our communities. Making the subcomponents we need for solar energy here at home ensures clean energy is more reliable and accessible. This map is a great resource for understanding the gaps, so we know how and where to grow U.S. manufacturing for the solar industry.”

BlueGreen Alliance Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy Ted Fertik, mentioned, “American workers cannot afford to see the solar industry collapse. For no good reason, America is missing out on the huge opportunity to lead in manufacturing clean technology components and create good-paying jobs across the country.”

The findings underscore both the importance of scaling up U.S. solar manufacturing and the challenges the country faces in building a resilient, secure supply chain. With electricity demand on the rise, the resource is intended to guide policymakers, industry leaders, and stakeholders in identifying areas where targeted investment and development could strengthen domestic solar production and reduce reliance on imports.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/30-1.png,N,,2025-08-16 14:03:05.691126

Filed in U.S. District Court for Oregon, the complaint targets the department’s policy change that limits reimbursement that states can use toward administrative and staffing costs. The attorneys general and governors are framing it as cuts against consumers.

“Cutting these programs would pull the rug out from efforts to save New Yorkers money on their bills, prepare homes for extreme weather, and move toward clean, affordable energy,” James said in a post on X.

On June 30, the department in a policy flash announced limits to how much state governments can claim for overhead and employee benefits on new grants.

Before, states often could get back much more, based on special agreements. Now, reimbursements are capped at just 10% of the total award. This means less money to cover things like office staff, utilities, and worker benefits tied to the project.

For some states, that could mean dipping into their own budgets to make up the difference or scaling back support services — leaving more federal dollars for the project itself but tightening belts at the state level.

“We’re suing to stop [President] Donald Trump from making it harder for states like Connecticut to drive down energy costs and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Connecticut families and small businesses are getting socked by skyrocketing utility bills, and now Trump is lawlessly defunding efforts to help us save. And why? So that he can funnel even more tax breaks to billionaires. We’re not going to let him,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement in a press release Friday.

The DOJ filed two complaints in federal courts against the California Air Resources Board over a partnership the state inked with heavy-duty truck and engine manufacturers.
Through the Clean Truck Partnership, the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association and other major truck manufacturers agreed in 2023 to meet the state’s vehicle standards that require the sale and adoption of zero-emissions technology.

Andrea Issod, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said she doesn’t buy that argument.","The U.S. Department of Justice announced on Friday that it is suing California over its emission standards for trucks, escalating the battle over the state’s authority to set its own clean air standards.

The DOJ filed two complaints in federal courts against the California Air Resources Board over a partnership the state inked with heavy-duty truck and engine manufacturers.

Through the Clean Truck Partnership, the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association and other major truck manufacturers agreed in 2023 to meet the state’s vehicle standards that require the sale and adoption of zero-emissions technology. The manufacturers pledged to do so regardless of any legal challenges that might arise to the state’s authority to set more stringent emission standards.

In exchange, CARB agreed to work with manufacturers and provide more lead time to meet regulatory requirements before imposing new regulations.

The DOJ argues in its press release that the federal Clean Air Act preempts state regulations of vehicle emissions unless the Environmental Protection Agency grants California a waiver. In June, President Donald Trump signed into law congressional resolutions to invalidate waivers previously adopted by the Biden administration, including the state’s ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered cars beginning by 2035.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Adam Gustafson, acting assistant attorney general for the Environment and Natural Resources Division at the DOJ, wrote in a statement.

CARB declined to comment, citing pending litigation.

Brian Beveridge, executive director of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, said he is not surprised because the Trump administration has been “committed to rolling back environmental standards on every front.”

“We’re awash in diesel emissions and this administration doesn’t care,” Beveridge said. “It’s been amazing to me how the minute the administration took on this kind of a fight, all of these industries just decided, ‘The gloves are off, we don’t have to do any of that stuff.’”

The DOJ complaints come after four truck manufacturers filed a lawsuit against CARB this week over its zero-emission vehicle plan, stating the manufacturers were “caught in the crossfire” between California’s demands and the federal government.

Andrea Issod, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said she doesn’t buy that argument.

“They’re painting this story that they’re caught between the federal and state regulators and the trucking companies are the victims,” Issod said. “It’s apparent they’ve been working with the Trump administration to back out of the obligations that they made with California.”

The Federal Trade Commission, earlier this week, closed its investigation into whether truck and engine manufacturers and their trade association violated antitrust laws by entering the partnership. The commission wrote that the “agreement forced manufacturers to produce ‘zero emissions’ engines rather than internal combustion engines, and these output restrictions remained in place even if the CARB regulations were later invalidated.”

Issod said California has been clear that the state needs to reduce pollution to meet its obligations under the Clean Air Act and protect its residents.

“If these trucking companies want to back out of this agreement, California is going to be creative in other ways to get those reductions it needs,” Issod said.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/230928-EAGLE-ROCK-SETTLE-MD-07_qed.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 13:04:47.966023

His recent policy moves have led several wind energy companies to rethink investments in the U.S. and halt developments due to financial and political uncertainty.
However, following Trump’s attack on U.S. wind energy, the value of domestic wind projects has dropped significantly.
Nevertheless, Ørsted plans to complete its Sunrise Wind project off the coast of New York and the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island, so long as it can raise the $9 billion needed to achieve this.
While the political moves to restrict wind energy development are new, Trump’s disdain for the energy source is not.","The Danish wind energy producer Ørsted has blamed United States President Donald Trump for its plummeting shares following Trump’s months of attack on wind energy, and it is not the only wind energy producer suffering from the new U.S. policies that make it more difficult to develop wind farms.

For months, President Trump has threatened those in the wind and solar energy industries, as he stated plans to restrict new development. In July, Trump announced plans to tighten federal permitting to restrict solar and wind energy development, following the passing of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, instead, focuses on the expansion of fossil fuel and nuclear power projects. His recent policy moves have led several wind energy companies to rethink investments in the U.S. and halt developments due to financial and political uncertainty.

In August, Europe’s largest wind power company, Ørsted, blamed President Trump for derailing its business model after its market value dropped by nearly a third. Ørsted told shareholders that it would need to raise funds to cover the cost of its plans due to the “extraordinary situation” the company was facing in the U.S. Ørsted said that the “recent material developments in the U.S.” had made it impossible to raise the money needed by selling a stake in its new the eastern seaboard project off as previously planned.

Typically, Ørsted covers the cost of its new developments by selling a stake in each project once it is under development. However, following Trump’s attack on U.S. wind energy, the value of domestic wind projects has dropped significantly.

Trump’s approach to wind and solar power marks a U-turn on the Biden-era stance on renewables. The Biden administration introduced a wide range of policies and orders to promote the expansion of the U.S. renewable energy industry, supported by financial incentives, such as tax breaks. This was aimed at supporting a green transition away from fossil fuels. Now, Trump is attempting to undo much of the groundwork laid by Biden, to stall green energy progress and push fossil fuel production even higher.

In January, Trump ordered a review of offshore wind permitting and leasing. The review hit the industry hard at a time when it was only just recovering from supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and higher material costs, which have driven up project costs. Trump has since issued a stop-work order on a project being developed by the Norwegian energy company Equinor, which has made those in the industry wary of investing in new developments.

Nevertheless, Ørsted plans to complete its Sunrise Wind project off the coast of New York and the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island, so long as it can raise the $9 billion needed to achieve this. The firm’s CEO, Rasmus Errboe, said, “Ørsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the U.S. on top of the past years’ macroeconomic and supply chain challenges.”

In August, the Interior Department said that approving new solar and solar projects would require additional new layers of political review by the Interior Secretary’s office, which is leading to permitting delays. The agency is also investigating the prevalence of bird deaths related to wind farms and withdrawing millions of acres of federal waters that were previously available for leasing for offshore wind.

It is also expected to begin reviewing wind projects that have already been granted approval but are being sued by opponents, and may rescind their permits, even if they are already under construction. In August, the agency said it was reversing the Biden-era approval of the Lava Ridge Wind Project in southern Idaho as, among other issues, lawmakers said it was visible from a World War II internment camp for Japanese Americans, known as the Minidoka National Historic Site.

While the political moves to restrict wind energy development are new, Trump’s disdain for the energy source is not. The U.S. president first publicly voiced his opposition to wind energy 14 years ago when he fought against the development of 11 wind turbines that were visible from his Aberdeenshire golf course in Scotland. At the time, Trump argued the “ugly” turbines were “monstrosities” that would help sink Scotland’s tourism industry.

He ultimately lost the legal fight aimed at halting construction of the turbines, but now he appears to be back with a vengeance. On a recent visit to the U.K., Trump spoke out against the country’s energy agenda, which focuses on a shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives. During the visit, Trump stated, “They should get rid of the windmills and bring back the oil… The windmills are really detrimental to the beauty of Scotland and every other place they go up.”

The United States appeared to be a favourable investment environment for renewable energy companies looking to develop their portfolios under the Biden administration, which encouraged companies such as Ørsted and Equinor to plan major onshore and offshore wind power developments in the U.S. However, Trump’s recent attack on wind energy has made the investment outlook much more uncertain, leading companies to lose both public confidence and funds as they struggle to develop new projects.

“For us, it’s really a kick in the balls,” said Patrick Goggles, a member of the tribe who led the implementation of the federal Solar for All program in its Natural Resources Office.

Goggles learned that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was moving to cancel $7 billion in funding for low-income households to install rooftop solar panels when the New York Times reported it. The Northern Arapaho had expected to receive about $10 million between agreements with The Northern Plains Tribal Solar for All Coalition and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Goggles said.

“We were really looking forward to doing these projects,” said Dean Goggles, the Natural Resources Office’s executive director and Patrick’s brother. “It’s a huge loss.”

As the Northern Arapaho explore options for other funding sources, their neighbors in the Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming, the Eastern Shoshone, are officially moving forward with a solar-powered microgrid.

On the last day of July, the Eastern Shoshone finally received grant money for the project from the Bureau of Indian Affairs through its Tribal Electrification Program, which was funded using Inflation Reduction Act Money but is unrelated to Solar For All, said Levi Purdum, director of Energize Wind River, a renewable energy company working on the reservation. The tribe had been unsure whether it would receive the already awarded funding during the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

“It’s a very unusual scenario,” Purdum said, reflecting on the period when the funding was in flux.

According to Purdum, the BIA could not confirm the tribe would receive money it had already been awarded, and told him the money was sequestered in the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees federal spending and is led by Russel Vought, the self-described Christian Nationalist and a co-author of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump’s second term.

Now that the Eastern Shoshone have secured a little over $7 million, Purdum hopes construction can begin soon, though he noted that the tribe had planned to get additional funds from the Solar for All program to maintain the microgrid once it was built.

With the Trump administration apparently intent on stymying renewable energy development, both tribes are dealing with how to work with a federal government they say has suddenly become much more unreliable.

“Prior to the administration change, there were tons of grants available that would have been so appropriate, so in tune with our project and goal to be on our path towards energy sovereignty,” said Gilbert Richie, housing services director with the Eastern Shoshone Housing Authority.

“And then the administration changed. The funds are frozen or eliminated. And then they’re brought back,” Ritchie said. “We don’t know if we should apply for grants with the anticipation that they might not be available next year.”

Neither tribe is giving up on solar energy, particularly the Northern Arapaho, and both are determined to scour the private sector for funding to pursue a technology they see as supporting tribal sovereignty.

Taylor Rogers, a White House assistant press secretary, did not answer questions about how rescinding funding for low-income households aligns with the administration’s purported commitment to affordability, and did not respond to questions about how reducing energy funding helps the country stave off the “energy emergency” the administration has declared.

“We don’t know if we should apply for grants with the anticipation that they might not be available next year.”

— Gilbert Richie, Eastern Shoshone Housing Authority

Instead, she referred to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Aug. 7 announcement that the program would end. Zeldin claimed the agency “no longer has the authority to administer the program” after July’s spending bill ended the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Solar for All’s parent program.

“Administrator Zeldin is laser-focused on ensuring taxpayer dollars are managed properly, and this includes going after wasteful spending conducted by the previous administration,” said Cyrus Western, EPA’s region 8 administrator, who oversees the Mountain West, which has 28 federally recognized Native American tribes.

Western did not respond to questions regarding affordability and energy concerns.

A Microgrid With Backup Power

With funding secured, Energize Wind River is working with the Eastern Shoshone Housing Authority to build a solar microgrid that could satisfy the electricity demand from up to 21 homes on the reservation. The system will use batteries to store electricity from the panels when they are producing more power than the homes demand, and it will also include a natural gas generator that would “literally just be an emergency backup option,” Purdum said.

The gas facility is not covered by federal funding, and Purdum said the Eastern Shoshone are seeking support elsewhere to purchase the generator.

Energize Wind River, which is made up almost entirely of Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribal members, intends to conduct a complete environmental analysis of the project’s impacts. Purdum, who is not an enrolled member of either tribe, is proud of the scrutiny they are giving the project, given the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental regulations.

“Even if we don’t need a detailed environmental impact study for our project, that’s still something that we want to produce, we want to have on hand and we want to be able to share with the community, with tribal organizations and tribal leaders, because that’s a matter of good stewardship,” Purdum said. “That’s the only responsible way to do a project like this.”

The energy savings for tribal members who get electricity from the microgrid could help them find financial stability after tribal benefits—royalties companies pay the tribe for drilling on its land—fell to only $50 a month per tribal member, according to Richie.

“The bigger picture is to create an energy source that provides more permanency here in the reservation,” he said. “We’re trying to open up other opportunities, which is kind of hard when you’re in a mineral state.”

Navigating the Fallout

Although the Northern Arapaho were not pursuing a microgrid of their own, the tribe’s plans for solar were no less ambitious. The tribe wanted to install solar panels for about 140 homes, creating potentially significant energy and financial savings. Eventually, Goggles hoped to bring the technology to municipal and civil infrastructure on the reservation.

Now those plans are on hold.

“The Solar for All program would have had a huge economic impact on the energy cost savings for tribal members,” said Steve Babbits, an environmental scientist with the Northern Arapaho’s Natural Resource Office. “They would have had extra money in their pocket that they could have spent somewhere else. I guess that’s not going to happen now.”

“It’s a pretty big loss for everyone,” he added.

Using his home as an example, Patrick Goggles estimated that if he installed a solar system capable of offsetting 80 percent of his monthly electric demand, he would save $150 to $200 per month—this at a time when oil and gas royalties for the Northern Arapaho, a significant source of income for many tribal families, has dropped even lower than it has for the Eastern Shoshone, to about $10 a month per tribal member, he added.

In addition to hundreds of tribal members who now no longer have access to money-saving renewable energy, the EPA’s decision is financially impacting the men leading the project. Patrick Goggles had been working without pay, expecting to be reimbursed through the grant, he said. Now, a year’s worth of his time and labor will go uncompensated.

Dean Goggles and Babbits had planned to begin hiring more people to help administer the program, but now they can’t, and they noted that local contractors and builders had just lost an opportunity to bring in new business.

“From the first day [the Trump administration] declared an energy crisis, they should be supporting all types of energy production but they’re not,” Babbits said. “I think it’s going to hurt the country as a whole.”

Without Solar for All funding, the three men say they are turning their attention to building a planning document that the Northern Arapaho can use to help expedite any future solar power pursuits. But first, they will scour the private sector for any funding that could keep their current plans afloat.

“A lot of people were looking forward to this,” said Dean Goggles. “It’s a long shot, but we’re still going to look.”

Even if the EPA’s decision is challenged in court, without access to the money, the Northern Arapaho’s project is functionally stalled, the men said.

However, it contains an exemption for projects that begin construction over the next year. Under the law, those projects would remain eligible for the subsidies even if they don’t produce electricity under the specified time frame.

The Trump administration’s new guidance, however, sets further restrictions on which projects are considered having begun construction.

It says that construction of these projects must be “continuous.”

It also defines having begun construction as having done “physical work of a significant nature.” This includes activities like manufacturing equipment and excavating land to begin placing equipment in it. But it excludes activities like only having done surveys, test drilling or excavation for purposes of altering the landscape.

The guidance also says that even if the project meets those other requirements, it still must produce electricity by the end of the fourth calendar year after it begins construction.

The renewable energy industry criticized the guidance, saying it would slow the buildup of low-carbon energy sources.

“This is yet another act of energy subtraction from the Trump administration that will further delay the buildout of affordable, reliable power.

Thriving Nonprofits is a program made possible by a partnership between the IFF and the Indianapolis Office of Sustainability.

This is the first year for the program. In its inaugural year, there were 44 nonprofits that applied. In the end, ten nonprofits were selected to participate.

The chosen nonprofits receive an energy assessment from IFF. After the energy assessment, nonprofits receive a grant for up to $10,000 each to make the suggested upgrades.

""The goal is to allow us to provide funding to Indianapolis nonprofits to reduce their overall energy bill, so they can have more money to fulfill their missions,"" explained Stephanie Goodrid Lawson.

Goodrid Lawson is the Executive Director of the McKinney Family Foundation, which is funding the program.

South Bend and Bloomington have similar energy assessment programs. Goodrid Lawson said the new Indianapolis program was inspired by these programs, but there are some differences.

""South Bend and Bloomington have actually created a program that's funded by their city through additional taxes, so they didn't need philanthropic support,"" Goodrid Lawson explained. ""In Indianapolis, we wanted to be a philanthropic partner instead of just going and using Indianapolis taxpayers' money.""

One nonprofit that was selected for the program is Second Helpings in Indianapolis.

""We are involved in food rescue, hunger relief, and culinary job training,"" said Linda Broadfoot, the CEO of Second Helpings.

""Last year, we rescued 4.3 million pounds of food that we kept from the landfill and put to good use,"" Broadfoot continued.

Broadfoot explained how Second Helpings was selected for the program.

""We've gotten more vocal in how we talk about environmental sustainability in our work, and luckily I think some folks were paying attention,"" Broadfoot said. ""Someone reached out to us from the office and encouraged us to apply.""

Second Helpings tracks their environmental impact closely. You can read more about their current energy efficiency and environmental impact here.

WRTV visited Second Helpings on the day of their energy assessment. Broadfoot and her team were very excited to learn the findings.

""We're gonna really dig in from top to bottom and see where we can be more efficient,"" Broadfoot said with a smile.

Ian Loera and Donna Sink from IFF were on site to do the energy assessment.

Loera uses a forward-facing infrared camera to determine where heat was flowing from.

""If we look here, we can actually see the heat coming off the reach-in coolers,"" Loera demonstrated.

Parts of the building were hotter than others. Loera looked at the appliances and lights that he considered could be part of the problem.

""It's a little bit of detective work,"" Loera shared. ""I might use this to check, peer into the wall to see what the insulation's like, to see how much heat is coming in.""

""Keeping the building cool has been really hard for us,"" shared Broadfoot.

Volunteers in the hot kitchen, with lots of running ovens and other large appliances like fridges and freezers, were surrounded by fans to help keep them cool.

Broadfoot mentioned it is crucial to keep volunteers ""safe and happy"" during their shifts by keeping them cool.

Loera also looked closely at the ducts inside the building for ways to save energy.

On the roof of the building, he also inspected the heating and air conditioning units.

After an assessment, Loera puts together his findings. He will offer recommendations in his report of how energy can be saved. This will eventually be shared with each of the ten nonprofits in 2025's program.

From there, the nonprofits can get to work on the recommended changes, and receive the grant money to make the repairs, which should be completed by the end of 2025.

While the upfront work and costs of repairs might seem like a lot, ultimately, the energy saving swaps are designed to save nonprofits money.

""We are very serious about using our donor dollars as responsibly as possible,"" Broadfoot shared of Second Helpings. ""Aside from the obvious ecological benefits of doing these things, it helps us stretch our dollar, so we can deliver even more meals to the community.""

""The whole point of this is to save on energy bills. When you have large coolers, large kitchens, lots of different people that you need to feed on a daily basis, that's a large energy burden for these nonprofits,"" Goodrid Lawson shared. ""We want to reduce that energy burden by making sure they have the most energy efficient appliances and energy efficient technologies at their disposal.""

What does the future of the program look like? While Loera and Goodrid Lawson are optimistic about continuing the program in 2026, they may make some changes based on how this first year goes.

""This is our first attempt. It's our first cohort. We're very excited to go through it, and we're hoping that more individuals and foundations will join McKinney Family Foundation so we can expand this and do a lot more for Indianapolis,"" Goodrid Lawson shared.

Suncor and other large industrial polluters are required to submit plans explaining how they will reduce emissions under a state rule that requires Colorado’s 18 largest industrial manufacturers to reduce their overall greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% by 2030.
But Suncor needs to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 133,266 tons annually to comply with state regulations, its reduction plan states.
Those companies bought the credits because they are on track to miss the state’s first deadline to reduce emissions by 2030.
Colorado wants to eliminate 100% of its greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.","Suncor Energy is planning to spend more than $57 million to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions at its Commerce City oil refinery, but still expects to miss its 2030 deadline to eliminate enough pollution to meet Colorado’s benchmark for industrial polluters.

Not only will the company miss its 2030 greenhouse-gas emissions deadline, which is required by state law, but Suncor says its Commerce City refinery never will meet Colorado’s reduction demands unless the state creates a fund to help companies finance projects that would lower emissions, according to a new report the company filed with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

“Despite this major capital investment, onsite reductions will be insufficient to meet Suncor’s GHG emissions requirements,” the company’s report states.

Suncor’s investment in five projects at its Commerce City refinery and its determination that it cannot meet the state’s demands were revealed in a greenhouse-gas reduction plan posted on the state health department’s website this month.

Suncor and other large industrial polluters are required to submit plans explaining how they will reduce emissions under a state rule that requires Colorado’s 18 largest industrial manufacturers to reduce their overall greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% by 2030. Thus far, eight companies have filed their plans, and Suncor is one of three companies that said it will struggle to meet the state’s reduction requirements.

The other two are Natural Soda and American Gypsum, and both wrote in their reports that while they will upgrade some equipment, it will not be enough to meet the state’s pollution-reduction demands.

American Gypsum, a drywall manufacturer in Eagle County, said it will buy greenhouse-gas credits on Colorado’s exchange market and alter its production to make a drywall that is a different size and thickness to reach its benchmark. The credit exchange allows companies that fail to meet benchmarks to buy credits from others that successfully cut emissions and use those credits to account for their excessive pollution.

Natural Soda, which mines and makes baking soda in Rifle, said it would also rely on the greenhouse-gas credit exchange until other technology was more feasible and cost-effective.

The other companies that have filed greenhouse-gas reduction plans are Cargill Meat Solutions in Fort Morgan; Golden Aluminum, a sheet metal supplier in Fort Lupton; JBS Swift Foods, a meat processor in Greeley; Sterling Ethanol, an ethanol plant in Logan County; and its sister plant, Yuma Ethanol, based in Yuma County.

Those manufacturers said they will replace aging equipment and adopt new technology to reach their goals. For example, the two ethanol plants will use a carbon-capture system in which carbon dioxide is collected and then sent through a pipeline to be stored deep underground.

Cargill’s report said it would recycle biogas created from anaerobic wastewater treatment lagoons to power on-site boilers.

Of those eight companies, Suncor is the most high-profile because it is one of the largest polluters in Colorado and it is close to densely populated neighborhoods in Commerce City and north Denver. The refinery has been under pressure for years to clean up its facility and has been fined for repeated violations of its federal air permits, which regulate how much pollution it is allowed to emit each year.

Suncor denied The Denver Post’s request for an interview about its emissions-reduction plan and sent an emailed statement that repeated what the company wrote in its report.

In its greenhouse-gas reduction plan, Suncor says it will upgrade technology in five areas, including improving two flares — also known as smokestacks — that burn off gases created during the refining process. Suncor is seeking state approval for one flare project that would reroute gas to a more modern stack and decommission an older, 100-foot stack that has been in operation for 75 years, according to its plan.

The other measures the company is proposing include improvements to its fluidized catalytic-cracking units, which help turn crude oil into gasoline, and installing carbon monoxide analyzers to ensure equipment is running efficiently.

Those five projects will cut 31,129 tons of carbon dioxide annually, the report said. But Suncor needs to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 133,266 tons annually to comply with state regulations, its reduction plan states.

In Suncor’s emailed statement and in the written report, the company said it is a pioneer in energy-efficient refining. “As background, the Commerce City refinery has long been an energy-efficiency leader in the refining sector — both among those refineries supplying Colorado and among similarly sized refineries nationwide.”

However, that statement contradicts the findings of a 2023 Environmental Protection Agency report that said the Commerce City refinery records more malfunctions that release toxic chemicals into the air than other similarly sized plants in the United States.

Suncor included an analysis and a letter from HSB Solomon Associates, a consultant it hired to analyze and compare its Commerce City emissions to other refineries, and that letter stated Suncor is the “best of the best” in its carbon emissions when compared against other refineries in the Rocky Mountain region.

“As a result of Suncor’s high level of efficiency in its operations, there is very little low-hanging fruit to further reduce GHGs at the Commerce City refinery,” the report stated.

Because the company said it cannot spend more money to meet the state’s greenhouse-gas limits, Suncor plans to use Colorado’s new greenhouse-gas credit trading system, which was created when the Air Quality Control Commission wrote regulations in 2023 that required the state’s largest industrial polluters to reduce emissions.

That rule was created after the General Assembly passed a 2021 law aimed at improving the quality of life in neighborhoods most impacted by air pollution and reducing Colorado’s impact on climate change.

Colorado held its first greenhouse-gas credit auction this summer with five companies, including Suncor, spending $68,000 on credits. Those companies bought the credits because they are on track to miss the state’s first deadline to reduce emissions by 2030. However, state regulations prevent the disclosure of how many credits each company bought.

The Air Quality Control Commission has also asked the state’s Air Pollution Control Division to propose a state-managed fund that would help companies pay for emissions-reducing projects. That proposal is expected to be introduced to the commission in February when the state health department requests a hearing on it, and environmentalists are expected to oppose it, saying it creates a “pay-to-pollute” scheme that will allow Suncor and other heavy polluters to avoid making actual improvements to their facilities.

Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Those gases linger and circle the Earth, causing global warming and climate change that brings on more severe weather, such as rainstorms and intense summer heat. They also impact human health, causing respiratory and heart diseases, and some cancers.

The manufacturers that produce these gases typically are located in communities where the people are Black, Latino or Native American and earn less money than the state median income.

The coalition argues that by capping certain funding for these programs, DOE is jeopardizing states’ ability to keep them running.
The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate this unlawful cap and restore the legally required reimbursement rates for these essential energy programs.
“Oregonians count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean, and our bills manageable,” said Attorney General Rayfield.
In 2024, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal funding through the State Energy Program to support local clean energy work.","Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 18 other states, plus the District of Columbia, sued to block the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) from imposing a new funding cap that slashes support for vital state-run energy programs. The DOE policy would prevent states from using critical federal funds by limiting reimbursement for key administrative and staffing costs that have long been covered by these federal energy programs.

The lawsuit was filed today in the U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon.

The coalition argues that by capping certain funding for these programs, DOE is jeopardizing states’ ability to keep them running. The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate this unlawful cap and restore the legally required reimbursement rates for these essential energy programs.

“Oregonians count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean, and our bills manageable,” said Attorney General Rayfield. “This cap strips away the resources we need to keep that work going – and the people and expertise behind it. We can’t meet Oregon’s energy needs if the federal government pulls critical infrastructure that supports the people and expertise behind this work midstream.”

For decades, federal law has required agencies like DOE to negotiate agreements with states that set fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run programs. This includes the basic administrative or staffing costs needed to run federally funded programs. These “indirect” and “fringe” costs have never been subject to a cap. On May 8, 2025, DOE announced a new policy that ignores this longstanding practice, capping indirect and employee benefit costs at 10 percent of a project’s total budget, regardless of previously negotiated rates.

In 2024, Oregon received about $786,000 in federal funding through the State Energy Program to support local clean energy work. Nearly half of that went to essential operating costs — including staff benefits and the basic overhead needed to run programs — with the rest funding on-the-ground energy projects. If these federal dollars are cut, it will directly impact the state’s ability to keep staff, maintain programs, and deliver energy savings for Oregonians.

Attorney General Rayfield and the coalition argue that the new policy violates federal regulations that require agencies to honor negotiated indirect cost rates between states and the federal government. They assert the policy mirrors similar caps that federal courts have recently struck down, and additional federal regulations regarding fringe. The attorneys general emphasize that every court to have ruled on the merits of such blanket limits has found them unlawful, unjustified, and disruptive to essential public programs.

The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate DOE’s new policy and bar implementation of any unlawful reimbursement caps.

Joining Attorney General Rayfield in filing this lawsuit are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

In 2025, choosing a fuel-efficient car isn't just about saving money - it's a matter of lifestyle, values, and identity.

With rising gas prices and growing environmental concerns, drivers are turning to cars that deliver maximum miles per gallon and minimal emissions. The General takes a look at some of the most fuel-efficient vehicles of the year, the ones blending performance, innovation, and sustainability.

Why fuel efficiency matters more than ever

The average U.S. gas price as of July 28 was $3.12 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For daily commuters and families, this translates to hundreds in annual fuel savings or extra costs. Fuel-efficient vehicles not only reduce those expenses but also slash greenhouse gas emissions, helping drivers do their part in the fight against climate change.

A diverse landscape of efficient options

The 2025 lineup reflects the most diverse selection of eco-friendly vehicles in history. From hybrid sedans and compact SUVs to electric vehicles and even fuel-efficient pickup trucks, there's something for every driver.

Campbell coal plant in West Olive.

The J.H. Campbell Complex, one of Michigan's largest remaining coal-burning power plants, was initially scheduled to close in May 2025. However, an emergency order from the Trump administration extended its operation for 90 days, pushing the shutdown date to August 21.

Water activist Eldin Causevic of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters helped organize the rally to advocate for the plant's closure.

""We want the coal plant shut down because we believe that it harms Michigan's air, water, land, just overall environment,"" said Causevic.

Protesters in Holland demand immediate shutdown of J.H. Campbell Coal Complex

Demonstrators also highlighted the financial implications of keeping the plant open.

""They're talking about wasting $40 or $50 million already keeping it open,"" said retired family physician, Steven Ashmead.

Around 100 citizens marched from the Window on the Waterfront on 6th St. to Huizenga's office in downtown Holland at 170 College Ave. Suite 160.

""If he comes out, or if he doesn't come out, we'll be marching to the park right next to his office, we're going to have some of our youth speakers come to demonstrate how the youth feel about this issue and just about climate advocacy in general,"" Causevic explained.

Though Huizenga did not respond to the protesters at his door, speakers, including Ashmead, emphasized the environmental risks associated with coal.

""It sits here next to Lake Michigan. It spews out 8 billion tons of carbon, plus of carbon dioxide, plus nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide. The ash that comes from burning the coal contains heavy metals that can cause disease and cancer, and so it's a huge polluter,"" he said. ""Coal represents the worst option to produce energy.""

Nineteen-year-old activist Ruby Muehlens also spoke out, saying, ""This is going to cause rises in Michigan, it's going to cause rises in energy prices around the U.S.""

She emphasized the importance of raising awareness and engaging with elected officials.

""The only ways we can raise awareness, we can talk to people and then we can, you know, make sure he listens to us with a vote,"" Muehlens added.

""My hope is that rational, moderate people will look at these issues and make appropriate decisions instead of following the lead of the current administration,"" said Ashmead.

In response to the protest, Huizenga's office referred to this social media post from May 23, where he stated in part: ""We need to use addition, not subtraction, to assert American energy dominance — now is not the time to close power-generating facilities.""

The path seemed straightforward: phase down subsidies for mature technologies, remove fossil impediments, and build an energy dominance agenda across all sectors.

That’s what I hoped he would do.

Instead, the president went on the offensive against renewable energy, stripping wind and solar from the definition of energy resources in his executive order declaring a national energy emergency. Renewable projects lost tax support and gained new regulatory hurdles, while coal, oil, and gas projects received new subsidies, accelerated approvals, and relaxed environmental rules.

The policy shift extends to projects already approved. Last month, the Department of Energy canceled a loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, an interregional transmission line delivering cheaper, more reliable power to utilities and co-ops across 29 states — simply because it can carry renewable power to market. That’s like canceling an interstate highway because it might be used to ship vegetables you don’t like.

Utilities are doing their level best to keep up with the cascade of change affecting U.S. energy planning. They manage an aging grid with a mix of resources — old and new, intermittent and firm — that must be balanced every second of every day. Load growth is surging for the first time in a generation. Regulations proliferate, as do lawsuits. Wildfire mitigation demands more of their budgets in a hotter, drier world.

Old thermal plants are being retired faster than new resources can replace them. Trump ordered two 60-year-old plants to stay online, but that’s not a coherent long-term strategy or an affordable one for ratepayers. Yet in these volatile political times, which new resources should a utility select? How does any business future-proof against Calvinball?

Maintaining and modernizing our energy systems is a complex endeavor. It would help if America could get on the same page. Most people I know want safe, reliable, affordable energy that gets cleaner over time. That should be our national goal.

I’ve spent eight years helping to raise political will for consensus climate policies — not an easy task in a polarized world. We’re making progress, finding agreement on ways to reduce emissions from the fossil fuels we still need and innovate new zero-emission energy sources.

Geothermal, nuclear, carbon capture, and battery storage have strong bipartisan support. Tax incentives for those technologies earned yes votes from almost every congressional Democrat in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, and almost every Republican in this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

As for solar and wind, they deliver exceptional value when integrated into a balanced grid and will continue to be built in the U.S. despite headwinds from the Trump administration. Combined with battery storage and on-demand generation, renewables are a low-cost workhorse, contributing to a strong, flexible grid that can keep pace with a changing world.

Here’s my all-of-the-above recipe for energy abundance: Build a big energy toolbox, let utilities choose the best tools for the job, and keep them focused on our common goal — safe, reliable, affordable, increasingly clean power. And the rest of us should stop playing our own versions of Calvinball, tilting the game and waging war over every decision.

Politics shouldn’t be the riskiest part of America’s energy system. It’s time we started a serious dialog with each other, including our elected representatives, about how we’re going to keep our lights on and our climate safe.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32d0574-1b24-11ec-a31e-77e4d5ecaec6.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-08-16 12:08:32.179971

The complete removal of the Solar for All program could potentially cut off solar power access to families across the country.
The U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public noted that litigation against the administration's decision to halt funding to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund ""remains ongoing.""","Despite a strong desire to ""unleash American energy,"" the Trump administration has quickly paved the way for the elimination of solar tax credits. As a result, more Americans will likely be paying more on their energy bills.

What's happening?

In an August 7 post on X, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the EPA would be ending the Solar for All program, which aimed to expand access to solar energy for low-income and disadvantaged communities.

The Solar for All program is a $7 billion initiative funded by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.

According to Zeldin, the move to dismantle the program was made possible by the signing of H.R.1, also known as One Big Beautiful Bill, into law. The legislation eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, cutting off all funding for the renewable energy program.

""The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" Zeldin wrote in the social media post. ""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!""

Why is the removal of the Solar for All program concerning?

While the elimination of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund may appear to be saving American taxpayers $7 billion, experts are now warning that the move will ultimately make energy bills more expensive for close to a million low-income families.

Zealan Hoover, a senior advisor with the EPA during the Biden administration, noted that pulling the plug on the Solar for All program will hurt those in need of help the most.

""Communities promised relief from punishing energy costs are now left in the dark,"" Hoover told Canary Media. ""Nearly a million families will pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their electricity bill because the Trump administration killed a program that would have more than paid for itself.""

By generating own electricity with solar power, homeowners are able to reduce the amount of power needed from the grid, directly lowering monthly electricity costs. In some cases, homeowners can generate so much power that they may even create a surplus of energy that earns them credits from their utility company.

However, the upfront cost of solar panel installation may be too high for some homeowners to fit into their budget, especially low-income families. The complete removal of the Solar for All program could potentially cut off solar power access to families across the country.

What's being done about solar power access for American families?

Although Administrator Zeldin stands by the Trump administration's right to rescind funds distributed by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, many are arguing that money already obligated to specific programs should be legally protected.

In a press release, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse was adamant that the claim lacked real merit.

""The Trump Administration has waged a defamatory assault on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, unlawfully weaponizing the federal government to deprive families of financing to help lower their energy bills, make their communities more resilient, and generate good-paying local jobs,"" Whitehouse said in a statement.

The U.S. Senate Committee on Environment & Public noted that litigation against the administration's decision to halt funding to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund ""remains ongoing.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-recv4JfAWBssugjAf.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 16:03:07.402056

PANNA Files Writ Of Mandamus Against EPA For Failing To Respond To Petition To Cancel Organophosphate Pesticides: On June 30, 2025, the Pesticide Action and Agroecology Network North America (PANNA) and several other non-governmental organizations (together, Petitioner) filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus (Mandamus Petition) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to seek an order directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to act on a 2021 Petition to revoke all food tolerances and cancel registrations for organophosphate (OP) pesticides (OP Petition). The Mandamus Petition was filed pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. Section 1651. Background regarding the OP Petition is available in our December 8, 2021, blog post. Petitioner states that EPA has continued to delay issuing registration review decisions on OPs and seeks the court to order EPA, within certain deadlines, to issue a final decision on the OP Petition for each of the 12 OPs. It asks the court to “direct EPA either to deny the OP Petition upon finding the OP uses safe, or grant the Petition and take the required regulatory action within one year.” Additionally, the Mandamus Petition seeks the court to retain jurisdiction and require quarterly status reports from EPA until it makes final decisions subject to judicial review for each of the OPs. More information is available in our July 15, 2025, blog item.

EPA Issues Final SNURs For Certain Chemical Substances: EPA published final significant new use rules (SNUR) on July 17 and July 29, 2025, for certain chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMN) and are also subject to an Order issued by EPA pursuant to TSCA. 90 Fed. Reg. 33283, 90 Fed. Reg. 35624. The SNURs require persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process any of these chemical substances for an activity that is designated as a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. Persons may not commence manufacture or processing for the significant new use until they have submitted a Significant New Use Notice (SNUN), and EPA has conducted a review of the SNUN, made an appropriate determination, and has taken such actions as are required by that determination. The July 17, 2025, SNURs will be effective September 15, 2025. The July 29, 2025, SNURs will be effective September 29, 2025.

Trump EPA Seeks Reversal Of Ruling That Typical Levels Of Drinking Water Fluoridation Present An Unreasonable Risk To Health: As reported in our February 13, 2025, blog item, on January 17, 2025, the Biden EPA filed a notice of appeal of the September 2024 lower court decision finding that the plaintiffs established by a preponderance of the evidence that the levels of fluoride typical in drinking water in the United States pose an unreasonable risk of injury to the health of the public. Food & Water Watch v. EPA (No. 25-384). At that time, it was unknown how the Trump EPA would proceed. On July 18, 2025, EPA filed its opening brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the lower court’s decision should be reversed. EPA’s arguments include:

Plaintiffs’ only relevant standing declarant has water that naturally contains fluoride, and Plaintiffs do not ask that the water utility remove naturally occurring fluoride. Thus, according to EPA, Plaintiffs’ injury is not caused by the addition of fluoride to drinking water, and no available remedy will redress it.

EPA states that the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California violated TSCA Section 21 by “permitting Plaintiffs to rely on evidence not first presented to EPA in the petition and reviewed by EPA in denying the petition.”

EPA claims that the court “abused its discretion by commandeering the trial and administrative proceedings in violation of the party-presentation principle.”

EPA plans to publish a revised version of the data set later in 2025 that will include late submissions and revisions submitted by facilities. The preliminary data are accessible on EPA’s Envirofacts website. They are also available for download from the TRI website.

EPA Releases Draft TSCA Risk Evaluations For Phthalates BBP And DIBP For Public Comment: EPA announced on August 6, 2025, the availability of the draft TSCA risk evaluations for the phthalates butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) for public comment. 90 Fed. Reg. 37855. According to EPA, the purpose of TSCA risk evaluations is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, and without consideration of costs or non-risk factors. EPA states that it used the best available science to prepare the draft risk evaluations and to determine preliminarily, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that BBP and DIBP pose unreasonable risk to health and the environment driven primarily by certain conditions of use analyzed in the draft risk evaluations. Comments are due October 6, 2025. More information is available in our August 15, 2025, blog item.

EPA Seeks Stakeholders To Participate As Small Entity Representatives On Small Business Advocacy Review Panels On Asbestos And Formaldehyde: EPA announced on August 8, 2025, that it seeks self-nominations from small businesses, governments, and not-for-profits to participate as Small Entity Representatives (SER) providing advice and recommendations for two separate Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) Panels. One SBAR Panel will focus on EPA’s development of a proposed rule to address unreasonable risk identified in the TSCA risk evaluation for asbestos part 2. A separate SBAR Panel will focus on EPA’s development of a proposed rule to address unreasonable risk identified in the TSCA risk evaluation for formaldehyde. EPA states that other representatives, such as trade associations that exclusively or at least primarily represent potentially regulated small entities, may also serve as SERs. Nominations for the formaldehyde SBAR panel are due August 22, 2025. Nominations for the asbestos part 2 SBAR panel are due September 7, 2025.

EPA Accelerates Review Of LVEs: EPA announced on August 11, 2025, the results of process improvements to accelerate the review of Low Volume Exemptions (LVE) in the TSCA New Chemicals Program. At the end of March 2025, EPA identified 79 LVEs waiting for review and established a dedicated team of risk assessors. EPA states that it completed the risk assessments and made preliminary decisions for all 79 cases during April and May 2025. According to EPA, 80 percent of these LVEs have received final decisions from EPA and the remaining 20 percent are awaiting information from the submitter before a final decision can be made. EPA also completed risk assessments for an additional 27 LVEs, for a total of 106 LVE risk assessments completed over two months.

The process improvements, including grouping similar cases, designating discipline-specific expediters, and using just-in-time communication, helped to gain speed and efficiencies. EPA states that it “recorded detailed data on assessor timeliness and identified periods of down time that can be shortened or eliminated, resulting in more opportunities for additional efficiency gains in the future.” EPA intends to continue making improvements to decrease the review time for LVEs with the target of assigning an assessor and completing the review within 30 days.

EPA Releases Update To TSCA Inventory: EPA announced on August 14, 2025, that it has released the latest TSCA Inventory. The TSCA Inventory is a list of all existing chemical substances manufactured, processed, or imported in the United States under TSCA that do not otherwise qualify for an exemption or exclusion. EPA notes that this biannual update to the TSCA Inventory includes EPA’s regular posting of non-confidential TSCA Inventory data. EPA plans the next regular update of the TSCA Inventory for winter 2026. EPA states that it is also updating the TSCA Master Inventory File, “which includes the full, specific chemical identities claimed as confidential.” According to EPA, the TSCA Master Inventory File now contains 86,862 chemicals of which 42,578 are active in U.S. commerce. Other updates to the TSCA Inventory include updates to commercial activity data, unique identifier data, and regulatory flags (e.g., SNURs and test orders). EPA continues to perform ongoing confidential business information (CBI) reviews resulting in a number of chemicals that no longer have confidential claims to the chemical name and have been moved to the non-confidential portion of the Inventory.

Trump Grants Regulatory Relief From Biden EPA Emission Standards: On July 17, 2025, President Trump signed four proclamations that grant two years of regulatory relief from Biden-era regulations that impacted various sectors vital to national security. According to the White House’s July 17, 2025, fact sheet, the proclamations cover coal plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities, and certain chemical manufacturers that produce chemicals related to semiconductors, medical device sterilization, advanced manufacturing, and national defense systems. The proclamations allow certain of these facilities to comply with standards that were in place before the Biden Administration rulemakings for two years. The fact sheet states that the exemptions “ensure that these facilities within these critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs to comply with, in some cases, unattainable compliance requirements.”

EPA And CSB Announce “First-Ever” Settlement To Resolve Violations Of The Accidental Release Reporting Rule: EPA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) announced on July 28, 2025, a settlement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) to resolve a violation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the 2020 Accidental Release Reporting rule. EPA notes that “[t]his is the first time EPA has taken an enforcement action and reached a settlement with a company for violations of the 2020 rule.” According to EPA, on June 8, 2023, an accidental release of natural gas from a PG&E pipeline in San Jose, California, caused a serious injury to a PG&E employee. PG&E failed to report the incident to the CSB. EPA states that under the settlement, PG&E will pay a civil penalty of $45,273 for failing to report the incident. PG&E has submitted a report to the CSB containing the required information about the incident.

GAO notes that “[b]ecause this issue is the subject of ongoing litigation, GAO’s work focused on whether EPA sought and published public comment on various elements of the analysis of costs, as required by [the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)].” GAO found that EPA did publish and seek public comment as required.

EPA Proposes Reconsideration Of 2009 Endangerment Finding And GHG Vehicle Standards: EPA published a proposed rule on August 1, 2025, that would repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines to effectuate the best reading of CAA Section 202(a). 90 Fed. Reg. 36288. EPA proposes that CAA Section 202(a) “does not authorize the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns and, on that basis, propose to rescind the Administrator’s prior findings in 2009 that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare.” EPA further proposes, in the alternative, to rescind the Administrator’s prior findings in 2009 because EPA “unreasonably analyzed the scientific record and because developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings.” Lastly, EPA proposes to repeal all GHG emission standards on the alternative bases that no requisite technology for vehicle and engine emission control can address the global climate change concerns identified in the findings without risking greater harms to public health and welfare. On August 15, 2025, EPA extended the comment period. 90 Fed. Reg. 39345. Comments are due September 22, 2025. EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on August 19-20, 2025, on the proposed rule. 90 Fed. Reg. 36125.

FDA Requests Information For “Ultra-Processed Foods”: On July 25, 2025, FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) requested “data and information to help develop a uniform definition of ultra-processed foods (UPF or UPFs) for human food products in the U.S. food supply.” 90 Fed. Reg. 35305. FDA notes that there “is a clear need for a uniform definition of UPFs to allow for consistency in research and policy. With this Request for Information, we seek data and information that would enable us, as part of a joint federal agency effort, to define UPFs.” Comments must be submitted by September 23, 2025.

FDA Releases Tool For Toxicity Screening For Chemicals In Food: On July 30, 2025, FDA released its Expanded Decision Tree (EDT), a chemical toxicity and risk screening tool that FDA identifies as a New Approach Method that may “leverage large data sets to achieve faster and less expensive informative new approaches to chemical assessments that can inform risk management decisions and actions.” Additional details for the tool are available at online.

Former FDA Chief Files Citizen’s Petition On Processed Food: On August 6, 2025, Dr. David A. Kessler, a former head of FDA, filed a citizen’s petition arguing that certain ingredients in ultra-processed food should not be considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS), stating that “science no longer supports that determination.” Dr. Kessler asserts in the petition that “[p]ast GRAS determinations are based on outdated data and fail to assess the long-term eﬀects on insulin dynamics, blood lipid parameters, energy partitioning, inﬂammatory markers, brain reward signaling, or visceral adiposity. These past determinations do not reﬂect chronic exposure, synergistic eﬀects with other additives, or lifetime health consequences. Today there is no expert consensus that reﬁned carbohydrates in ultraprocessed foods are safe under present conditions of use, as is required to ﬁnd that use of reﬁned carbohydrates is GRAS.” Dr. Kessler’s petition requests that FDA: (1) declare that it no longer considers certain processed carbohydrates as GRAS; (2) revoke existing GRAS regulations for these processed carbohydrates; (3) inform industry that continued use requires notifying FDA; and (4) remove certain products from commerce unless their use in food is authorized by a food additive petition.

LEGISLATIVE

Safer Beauty Bill Package Would Update Federal Cosmetics Laws: In July 2025, Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade reintroduced the Safer Beauty Bill Package with Representatives Lizzie Fletcher (D-TX), Doris Matsui (D-CA), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). According to Schakowsky’s July 17, 2025, press release, the bill package includes four separate bills that “offer progressive updates to an increasingly outdated set of federal cosmetics laws.” The press release states that the package “builds upon the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act (MoCRA), which passed under President Joe Biden and expanded FDA oversight to include the regulation of the cosmetics industry, including mandatory recall authority, adverse event reporting, and requiring facility registration, and more.” The bills include:

The Toxic-Free Beauty Act (H.R. 4433): Bans 18 chemicals and two classes of chemicals (phthalates and formaldehyde-releasing preservatives) that have been banned by the European Union and a number of states, including California, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont;

Cosmetic Supply Chain Transparency Act (H.R. 4434): Requires suppliers of raw materials, ingredients, and private label products to provide full ingredient disclosure and safety data to cosmetic companies;

Cosmetic Hazardous Ingredient Right to Know Act (H.R. 4435): Requires product label and website disclosure of “secret, unlabeled, and often toxic chemicals in our personal care products”; and

Cosmetic Safety Protections for Communities of Color and Salon Workers (H.R. 4436): Funds research, resource materials, education and outreach, and the development of safer chemicals to protect the health of women of color and salon workers. The bill also requires FDA to regulate the safety of synthetic braids, “which can contain toxic chemicals.”

Legislation Introduced To Amend FIFRA To Establish A Private Right Of Action For Injuries Caused By Pesticides: On July 17, 2025, Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced legislation that would establish a private right of action for injuries caused by pesticides (S.2324). The introduction of S.2324, the Pesticide Injury Accountability Act of 2025, if enacted, is intended to allow cases against pesticide manufacturers for alleged harm caused by their pesticide products. In his press release, Booker states: “Rather than providing a liability shield so that foreign corporations are allowed to poison the American people, Congress should instead pass the Pesticide Injury Accountability Act to ensure that these chemical companies can be held accountable in federal court for the harm caused by their toxic products.” Specifically, the legislation would amend FIFRA by adding the following language:

“Sec. 34. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR INJURIES CAUSED BY PESTICIDES.

(a) IN GENERAL.— Any person the property or person of which is injured by a pesticide may bring a civil action in Federal district court against a registrant of the pesticide for monetary damages for injury to the property or person caused by the pesticide.

(b) RECOVERABLE DAMAGES.— Monetary damages that may be recovered in a civil action under subsection (a) — (1) include compensatory and punitive damages, at the discretion of the court; and (2) do not include attorney’s fees or court costs.

(c) EFFECT.— Nothing in this section shall preempt any State law claim.”

More information regarding the Senate legislation is available here. B&C’s insightful commentary on the legislation is available in our July 23, 2025, blog item.

House Appropriations Committee Approves FY 2026 Interior, Environment, And Related Agencies Appropriations Bill That Would Prohibit Funding For The IRIS Program: On July 22, 2025, the House Appropriations Committee approved fiscal year (FY) 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill (H.R. 4754) by a vote of 33 to 28. According to the Committee’s July 22, 2025, press release, the bill would reduce EPA funding by 23 percent. The bill would prohibit funding to “develop, finalize, issue, or use assessments” under EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program.

Bipartisan Permitting Reform Legislation Introduced In The House: On July 25, 2025, Representatives Bruce Westerman (R-AR), Chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, and Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R. 4776). According to the Committee’s July 25, 2025, press release, the SPEED Act will modernize the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) “to help streamline the permitting process and return the law to its intended purpose.” The press release states that the bill will shorten permitting timelines and reduce the frequency of “frivolous litigation.” This legislation will simplify the analysis required in NEPA documents, thereby easing the burden on agencies. The bill will also clarify when NEPA is triggered by clarifying the definition of “Major Federal Action.” Lastly, the bill will establish judicial review limitations for NEPA claims, including a 150-day deadline for filing claims, a new standard of review, and the elimination of procedural moves that stop projects from moving forward.

Bipartisan Legislation Would Reduce PFAS Contamination At Military Sites And In Surrounding Communities: On July 28, 2025, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) PFAS Discharge Prevention Act (S. 2472). According to Gillibrand’s July 28, 2025, press release, the bill would facilitate the implementation of best management practices (BMP) at DOD facilities to mitigate PFAS pollution at the source, before it contaminates drinking water. The bill would use a small portion of existing PFAS remediation funding to:

Require DOD to monitor regularly for PFAS at DOD installations; and

Facilitate the implementation of base-specific BMPs to limit PFAS-laden stormwater runoff at DOD facilities.

Research For Healthy Soils Act Reintroduced In The Senate: Senator Jeff Merkley announced on July 29, 2025, that he reintroduced the Research for Healthy Soils Act (S. 2500). According to Merkley’s press release, the legislation “would unlock federal funding at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service to conduct research on microplastics in biosolids and help us better understand their potential impacts on soil health, crops, public health, and the environment.”

A Snapshot Of Extended Producer Responsibility In 2025: 2025 has been a busy year for extended producer responsibility (EPR) policy, especially for packaging and paper products. States have enacted new EPR programs and laws to assess the need for EPR. Existing programs have been altered or updated. Compliance deadlines have come and gone. EPR legislation has been introduced in many states. With so many moving parts, the status of EPR in the United States can be hard to follow. More information on the overview of changes and developments in the EPR landscape in 2025 is available in our July 16, 2025, memorandum.

DOD Publishes 2025 Update On Critical PFAS Uses, Recommends Risk-Based Approach To Defining PFAS: DOD published a July 2025 report entitled Update on Critical Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Uses. The report presents DOD’s plan to research alternatives to mission critical PFAS uses and evaluate and review key technical standards for PFAS critical materials “to ensure that the standards are effective, accurately represent the required performance, and ensure that viable PFAS-free alternatives are not artificially excluded.” The report states that the collective international, federal, and state regulatory actions to manage the environmental impacts of PFAS and identify and eliminate PFAS from the market, and the resulting market responses, pose increasing risks to DOD operations due to possible product obsolescence and reformulations. These issues are exacerbated by the variability in how the regulatory authorities define PFAS. According to the report, PFAS are critical to the national security of the United States, and there is a need “to ensure that the dwindling number of domestic PFAS manufacturers remain able to and capable of providing PFAS critical to national security, including those producing the feedstock minerals (fluorspar and possibly others) and chemicals and all the intermediate chemicals leading to the manufacture of fluoropolymers, fluorinated gases, and other critical fluorochemicals broadly defined as PFAS.” More information is available in our July 24, 2025, blog item.

Minnesota Extends January 1, 2026, PFAS Reporting Deadline To July 1, 2026: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) announced on July 23, 2025, that it will extend the January 1, 2026, deadline for reporting products containing intentionally added PFAS to July 1, 2026. In its announcement, MPCA also notes updates to the 2025 PFAS in product prohibitions. Consistent with MPCA’s recommendations, the Minnesota legislature amended the statute so that intentionally added PFAS found in internal components and electronic components of products are now exempt from Minnesota’s 2025 PFAS prohibitions. Intentionally added PFAS in these components will be prohibited beginning January 1, 2032, unless the use of PFAS is determined to be a currently unavoidable use (CUU). The legislature also amended the statute to clarify the definition of “juvenile products” to exclude all-terrain vehicles (ATV), motorcycles, snowmobiles, e-bikes, and replacement parts for these products designed for children.

Safer States Publishes Takeaways From 2025 Legislative Session On Toxic Chemicals And Plastics, Including PFAS And Microplastics: On July 23, 2025, Safer States published its takeaways from the 2025 legislative session on toxic chemicals and plastics. According to Safer States, in 2025, ten states have adopted at least 22 policies intended to reduce exposure to toxic chemicals and advance safer solutions. Safer States notes the following trends from the 2025 legislative sessions:

States are leading the charge to prevent exposure to PFAS, toxic plastics, and other harmful chemicals;

States are addressing pollution and cleaning up toxic contamination;

States are successfully defending hard-won protections; and

States are protecting drinking water as federal action falters.

Safer States anticipates that this momentum will continue in the states that still have active legislative sessions. Safer State’s bill tracker allows stakeholders “to keep up to date on adopted and moving state legislative policies that help move the needle forward toward achieving a healthier world.” More information is available in our July 31, 2025, blog item.

Comments On Maine’s Proposed CUU Amendment Due September 2, 2025: The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) began a public consultation on July 30, 2025, on a proposed amendment to Chapter 90: Products Containing PFAS. The proposed amendment would add two designations for CUUs of intentionally added PFAS in cleaning products subject to sales prohibition beginning January 1, 2026. Each determination will remain in effect until the date listed below:

The use of PFAS in a cleaning product container internal cartridge valve within the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) classification 3926.90.4510, that are used in the industrial sector with the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 561210 and 561720, is a CUU until January 1, 2031; and

The use of PFAS in a cleaning product container vented cap liner within the HTS classification 3921.19.0000, 7607.20.5000, and 3923.50.0000, that are used in the industrial sector with the NAICS code 322299, is a CUU until January 1, 2031.

MDEP will hold a public hearing on August 21, 2025. Comments are due September 2, 2025. More information on the CUU proposals is available in our July 14, 2025, memorandum.

EPA Publishes Guidance On Referrals For Potential Criminal Enforcement: EPA published a notice on July 31, 2025, describing its plans to address regulatory offenses that give rise to criminal liability under Executive Order 14294 on “Fighting Overcriminalization in Federal Regulations.” 90 Fed. Reg. 36044. EPA advises the public that by May 9, 2026, the Agency, in consultation with the Attorney General, will provide to the OMB Director a report containing: list of all criminal regulatory offenses enforceable by Agency or the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ); and for each such criminal regulatory offense, the range of potential criminal penalties for a violation and the applicable mens rea standard for the criminal regulatory offense. The notice also announces a general policy, subject to appropriate exceptions and to the extent consistent with law, that when the Agency is deciding whether to refer alleged violations of criminal regulatory offenses to DOJ, officers and employees of EPA should consider, among other factors:

The harm or risk of harm, pecuniary or otherwise, caused by the alleged offense;

The potential gain to the putative defendant that could result from the offense;

Whether the putative defendant held specialized knowledge, expertise, or was licensed in an industry related to the rule or regulation at issue; and

Evidence, if any is available, of the putative defendant’s general awareness of the unlawfulness of his conduct as well as his knowledge or lack thereof of the regulation at issue.

EPA notes that it “has historically considered each of these factors as a matter of formal policy and in practice, not only in referring alleged violations of criminal regulatory offenses to DOJ, but also in deciding whether to open a formal investigation in the first place.”

IRS Modifies List Of Taxable Chemical Substances To Include 21 Chemicals: On August 4, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published a notice of determinations that modifies the list of taxable substances to include the following 21 substances: polyphenylene sulfide, cellulose acetate (degree of substitution = 1.5-2.0), 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlorohydrin copolymer, nylon 6, caprolactam, methyl ethyl ketoxime, iso-butanol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol phenyl ether, methoxytriglycol, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, propylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol n-propyl ether, propylene glycol phenyl ether, di-isobutyl carbinol, di-isobutyl ketone, methyl isobutyl carbinol, cyanuric acid, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, and sodium chlorite. 90 Fed. Reg. 36520. For each of the substances, an importer, an exporter, or an interested person petitioned the IRS for a determination under Section 4672(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to add the substance to the list. According to the IRS, for each substance, the petition represented that the taxable chemicals constitute more than 20 percent of the weight of materials used to produce the substance, based on the predominant method of production. After reviewing each petition, the Secretary determined that taxable chemicals constitute more than 20 percent by weight of the materials used to produce the substance, based on the predominant method of production. Therefore, each of the substances is added to the list as required under Section 4672(a)(2) and (4). The effective date for purposes of the tax under Section 4671 of the Code for the taxable substances added to the list is January 1, 2026. For the effective date for purposes of refund claims under Section 4662(e) of the Code for the taxable substances added to the list, the IRS states that stakeholders should see the determination for each substance. The notice “also modifies the list included in Notice 2021-66 by correcting a typographical error in the spelling of the name of the taxable substance sodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate and prescribing a tax rate for sodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate.” The tax rate for sodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate is effective July 1, 2022.

Federal Court Grants Minnesota’s Motion To Dismiss Challenge To Its PFAS Ban In Cookware: On August 11, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota granted MPCA’s motion to dismiss the Cookware Sustainability Alliance’s (CSA) suit for failure to state a claim. CSA v. Kessler (No. 0:25-cv-00041). As reported in our January 14, 2025, blog item, CSA filed suit in January 2025, claiming that Minnesota’s January 1, 2025, ban on the sale of cookware containing intentionally added PFAS violates the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause, the First Amendment, and the Supremacy Clause. After MPCA moved to dismiss the complaint, CSA voluntarily dismissed its causes of action under the First Amendment and the Supremacy Clause. The court granted MPCA’s motion to dismiss, dismissing CSA’s dormant Commerce Clause claims in the Complaint with prejudice and the voluntarily dismissed claims without prejudice. More information will be available in a forthcoming blog item.

EPA Relaunches Comprehensive Guidance Document Website: On August 13, 2025, EPA announced the relaunch of EPA’s Guidance Portal, “a streamlined website for accessing important guidance documents related to air quality, water protection, hazardous waste management, and more.” According to EPA, the website serves as a resource for all guidance documents managed across EPA’s headquarters environmental programs. EPA designed the website to be a “one-stop shop to help users and small businesses easily and quickly locate and follow EPA’s active guidance documents on topics of interest.” EPA notes that guidance documents are “agency statements of general applicability, intended to have future effects on the behavior of regulated parties, that set forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue, or an interpretation of a statute or regulation, with some exceptions.” According to EPA, the portal does not contain documents excluded from this definition, “such as internal guidance directed to EPA or other federal agencies that is not intended to have future effect on the behavior of regulated parties, rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice, and internal executive branch legal advice or legal opinions addressed to executive branch officials, among others.” EPA’s guidance documents generally lack the force and effect of law.

Petitions Filed To Add Chemicals To List Of Chemical Substances Subject To Superfund Excise Tax: On August 15, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that petitions have been filed to add the following chemicals to the list of taxable substances:

Chloro-isobutene-isoprene rubber ((C4H8)n-(C5H7.31Cl0.69)m; n=97.75, m=2.25) (90 Fed. Reg. 39468): Petition filed by Arlanxeo USA LLC and Arlanxeo Canada Inc., importers and exporters of chloro-isobutene-isoprene rubber((C4H8)n-(C5H7.31Cl0.69)m; n=97.75, m=2.25); and

Ethylene-propylene-dicyclopentadiene rubber ((C2H4)m-(C3H6)n-(C10H12)o; m=73.18, n=26.53, o=0.29) (90 Fed. Reg. 39469): Petition filed by Arlanxeo USA LLC and Arlanxeo Canada Inc., importers and exporters of ethylene-propylene-dicyclopentadiene rubber ((C4H8)n-(C5H7.31Cl0.69)m; n=97.75, m=2.25).

Comments on the petitions are due October 14, 2025.

NYS DEC Will Hold Pre-Rulemaking Stakeholder Meeting On PFAS In Apparel Law: On August 25, 2025, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYS DEC) will hold a pre-rulemaking stakeholder meeting on its implementation of the prohibitions on PFAS in apparel. NYS DEC will present an overview of the enacted law, codified at Section 37-0121 of the Environmental Conservation Law, and discuss the conceptual framework for regulating PFAS in apparel that it is considering for the rulemaking. NYS DEC notes that this will be a pre-rulemaking meeting and that it anticipates using feedback from the meeting to inform a proposed rule with additional public comment opportunities.

The new guidance requires projects larger than 1.5 MW to use the Physical Work Test to safe harbor the ITC — the method proving significant physical labor has begun on a site.
It also did not change the amount of time developers have to place a safe-harbored project in service, whether it’s using the Physical Work Test or Five Percent Safe Harbor.

Safe harboring allows companies to demonstrate a good-faith effort at starting a solar project to secure the applicable tax credits in place that year.

The new guidance requires projects larger than 1.5 MW to use the Physical Work Test to safe harbor the ITC — the method proving significant physical labor has begun on a site. Large projects can no longer use the Five Percent Safe Harbor — the method proving significant costs have been incurred for the project. The guidance also narrows the Physical Work Test to “the installation of racks or other structures to affix photovoltaic (PV) panels, collectors or solar cells to a site.” It does not include “preliminary activities” like grading the land, conducting studies or clearing a site. The guidance also requires projects using the Physical Work Test to “maintain a continuous program of construction,” where the “physical work performed is of a significant nature.”

The guidance did not raise the percentage required for the Five Percent Safe Harbor, which, as the name implies, remains at 5%. It also did not change the amount of time developers have to place a safe-harbored project in service, whether it’s using the Physical Work Test or Five Percent Safe Harbor. That Continuity Safe Harbor time period is still set at four years.

The new rules take effect on September 2, 2025, and are not retroactive.

Solar industry groups spoke out against the changes, but Roth Capital Partners said the guidance was “substantially better than expected.”

“The Treasury Department’s new guidance to further restrict energy tax credits is part of an unprecedented side deal the administration made with anti-clean energy ideologues to undermine Congress and further harm America’s solar industry,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the SEIA. “This is a blatant rejection of what Congress passed in HR 1, and it threatens thousands of small businesses across the country that are the backbone of our clean energy economy.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Quanta-stock-solar-utility-woman.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 13:04:04.949800

The California Air Resources Board is continuing to enforce “stringent emission standards” for trucks despite President Donald Trump’s congressional resolutions in June invalidating the Environmental Protection Agency’s preemption waivers for the state’s two standards on emissions for trucks.
The Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division claims the Clean Air Act prohibits the California Air Resources Board from enforcing regulations granted under the EPA’s waivers.
“President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions.

The California Air Resources Board is continuing to enforce “stringent emission standards” for trucks despite President Donald Trump’s congressional resolutions in June invalidating the Environmental Protection Agency’s preemption waivers for the state’s two standards on emissions for trucks.

Therefore, the Department of Justice filed a complaint against the California Air Resources Board in the Northern District of Illinois on Wednesday as well as in the Eastern District of California on Thursday.

The complaints were filed with motions to intervene and join previous plaintiffs in litigation against California in the two courts.

The Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division claims the Clean Air Act prohibits the California Air Resources Board from enforcing regulations granted under the EPA’s waivers. That is because the Clean Air Act prevents states from enforcing regulations on vehicle emissions unless the EPA grants the state a preemption waiver.

The division also said Trump’s decision in June was part of his commitment to “end the electric vehicle mandate, level the regulatory playing field and promote consumer choice in motor vehicles.”

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division said in a press release Friday. “President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions. The California Air Resources Board must respect the democratic process and stop enforcing unlawful standards.”

The California Air Resources Board is trying to find a way around its prohibition by enforcing the emission standards through the Clean Truck Partnership.

The complaint in the Eastern District of California was filed by four truck manufacturers: Daimler Truck North America, Paccar Inc., International Motors and Volvo Group North America.

International Motors said in a press release Monday, original equipment manufacturers — companies that sell parts to other companies that need them to build their products – are being asked to meet “conflicting mandates,” which in turn is affecting International Motors’ ability to produce and deliver vehicles to its customers.

“We are asking the courts for a swift resolution so we can continue providing the dependable solutions our customers count on every day, including the S13 Integrated Powertrain, which offers a fuel economy-leading powertrain option capable of achieving low NOx,” International Motors said.

Although imperfect, the IRA’s tax credits scored some significant wins that should undoubtedly inform future policy.
To the degree that the tax credits can help build industrial capacity and institutional support for decarbonization, future policymaking should maximize their remit and their distribution.
Democrats, like clean energy developers, do not fight on a level playing field.
Here, climate policy is not about combating Chinese supply chain dominance, or even about delivering an American industrial renaissance.","Today, the Inflation Reduction Act would have turned three years old — if it hadn’t been buried alive in a big, beautiful grave. While the IRA was a hodgepodge of programs salvaged from President Biden’s far more ambitious Build Back Better agenda, it still represented the biggest climate investment in U.S. history. It catalyzed over $360 billion in energy and manufacturing investments and was expected to drive the installation of over 155 gigawatts of new solar and wind energy by 2030. And now Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to its achievements.

The timing could not be worse — not just for the climate, but also for the energy systems that we rely on. At a moment when the energy sector requires $1.4 trillion worth of upgrades by 2030 just to keep up with rising energy demand and increasingly erratic weather, Republicans have instead delivered a one-two punch of tariffs and tax hikes, sabotaging the industrial base required to deliver those investments and raising the retirement age of our power generation fleet.

All over the country (Texas and California maybe exempted), our aging electricity system is putting in its two-weeks notice. Staring down the barrel of precipitous demand growth, the country’s regulated utilities have requested over $29 billion in rate increases, concentrated across the West and South. The Department of Energy ordered the delayed retirement of coal plants and oil generators to manage this summer’s demand peaks. Meanwhile, capacity market prices on two of the country’s largest grids, PJM and MISO, have reached record highs ― a cry for new supply that is now increasingly unlikely to materialize quickly or cheaply. Two months ago, an unplanned nuclear reactor outage on a congested part of Louisiana’s energy grid plunged 100,000 people in and around New Orleans into a blackout. That meant no working AC or refrigerators across large swaths of the city during a sweltering Memorial Day weekend.

All of this amounts to an opening for Democrats to shift public opinion decisively in favor of renewed climate action. Moving forward, lawmakers cannot ignore our infirm fossil-fired energy system, which stands to thwart their ability to deliver affordability, employment, health, and resilience to their constituents. Despite our recent losses, we still need an energy policy ― a climate policy.

What should the Democrats’ second attempt at a clean investment program look like? Having delivered the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, laws that committed the state to the realization of a particular energy future, Democrats are well-positioned to build on their successes, and even to engage Republicans who remain interested in supporting innovative technologies, decarbonizing industry, and protecting public lands.

Where they cannot meet Republicans halfway, Democrats should double their ambitions. They must continue to embrace the power of federal investment to shape markets and achieve policy goals. But they must also learn from the shortcomings of their previous legislative outings and substantively change how the federal government invests in the first place. The way forward for Democrats starts with mapping out exactly how far they didn’t go, and ends with going there.

IRA and BIL were paradigm-shifting attempts at market-shaping. They laid the groundwork for the deployment of promising clean firm energy technologies such as next-generation geothermal and nuclear energy, as well as for necessary grid and supply chain upgrades, such as long-distance transmission corridors and critical minerals processing.

IRA and BIL were not, however, a comprehensive climate policy. They created cost-share programs for infrastructure resilience but neglected to buttress municipal bond markets, which states and local governments can use to make longer-term investments in climate resilience and adaptation. They penalized methane emissions but organized no comprehensive or compulsory managed phaseout of fossil fuel infrastructure. They failed to advance or adequately finance a coordinated deployment strategy for any key energy sector. And they shed the transformative vision of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, which sought to stabilize the cost of living for Americans in the meantime — a tactical retreat that, in retrospect, looks ill-advised given voters’ current worries about affordability.

I am aware that criticizing BIL and IRA on these grounds amounts to judging them for goals they didn’t attempt to achieve. Judging them by the goals they did attempt to achieve, however, reveals that they only ever worked incompletely. Taken together, BIL and IRA expanded the energy tax credit system, created powerful programs for piloting and deploying innovative energy technologies, and seeded an ecosystem of regional financing institutions devoted to more equitably distributing the benefits of decarbonization. But the energy tax credits were never expansive enough; the programs intended to motivate investments into deeper decarbonization were not flexible enough to drive the mass uptake of emerging technologies; and efforts to decarbonize disadvantaged communities lacked a coherent strategy and ran headlong into local capacity constraints.

Speeding up the energy transition and building new infrastructure at scale requires endowing federal and state agencies with adequate appropriations, access to liquidity, and crystal-clear, wide-ranging mandates, as well as empowering them in statute with considerable flexibility as to the financial products and strategies they deploy to achieve those mandates.

Although imperfect, the IRA’s tax credits scored some significant wins that should undoubtedly inform future policy. The law took an existing system of technology-specific subsidies that had been on the books in some form since 1978 and made them technology-neutral, allowing developers of nearly any zero-emissions energy technology to access tax relief. It expanded the credits to domestic manufacturers of certain low- and zero-carbon technologies. It created a tax credit transfer market, allowing developers with limited tax liability to sell their credits for cash on an open market to any tax-liable buyer, rather than engage in expensive and complex “tax equity” transactions with a few large banks. It made certain credits directly accessible to tax-exempt entities, significantly broadening the pool of potential users. And most of these credits remained entirely uncapped ― a “bottomless mimosa” for developers that spurred over $321 billion in clean energy and manufacturing investments and supported more than 2,000 new facilities across the country.

To be sure, the IRA did not level the playing field perfectly across developers or across technologies. Developers of energy transmission, grid transformers, and electric rail were shut out of the credits. Tax-exempt public and nonprofit developers ― entities as large as the New York Power Authority and as small as local churches ― could not monetize depreciation or participate in the transfer market. And some credits remained capped, forcing developers to apply and cross their fingers. But as early as 2023, Goldman Sachs argued that even with these inadequacies ― which have easy legislative and statutory fixes ― the IRA would still have spurred over $3 trillion in investment by 2033.

The GOP has gutted much of this system, shortcomings and all, and replaced it with a tangle of red tape. The energy tax credits are once again technology-specific ― solar and wind developers have a few months left to start a project and claim the credits as written, though what it means to start a project got more complex just yesterday. But even the “clean firm” energy technologies that can still claim credits until 2032, such as nuclear and geothermal, may not be safe under new “foreign entity of concern” rules, which condition credits on developers’ ability to limit their reliance on Chinese suppliers and investment, requiring them to map out their supply chains at an unprecedented level of detail.

Democrats seeking to restore and build upon this plank of the IRA have their work cut out for them. The developers and manufacturers of any technology that contributes to zero-emissions energy production should be able to access and monetize federal support regardless of their tax status and free from the rigmarole and uncertainties imposed by competitive application procedures. Goldman Sachs’ $3 trillion estimate is now the lower bound of what’s possible — for instance, a tax credit for transmission investments suggested as part of Build Back Better but excluded from the IRA could have catalyzed over $15 billion in investment and supported the economics of all other energy projects. To the degree that the tax credits can help build industrial capacity and institutional support for decarbonization, future policymaking should maximize their remit and their distribution.

Tax credits alone, however, are hardly a skeleton key to decarbonization. Being disbursed only once a project is complete, tax credits do not substitute for the kinds of upfront financial support that project developers — especially developers of emerging technologies — require to complete their projects in the first place. Private investors have been comfortable with solar, batteries, and onshore wind because these projects can be completed, claim their tax credits, and earn revenues on the grid on a mostly predictable timetable. But new nuclear reactors, geothermal, hydrogen, green steel, and carbon capture are unfamiliar investments, have uncertain development pathways and return profiles, and thus remain un-bankable to investors.

This is why BIL and IRA created powerful programs worth tens of billions of dollars to finance the deployment of emerging clean technologies and break this vicious cycle of uncertainty. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, or OCED, and the Loan Programs Office, or LPO, in particular, were empowered to support, at scale, the testing and commercialization of these emerging technologies as well as conversions of whole electricity grids.

OCED, with over $27 billion in appropriations, set up hubs for hydrogen and carbon capture projects across the country, and funded a suite of advanced steel and iron decarbonization projects. Endowed by BIL and IRA with over $15 billion in total credit subsidy and well over $300 billion in total loan authority, LPO made ambitious investments across a host of innovative technology categories, including ― but certainly not limited to ― energy storage, sustainable aviation fuels, virtual power plants, EV charging, and bioenergy. At the end of 2024, the LPO had over 200 loan applicants in its queue.

By rescinding OCED’s unobligated funding, ambiguously rewriting LPO’s lending authorities (while rescinding most of its unobligated credit subsidy), and pulling the plug on billions of dollars worth of conditional commitments, the GOP has stopped years of progress in its tracks. In the meantime, LPO has shed considerable staff while the administration has prevented it from making any new commitments. The combination of the “foreign entity of concern” rules constraining tax credit eligibility and this shuttering of federal financing opportunities could seriously throttle the development and commercialization of nuclear energy in particular, the darling du jour of Republicans’ energy strategy.

If these offices were once the engines of decarbonization, they needed a stronger spark plug. The LPO, in particular, has a special authority to finance state government-backed, non-innovative clean energy projects, such as regional battery manufacturing clusters or a state power developer’s renewables portfolio, but has never used it. And while OCED and LPO can provide developers with some degree of upfront support, LPO cannot easily provide construction loans, cannot derisk project cash flows to provide security to investors, and cannot mandate offtake. These deficiencies prevent ambitious borrowers with unproven technologies from scaling up: they scare off private lenders in the infrastructure sector, many of which are skittish about construction risk, require project developers to demonstrate three to five years of stable cash flows, have a low tolerance for market price uncertainty, and have shareholders who demand a certain level of returns.

The DOE can bridge this “valley of death” by using its broader market-shaping authorities to take a more aggressive “dealership” role in these sectors, providing stable offtake for developers through upfront purchasing while becoming a reliable source of supply to downstream customers (like an actual car dealership or a grocery store). The DOE has in fact already used this approach to provide demand-side support to its now-endangered hydrogen hubs through OCED.

These kinds of public dealership arrangements are not unique or path-breaking: The Federal Reserve’s backstop of the municipal bond market in 2020, nonprofit investor Climate United’s planned EV trucking purchase-and-lease program in California, and even the Department of Defense’s recent MP Materials deal are all examples of public entities addressing a mismatch in the supply of and demand for a critical good and, in doing so, shaping markets toward public ends.

For all that BIL and IRA built avenues for developing and deploying energy technologies, they were also full of programs aimed at distributing the fruits of decarbonization equitably. Both the energy community bonus credits, a provision in the IRA that increased the value of the energy tax credits for projects in poorer, higher-unemployment, and energy facility-adjacent communities, and President Biden’s Justice40 initiative, which directed 40% of federal spending toward poorer and more rural communities, exemplified the administration’s “place-based” approach to industrial policy and economic development. The Biden administration heavily encouraged disadvantaged communities, local governments, schools, nonprofits, and tribal nations to develop their own clean energy projects — aided by the IRA’s direct pay mechanism, which allowed tax-exempt entities to access subsidies — by drawing on the various local decarbonization programs in BIL and IRA.

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, perhaps the most important of these programs, exemplifies the promises and pitfalls of the administration’s approach to “place-based” industrial policy. Managed by the Environmental Protection Agency, GGRF provided $27 billion to disadvantaged communities for the financing of rooftop solar, zero-emissions transport, and net-zero housing. That pot was split into three thematic buckets ― $7 billion to the Solar for All program, specifically for rooftop solar development; $14 billion to the National Clean Investment Fund, for supporting clean energy project finance more broadly in disadvantaged communities; and $6 billion more to local and regional technical assistance providers. Each program then subdivided its appropriations further. Solar for All went to 60 recipients across the country via a competitive application. The National Clean Investment Fund’s $14 billion was split among three awardees, each a coalition of various financial institutions designed to lend to energy projects, such as green banks, impact investors, and nonprofits ― and each of those recipient coalitions planned to subdivide much of its funds still further, first among coalition partners and then to subordinate local and state partners.

That dizzying program structure was meant to endow local communities with the ability to finance their own projects. And by including so many nonprofit institutions, GGRF could make significant inroads into Republican states, whose officials might otherwise reject federal funding.

But there was not much coordination between partners and subawardees around how best to deploy those funds. And what seemed like a firehose of financing often reached local recipients as a trickle of pre-development and technical assistance grants. Demanding that local organizations build their own capacity to plan, finance, and develop projects (or hire expensive external consultants to do so) ― with limited and one-time funds, no less ― is duplicative and inefficient, and it defeats GGRF’s own stated goal of mobilizing private capital through building standardized markets for decarbonization, thereby slowing down the pace of emissions reductions. The program’s complexity also left it vulnerable to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s efforts to hound the program in court and freeze its funding.

Pandemic-era proposals for a National Investment Authority, as well as legislative proposals for a national green bank ― predecessors to the GGRF ― differ sharply from this status quo, instead highlighting how public finance can benefit from economies of scale. Larger financial institutions tasked with deploying clean energy projects can more easily prepare portfolios of projects for co-investors, engage with utilities, raise debt on municipal bond markets, and build a bench of trustworthy private developers to contract for projects. If they are publicly administered, these institutions can also take more risk, undercut private lenders, support more developers, engage with local communities to meet their needs, and use revenues from higher-return projects to derisk lower-return projects that might be necessary to build to achieve their resilience and affordability goals.

Should policymakers get a second shot at building a national green bank system, they should not try to recreate GGRF’s fractal approach to energy finance. Rather, policymakers must ensure that financing sits in the hands of public agencies that already have the authorities and expert staff to be ambitious market-shapers: bond banks, state-led energy finance authorities, and public developers. The good news is that state-level green banks empowered with state funding and a political mandate are already exercising their capacities to shape markets and support disadvantaged communities directly: the New York Power Authority, the Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority, the Connecticut Green Bank, and the Greater Arizona Development Authority, to name a few, are all taking it upon themselves to raise debt and contract with developers to undertake ambitious energy and infrastructure investment programs.

But Democrats should be clear-eyed about the consequences of this reorientation: It means rejecting the prevailing wisdom that local nonprofits should necessarily coordinate local project development. Local groups can be extremely effective advocates for communities’ needs ― but in contrast to public investment agencies, their capacity to finance and implement solutions is simply not great enough.

This analysis of IRA and BIL leaves out more parts of the laws than it includes ― to take just one example, the BIL’s $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure charging station program. But the story is similar: Ambitious as it seemed, NEVI money could only flow when state governments set up implementation offices and had their spending plans approved by federal officials. Most states, which had not prepared for any of this, took years to build the requisite capacity ― just in time for the Trump administration to try and snatch away the funding (though it recently admitted defeat in that project). In fairness to state governments, the EV charging sector is incredibly new. But even this program highlights how IRA and BIL lacked the capacity to be implemented as quickly and efficiently as their supporters hoped.

Going above and beyond BIL and IRA to deliver an energy policy that stabilizes Americans’ cost of living while driving an energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward the technologies of the future ― Democrats should embrace this challenge. But they should also be aware that climate ambition runs headlong into the same institutional problems facing American democracy at large. The Senate filibuster prevents either party from comprehensively redesigning the federal government, its institutions, and its regulations to serve Americans more quickly and more efficiently. That leaves both parties reliant on budget reconciliation ― to our detriment. The head-spinning design of GGRF was itself an artifact of the reconciliation process, which prevented Congress from creating a single green bank institution or giving it a specific mandate; its awardee organizations and coalitions certainly did not ask for the program structure they got.

There’s a lot more that budget reconciliation will never solve: the century-old American utility system, the regulatory thicket of U.S. electricity markets, or the land use and permitting rules that constrain project development and grid interconnection. And things could get worse: Trump-appointed judges and Supreme Court justices who reject federal agencies’ and state governments’ attempts to regulate fossil fuel infrastructure have placed the legal system itself at odds with responsible energy system management. The courts may no longer be able to block clawbacks and recissions of legally obligated federal spending. Democrats, like clean energy developers, do not fight on a level playing field.

While Democrats are out of federal power, they should practice ambitious climate policymaking at the state level. States already have considerable ability to raise finance and build capacity for ambitious infrastructure projects ― and they might have to quickly, considering the drain of federal capacity that might support them. By developing their own public programs for transmission finance, utility-scale battery procurement, virtual power plants, and clean firm energy pilots, Democratic state governments can ensure that the ecosystem of clean energy developers created by BIL and IRA does not disappear for lack of demand — and in doing so, these states would help stabilize the cost of clean energy project development.

Finally, Democrats should not forget that climate remains a cost of living issue. In a city like New Orleans, rocked by the recent nuclear outage, residents spend, on average, over 19% of their incomes on their energy bills, over three times the DOE’s threshold to be considered an energy-burdened community. Their bills already include adders for climate adaptation and disaster preparedness ― yet, for all they spend, they still face blackouts, and their costs will only increase as their grid continues to deteriorate. Here, climate policy is not about combating Chinese supply chain dominance, or even about delivering an American industrial renaissance. It’s about keeping the lights on, keeping bills low, keeping the air clean, and keeping residents safe from disaster.

It turns out that voters all over the country still care about these goals. A majority of likely voters in the next election think climate change will have a direct impact on their or their family’s finances. This constituency is still in play — and given sharply deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, soon-to-spike electricity prices, and the ever-increasing threat of climate disaster, these cost-of-living-focused voters could be far more vocal, relevant, and hungry for change than a coalition built on vague sabre-rattling against China.

In 2022, Democrats made a valiant first attempt to transform the state itself. Perhaps it was inadequate, perhaps it was impossible to do more at the time, but that’s no reason not to think seriously about the kind of policymaking, institutional, and financial interventions that would be called for should they get a second shot at realizing that goal. The rollback of the IRA only reveals how much Democrats left on the table three years ago ― and how much farther a real climate policy could go.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQzOTEyNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTczMTc4MH0.2pkwcXBA7GhyTKGGN-NDAS0oA3vmcD8QzWexPZy2e0c/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-08-16 12:09:06.067624

Oil industry warns of higher fuel costs, questions proposal's legality

Proposal impacts bio-based diesel reliant on imports

A top U.S. oil trade group on Thursday joined a chorus of complaints against a new government proposal to slash incentives for biofuel imports, testing the Trump administration's resolve to keep the policy in the upcoming months.

The mounting criticism puts the White House in the position of having to side with either farmers looking to prioritize domestic supply, or refiners seeking cheaper feedstock - both groups loyal to President Donald Trump.

At issue is a proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in June that would allocate only half as many tradable renewable fuel credits to imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks as to domestic ones.

The shift, which could be finalized before the year's end, has significant implications for bio-based diesel, which relies on imports to meet federal mandates.

The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires refiners to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the fuel market, or buy credits known as renewable identification numbers (RINs) from those that do to demonstrate compliance with the program.

The Farm Belt, specifically soybean farmers, hailed the proposed shift as a victory, arguing the RFS was always intended to boost domestic production and that countries like China were flooding the market with cheap supply.

But the oil industry argues the U.S. lacks enough feedstock to meet the federal quotas without imports, tightening an already stretched domestic market and driving prices higher.

""As proposed, it is unworkable and would have significant harmful effects on the overall RFS program and could place upward pressure on fuel costs,"" the American Petroleum Institute said in a letter to the EPA on Thursday, urging the complete removal of the import proposal.

The API also questioned the legality of the proposal in separate comments, signaling the deep-pocketed trade group could be prepared to go to court to challenge the administration.

Refiners and farm groups were unified earlier this year on bio-based diesel, with both arguing that federal quotas needed to be higher. However, the shift on imports caught both industries by surprise.

Even within trade groups, sentiment around the imports proposal is divided.

""There is no consensus among our members on the proposal to reduce the RIN value for fuels produced domestically from foreign feedstock,"" Clean Fuels Alliance America, a biodiesel group, said in comments submitted to the EPA.

How Baker Donelson Can Assist The proposed rollback of EPA's and states' GHG authority marks a significant shift in environmental regulation.","Together, these developments have triggered significant legal uncertainty, raising complex questions about the CRA's applicability to waiver decisions and the future of federal GHG regulation. California and other states have responded with litigation, seeking to preserve their regulatory authority. In the meantime, states and industry stakeholders are navigating the shifting legal landscape by pursuing alternative compliance strategies – including executive orders, voluntary industry-state agreements, and land-use-based regulations like Indirect Source Review rules that may fall outside the scope of federal preemption.

For decades, California's unique waiver authority has enabled it to set some of the nation's most ambitious vehicle emissions standards – many of which have been adopted by other states. While the recent CRA resolutions pose a direct threat to that state-led framework, this article also takes a closer look at a separate, potentially more far-reaching development: the EPA's proposal to rescind the 2009 CAA GHG Endangerment Finding. Independent of the CRA controversy, this proposed rule challenges the legal foundation for federal GHG regulation of mobile source emissions under the CAA.

Background: California's Clean Air Act Waiver Authority

Under the CAA, Congress generally preempted states from setting their own emissions standards for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. However, California was granted a unique carveout under Section 209(b) of the CAA, which authorizes it to seek a waiver from the EPA to enforce its own, often stricter, vehicle emissions standards despite federal preemption.

The EPA is required to grant such waivers unless it finds that: (1) California's determination is arbitrary and capricious; (2) the state does not need its standards to meet ""compelling and extraordinary conditions""; or (3) the standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are inconsistent with Section 202(a) of the CAA. In addition, other states are permitted to adopt California's standards under certain conditions.

Over the past five decades, the EPA has granted California more than 100 CAA waivers. In addition, as of early 2025, 17 states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's light-duty vehicle standards, while 10 states have adopted its standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

Congressional Review Act Resolutions and Their Impact

The Congressional Review Act is an oversight tool that allows Congress to invalidate federal agency actions that qualify as ""rules"" under the statute. Under the CRA, if both the House and Senate pass a joint resolution of disapproval – signed by the president – within 60 legislative days of a rule being submitted to Congress, the rule is nullified and has no legal effect. Importantly, the CRA also bars agencies from issuing any new rule that is ""substantially the same"" as the one disapproved, unless Congress expressly authorizes it by law.1

To fall within the scope of the CRA, an agency action must meet the definition of a ""rule"" under the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA""), subject to exclusions such as rules of particular applicability. The GAO has consistently opined that EPA waivers granted to California under CAA Section 209(b) are not rules, but rather meet the statutory definition of an ""order"" because a waiver decision ""mak[es] a 'final disposition' granting California a 'form of permission."" According to the GAO, even if such a waiver were considered a rule, it would be a rule of particular applicability, which is exempt from CRA review.

Despite these legal distinctions, Congress has tested the limits of the CRA's reach by targeting California-specific EPA waivers for disapproval. Congress passed, and President Trump signed, three CRA resolutions disapproving key EPA waivers previously granted to California:

H.J. Res. 88: Disapproved the EPA waiver for California's Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II) program, which requires that 100 percent of new light- and medium-duty vehicle sales in the state be zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2035.

H.J. Res. 87: Disapproved a suite of EPA waivers covering several heavy-duty vehicle programs, including:

Advanced Clean Trucks, which mandates increasing the sales of medium- and heavy-duty ZEVs over time, with targets reaching 100 percent by 2045

Zero-Emission Airport Shuttle requirements; and

The Zero-Emission Powertrain Certification program.

H.J. Res. 89: Disapproved the waiver for California's ""Omnibus"" Low NOx regulation, which imposes stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles.

If these disapprovals are upheld by the courts, their implications would be far-reaching. First, they would rescind the underlying waivers, preventing California from enforcing the affected standards and barring other states from adopting them. Second, and perhaps more consequentially, the CRA's ""substantially the same"" prohibition could block the EPA from ever reissuing similar waivers or authorizations – even under future administrations – unless Congress enacts new legislation permitting it.

Legal and Procedural Controversies

Until now, the CRA has never been used to invalidate a federal agency action that involved waiving preemption or authorizing states to implement their own regulatory programs. This unprecedented application of the CRA has ignited intense legal debate, particularly given the statute's judicial review bar, which states that ""no determination, finding, action, or omission under [the CRA] shall be subject to judicial review.""2

Some commentators argue that this non-review provision entirely bars courts from scrutinizing whether a disapproved agency action qualifies as a ""rule"" subject to the CRA's scope. Others counter that, at minimum, courts must retain the authority to decide whether an agency action even qualifies as a ""rule"" in the first place – a foundational threshold question critical to the CRA's application and Congress's disapproval power.

On June 12, 2025, California and ten other states filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Docket No.: 3:25-cv-04966) challenging the legality of the three CRA resolutions that disapproved EPA's waivers. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that these resolutions have no effect on the status or enforceability of their state emissions control programs.

The states contend that preemption waiver decisions are not ""rules"" under the CRA and therefore lie beyond Congress's power to disapprove under that statute. Specifically, they emphasize that the waiver authority granted to the EPA under the CAA empowers the agency only to waive federal preemption as applied to California – not to promulgate rules. Supporting this, EPA waiver decisions have consistently stated that they are ""not a rule,"" and Congress explicitly excluded waiver decisions from the list of CAA actions subject to rulemaking requirements.3

Moreover, the states argue that the CRA was designed to provide guardrails to federal rulemaking – not to dismantle state regulatory authority, particularly where that authority is expressly granted by statute. The complaint asserts that employing the CRA in this manner violates key constitutional principles, including the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and fundamental tenets of federalism. Accordingly, the states maintain that Congress lacks the constitutional authority to rescind Biden Administration preemption waivers through the CRA.

Should Congress's use of the CRA withstand judicial review, the practical effect would be to invalidate EPA's waiver decisions – preempting California's ability to enforce its stricter emissions regulations and likely barring other states from enforcing their identical standards or adopting new, stricter regulations under the derivative authority of these invalidated waivers. Furthermore, without new congressional authorization, the EPA would be prohibited from issuing new ""rules"" substantially similar to the disapproved waivers in the future, significantly constraining regulatory flexibility on GHG emissions.

Industry and State Responses

As California's long-standing CAA waivers face renewed scrutiny, states and industry stakeholders are adopting a range of adaptive strategies to sustain progress on emission reductions. The sections below explore how states and the industry are responding to this legal uncertainty – highlighting executive actions, voluntary agreements, and innovative regulatory approaches like Indirect Source Review rules, which may offer durable, waiver-independent pathways for emissions control.

California's Response

While litigation over the state's waiver authority proceeds, California's Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order on June 12th directing the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop new zero-emission regulations. These rules are intended either to strengthen existing mandates or serve as replacements should the current regulations be invalidated in court. The order reaffirms California's commitment to phasing out gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles.

Industry Response

In the face of legal uncertainty, voluntary agreements between manufacturers and states are becoming increasingly important as alternative pathways for emissions reductions. One notable example is the Clean Truck Partnership (CTP), an agreement among CARB, the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association, and major truck manufacturers representing more than 90 percent of California's truck market. Under the CTP, participating manufacturers have pledged to comply with California's emissions regulations – including those subject to CRA challenges – regardless of the outcome of litigation over waiver authorizations or California's underlying regulatory authority.

Alternative Regulatory Approaches by States

Rather than setting emissions standards for vehicles directly, some states are pursuing complementary regulatory tools such as Indirect Source Review (ISR) rules. These regulations target emissions associated with activities at facilities like ports, warehouses, and distribution centers rather than regulating vehicles directly. ISRs incentivize the transition to zero-emission vehicles by regulating the stationary sources contributing to air pollution from mobile sources, rather than regulating the mobile sources themselves.

Because ISRs focus on facility impacts and land use – rather than vehicle design or emissions limits – they typically fall outside the scope of the CAA Section 209 preemption and do not require a federal waiver. As a result, ISRs are believed to offer a legally resilient strategy for advancing zero-emission goals.

The EPA Seeks to Repeal Its CAA Greenhouse Gas Mobile Source Emissions Regulatory Authority

Under Section 202(a) of the CAA, the EPA is required to regulate air pollutants that ""cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare."" In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court affirmed that greenhouse gases (GHGs) qualify as such pollutants, granting the EPA authority to regulate them from motor vehicles.

In response, the Obama Administration's EPA issued two key findings that provide the legal foundation for regulating GHG emissions under the CAA:

(1) the 2009 ""Endangerment Finding,"" which concluded that six GHGs – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) – endanger public health and welfare; and

(2) the Cause or Contribute Finding, which determined that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to harmful air pollution.

Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the Endangerment Finding and repealing all GHG emission standards for new light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. Absent this finding, the EPA would lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the CAA to prescribe standards for GHG emissions.

The EPA's proposal does not challenge existing tailpipe standards for traditional pollutants that directly harm human health. Under its proposed new interpretation of the CAA, GHGs – due to their global nature – fall outside the scope of Section 202(a). The EPA suggests that Section 202(a) of the CAA is best read as authorizing the regulation of air pollutants that cause or contribute to air pollution which endangers public health or welfare through local or regional exposure. Under this interpretation, CAA mobile source regulations that do not depend on the 2009 Endangerment Finding – such as those targeting traditional pollutants like hydrocarbons (HCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and particulate matter (PM) – would remain unaffected. These pollutants are known to harm human health and the environment directly, either through immediate exposure (e.g., inhalation or dermal contact) or by contributing to air pollution phenomena such as smog and acid rain, which also have localized or regional health effects.

Unlike these traditional pollutants, the EPA now proposes that Section 202(a) of the CAA does not authorize regulation of GHGs based on global climate change concerns because GHGs do not cause or contribute to localized air pollution in a manner that can reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare under the statute's intended scope. Accordingly, the proposed rule would repeal all motor vehicle and engine GHG emission regulations. Without the Endangerment Finding, the EPA contends there is no statutory basis for maintaining these regulations.

The EPA has proposed several alternatives for repealing the Endangerment Finding, signaling a potential shift in how the agency evaluates scientific evidence for regulation. First, the EPA questioned the scientific basis of the Endangerment Finding, stating there is ""insufficient reliable information"" to support the conclusion that GHG emissions from vehicles and engines endanger public health in the form of global climate change. Additionally, the agency argued that there is no ""requisite technology"" capable of reliably and meaningfully addressing elevated global GHG concentrations.

As part of its public comment request, the EPA is soliciting input on what scientific threshold should be used to determine whether vehicle emissions have measurable impacts on climate trends. This raises the prospect of a significantly higher evidentiary standard for future regulation – one that could make it far more difficult to regulate GHGs or other pollutants if agencies are required to demonstrate precise, quantifiable impacts on global climate outcomes before acting.

Regulatory Implications and Preemption Concerns Resulting from Rescinding the Endangerment Finding

Industry stakeholders should note that EPA's proposed rule to rescind the Endangerment Finding is still a proposal, with public comments accepted through September 15, 2025. A public hearing is scheduled for August 19 and 20, with pre-registration for verbal testimony due August 12, 2025. Stakeholders should carefully review the proposed rule and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194).

While the EPA asserts that Title II of the CAA still preempts state GHG emission standards, some legal experts warn that rescinding the Endangerment Finding could open the door for more aggressive state-level regulation. Specifically, Section 209(a) of the CAA prohibits states from adopting or enforcing emission standards for new motor vehicles or engines ""subject to this part"" of the CAA. However, if the EPA revokes the Endangerment Finding and ceases regulating GHG emissions from vehicles, no federal GHG standards would apply, potentially meaning no vehicles would be ""subject to this part"" for those emissions.

The Supreme Court's decision in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410 (2011), also factors in, affirming that federal common-law claims on GHG emissions are preempted, as Congress tasked the EPA with regulating these emissions. But an absence of federal regulation could shift the balance, prompting courts to reassess the interplay between federal regulatory inaction and federal common-law protections.

The fallout of any rollback of GHG emissions regulations at the federal level raises a novel legal question: whether California would still require a waiver under Section 209(b) to enforce its zero-emission vehicle standards, or whether Section 209(a) preemption would no longer apply in the absence of federal GHG regulation. While courts have yet to address this exact scenario – since the EPA has regulated GHGs continuously since 2009 – it remains uncertain whether federal preemption would continue to bar state standards. Some legal scholars argue that the EPA's broad authority under the CAA to regulate pollutants means a refusal to regulate could be viewed as a declination to act, effectively leaving regulatory authority to the states. Nonetheless, it is also possible that courts could uphold federal preemption on statutory or policy grounds to avoid a fragmented regulatory landscape.

Next Steps for Businesses

As legal, regulatory, and political uncertainty surrounding federal and state emissions authority continues to unfold, stakeholders across the transportation, manufacturing, logistics, and energy sectors should stay closely engaged and begin preparing for a range of potential outcomes.

1. Legal Review

First, companies should consult legal counsel to assess how the combined impacts of the EPA's proposed rule and the recent CRA resolutions may impact their regulatory obligations, business operations, and strategic planning. Legal review is critical for companies currently operating under California-based emissions standards, investing in zero-emission technologies, or acting based on federal climate regulations for business planning or permitting.

2. Risk Management and Compliance Strategy

Second, companies should evaluate their regulatory posture and consider proactive steps to manage risk in the face of shifting federal and state requirements. This may include reviewing internal compliance plans, supply chain strategies, and product development timelines tied to California's standards or federal GHG regulations. Participating in or forming voluntary agreements, engaging with state and local regulators on land-use-based mechanisms like Indirect Source Review (ISR) rules, and diversifying compliance approaches can help create predictability amid regulatory flux.

3. Monitor Legal Developments

Companies should monitor the progress of state-led litigation challenging the CRA resolutions, potential judicial review of EPA's waiver authority, and participating in and tracking the rulemaking process for the EPA's Endangerment Finding proposal will be essential. These developments could fundamentally reshape the roles of federal and state governments in emissions regulation. While the regulatory landscape remains unsettled, proactive legal and strategic planning now can help businesses stay ahead of potential disruptions.

How Baker Donelson Can Assist

The proposed rollback of EPA's and states' GHG authority marks a significant shift in environmental regulation. While the final outcome remains uncertain, early legal and strategic planning can help businesses navigate a potentially fragmented and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape.

With its abundant sunshine, relaxed regulatory environment, and an ever more urgent need for more kilowatts, Texas has already established itself as a national leader in installed solar capacity. Texas is also doing for others what it has done to itself. The state’s booming solar manufacturing sector is sending solar equipment all over the US to help keep the renewable energy transition moving along, regardless of the abrupt shift in federal policy.

Texas Sends A Solar Manufacturing Love Letter To The Other 49 States

To be clear, all is not roses. Some Texas lawmakers have been trying to throttle down the pace of solar development within Texas. They may yet succeed, but in the meantime solar manufacturing has become an economic force to be reckoned with. After all, who wants to monkey-wrench thousands of new factory jobs?

A case in point is T1 Energy. T1 is the newly refreshed brand of the former Norway-based firm Freyr Battery, which moved its headquarters to Austin and turned to the ripe field of solar manufacturing in Texas after droppping plans for an EV battery factory in Georgia.

T1 already has a one gigawatt-scale solar module factory in the works in Texas, and now the company is racing full speed ahead with plans for a second factory in Texas, to supply its first factory with made-in-Texas solar cells.

As for where the polysilicon for the solar cells will come from, that’s not coming from Texas, but it will be made in the US. Earlier today, T1 and the US legacy firm Corning Incorporated let word slip that T1 will source its polysilicon and solar wafers from Corning’s Hemlock venture in Michigan. The terms of a newly announced strategic partnership call for Corning to deliver wafers to T1’s G2_Austin facility, where they will be used to manufacture solar cells. “These cells will then be used to manufacture solar modules at T1’s operational G1_Dallas site,” T1 explains.

Location, Location, Location

Although the chaotic state of tariff and tax policy in the US has put a damper on some (but not all) solar development in the US for the time being, the solar manufacturing side is a different kettle of fish. Industry stakeholders anticipate that the White House’s oft-stated support for onshoring will enable solar factories to keep on churning out the goods, regardless of other policy variables.

“Supply chain certainty remains a top priority for customers, and the expanded agreement between T1 and Corning delivers a more stable and predictable supply of domestically sourced solar components,” T1 explains.

“By connecting American-made polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules, this vertically integrated model supports long-term planning, regulatory compliance, and energy resilience,” they add for good measure.

Solar Manufacturing Is Forever

The US was first out of the box in the global solar manufacturing movement back in the 1950’s, riding demand for the expensive little gadgets in aerospace applications and other market niches where price is no object. By the end of the 20th century, though, the US industry was running far behind its overseas competitors. Renewed support for renewable energy at the federal level kickstarted the domestic industry back to life on the heels of the 2008 financial meltdown. Despite some high profile failures (Solyndra, much?), the policy was an overwhelming success overall. By the beginning of this year the solar factory muscles were flexing all over the US.

If anyone hopes to stamp out that fire, they’ll find tough going. Just take a look at Corning. The company has been introducing waves of commercial-ready technology into the market since the 1850’s and it’s not about to stop now. “We’re accelerating the ramp of our advanced manufacturing capabilities to support a resilient U.S. solar supply chain,” explains Corning VP and General Manager AB Ghosh, who is also Chairman and CEO of the company’s Hemlock Semiconductor branch.

“Corning is proud to help meet the growing need for solar products made in the United States,” Ghosh emphasized in a press statement. “We’re accelerating the ramp of our advanced manufacturing capabilities to support a resilient U.S. solar supply chain.”

“By building foundational infrastructure in Michigan, we’re adding good-paying manufacturing jobs, strengthening the U.S. solar industry and advancing a more energy-independent future for the country,” he added for good measure.

T1 CEO and Board Chairman Daniel Barcelo also chipped in his two cents. “Together with Corning, we intend to accelerate America’s ability to manufacture leading-edge solar solutions, support a total of nearly 6,000 American jobs, and promote American energy independence,” he said.

Next Steps For The US Energy Transition

If you’re wondering why Freyr Battery was dropped its EV battery plans for Georgia like a hot potato last year and turned its attention to solar manufacturing, that’s a good question. Among other factors, Freyr was already committed to a Nordic-centered supply chain for its semi-solid stationary and EV lithium-ion batteries as of last year, but other battery stakeholders were already beginning to drop hints of a new low-cost LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) formula. Last year Ford also hinted that LFP was in its future electrification plans.

Unless Freyr was prepared to make the pivot, the writing was on the wall. Sure enough, in recent weeks both Ford and General Motors confirmed plans to introduce LFP in the near future.

Meanwhile, Corning was already hammering away at the domestic solar manufacturing market through its Hemlock Semiconductor venture in Michigan. Corning put up $900 million for a majority stake in the firm last year, catapulting the state into the solar investment big leagues and adding more than 1,000 jobs, to boot.

There being no such thing as a free lunch, the US solar market is not out of the woods yet. The Republican majority in Congress put a another crimp in the US energy transition when it passed the new “OBBA” tax bill in July. The Treasury Department followed up with an extra kick in the pants when it issued guidance interpreting the new law.

The Solar Energy Industries Association promptly accused the White House of making a “side deal” with fossil energy stakeholders and their allies.

“The Treasury Department’s new guidance to further restrict energy tax credits is part of an unprecedented side deal the administration made with anti-clean energy ideologues to undermine Congress and further harm America’s solar industry,” SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said last week, on August 15.

“This is a blatant rejection of what Congress passed in H.R. 1, and it threatens thousands of small businesses across the country that are the backbone of our clean energy economy,” she added, with H.R. 1 meaning the new tax bill.

Hold on to your hats. SEIA is currently preparing a follow-on response, most likely a legal one. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, contact your representatives in Congress and tell them what you think.

Trump has been largely silent on addressing the pain his tariffs have caused farmers and ranchers, despite rural voters being a cornerstone of his political base.","Seventh-generation farmer Brian Harbage grows corn, soybeans and grass, and runs a cattle operation across five counties in western Ohio. In the world of agriculture, his work makes up a large business.

And still, the past two years have been immensely challenging amid the twin threats of the climate crisis and the Trump administration.

Last year, regions of the eastern corn belt saw just 20% of crops harvested due to a drought that brought little precipitation between June and October. It was part of a climatic cycle that involved drought, heat and wildfires that cost crop producers $11bn nationally.

“Last year, we got a good crop started, and then it just quit raining. Our yields were definitely reduced by at least 25-30%,” says Harbage.

This year, it’s been almost the complete opposite.

Excess rainfall has fueled severe disease and pest pressure on the several thousand acres of soybeans and corn he planted in the spring.

“There were three-day windows, it seemed like. It would just start to get dried out and it would rain,” he says.

“We finished up [planting] at the beginning of June. We like to be finished by 15 May. Anything that’s planted later means that it was probably planted in marginal conditions since we were rushing to get it in, and secondly, it doesn’t have near enough time to mature before harvest.”

With the 2025 harvest of corn and soybeans approaching – America’s biggest two crops and the linchpins of agriculture – crop growers are facing down the gauntlet. Climatic swings, rocketing operating costs and low international demand, caused, in large part, by government policy in the shape of tariffs, has created the perfect storm.

“Farming is not for the worrisome,” says Harbage. “We always kid that we are crisis managers.”

Suicide rates among farmers are 3.5 times the national level.

In 2023-24, China bought 24.9m metric tons of soybeans worth $13.2bn, largely used to feed its 427-million-strong pig herd. At under 6m metric tons, US farmers’ second biggest international soybean market, Mexico, lags far behind.

Since 2017, when tariffs were first introduced by President Trump, crop farmers have been struggling with the decline of China as the leading market for soybeans and an important market for corn exports.

Last month, reports emerged that exports of soybeans – America’s largest grain export by value – had hit a 20-year low.

“Tariffs are probably something that will help in the long run, for the whole country; in the short run it’s terrible for farmers,” says Harbage.

“We’re really taking it on the chin now because if we can’t export, our prices are low. And if we can’t export and we have a terrible crop then it’s a one-two punch. I see what the government wants to do, but it’s hurting me in the near term.”

Farmers and rural Americans are keen to highlight that their political and voting preferences are rarely fueled by a single issue or event such as tariffs. Many continue to back Trump, despite the obvious financial challenges the president’s policies are fomenting.

Trump has been largely silent on addressing the pain his tariffs have caused farmers and ranchers, despite rural voters being a cornerstone of his political base. On 10 August, he posted to Truth Social a demand that China quadruple its purchases of American soybeans. The president claimed that China was “worried” about having a soybean shortage, although China has vowed to increase its domestic soybean production yield by 38% by 2034.

What’s more, some market analysts say that Trump’s post didn’t make the rounds on Chinese social media, suggesting his demand may not have been heard by the country’s political leaders.

With the soybean harvest in the midwest set to start about a month from now, and corn following weeks later, the fear that China may not buy a single shipload of grain this season is growing for many.

“With [tariffs] in place, we are not competitive with soybeans from Brazil. Our marketing year starts 1 October and usually by now we’d see China making commitments to pre-purchases for soybeans. China has not made a single purchase for US soybeans,” says Virginia Houston, director of government affairs at the American Soybean Association, a lobbying organization.

“No market can match China’s demand for soybeans. Right now, there is a 20% retaliatory duty from China.”

To appease his farming base, the Trump administration announced $60bn in subsidies for farmers over the next decade in the recent tax bill, but that has drawn criticism from those who say that farmers shouldn’t be subsidized on taxpayers’ dime.

Others have reported that funding is going to select producers in specific regions of the US, benefiting bigger producers rather than family farms. Adding to the export challenges, the price of commodity crops in the US has been in steady decline for the past three years due to a smaller cattle herd and falling ethanol production.

Houston says that when she speaks with the White House and Congress to share the struggles farmers are facing due to tariffs, the response is that “they support farmers [but] we are one cog in the wheel of this complex relationship.

“The farm economy is in a much tougher place than where we were in 2018 [during Trump’s previous China trade war]. Prices have gone down while inputs – seed, fertilizer, chemicals, land and equipment – continue to go up.”

All the while, unpredictable weather conditions continue to make planning more difficult.

For much of this summer, afternoon storms had been a near-daily occurrence in Indiana, Ohio and elsewhere in the eastern corn belt, causing ponding that kills early plant growth. Diseases such as northern corn leaf blight, gray leaf spot and tar spot soon followed.

“When it’s being attacked by disease, it’s not growing to its full potential because it’s trying to fight off the disease,” says Harbage.

Although he treated his crops for disease, the heat and humidity that have been an uncommon feature of life this summer can overcome the effects of fungicides.

On top of that, Harbage says he’ll have to spend additional money on propane to dry his corn before sending it to consumers, again due to the high moisture content.

If Trump walked into his farm today, Harbage says he’d have one message.

“The exports is number one. That’s the number one fix. We have to get rid of what we’re growing, or we have to be able to use it,” he says.

“China, Mexico and Canada – we export $83bn worth of commodities to them a year. So if they’re not buying, we’re stuck with our crop.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8938915566efe88aed88552cc62e142b86285c21/572_0_3626_2900/master/3626.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9007f1c009d88d7a125002db05e53653",N,,2025-08-16 10:01:14.833669

Congress passed the largest ever federal law to combat climate change. Coal-burning power plants were shutting down. Hundreds of billions of dollars of federal investment in renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles was beginning to flow.

But in just months, President Trump has attacked much of that work.

The Biden-era climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, is in tatters. The White House is trying to revive coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, while boosting oil and gas and hindering solar and wind power. And it is weakening or trying to scrap environmental policies and regulations, some dating to 1970.

The abrupt reversal in fortunes has led to a moment of crisis for the environmental community. “The morale is destroyed,” said Ramon Cruz, a former president of the Sierra Club. “I won’t try to sugar coat it. This is a generational loss.”

After a series of stinging defeats and other challenges, some prominent environmental groups are adrift. This week, the Sierra Club’s executive director was fired after a rocky tenure in which he oversaw several rounds of layoffs and clashed with employees. Greenpeace is facing a $670 million legal verdict that could put its future at risk. Rewiring America, a nonprofit group that works to electrify buildings, has slashed nearly a third of its staff.

In the fiscal year that ended in June, the NRDC saw its second highest fund-raising total ever, according to Mark Drajem, a spokesman. (Its best year was 2021.) It is increasing its focus in states like Georgia and Ohio, where it sees opportunities to accelerate solar energy. It is helping to support a Vermont law that would hold fossil fuel companies responsible for climate damage. And the group is expanding its work in India and beginning to work on projects in Africa.

Some hope the environmental movement finds lessons in its recent losses.

Tom Steyer, the billionaire investor who has supported past efforts to mobilize climate voters and pass climate initiatives on state ballots, said the lesson of the 2024 election is that the public wants solutions that have immediate economic effects.

“If we want to win, we need a fundamental recalibration,” Mr. Steyer recently wrote on Facebook. “Climate can no longer be a separate cause. It must be the context for making people’s lives better. It has to feel like relief. Like opportunity.” For example, he wrote, clean energy must mean lower electric bills.

When Mr. Trump was elected to a second term, lawyers at environmental groups anticipated he would dial up the pressure. But the speed and intensity of the fight has exceeded their expectations, said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental-law group.

As a result, there has been more deliberate coordination with other environmental groups during President Trump’s second term, Ms. Dillen said. In June, Earthjustice, the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Public Rights Project and Lawyers for Good Government filed a class-action suit on behalf of 350 groups that lost funding under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Earthjustice has opened 96 legal actions against the Trump administration this year, including lawsuits as well as technical comments on proposed regulatory changes. That’s nearly three times the amount it initiated during the first six months of Mr. Trump’s first term.

It has had some wins. On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington ordered the Agriculture Department to reinstate grants for farmers and nonprofits that had been terminated. The groups were represented by Earthjustice and two other legal nonprofits, FarmSTAND and Farmers Justice Center.

Still, environmental groups are facing many challenges, including one major lawsuit, internal disagreements and the threat of being targeted by the Trump administration.

Greenpeace lost a lawsuit in March after being sued over allegations it defamed Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. Kelcy Warren, the company’s chairman, was a major donor to Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign.

His company accused Greenpeace of an “unlawful and violent scheme” to incite demonstrations to stop the project. Greenpeace has maintained that it played a minor role promoting peaceful protest and that its actions were protected by the First Amendment.

Greenpeace now faces the prospect of nearly $670 million in damages if it loses on appeal, with its U.S. arm responsible for the vast majority of that amount. That prospect has led Greenpeace to pursue “voluntary separation” agreements with 22 employees, roughly 20 percent of its head count.

But Sushma Raman, the interim executive director of Greenpeace USA, said donations to the organization have remained strong. She said the group was relying on “the power of our mission, the power of the movement, the power of our supporters to keep focusing ahead.”

The Sierra Club, one of the nation’s oldest environmental groups, has been rocked by a leadership crisis. Ben Jealous, who took over as executive director in 2023, was fired on Monday after a year of tension between Mr. Jealous and local chapters, employees and the organization’s union. Mr. Jealous had inherited a substantial budget deficit when he joined the organization, which has an annual revenue of more than $100 million. The group went through several rounds of layoffs, depressing morale.

Mr. Jealous said he planned to fight the termination.

At the same time, the Sierra Club and three other environmental groups are facing a defamation lawsuit by Exxon Mobil in federal court in Texas.

Through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the Section 25C tax credit provides homeowners with a 30% credit on the installation costs of energy-efficient oil boilers and furnaces, capped at $600 per item, for units installed between Jan. 1, 2023, and Dec. 31, 2025.

To qualify, oil boilers and furnaces must be rated by the manufacturer for use with fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel, renewable diesel and meet or exceed 2021 ENERGY STAR efficiency criteria.

Starting in 2025, qualifying units must include a manufacturer-provided Product Identification Number or QM Code on IRS Form 5695 when filing taxes. This credit is applicable to primary or secondary residences in the United States.

“The impending expiration of the 25C tax credit presents a unique window for heating industry professionals to drive demand for high-efficiency boilers and furnaces,” OESP President Bob O’Brien said.

O’Brien encouraged contractors, HVAC companies and fuel suppliers to leverage this incentive in their marketing strategies by:

promoting renewable liquid fuels: Highlight the eligibility of B20-rated – 20% biodiesel – boilers and furnaces, aligning with the industry’s shift toward sustainable liquid fuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel. Emphasize how these systems reduce carbon footprints while meeting stringent efficiency standards;

educating homeowners: Inform homeowners about the $600 tax credit, emphasizing savings on installation costs and long-term energy bill reductions – as much as 25% for high-efficiency systems;

targeting key markets: Collaborate with local utilities for additional rebates, amplifying the financial incentive. Check dsireusa.org for state-specific programs. NORA rebates may be available for oil appliances; and

urgency messaging: Create time-sensitive promotions to encourage homeowners to schedule installations before the Dec. 31 deadline. Highlight that the credit resets annually, allowing multiple upgrades between 2023 and 2025.

To claim their credit, homeowners should:

consult a certified contractor to select a qualifying oil boiler or furnace;

ensure installation is completed by Dec. 31;

retain manufacturer documentation, including the PIN or QM Code, and all receipts;

file IRS Form 5695 with their 2025 federal tax return in 2026, claiming 30% of installation costs up to $600 per unit; and

consult a tax professional for personalized guidance.",https://i0.wp.com/unionnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cropped-favicon-2.jpg?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-16 12:09:10.702010

These asset managers saw the writing on the wall and adjusted their investments aligned with their fiduciary duty to their clients.
Coal decline happened in both public and private coal companies.
Coal companies themselves have noted the decline in prior annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Asset managers have a legal duty to evaluate long-term risks and returns for their clients.","There is a core misunderstanding fueling a recent lawsuit that has made headlines. The Texas attorney general and 10 other GOP attorneys generals have accused some of the nation’s largest asset managers of “colluding” to harm coal companies, making the altogether false claim that the decline of coal is the result of some coordinated political vendetta rather than simple, demonstrable market economics.

With the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission joining the conversation, it’s important to delve into the details and consider market trends over the past few decades.

The simple reality is that coal’s decline in the United States did not start with asset managers or ESG (“environmental, social and governance”) investment policies. It started decades ago with the shale gas revolution, when fracking technology unleashed an abundant, cheap and cleaner-burning alternative. U.S. Energy Information Administration data show that U.S. coal production was 1.127 trillion short tons in 2001, but by 2020 that number declined to 535 billion short tons — its lowest level since 1965.

Natural gas outcompeted coal because it made economic sense — lower operating costs, fewer regulatory burdens and, perhaps most importantly, reduced environmental impact. Add in the drop in the cost of renewables, and coal’s decline was not only inevitable, it was predictable. These asset managers saw the writing on the wall and adjusted their investments aligned with their fiduciary duty to their clients.

This is about economics, not ideology. Business decisions, not politics.

Power utilities, manufacturers and even global markets have made decisions based on price, efficiency and reliability. Coal decline happened in both public and private coal companies. Coal companies themselves have noted the decline in prior annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Capital flows to create a competitive advantage, not political talking points.

What these attorneys general attempt to frame as “coal collusion” is, in fact, a textbook example of fiduciary responsibility and following industry direction.

Asset managers have a legal duty to evaluate long-term risks and returns for their clients. When coal projects increasingly face uncertain demand, regulatory headwinds and operational volatility, choosing to limit exposure is prudent investing. The lawsuit itself notes that coal production increased (incrementally) in 2021, the first year of the supposed “conspiracy.” This further shows the inconsistency of this lawsuit, raising questions about whether this lawsuit is really about coal, or rather about weaponizing an economic trend — a dangerous precedent to set.

We must be honest about what’s happening to coal — and to energy more broadly. Rather than distorting reality for short-term political gain, let’s focus on developing solutions that respect our economic system, support innovation and ensure energy security.

The real conversation we should be having is about ensuring energy abundance through all means. Let’s talk about how to accelerate nuclear energy, streamline permitting for cleaner domestic production, invest in resilient grid infrastructure, and maintain American leadership in next-generation energy technologies. Allowing for a truly “all of the above” energy strategy enables investments in diverse, dependable and secure energy sources.

Climate, energy and market decisions are complex, and intertwined. They deserve meticulous debate. It’s time to refocus the conversation on pragmatism and opportunity — not partisan politicking.

We should all care about America’s energy future, and to best do so, we have to stop pretending market evolution is sabotage. The decline of coal in the United States is simply capitalism doing exactly what conservatives have always trusted it to do: adapt and allocate capital where it best serves growth, stability and prosperity.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/6583687ac36632.92253592-e1714172952923.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 10:00:21.924056

Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.
But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex.","AMES, IOWA — U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Thursday during a visit to Ames National Laboratory that he supports the development and research of clean energy sources — but also said he believes the ending of some federal supports for industries like solar and wind energy has come at the right time.

Several parts of the budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump change clean energy programs created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the flagship legislation of former President Joe Biden. The “big, beautiful” law takes funding out of some of these programs, in addition to ending or phasing out clean energy tax credits, shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects and terminating rebates this year for purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient home upgrades.

Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Advocates for clean energy say Iowa, which has a higher share of wind energy production than other states and hosts a growing solar energy industry, could see higher costs and the loss of new projects, jobs and manufacturing facilities as these federal incentives end.

But Wright told reporters he supported the move to end these incentives, saying the industry has grown enough to be able to compete without the government financial support.

“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said. “… In an early energy producing industry, the government provides subsidies or incentives or whatever to do it. But they’ve been around for 33 years, and I think you’ve seen a mature industry develop. So like with any energy source, it’s got to achieve maturity and compete in the marketplace.”

Wright was joined by members of Iowa’s federal delegation, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, as well as other members of the conservative climate caucus in the U.S. House, Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas.

Ernst said discussions are ongoing with the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on wind projects in Iowa “to make sure that they do qualify for those tax credits.”

“It doesn’t mean our wind energy is going away. It just means that those tax credits will be phased out,” Ernst said. “So I can anticipate that states like Iowa, we will continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines, the solar projects that are there, but we will see less subsidies coming from the federal government.”

Wright also spoke in support of other components of the budget reconciliation law, saying the measure included some changes to permitting that “took some shackles off” on building new energy production infrastructure, as well as for natural resource extraction within the country.

The Ames National Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus, is one of the 17 national laboratories throughout the country that focus on research related to energy production, national security and environmental impact. The Ames lab focuses on issues related to materials science and minerals — areas of research Wright said are vital, as the nation needs to become less dependent on countries like China.

Currently, he said, the U.S. is over-reliant on foreign countries for certain chemicals and minerals that are needed in many energy, technology and medical fields.

Miller-Meeks said bringing the mining of minerals back to the U.S. — as well as setting up more processing and manufacturing industries for these natural resources in the U.S. — would be more environmentally conscious overall, as there are “better labor practices, better environmental practices” in the U.S. than in other countries.

There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.

Wright said while there were cuts made through the budget reconciliation law and other efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to cut costs, he said he does not expect cuts to the National Laboratory system.

“Of course, when I got there, the original idea was, ‘Let’s cut everything, let’s shrink everything,’” Wright said. “We need to shrink our spending of the government. But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future. They’re much smaller dollars than giant corporate subsidies, and they have huge payoffs.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wright.ames_.8.14.1-2048x1536-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 12:07:39.252345

The DOE policy would prevent states from using critical federal funds by limiting reimbursement for key administrative and staffing costs that have long been covered by these federal energy programs. Attorney General James and the coalition argue that by capping certain funding for these programs, DOE is jeopardizing states’ ability to keep them running, which threatens consumers’ access to critical benefits and savings. The attorneys general are to vacate this unlawful cap and restore the legally required reimbursement rates for these essential energy programs.

“New Yorkers count on state energy programs to save money on their bills, prepare homes for extreme weather, and move toward clean, affordable energy,” said Attorney General James. “The Department of Energy’s cuts threaten to pull the rug out from under those efforts. We’re taking them to court to protect the funding that keeps these programs running for families across New York.”

“During the peak of hurricane season, the Trump administration is putting in jeopardy the state’s capacity to plan for the impacts to our gasoline system and take appropriate action to protect New Yorkers and our economy,” said New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris. “This attempt by the U.S. Department of Energy to undermine essential and critical energy planning and emergency response services should not go unchallenged, and I thank Governor Hochul, Attorney General James and their colleagues across the country for taking the decisive and necessary steps to protect and enforce this federal government responsibility.”

For decades, federal law has required agencies like DOE to negotiate agreements with states that set fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run programs. This includes the basic administrative or staffing costs needed to run federally funded programs, known as “indirect” costs, and employee benefits for program staff, known as “fringe” costs. These have never been subject to a cap. On May 8, 2025, DOE announced a new policy that ignores this longstanding practice, capping indirect and employee benefit costs at 10 percent of a project’s total budget, regardless of previously negotiated rates or actual need.

MORE:

If allowed to stand, the cap would strip away the resources states rely on to keep programs operating and ensure federal dollars reach the people they are meant to help. It would force states to make deep cuts to staffing and operations, sharply reducing their ability to deliver energy efficiency rebates, technical assistance, and weatherization services to households and small businesses. Projects to modernize the electric grid, expand renewable energy, and strengthen resilience against extreme weather could be delayed or cancelled. State budgets would face sudden shortfalls, and agencies would be forced to spend more time and money navigating DOE’s new budget rules, leaving fewer resources for direct consumer assistance.

In New York, the damage would be immediate and severe. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) estimates the new cap would slash about $1.6 million from one grant alone, the formula grant, creating an unexpected cost burden the state cannot meet. Last year, NYSERDA was awarded more than $1.8 million for indirect and fringe costs. Under the new policy, that funding would be cut to just $314,000, a fraction of what is needed to perform the work.

MORE:

The SEP award is a major funding source for New York’s energy planning, emergency preparedness, and energy security work. It helps fund 26 staff positions – from administrators to nuclear safety specialists – who develop the State Energy Plan, monitor and respond to fuel supply disruptions, work with federal agencies to protect public safety near nuclear plants, and manage New York’s Strategic Fuel Reserve. This funding also helps the state ensure the state’s energy systems can withstand extreme weather or disasters, determine how electricity prices and market rules are set, and run annual practice drills so the state can respond quickly if the power grid or fuel supply is disrupted. Without full federal support, NYSERDA could be forced to cancel or delay programs that enable the state meet to energy demand while prioritizing affordability.

Attorney General James and the coalition argue that the new policy is unlawful, violating federal regulations that require agencies to honor negotiated indirect cost rates between states and the federal government, mirroring similar caps that federal courts have recently struck down, and also additional federal regulations regarding fringe. The attorneys general emphasize that every court to have ruled on the merits of such blanket limits has found them unlawful, unjustified, and disruptive to essential public programs.

The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate DOE’s new policy and bar implementation of any unlawful reimbursement caps.

Many fiscal conservatives had sought a complete repeal of the clean energy tax credits.
“After much fanfare, Joe Biden’s Inflation ‘Reduction’ Act barely lowered drug prices in the first round of negotiations and actually increased Medicare premiums in the meantime,” said Desai.
The OBBBA included a permanent extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals.
But the bill mostly kept the IRA tax hikes, with some changes, said Will McBride, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.","The legislation was billed as addressing inflation, which at the time was soaring to the highest rates in decades. In reality, it authorized major new spending on initiatives long sought by Democrats. Most notably, it included hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for clean energy programs. Biden touted it as the “most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis.” The bill also included major new healthcare provisions sought by Democrats, and was financed by tax hikes on corporations and investors.

The clean energy provisions of the bill, in particular, have been significantly repealed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 — a major blow to Biden’s legislative legacy.

Other parts of the bill remain, and now appear to be firmly ensconced in federal law, at least for the near term. Here is the full rundown.

Clean energy

The OBBBA repeals more than $500 billion of IRA clean energy tax credits over the next decade, as well as billions for clean energy programs. The spending cuts helped offset other aspects of the Republican bill that add to the deficit, namely tax cuts and new spending on immigration enforcement and defense.

Specifically, the bill eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles as well as up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles. The credits will now conclude at the end of September. The tax credits were intended to boost EV adoption, but the Trump administration has strongly opposed incentives or policies to increase the EV industry.

The bill phased out tax credits for solar and wind energy, requiring projects to begin construction within one year or be operational by 2027 to be eligible for the production or investment tax credit.

The Trump administration has heavily criticized both industries and last month directed the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the termination of the credits. The department issued new stringent regulations on Friday.

Many fiscal conservatives had sought a complete repeal of the clean energy tax credits. That goal was not met. For nuclear power, geothermal power, and hydropower — sources of energy valued by the Trump administration because they can provide “baseload” power that does not vary with the wind or sun — the IRA tax credits were untouched or have a longer phase-out period. The OBBBA also increased subsidies for biofuels.

The OBBBA also further departed from the clean-energy agenda by including provisions to increase domestic oil and gas development by mandating lease sales on federal lands and waters. Specifically, it would require two lease sales in the Gulf of America, formally known as the Gulf of America, and would also mandate quarterly lease sales onshore and sales in Alaska.

Overall, the course of federal energy policy has taken a dramatic turn.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has positioned the federal government to encourage investment in traditional fossil fuel projects,” James Bowe, a partner at King & Spalding who focuses on energy, said via email.

“One result of the [OBBBA] enactment and related changes in federal energy policy has been an upsurge in new natural gas and liquified natural gas project development, the revival of several large natural gas pipeline projects and a rush to develop new gas-fired generating facilities,” he added. “From the federal government’s perspective, renewables are out, and oil, gas and even coal are now back in.”

Drug price negotiation program

The IRA created the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, advancing the long-sought liberal goal of having the government negotiate prices for drugs it purchases.

Although the drug pricing program is hated by the pharmaceutical industry and many conservatives, it has survived. The Trump administration appears to be using the negotiation authority until larger plans for lowering drug costs take shape.

The provision in the IRA gives the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator the authority to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to set the prices for the most expensive prescription medications for the Medicare program that do not have other “bona fide” generics on the market.

Last August, the Biden administration announced the negotiated prices for the 10 drugs selected during the first round of negotiations started in 2023. At the time, CMS estimated the new prices would save the Medicare program $6 billion annually.

Those new prices, for drugs like heart medications Jardiance and Eliquis and Crohn’s Disease drug Stelara, are set to take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

This January, the outgoing Biden CMS announced 15 new drugs up for negotiations with prices to take effect in 2027. That list included the Danish pharmaceutical juggernaut Novo Nordisk’s diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus.

Trump CMS administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz has not yet announced whether the prices for those 15 drugs have been negotiated yet. But, during his Senate confirmation hearing in March, he said that the negotiation program was the law of the land and that he would “defend it and use it.”

The OBBBA did make changes to the program, but only at the margin. It clarified rules for so-called “orphan drugs” that treat one or more rare diseases. These orphan drugs are now fully exempt from the negotiation program, with the intention of encouraging pharmaceutical companies to invest in cures or treatments for rare diseases.

More generally, though, the Trump administration has taken a heavy-handed approach to pressuring drugmakers to lower prices.

In May, Trump signed an executive order seeking to implement the “Most Favored Nation” policy, whereby the government pays prices for drugs that are tied to the prices paid by other countries, in an attempt to rectify the issue of American consumers shouldering the costs of research and development.

If pharmaceutical companies do not voluntarily comply, the executive order gives Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the authority to propose rules and restrictions on manufacturers and imports.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner that the drug pricing reforms are inferior to the Most Favored Nation policy.

“After much fanfare, Joe Biden’s Inflation ‘Reduction’ Act barely lowered drug prices in the first round of negotiations and actually increased Medicare premiums in the meantime,” said Desai. “President Trump is focused on delivering what American patients really want – lower drug prices by ending foreign free loading off of American innovation.”

One major IRA provision that faces an uncertain future is its extension of additional Obamacare premium subsidies. The additional subsidies prevented premiums from rising significantly for many middle-income people who get insurance through the exchanges. If they expire, many families would face higher costs, and the ranks of the uninsured would rise by 3.8 million, a daunting political scenario for Republicans. A permanent expansion, though, would cost the government $383 billion over the next 10 years. Many fiscal conservatives oppose that spending.

Tax hikes

Somewhat surprisingly — given that Republicans have control of the White House, the House, and the Senate — much of the tax hikes in the IRA have survived, although some have been altered or scaled back.

The OBBBA included a permanent extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals. It also enacted new campaign-trail Trump proposals, such as eliminating taxes on tips and ending taxes on overtime pay.

But the bill mostly kept the IRA tax hikes, with some changes, said Will McBride, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.

The IRA created a corporate alternative minimum tax that mandated a 15% minimum tax for large corporations on their “book income” — that is, the income they report to investors, rather than what they report to the IRS. McBride said that the GOP bill only slightly tweaks that provision by providing a bit of a carveout for some companies in the oil and gas sector.

“It’s a very small issue — it’s less than a billion dollars over 10 years — so otherwise, the corporate alternative tax is fully in place,” McBride told the Washington Examiner.

The IRA also imposed a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. That was also untouched by the OBBBA.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

Also, the Republican reconciliation legislation didn’t touch the $80 billion in new IRS funding that was granted by Democrats as part of the IRA. Still, other pieces of legislation have chiseled away at that $80 billion, and the funding is now about half of what it was when the IRA became law.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25105840311601.webp,N,,2025-08-16 12:09:25.955036

For Canada, I’d argue, that means killing the EV mandate and cancelling/trying to claw back as much of the government’s “investments” in EV and EV battery technology and manufacturing as quickly as possible.","Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), recently announced that the EPA will scrap a 2009 Obama-era “Endangerment Finding” that held: “The Administrator finds that the current and projected concentrations of the six key well-mixed greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.”

After its 2009 enactment and 2016 reaffirmation, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, the Endangerment Finding would be the legal rationale to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for cars and light trucks, power plants, and facilities in the oil and gas sector.

There will no doubt be legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision to terminate the finding (as there seemingly is for everything Trump), however in the event that it proceeds (and it likely will), one can expect to see the elimination of a fair number of large-scale environmental regulations that could have ripple effects on the Canadian economy.

From a Canadian perspective, the most important aspect of the repeal is that it will likely lead to the complete withdrawal of the U.S. federal government’s support of vehicle electrification. The Trump administration has already killed electric vehicle (EV) mandates and federal subsidies for the purchase of EVs, but remaining production mandates for car companies (under the guise of EPA fleet fuel-economy standards) are also likely to end, and with that, EV manufacturing and sales will likely plummet. This will leave EVs in the niche they’ve held—novelty items for hobbyists or luxury toys for well-heeled eco-virtue signallers. And California can’t bail this one out—its own authority to set more stringent environmental standards for vehicles emissions has also been terminated, along with its ability to drive the EV revolution forward.

So, policymakers in Canada should shelve (or drop into the round file) any expectation of exporting significant EV-related goods into the U.S. market. At the least, governments should suspend or eliminate Canadian EV sales mandates and “investments” based on an expected U.S. market for such goods, unless governments want to give taxpayers a soaking.

The federal government, and some provincial governments, may choose to continue supporting vehicle electrification within Canada and the creation of export capacity for EV parts and components (such as batteries) outside of the U.S. market for any number of reasons. They might justify this support based on concerns over air quality or GHG emissions. However, the logistics of such endeavours, particularly tech sales out of North America, would be daunting. EV components tend to be heavy, require exotic materials and long costly shipping lines to Europe, Asia and points abroad. And planning to sell EV components to Asia is like preparing to sell ice to the Inuit or carrying coal to Newcastle.

Canada’s vehicle electrification fixation has been dubious from the start, much like the U.S. fixation, due to the vast transport distances, rugged topography, inadequate and unaffordable battery tech and charging capacity, and in some precincts, a great deal of cold weather.

But whether one agrees with the death of the Endangerment Finding or not, a pragmatic observer should recognize that, for the next good while at least, the United States is pulling the plug on North America vehicle electrification and subsequently any expectations of profit from the previous EV regulatory milieu. For Canada, I’d argue, that means killing the EV mandate and cancelling/trying to claw back as much of the government’s “investments” in EV and EV battery technology and manufacturing as quickly as possible.",https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/electric-car-charging-1440-1406257864.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 12:08:57.271961

Under the new tax bill recently passed by Congress, many federal tax credits for clean energy and energy efficient home improvements are being phased out but are still available for a limited time. So you need to move quickly! And the good news is that state-funded rebates and 0% loans continue to be available through Mass Save.

Federal tax credits for home energy efficiency improvements — including weatherization, electrical upgrades, heat pumps, induction stoves, and other energy efficient appliances – will end on December 31, 2025. If you want to cash in on these federal tax credits, contact Mass Save NOW and set up a free home energy assessment (you will need to do this to be eligible for the state rebates and loans). You’ll need to find a contractor — Mass Save has a list of participating contractors, or see Electrify Brookline’s Green Contractors List — and have your project paid for by the end of the year.

Federal tax credits for residential clean energy — installing solar panels for generating electricity or water heating — also expire at the end of 2025. In order for a system to qualify, it will need to be installed by Dec. 31, 2025. Check with your installer to see whether all necessary steps to qualify for the federal tax credit (including any interconnection requirement) would meet that accelerated deadline.

The phase-out of federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits is coming even sooner: September 30, 2025. If your income and chosen vehicle meet the eligibility requirements, you can save up to $7,500 on new EVs or $4000 on used ones. Many dealers offer both federal and state rebates up front at the point of purchase, so check around for the EV you want before the deadline.

For more details on the phase out, see this recent article in the New York Times. For information on EVs, solar panels, and home electrification.

Natural gas exports also push prices higher The soaring price of natural gas is also pushing power prices higher.
The federal government currently spends about $4 billion a year to help low-income families with energy bills.","Ken Thomas woke up this past Wednesday to find the power had gone out at his house in Boca Raton. A text message from his utility said a piece of equipment had failed at 2 a.m. By the time a repair crew showed up eight hours later, the hot, sticky Florida summer was already taking a toll.

""You just don't realize how important your power is until you don't have it,"" says Thomas, a retired air traffic controller. ""In Florida's heat, you just can't live without air conditioning. And this time of year particularly.""

Thomas has invested in energy-saving windows and insulation to keep his house comfortable. But in the heat of the summer, his power bills still top $400 a month.

""It's painful to see that bill when it comes in,"" he says.

Across the country, electricity prices have jumped more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year. That's especially painful during the dog days of summer, when air conditioners are working overtime.

In Pembroke Pines, Fla., Al Salvi's power bill can reach $500 a month.

""There's a lot of seniors down here that are living check to check. They can barely afford prescriptions such as myself,"" says Salvi, who's 63 and uses a wheelchair. ""Now we got to decide whether we're going to pay the electric bill or are we going to buy medication. And it's not fair to us. You're squeezing us between a rock and a hard place.""

Earlier this year, the utility that serves both Thomas and Salvi, Florida Power & Light, applied for a rate increase that would have boosted bills for a typical South Florida resident by about 13% over the next four years.

The AARP launched a petition drive to oppose the rate hike, and quickly gathered tens of thousands of signatures.

""Our members are pretty upset,"" says Zayne Smith, AARP Florida's director of advocacy. ""That's just another way people are getting nickel and dimed out of being able to afford to live here in Florida.""

Last week, Florida Power & Light announced a tentative agreement on rates with commercial and industrial customers. CEO Armando Pimentel said the deal would ensure, ""we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low.""

Details of the new rate proposal have not been made public.

It's not just Florida that's wrestling with high-priced power. Electricity prices have been rising rapidly across the country — thanks to a combination of factors tied to both demand and supply.

Power-hungry AI data centers are one factor driving high prices

Power-hungry data centers have been popping up all over, to serve the boom in artificial intelligence. The Energy Department projects data centers and other commercial customers will use more electricity than households for the first time ever next year. That's a challenge for policymakers, who have to decide how to accommodate that extra demand and who should foot the bill.

""Regulators always play catchup,"" says John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The growth of data centers is far outpacing the response by grid managers, public utility commissions across the country, and they're racing to catch up.""

Natural gas exports also push prices higher

The soaring price of natural gas is also pushing power prices higher. More than 40% of electricity is generated using natural gas. As more gas is exported as liquid natural gas, the competition from foreign customers is driving up the price utilities have to pay here at home.

The Energy Department says the cost of gas used to generate power jumped more than 40% in the first half of this year compared to 2024. Another 17% increase is expected next year.

""Any way you look at it, gas-fired power is expensive,"" Quigley says. ""It's going to be increasingly expensive as natural gas exports increase. The future is to make electricity cheaper and the way to do it is clean energy.""

One in six households already struggles to pay for power

Solar and wind power can be cheaper than gas-fired plants, even without government subsidies. But building new power supplies and the wires to carry it will cost money. And one out of six households already have trouble paying their current electric bills.

""We're not questioning whether the grid needs to be rebuilt,"" says Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which advocates for low-income energy customers. ""We're not questioning whether there needs to be new data centers built. But the problem is, for low income families and people living in poverty, they don't have the ability to pay any more than they're currently paying, without falling even further behind and getting into shut-off situations.""

The federal government currently spends about $4 billion a year to help low-income families with energy bills. But Wolfe says that's not enough to cover rising cooling costs in the summer. And President Trump's proposed budget would end the assistance altogether.

In Boca Raton, Ken Thomas was grateful to have his power restored this week, after about ten hours with no air conditioning. At the same time, he's bracing for his August electric bill.

""I value my utility that I need to stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter,"" he says. ""But I also know that there is a limit to what we can afford to pay.""

Conclusion The Trump Administration's subsidy overhaul has created a fragmented and challenging environment for renewable energy investment.","The Trump Administration's 2025 subsidy overhaul has rewritten the rules of the U.S. renewable energy landscape, creating a policy environment that is both volatile and unevenly distributed. By abruptly ending the 30% residential solar tax credit (Section 25D) and tightening eligibility for commercial solar and wind incentives, the administration has forced a recalibration of project economics, developer strategies, and supply chain dynamics. While the immediate impact has been a contraction in residential solar and a scramble to meet construction deadlines, the long-term implications reveal a market where resilience is not uniform—and where undervalued opportunities may emerge for those who can navigate the new terrain.

The Shifting Economics of Tax Credits

The expiration of Section 25D and the revised rules for Section 48E have created a stark divide between residential and commercial solar. Residential installations, which rely heavily on tax credits for affordability, saw a 13% year-over-year decline in Q1 2025, with California—the nation's largest market—installing its lowest quarterly capacity since 2020. The absence of a phase-out period for residential credits forced a “last-minute rush,” with installers scrambling to meet the December 2025 deadline. This created a surge in short-term demand but left the sector vulnerable to a post-deadline slump.

In contrast, commercial and utility-scale solar projects remain eligible for the 30% ITC until 2026, provided they begin construction by July 4, 2026. This has spurred a “race to build,” with developers prioritizing projects that can demonstrate “physical construction” under the new, stricter definitions. The Treasury Department's revised guidance, which eliminates the 5% safe harbor for most projects, has increased compliance costs and reduced flexibility for smaller developers. Larger firms with capital and supply chain access, however, are better positioned to absorb these costs, creating a winner-takes-all dynamic.

Developer Strategies: Adaptation or Retreat?

The policy shift has forced developers to adopt a dual strategy: accelerate existing projects while pivoting to alternative revenue streams. For example, companies like GreenLancer have expanded their engineering and permitting services to help installers meet tighter deadlines. Others are shifting focus to residential solar in states with robust state-level incentives, such as New York and California, which have introduced programs to offset the loss of federal credits.

However, the broader challenge lies in the FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) rules, which restrict tax credit eligibility for projects with supply chain ties to China or other “covered nations.” This has led to a surge in domestic sourcing for solar panels, inverters, and balance-of-system components. While this could strengthen long-term supply chain resilience, it has also increased costs and delayed timelines. Developers now face a trade-off: prioritize speed to meet tax credit deadlines or invest in domestic supply chains to comply with FEOC rules.

Regional Supply Chains: Winners and Losers

The impact of these policies is unevenly distributed geographically. States in the Midwest and Mountain West, which have historically relied on federal tax credits to attract renewable energy projects, are experiencing a slowdown. For instance, the cancellation of $22 billion in clean energy projects in the first half of 2025—driven by FEOC uncertainty and tariff hikes—has disproportionately affected GOP-held districts, where 16,500 jobs were lost year-to-date.

Conversely, regions with strong domestic manufacturing bases, such as Texas and Georgia, are better positioned to weather the storm. These states have invested in solar panel and battery manufacturing, reducing reliance on foreign imports and aligning with the administration's emphasis on energy independence. The Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) remaining tax credits, such as Section 45X for advanced manufacturing, continue to provide a lifeline for projects that can meet domestic content thresholds.

Identifying Resilient Sub-Sectors

Despite the headwinds, certain sub-sectors and geographies remain attractive for investors:

Utility-Scale Solar and Storage: Projects that can leverage the extended ITC and IRA credits for storage integration are well-positioned. The combination of solar and battery storage offers grid reliability benefits, which are increasingly valued as the administration promotes fossil fuel development.

Domestic Manufacturing: Companies producing solar panels, inverters, and battery components in the U.S. are likely to benefit from FEOC-driven demand for “clean” supply chains. For example, First Solar and Enphase Energy have expanded domestic manufacturing capacity, insulating them from import tariffs.

State-Level Incentives: States like California and New York are stepping in to fill the federal void. California's Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) and New York's Clean Energy Fund offer tax-like rebates for residential and commercial solar, creating a buffer for developers.

Hydrogen and Nuclear: While not directly tied to the 2025 tax credit changes, the administration's push for energy independence has spurred interest in hydrogen and nuclear as alternatives to wind and solar. These sectors, though capital-intensive, could see long-term growth if policy support shifts further.

Investment Advice: Navigating the Policy Maze

For investors, the key is to balance short-term volatility with long-term resilience. Here are three actionable strategies:

Target Undervalued Commercial Solar Firms: Companies like NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable Partners, which focus on utility-scale projects, are better insulated from the residential sector's downturn. Their ability to leverage extended ITCs and IRA credits makes them attractive despite near-term headwinds.

Invest in Domestic Supply Chain Players: Firms like SunPower and Tesla's Gigafactory, which are scaling U.S.-based manufacturing, are likely to benefit from FEOC-driven demand. These companies may trade at a discount due to short-term policy uncertainty but offer strong long-term growth potential.

Diversify into State-Level Opportunities: Investors should monitor state-level incentives, particularly in California and New York, where policy continuity provides a buffer against federal shifts. These markets may offer higher returns as developers pivot to state-backed programs.

Conclusion

The Trump Administration's subsidy overhaul has created a fragmented and challenging environment for renewable energy investment. Yet, within this disruption lie opportunities for those who can adapt to the new rules. By focusing on utility-scale projects, domestic manufacturing, and state-level incentives, investors can position themselves to capitalize on a sector that remains critical to the U.S. energy transition—even as policy priorities shift. The key is to remain agile, prioritize resilience over short-term gains, and recognize that the most undervalued opportunities often emerge in the wake of regulatory upheaval.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-16 12:09:30.464906

Duke Energy Carolinas, which covers the Triad, and Duke Energy Progress have operated as separate subsidiaries since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

Duke Energy Carolinas serves 2.9 million residential, commercial and industrial customers largely in the western part of the state. Duke Energy Progress serves 1.8 million customers, primarily in the eastern part of the state, including Raleigh.

The utilities said in a joint news release that merging could save customers between $1.6 billion and $3.2 billion through 2038.

If the merger is approved by the N.C. Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the utilities said, “no bill or service changes would occur to retail rates before 2027.”

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, chief executive of Duke Energy Carolinas.

The utilities said in a news release that a merger would serve to “modernize its infrastructure to meet the Carolinas’ growing energy needs, while ensuring customers continue to have reliable service at the lowest reasonable cost.”

“It would result in more efficient planning across the utilities’ combined 52,000-square-mile service area in the Carolinas, avoid redundant investments, improve grid reliability and more.”

That includes “operating existing resources more cost-effectively by running fewer and less expensive units, using less fuel, and reducing unit cycling on and off, saving maintenance costs.”

Is a merger really good for customers?

NC WARN Executive Director Jim Warren was skeptical of Duke’s claims regarding customer savings.

“A joining of utilities like this should produce some efficiencies and save customers money, but that’s not How Duke Energy‘s business model works,” he said. “It relies on maximizing the investment of customer dollars in giant capital projects, which leads to higher rates and profits. All of which is supported or enabled by the corporations capture of state politicians and regulators of both major political parties over the many years.”

Warren added, “Thus, any efficiencies of the merger will be dwarfed by the tens of billions Duke proposes to invest in unnecessary power plants, even while the executives continue to suppress renewable energy solutions. So, the corporation will remain one of the worst climate polluters in the entire world, which is tragic.”

Michael Walden, a retired economics professor at N.C. State University, said the merger “should increase efficiencies, although at least some of the savings likely will come from eliminating some positions.”

On July 29, the Republican-controlled General Assembly overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of Senate Bill 266, the Power Bill Reduction Act.

The bill repealed the state’s previously mandated interim emissions reduction target that Duke Energy was required to meet by 2030.

Stein vetoed SB266 on July 2, citing the need for the state to diversify its energy portfolio and avoid overreliance on natural gas and its “volatile” fuel markets.

Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, said after the successful veto override vote that Stein’s veto of SB266 “lay bare his priorities ... radical Green New Deal schemes to drive up your energy bills.”

The votes sparked strong reactions from environmental and clean energy groups.

Zach Amittay, Southeast Advocate for E2, calling the bill a “major mistake” by the state legislature, while Dan Crawford of the N.C. League of Conservation Voters said lawmakers “chose to reward corporate greed.”

“By overriding the governor’s veto, they handed Duke Energy a blank check — one that North Carolinians will be forced to pay.” Crawford said in a press release.

“This decision has nothing to do with keeping the lights on — and everything to do with padding the pockets of corporate polluters. Truly a dark day for N.C. ratepayers.”

Berger’s statement reiterated that SB266 will save North Carolinians $15 billion — an assertion repeatedly touted by Senate Republicans.

However, their claims do not align with research conducted at North Carolina State University and BW Research, which found that repealing the 2030 carbon target could lead to $23 billion in additional fuel costs for households through 2050 and 304,200 fewer job-years between 2030 and 2035.

The California Air Resources Board is continuing to enforce “stringent emission standards” for trucks despite President Donald Trump’s congressional resolutions in June invalidating the Environmental Protection Agency’s preemption waivers for the state's two standards on emissions for trucks.

Therefore, the Department of Justice filed a complaint against the California Air Resources Board in the Northern District of Illinois on Wednesday as well as in the Eastern District of California on Thursday.

The complaints were filed with motions to intervene and join previous plaintiffs in litigation against California in the two courts.

The Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division claims the Clean Air Act prohibits the California Air Resources Board from enforcing regulations granted under the EPA’s waivers. That is because the Clean Air Act prevents states from enforcing regulations on vehicle emissions unless the EPA grants the state a preemption waiver.

The division also said Trump’s decision in June was part of his commitment to “end the electric vehicle mandate, level the regulatory playing field and promote consumer choice in motor vehicles.""

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division said in a press release Friday. “President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions. The California Air Resources Board must respect the democratic process and stop enforcing unlawful standards.”

The California Air Resources Board is trying to find a way around its prohibition by enforcing the emission standards through the Clean Truck Partnership.

The complaint in the Eastern District of California was filed by four truck manufacturers: Daimler Truck North America, Paccar Inc., International Motors and Volvo Group North America.

International Motors said in a press release Monday, original equipment manufacturers — companies that sell parts to other companies that need them to build their products – are being asked to meet “conflicting mandates,” which in turn is affecting International Motors' ability to produce and deliver vehicles to its customers.

“We are asking the courts for a swift resolution so we can continue providing the dependable solutions our customers count on every day, including the S13 Integrated Powertrain, which offers a fuel economy-leading powertrain option capable of achieving low NOx,” International Motors said.

But more charging stations are needed and initiatives like the NEVI program play an important role in the buildout, he said.
The Sierra Club was less impressed, and said the new guidance adds nothing except time to build out the nation’s EV charging network.","Dive Brief:

The U.S. Department of Transportation on Monday revived the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program, which it suspended in February pending a review of implementation policies and funding guidance.

NEVI was included in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed by Congress in 2021 and required states to develop EV charging infrastructure plans in order to access funds to install charging stations.

The new guidance for states to access the charging funds cuts red tape and waste, DOT officials said. EV advocates cheered the “greater flexibility” for states and “regulatory certainty” around funding rollouts. The Sierra Club, however, said the Trump administration is “still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging.”

Dive Insight:

The DOT’s guidance follows a U.S. district court preliminary injunction in June that lifted the Trump administration’s NEVI freeze.

The February program hold blocked states from accessing more than $2.5 billion in funds that had already been allocated for 2022–2025, according to the Sierra Club. The June injunction allowed some states to access roughly $1 billion in funding that had been frozen.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.”

The Biden administration developed the NEVI program in an effort to ease range anxiety and facilitate wider adoption of EVs throughout rural and urban areas of the country. The former president had set a goal for half of new U.S. car sales to be electric by 2030.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy added.

The revised guidance requires states to file plans within 30 days. DOT said the new guidance “simplifies” the process by minimizing state plans to statutory and regulatory requirements.

The new guidance allows states to determine appropriate distance between stations along alternative fuel corridors, DOT said. The initial guidance required states to build EV charging stations every 50 miles along alternative fuel corridors.

DOT’s also said its changes minimize requirements for “states to consider electric grid integration and renewable energy” and “eliminates requirements for states to address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.”

EV advocates cheered the guidance and its potential impacts.

“We are encouraged by the Department’s commitment to removing unnecessary barriers and enabling states to advance EV infrastructure projects more efficiently,” Electrification Coalition Executive Director Ben Prochazka said in a statement. “We appreciate the Department’s efforts to streamline the program and provide states with greater flexibility to accelerate the deployment of EV charging infrastructure nationwide.”

Prochazka said the guidance “unlocks projects to move forward,” but added, “we look forward to providing input to improve the program further.”

The number of U.S. public charging connectors has more than doubled since 2021, and 2025 “is projected to be the strongest year yet for EV charging infrastructure expansion,” Zero Emission Transportation Association Executive Director Albert Gore said in a statement. But more charging stations are needed and initiatives like the NEVI program play an important role in the buildout, he said.

“The new interim final guidance provides important regulatory certainty for the companies and state departments of transportation that are implementing this program on the ground,” Gore said.

The Sierra Club was less impressed, and said the new guidance adds nothing except time to build out the nation’s EV charging network.

“It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in a statement. “The guidance only restates requirements already in law, making clear that the real purpose of the Trump administration’s freeze was to try to stall electric vehicle momentum.”

The Trump administration “is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging,” García added. “We will continue to work towards the recovery of nationwide NEVI funding.”

The June preliminary injunction lifted the freeze for some states, but Sierra Club officials say NEVI funds remain frozen for three plaintiffs — the District of Columbia, Vermont, and Minnesota — along with 34 other states and Puerto Rico who were not party to the lawsuit.

THE SAFETY IN ENDANGERMENT: The Trump administration is about to roll back the federal government’s power to regulate climate change, but a former top Biden administration official sees a silver lining for California.

Ann Carlson, a UCLA professor who served as acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under Biden, said the Trump administration’s move to nix the so-called endangerment finding — which the Obama administration issued in 2009 and lays out the legal basis for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases as a threat to human health — could open the door for states to create their own emissions rules for the transportation sector.

While states are preempted from setting vehicle greenhouse gas standards under Massachusetts v. EPA, a 2007 case that affirmed EPA’s authority to regulate those emissions, Carlson said that the federal government getting out of the emissions game would present state leaders with a serious argument that preemption is off the table. That would be especially useful for California, after Congress in June revoked its unique ability to create stricter-than-federal pollution rules.

Carlson spoke with POLITICO about the endangerment finding, the Supreme Court and what electric vehicle policies she wants California to push forward.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

It seems counterintuitive that the Trump administration rolling back EPA’s ability to reduce greenhouse gases could potentially help California regulate its own emissions. Can you explain your thinking?

I would start with the reality that what it looks like when you read the endangerment finding proposal from EPA is that it’s essentially making arguments that greenhouse gases are not air pollutants under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act. That’s the section that regulates vehicle emissions. So if that’s true, then the states presumably are not preempted from regulating greenhouse gases. If you want Massachusetts v. EPA to be overturned, which is essentially what they’re arguing, then you’re basically saying that the Clean Air Act doesn’t cover greenhouse gases, or at least with respect to mobile sources.

How exactly would that help a state like California to develop greenhouse gas rules for vehicles?

One of the arguments that opponents make against California’s special authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate mobile sources is that Section 209, which is the section that both preempts other states and gives California its authority, is really designed to attack air pollution, because historically, that’s been California’s big problem. Los Angeles has the worst air pollution in the country, and that’s really what that provision is about. And so if California is trying to use its authority to regulate greenhouse gases, opponents say that is beyond its scope.

But now, if EPA is in fact arguing that Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which gives it authority to regulate pollution from mobile sources, doesn’t cover greenhouse gases, then states aren’t preempted from regulating them. You could have 50 states potentially regulating greenhouse gases coming out of vehicles.

Do you think that argument would hold up in front of a conservative Supreme Court?

What EPA is doing is squarely putting on a collision course the combination question of whether Massachusetts v. EPA should be overturned and whether states can regulate independently because they’re not preempted. Let’s take power plants as an example. States can regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, because there’s no preemption provision in the Clean Air Act. That’s why California has its cap-and-invest program, for example.

I believe the answer would be that if Section 202 doesn’t cover greenhouse gases, there should be no prohibition on states regulating. Does that mean the Supreme Court would agree with me? Who knows. But it would raise a conundrum for them, because the conservatives on the court have been very reluctant to let EPA regulate greenhouse gases ambitiously.

This seems to be a serious conundrum for the auto industry, which pushed the administration to revoke California’s EV mandate.

It’s not an accident that the industry has not been urging EPA to withdraw the endangerment finding. If you look at who’s aligned with that concept, going back to the first Trump administration, auto companies and the [U.S.] Chamber of Commerce are staying on the sidelines. It’s the oil industry generally that has been arguing in favor of doing this.

Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order after Trump revoked California’s EV mandate, directing state agencies to develop recommendations for maintaining progress. If you were a state regulator, what policies would you advocate for?

Incentives are one way to push. For example, replacing the rollback of the federal tax credits is one possibility. Cities and counties can invest in zero-emission technology and consider things like feebates, where you reward buyers of electric vehicles through lower vehicle license fees. You can use the indirect source rules that require stationary sources that attract a lot of vehicle traffic to ensure that some of those vehicles are low-emission or zero-emission.

All of those sorts of things are, I think, appropriate. I think the harder question is, can you do enough to replace straight regulation? Yeah, right. That’s why this opportunity is potentially interesting. If the endangerment finding is going to go away, maybe California has authority that it didn’t think it had. — AN

WAIT FOR US: The Trump administration is jumping into truck manufacturers’ lawsuit seeking to dissolve a zero-emission sales agreement with California.

The Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division filed the motion to intervene in a Sacramento federal court on Thursday, three days after four truck makers — Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar and Volvo North America — sued to break a 2023 voluntary agreement with the state.

The move is the latest step in the administration’s aggressive effort to dismantle California’s electric vehicle policies, most notably Congress’ June revocation of EPA waivers that allow the state to enforce ZEV mandates. DOJ’s filing, like the industry’s lawsuit, argues that without the waivers, California no longer has the authority to enforce the Clean Truck Partnership, which was negotiated by nine manufacturers and the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement. — AN

ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET: A who’s who of the California wind energy industry, and their regulators, visited Merced County on Thursday to tour the under-construction Gonzaga Ridge Wind Farm.

Just three of the new turbines being installed will produce more power than the 1980s-era installation of 166 turbines that it’s replacing, according to the developer, Scout Clean Energy. In total, its capacity will reach 147.5 megawatts.

“That demonstrates how far the technology has come,” said California Energy Commission Chair David Hochschild as he gazed at the site. “This is what the future looks like.”

Besides the state’s top energy boss, POLITICO also spotted Ignis Energy USA General Manager Pedro Blanquer, Wind Stream Properties co-owner Bob Gates, Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria’s field representative Vanessa Barraza and California Wind Energy Association lobbyist Melissa Cortez. Also in attendance were representatives of Clean Power SF, whose agency has committed to purchasing the power for San Franciscans to use, and the state park system, whose land the installation sits on.

Rows and rows of turbine blades were being stored on the location, a welcome site to Scout Clean Energy CEO Michael Rucker. When his team heard that the Trump administration would be imposing hefty tariffs, they sped to expedite shipping supplies from India, Germany, and Malaysia. The blades, which were manufactured in Turkey, cleared customs one day before Liberation Day, according to Rucker.

“We were lucky,” he said. — NB

BETTER TO BE LUCKY: Warnings that the Trump administration’s Forest Service downsizing could hamper wildfire response efforts haven’t materialized yet, thanks in part to favorable weather conditions in fire-prone parts of the country.

Democratic lawmakers and state officials across the country have warned that the Trump administration is courting disaster by removing about 5,000 Forest Service workers through early retirement and buyout programs, including about 1,600 people with wildland firefighting qualifications.

But decent spring and summer rainfall and cooler temperatures across the West have helped contain wildfires, making existing personnel and resources adequate for ongoing response efforts, POLITICO’s Jordan Wolman reports.

“He’s gotten lucky in a way,” Steve Ellis, a former Forest Service supervisor who now serves as chair of the National Association of Forest Service Retirees, said of Trump. “You’re not really going to look bad until fire gets going and you don’t have enough resources.” — AN, JW

KEEPING THE TAP FLOWING: California can expect to receive steady Colorado River water supplies for the rest of the year, but the situation is getting dicey.

The Interior Department announced Friday that states along the river will continue to get stable supplies, despite the latest projections for the waterway, which show water levels at the two main reservoirs continuing to plummet, POLITICO’s Annie Snider reports.

New projections show Lake Mead at elevation 1,056 feet at the beginning of 2026 — almost 8 feet lower than it was on New Year’s Day 2025 — and Lake Powell at elevation 3,538 feet — 33.5 feet lower than it was on Jan. 1.

But the Trump administration left open the possibility of making mid-year changes to how much water gets released from Lake Powell, and potentially also releasing water from other reservoirs upstream in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah and New Mexico.

The news comes as the administration warns it could develop its own water-sharing rules for Western states if they can’t reach an agreement among themselves. — AN, AS

DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie

Ferrari CEO confirms no plans to abandon ICE technology

Being the Ferrari CEO in the modern car world presents some truly unique challenges for the company.

The marque faces the task of appealing to a newer, younger generation of potential customers.

It also faces the unique and difficult task of adapting to the modern nature of the car world.

The biggest aspect of that adaptation remains the concept of incorporating EVs into its range.

And the Ferrari CEO has now addressed what that electric future could look like for the Italian brand.

Brand CEO Benedetto Vigna has confirmed that Ferrari has no plans to abandon traditional engineering.

This philosophy comes amidst plans for Ferrari to unveil its all-electric SUV in October.

The Ferrari CEO sat down for an interview with Bloomberg’s Italian-language podcast, Quello Che i Soldi Non Dicono.

During the interview, Vigna made clear the delicate balance he is trying to strike between old and new.

“Some would-be customers tell me that they’d only join the Ferrari community if they could buy an electric,” he said.

On the other hand, others have said that, ‘they would never purchase an electric Ferrari.’

Brands face unique challenges in balancing demand

The comments from Vigna come at a particularly challenging time for high-end performance car brands.

Regulatory bodies are constantly pushing for manufacturers to lower emissions further and further.

The problem is that demand for such vehicles is, on the whole, dwindling – especially with high-end brands.

Governments across the globe are also scaling back subsidies and grants for production of EVs.

Mercedes-Benz, for example, has massively scaled back its previous plans for EV models.

Other brands, such as Audi and Lamborghini, have also clearly been watching the market with a keen interest.

Vigna has made it clear how important listening to the customer base is for him.

“Ferrari needs to be able to give customers a unique driving experience regardless of engine propulsion type,” Vigna said. That means traditional, hybrid, and fully electric options,” he said.

Vigna has been the main driving force behind the marque’s gradual move towards hybrid technology.

In fact, the Texas GOP has had years to prioritize such critical disaster-response legislation but has instead refused to engage with hundreds of related proposed bills to better prepare for disasters and ensure more resilience to climate change.

In fact, the only bill ever passed by the Texas Legislature that explicitly references climate change was a 2023 measure aimed at shutting down the adoption of climate policies by municipalities.","Governor Greg Abbott’s first special session is coming to an abrupt end after House Democrats fled the state to protest the Texas GOP’s cynical exploitation of the deadly Fourth of July Hill Country floods to enact redistricting that would, at President Donald Trump’s orders, rig the maps to deliver Republicans up to five new seats. Upon adjournment Friday, Abbott said he will immediately call another special session with the same agenda.

Before decamping to Illinois and other blue states, Democrats argued Abbott’s emergency powers already grant him the ability to unilaterally enact flood relief for the tragedy-stricken Hill Country. In a July 21 letter, House Democrats called on Speaker Dustin Burrows to prioritize flood response before any other business, arguing the GOP is deliberately holding flood relief hostage to Trump’s redistricting plan by putting the maps first on the agenda. Republicans have in turn attacked Democrats for abandoning their posts—and Hill Country flood victims.

In fact, the Texas GOP has had years to prioritize such critical disaster-response legislation but has instead refused to engage with hundreds of related proposed bills to better prepare for disasters and ensure more resilience to climate change. Such bills are once again going ignored as part of a longer pattern of climate-reactive discussions at the Legislature in which Republicans pull their collective fingers out of their ears only to offer piecemeal relief in the aftermath of deadly disaster.

Democratic state Representative Ron Reynolds, for instance, refiled a bill—one he’s carried for several years now—in the first special session aimed at creating a Climate Change Impact Assessment Council to study the impacts and cumulative costs of climate change on the state and measures that would mitigate flooding, erosion, drought, and wildfires. Democratic

Representatives Erin Zwiener and Mary González likewise filed bills in the 89th regular session directing the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Texas State University to undertake similar climate impact studies.

“This effort of some of these bills goes back quite a ways, even back to when Eric Johnson was in the House,” said Public Citizen Texas Director Adrian Shelley, referring to the now-Republican mayor of Dallas who served as a Democrat in the Texas House until 2019. Johnson filed a similar bill as early as 2015 that would have mandated certain state agencies draw up strategic plans every two years to address climate vulnerabilities.

It’s just one example in a long history of bills planning for extreme weather that have been effectively dead on arrival in the Capitol.

“It’s been an open secret in the Legislature for a while that if your bill has the word ‘climate’ in the caption, it’s not getting a hearing,” Shelley said. “That has been true for many sessions.”

The fate of the regular session’s HB 2618, authored by state Representative Rafael Anchía, a Dallas Democrat, underscores Shelley’s point. That bill would have directed several agencies including TCEQ, the Department of Public Safety, the Public Utility Commission, and the Texas A&M Forest Service, among others, to draw up “severe weather” adaptation plans every other year. The word “climate” is absent from the text. Anchía got two Republicans to sign on as joint authors, and the bill passed the House with bipartisan support (though it ultimately died in the Senate).

The word “climate” has also been missing from important disaster-response hearings. The phrase “climate change” did not come up once during the House Investigative Committee on the Panhandle Wildfires hearings near Amarillo last year, nor did it appear in the committee’s final report, which nonetheless noted the especially hot, windy, and dry conditions that fueled the flames that February.

But things may be starting to change—ever so slightly—this time around. The Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, who is tasked with studying state climate impacts, brought up climate change up during his recent testimony before the Senate and House Select Committees on Disaster Preparedness and Flooding in Kerrville in the context of his work with the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) to map trends in extreme rainfall and estimate future risks.

Nielsen-Gammon made several recommendations to the committee, including improving monitoring of air masses arriving from both the Gulf and Mexico, improving coordination among state agencies regarding longer-range forecasts, and partnering with the Texas Division of Emergency Management to develop a real-time weather app. He and other meteorologists from the TWDB hope to form a technical committee to develop the recommendations into legislation for the next regular session.

But other recommendations from the same state agency Nielsen-Gammon is partnering with went ignored—until July 4. TWDB’s first-ever statewide flood plan, adopted in August 2024, outlined at least nine specific legislative proposals, including one to prioritize and expand “funding for implementing flood early warning systems on a regional scale, with emphasis on rural areas.”

That policy recommendation, along with those aimed at maintaining the Flood Infrastructure Fund and improving low-water crossing and dam and levee safety, are largely precautionary and were the product of an intensive outreach process.

Still, as of now, the primary flood response bills in the special session currently address only one of those recommendations: the installation of early-warning systems. The joint committee is working to hone an interoperability and disaster-response bill that largely resembles House Bill 13 from the regular session—which died in the Senate—that would have created a similar interoperability council to administer a statewide disaster-response plan and grant program for counties to build new warning and communications systems.

Beyond that, at least one other bill filed in the first special looked to be directly modeled on the TWDB’s recommendation to authorize counties to collect drainage fees to fund flood mitigation and regulate land for flood management—an issue that has proved central to the July 4 catastrophe, with Camp Mystic being just one of at least 12 camps built in or near hazardous flood areas in unincorporated areas.

A number of other climate mitigation and resilience bills—almost entirely authored by Democrats—went ignored in the regular session and surely would suffer a similar fate in any special session, too.

Those included bills from state Representative Jon Rosenthal that would have eliminated routine flaring at fracked gas wells and directed the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) to implement weatherization rules for fracked gas facilities. Another measure that would have required state agencies and higher educational institutions to lower energy consumption 5% over six years passed the House and died in the Senate.

Other bills took a proactive approach to disaster response, including measures from state Representative Christina Morales, a Houston Democrat, to create an alert system to notify nearby residents of toxic chemical releases from manufacturing facilities. At least four bills were filed with the aim of requiring backup generators at nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

While the GOP-dominated Legislature did approve measures to secure the state’s drought-stricken water supply during the regular session, lawmakers simultaneously passed laws that would supercharge climate impacts by delivering another $5 billion to the Texas Energy Fund to support the building of new fracked gas plants and fast-tracking the permitting process for liquefied natural gas terminals.

Climate justice advocates remain concerned that another bill to bar all political subdivisions from using taxpayer dollars to fund environmental projects—like pollution reduction, and clean air programs—reared its head again in the first special session.

In fact, the only bill ever passed by the Texas Legislature that explicitly references climate change was a 2023 measure aimed at shutting down the adoption of climate policies by municipalities.

“I wish that we could just focus on what is important to Texans. Nobody asked for redistricting,” Public Citizen’s Shelley said. “One man asked for it.”",https://d3l0i86vhnepo5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15153902/texas-floods-kerr-co-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 12:09:35.941389

Rivian's $100 million revenue shortfall is a warning shot: policy resilience is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity.","The electric vehicle (EV) sector, once hailed as a beacon of sustainable innovation, is now grappling with a seismic shift in regulatory winds. Recent policy rollbacks under the Trump administration—ranging from the revocation of the 2009 “endangerment finding” to the elimination of federal EV tax credits—have exposed the fragility of business models reliant on government incentives. Rivian Automotive, a poster child for EV optimism, now faces a $100 million annual revenue shortfall from the phasing out of regulatory credit sales, a vulnerability that underscores broader industry risks. For investors, the lesson is clear: policy resilience and diversified revenue streams are no longer optional—they are existential imperatives.

The Unraveling of Regulatory Tailwinds

The EPA's revocation of the 2009 endangerment finding has crippled the legal foundation for federal emissions standards, while the termination of the $7,500 EV tax credit and the NEVI charging program has left automakers scrambling to fill the void. A Harvard study estimates that these rollbacks could reduce the U.S. EV market share from 48% to 32% by 2030—a 16-point drop that translates to billions in lost revenue. For companies like Rivian, which generated $325 million in 2024 from regulatory credit sales, the impact is existential. The “Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminates fines for noncompliant automakers, has further eroded demand for these credits, slashing Rivian's projected annual profit by $120 million.

Rivian's Credit-Dependent Gamble

Rivian's business model has been a high-stakes bet on regulatory arbitrage. By selling emissions credits to traditional automakers, the company achieved a 100% profit margin on these transactions, effectively monetizing compliance obligations for its peers. However, this strategy was always a house of cards. With the Trump administration's policy shifts, Rivian's Q2 2025 results reveal a net loss of $0.97 per share and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $667 million. The company's reliance on subsidies is stark: its Q2 automotive gross profit was zero, with software and services revenue barely offsetting losses.

Rivian's woes are compounded by its dependence on the $7,500 tax credit, which expired in September 2025. While the company anticipates a Q3 sales surge as consumers rush to qualify for the credit, the long-term outlook is grim. Rivian's adjusted core loss guidance now ranges from $2 billion to $2.25 billion, a 13% increase from earlier forecasts. This volatility highlights a critical flaw in its strategy: it has built a business around temporary policy tailwinds, not sustainable demand.

Peers Diversify, Rivian Stagnates

In contrast, Tesla, General Motors, and Ford have adopted more resilient strategies. Tesla, for instance, has transitioned from credit sales to a diversified revenue model that includes vehicle sales, energy products, and software monetization. In 2024, Tesla earned $1.9 billion from credit sales but now derives 10-15% of its revenue from software and services. Its vertical integration and global Supercharger network further insulate it from policy shocks.

General Motors and Ford, meanwhile, have leveraged their scale to hedge against regulatory uncertainty. GM's $35 billion investment in electrification and autonomous vehicles is paired with a disciplined approach to capital allocation, while Ford's “From America, For America” strategy has boosted margins by focusing on high-demand trucks and performance vehicles. Both companies have also prioritized software-defined platforms and commercial EV services, generating recurring revenue streams less sensitive to policy shifts.

The Urgency of Diversification

The EV sector's survival hinges on its ability to decouple from policy-driven revenue. Rivian's partnership with Volkswagen—a $5.8 billion joint venture—provides liquidity and access to global infrastructure, but it also raises questions about the company's long-term independence. The R2 SUV, priced under $50,000, is a critical pivot, but its success depends on scaling production without subsidies. For investors, the key takeaway is that companies like Tesla and Ford, with diversified revenue streams and operational flexibility, are better positioned to weather regulatory storms.

Investment Implications

For investors, the EV sector is a double-edged sword. While the long-term transition to electrification is inevitable, the path is riddled with policy risks. Rivian's struggles underscore the dangers of over-reliance on regulatory credits—a model that works only as long as the rules remain unchanged. In contrast, Tesla's software monetization and GM's global electrification roadmap offer more durable value.

The data is clear: companies with hybrid ICE-EV strategies, robust charging infrastructure, and diversified revenue streams will outperform in a post-subsidy world. Investors should prioritize firms that are not only building electric vehicles but also creating ecosystems around them—think Tesla's energy division or Ford's Ford Pro services.

Conclusion

The EV sector is at a crossroads. Regulatory rollbacks have exposed the fragility of credit-dependent models, but they've also accelerated the need for innovation. Rivian's $100 million revenue shortfall is a warning shot: policy resilience is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. For investors, the path forward lies in supporting companies that are adapting to a shifting landscape, not clinging to the past. The future of mobility is electric, but its success will depend on how well companies—and their investors—navigate the regulatory headwinds ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-16 08:01:29.853318

Southwest Ledger

The dramatic price increases in electricity across the country can be blamed on multiple factors.

One reason is the cost of natural gas.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that the average natural gas price for electrical generation in the United States in August 2024 was $9.32 per thousand cubic feet. That was more than double the average price in August 2021, which was $4.45 per thousand cubic feet, and was nearly quadruple the price in August 2020, when the national average was $2.50, according to an official with Public Service Co. of Oklahoma.

Another cause is the panoply of machines, vehicles and devices that run on electricity.

Artificial intelligence data centers consume “huge amounts of power,” The Atlantic magazine noted. “Once they’re online, data centers require a lot of electricity, which is helping drive rates up around the country,” Inside Climate News wrote recently.

Also, millions of Americans are plugging their electric cars and hybrids into the grid; recharging their “smart” phones, “smart” watches, iPads and tablets; and powering their toasters, refrigerators, ovens, clocks, washers and dryers, lawn and garden irrigation systems, lawn mowers and weed whackers, and even electric toothbrushes.

Rising temperatures mean more air-conditioning use indoors and battery-powered fans outdoors. Failure to meet this rising demand with adequate supply “results in higher prices.”

Summer demands for electricity across the U.S. set records on two days in the last week of July, when temperatures rose and homeowners and business operators dialed in their thermostats to keep cool.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported last week that hot weather, combined with an underlying trend of demand increases, pushed coincident peak demand for the lower 48 states to a high of 758,053 megawatts on July 28 between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. eastern time, according to the preliminary data in EIA’s Hourly Electric Grid Monitor. The next day, peak demand set another record, reaching 759,180 MW.

The previous record was 745,020 MW set on July 15, 2024.

The EIA forecasts U.S. electricity demand fulfilled by the electric power sector will grow at an annual rate of just over 2% in 2025 and 2026, according to the agency’s Short-Term Energy Outlook. Until 2020, electricity demand was relatively flat. Forecast electricity demand growth is higher in areas with plans for large data centers and manufacturing facilities, such as in Texas and northern Virginia.

Paul Cicio, chairman of the Electricity Transmission Competition Coalition, blames higher electricity bills on increases in power transmission rates.

Monopoly utility companies are exempt from “competitive bidding processes for new transmission lines that keep prices in check,” Cicio asserted. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s policies are “anti-consumer and anti-free market,” he contends.

Because there is little to no competition on transmission projects, consumers “are left paying the price for energy infrastructure,” he said. “With hundreds of billions in new transmission projects planned, this problem will only get worse unless regulators act to protect consumers.”

In the PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest regional transmission organization, power transmission costs have risen as a percentage of the price of electricity from 7% to nearly 28%.

Investment in assets

produces profits

A related matter is utility companies’ investment in long-term infrastructure, such as construction of new power generation facilities or, as in the case of Public Service Co. of Oklahoma, acquisition of an existing power plant.

With the recent approval of state regulators, PSO officially took control of the ‘Green Country’ power plant in Jenks. The $730 million acquisition was endorsed by the Corporation Commission on a 2-1 vote: Commissioners Kim David and Brian Bingman voted aye but Commissioner Todd Hiett voted nay.

An increase in customer utility bills to retire the debt has already begun to appear. “The average residential customer using 1,100 kilowatt-hours per month will see an increase of $7.19 on their total bill,” said Matt Rahn, PSO’s region communications manager. “In 2026 that average impact will drop to $6.47.”

In announcing its takeover, PSO proclaimed that the 795-megawatt natural gas plant “will deliver dependable, cost-effective electricity to homes and businesses across the state” while PSO is “enhancing energy reliability for its customers by becoming the full owner and operator of the Green Country power plant.”

Similarly, Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. recently broke ground on two new power generation units at its Horseshoe Lake Power Plant in Harrah.

OG&E transported massive equipment – including half-million-pound transformers – across 44 miles of Oklahoma County to the Horseshoe Lake Power Plant. The new natural gas units, set to begin operation in late 2026, will replace two aging units at the power plant, providing increased generating capacity and improved reliability.

After arriving in Oklahoma by rail, the huge equipment required a coordinated fleet of heavy haul contractors, safety escorts, and special permits from Oklahoma County to move these super-loads. Crews will transport the remaining equipment – including two 444,000-pound General Electric Vernova natural gas turbines and two 492,000-pound General Electric Vernova generators – in phases throughout June, July, and August. Specialized trailers with 240 tires are needed to transport the generators.

Southwestern Power Co., like PSO a subsidiary of American Electric Power Co., asked Arkansas regulators recently to approve a 27% monthly increase in residential utility bills. SWEPCO said it needs the additional revenue to pay for new power generation operations, including two wind farms, and to recover its expenses on system-wide grid improvements.

Evergy intends to build three natural-gas-fired power plants (two in Kansas and one in Missouri) and two solar farms (one each in Missouri and Kansas). The total cost is expected to exceed $2.75 billion.

Accordingly, Kansas regulators approved a $13 per month rate increase for Evergy Kansas Center customers, to help pay for construction of two 710-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine power plants and a solar farm.

Missouri regulators approved a $13.99% rate hike for Evergy on Jan. 1, 2025. The increase will give the Kansas City-based company nearly $104 million more revenue per year – on top of the $731 million in earnings Evergy recorded in 2023.

A utility’s expenses for salaries, maintenance and fuel are pass-through costs for which the company is prohibited from earning a profit. But infrastructure costs are financed with a mix of debt and equity, and the utility recovers those expenses from its customers via equal payments over the life of the asset.

For example, PSO’s 23-year-old Green Country generating plant at Jenks has an estimated 30-year remaining lifespan; thus, PSO customers will pay for it in 30 annual installments.

Debt can include borrowed money, and equity is money the utility earns from sales of its stock to the public. If equity is used to finance a utility’s assets, the company charges its customers for a percentage of that value.

That percentage is set by state regulators and is known as the “return on equity.” And that is the company’s profit.

Demand spikes as

federal tax breaks

for renewables cut

The timing of the spike in demand for electricity coincided with a surge in renewable energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that 93% of the electricity capacity added to the electric grid this year was attributed to wind, solar, and battery storage.

That trend was expected to accelerate in coming years because of federal tax credits that made building clean power sources less expensive. Previously, companies building wind and solar farms could qualify for a tax credit worth at least 30% of their costs if construction began before 2034.

However, President Trump’s now-enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill” phases out tax credits for solar and wind projects and electric vehicles. Under the new law, construction on those projects will need to start by July 2026 and become fully operational by 2028.",,N,,2025-08-16 08:01:34.286291

“It is unconscionable that utility companies might have sacrificed infrastructure maintenance, public safety and the well-being of our Texas communities for radical ESG and DEI goals,” Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement Friday.

Xcel shares fell as much as 4.5% after the investigation was announced before rebounding and were down 0.16% to $72.23 at 2:03 p.m. in New York.

Xcel has acknowledged that its infrastructure was likely involved in starting the the Smokehouse Creek fire, which charred more than 1 million acres in the Texas Panhandle, destroying ranches and killing thousands of livestock animals and two people. However, the company does not believe it played a role in the Windy Deuce fire.

Climate change has ripened conditions for more frequent and devastating wildfires. Across the US, utilities have been facing mounting pressure to better protect their equipment. And while power companies have been found to cause blazes in recent years, there’s no evidence that’s come because of prioritizing other initiatives.

The attorney general’s offices issued civil investigative demand letters to Xcel, its utility Southwestern Public Service Co. and its contractor Osmose Utilities Services.

Xcel said in a statement that it will work with state officials to better understand the cause of the fires, though the company disputes claims that it acted negligently. Xcel has already paid $123 million in settlement agreements to victims of the Smokehouse fire. An Osmose representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Republican-led states have targeted companies and financial institutions for adopting environmental, social and governance policies, or ESG, that limit business with the firearms or fossil fuels industries. They’ve also criticized diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI.

Texas restricts government work with companies that discriminate against firearms entities or boycott oil and gas companies. The ESG push at investment firms, pension funds and law practices has faded somewhat, partly because of efforts to avoid attacks by President Donald Trump and Republicans.

2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV Sale Figures Offers 315+ mile range, strong practicality, and appealing value for everyday drivers.","Somewhere between the practical wisdom of Detroit engineering and the precision of modern technology, there is a point where a new car stops feeling experimental and starts feeling like a finished product. The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV LT2 has landed squarely there. General Motors, in a move that feels both deliberate and confident, has produced an electric vehicle that meets expectations on paper and exceeds them on the road.

The result, according to a recent Facebook post, is a mid-size crossover that fits naturally into daily life and still invites long-distance travel.

“Early observations after a month with a 2025 Equinox EV LT2 with all the bells and whistles: our previous car was a 2022 Bolt EUV, a car we greatly enjoyed, never had an issue with, and that was our ""bridge"" to a full EV from a Toyota Prius Prime; the Equinox EV drives like a MUCH larger, more ""substantial vehicle, which isn't bad, but quite different; this ""great deal"" car came with Super Cruise, which I never thought was a big deal--it IS a big deal!

We've already taken several trips in the Equinox EV, and it is a pleasure to travel in. The longer range, higher-tech, more judicious way it ""handles"" energy use, and MUCH faster DC charging have all but eliminated my ""range anxiety.""

The Equinox EV came with a sunroof; I've never been a big fan of them--kind of like skylights on a house. To quote late football coach, Woody Hayes: ""Three things can happen, and two of them are bad.""

As one who has owned some of the strangest looking cars ever made (two VW ""beetles,"" one old, and one ""new""; a Dodge Colt Vista; an AMC Pacer; a Karmann Ghia; a Yugo (got me through graduate school the first time); a 2014 Prius; and my current second car is a MINI Cooper convertible), I am liking the more progressive styling of the Equinox EV (ours is Sterling Gray, believe it or not, with a Summit White top).

We have NOT had any of the issues that others have faced (leaking AC drains, electronic control issues, etc.)--yet. We are fortunate to have a solid Chevrolet dealer nearby, if we do.

Will keep yinz posted on how this goes, going forward. Good luck to all of you Equinox EV siblings out there!”

The jump from a Bolt EUV to the Equinox EV represents more than just an upgrade in size and equipment.

It reflects a step into a segment where electric crossovers are expected to compete head-to-head with established gasoline models, not just fill a niche for early adopters. Sterling’s comments about the car’s “substantial” feel reflect the difference between a small hatchback platform and the Ultium-based chassis of a purpose-built SUV.

2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV Cost

Starting around $33,600, qualifies for the full $7,500 federal tax credit, pushing the effective price below $30,000 for many buyers.

A test unit averaged 3.5 mi/kWh, climbing to 3.8 mi/kWh in warmer conditions on a 351-mile drive.

Named MotorWeek’s 2025 Drivers’ Choice “Best of the Year”, reinforcing its strong value proposition.

One owner clocked 450 miles per charge using drafting and tailwinds, achieving 4.1 mi/kWh.

Super Cruise emerges as the defining surprise in his ownership story. Initially dismissed as a novelty, it has become the feature that changes the character of long-distance travel. Hands-free highway driving under full supervision turns interstate stretches into manageable, even relaxing, portions of a trip. Other Equinox EV owners echo that sentiment, crediting the system with reducing fatigue and making multi-state drives more approachable.

Range and charging performance form the second half of that transformation. With an EPA-rated range exceeding 300 miles in certain trims and DC fast-charging capability that restores significant range in less than 20 minutes, the Equinox EV reduces the kind of uncertainty that once defined electric travel.

Is Range Anxiety Real?

Sterling’s comment about his “range anxiety” being eliminated is supported by reports from other owners who note consistent charging speeds and effective battery preconditioning before arriving at high-output stations.

Design has also played a role in the car’s reception. Sterling’s Sterling Gray body with a Summit White roof drew positive feedback for balancing modern proportions with restrained detailing.

Compared to the Bolt EUV’s upright hatchback stance, the Equinox EV presents a broader, more planted silhouette. Owners describe it as contemporary without excess, a difficult balance in a market where crossover styling often leans toward safe anonymity or overstatement.

2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV Sale Figures

Offers 315+ mile range, strong practicality, and appealing value for everyday drivers.

GM’s best-selling EV in its first year; 28,874 units sold in the U.S. in 2024, accounting for 41% of GM EV sales in Q4.

Starting prices near $33,600, 319-mile EPA range, spacious cabin (57.2 cu ft cargo), one-pedal driving, Super Cruise, 11.5 kW onboard charging, and fast DC charging up to 150 kW.

Perhaps most telling is the absence of trouble. While early production runs of any new model can bring minor defects,

Sterling has yet to encounter any of the leaking drains or software issues that a few others have reported with their Equinox EV.

Whether this is the result of improved assembly quality or a measure of good fortune, the effect is the same: confidence. That reliability, coupled with a supportive dealer network, is what turns a promising vehicle into a dependable one.

Sterling’s progression from hybrid to plug-in hybrid to full battery electric mirrors the broader market’s path over the past decade.

In California, three places have already ...","Hayley Smith, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-08-16/trumps-epa-polluters-exemptions-via-email-three-facilities-approved,"So far, three facilities in California have applied for and received approval.
The rule from which they are seeking relief applies to a chemical known as ethylene oxide, or EtO, which is commonly used to sterilize medical devices that can’t be cleaned using steam or radiation.
By comparison, one of the largest ethylene oxide emitters in the country, the Union Carbide plant in Louisiana, emitted 6,894 lbs.
In 2022, the South Coast Air Quality Management District issued violation notices for improperly handling ethylene oxide to Sterigenics and another company called Parter Medical Products in Carson for improper handling of ethylene oxide.
Thinking nationally, this is just one of eight rules for which the EPA has recently offered exemptions via email.","Three industrial facilities in California have received exemptions from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to emit a carcinogenic chemical after the Trump administration invited large emitters to bypass key provisions of the Clean Air Act by simply sending an email.

The EPA in March announced that it would allow large stationary sources of air pollution — that is, sources that aren’t vehicles — to apply for an exemption that would enable them to avoid regulations that limit hazardous emissions. The provision in question applies to the regulation of nearly 200 pollutants, including mercury, arsenic, benzene and formaldehyde.

The nation’s top environmental agency said the exemptions could be granted under the president’s authority “if the technology to implement the standard is not available and it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.” Environmental groups were outraged by the announcement — dubbing the email offer as an “inbox from hell.”

As of publication, at least 340 facilities nationwide have received or applied for exemptions from the EPA, including 87 in Texas, 51 in Louisiana and 18 in Pennsylvania, according to a tracker created by the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund.

So far, three facilities in California have applied for and received approval. All three belong to Sterigenics, a company that provides industrial sterilization technology for medical devices and other commercial products at two locations in Los Angeles and one in San Bernardino County.

The rule from which they are seeking relief applies to a chemical known as ethylene oxide, or EtO, which is commonly used to sterilize medical devices that can’t be cleaned using steam or radiation. An estimated 50% of sterile medical devices in the U.S. are treated with EtO. The colorless gas is also used to make chemicals found in products such as antifreeze, detergents, plastics and adhesives.

Yet the EPA’s own website notes that short-term exposure to EtO by inhalation can cause adverse health effects including headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, respiratory irritation, gastrointestinal distress and vomiting.

Long-term exposure is even worse, with the EPA website noting that “EtO is a human carcinogen. It causes cancer in humans.”

Specifically, chronic exposure to ethylene oxide over many years increases the risk of cancers of the white blood cells, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as breast cancer, according to the EPA. Children are particularly susceptible to its health risks.

Granting exemptions for such emissions is “something we should all be concerned about,” said Will Barrett, assistant vice president for nationwide clean air policy at the American Lung Assn.

“The public counts on these types of protections to ensure that their families are limiting their exposures to cancer-causing and other health risk-inducing pollutants,” Barrett said. “And to the extent that these exemption requests are allowed to undermine that, or to delay and continue the pollution that people are being exposed to — that can have deadly consequences.”

The Biden administration took steps to strengthen regulations for ethylene oxide under its amended air toxics standards in 2024, designed to reduce the amount of EtO released from commercial sterilizers by 90% and lessen the hazards for nearby communities.

The Trump administration instead argued those regulations place “severe burdens on commercial sterilization facilities,” and risk making sterile medical devices unavailable to patients who need them.

“The continued utilization of ethylene oxide by commercial sterilization facilities is essential to ensuring that our Nation provides its sick and injured with the best outcomes possible — an objective that is at the forefront of the Federal Government’s responsibility to the American people,” Trump wrote in a July executive order.

Trump in that same order listed nearly 40 facilities receiving exemptions from EtO compliance deadlines for two years, including the Southern California plants belonging to Sterigenics, one in Ontario, and two across the street from each other in Vernon.

In a statement, a Sterigenics spokesperson said the company “remains committed to operating safe facilities that protect patients, employees and communities.”

“The company has proactively implemented additional enhancements to further reduce already negligible levels of EtO emissions,” the statement said. “This extension to the timeline will allow Sterigenics to continue to make thoughtful, proactive investments and focus resources on ensuring stable, reliable compliance.”

According to public data, the two Sterigenics plants in Vernon released a combined 78 lbs of ethylene oxide emissions in 2024, while the one in Ontario released 612 lbs. By comparison, one of the largest ethylene oxide emitters in the country, the Union Carbide plant in Louisiana, emitted 6,894 lbs. in 2024. The federal government also granted that facility an exemption.

This is not the first time Sterigenics has faced scrutiny. In 2022, the South Coast Air Quality Management District issued violation notices for improperly handling ethylene oxide to Sterigenics and another company called Parter Medical Products in Carson for improper handling of ethylene oxide.

Biden’s standards are set to go into effect in mid-2026. The Trump administration has said one reason it is issuing these exemptions is that the technology to implement these stricter standards “does not exist.”

But the Biden administration would not have finalized the rules if such technology were not available, according to Ellen Robo, senior manager of clean air policy and analytics at the Environmental Defense Fund, who helped create the tracker.

“The standards that are now being ignored by these exemptions were carefully considered,” Robo said. “And with this arbitrary designation, they are being allowed to pollute in these communities with very little notice.”

Robo said at least 10 more sterilization plants in California are governed by the ethylene oxide standards, and it’s likely that they have also applied for an exemption. They are located in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, Sacramento and Marin counties.

Thinking nationally, this is just one of eight rules for which the EPA has recently offered exemptions via email. The others include rules governing mercury and air toxics; polymers and resins; rubber tires; copper smelting; and coal power, among others.

“These are things that cause cancer, cause developmental delays in children and babies,” Robo said. “These are many of the most toxic pollutants.”

The EPA’s exemption template asked applicants to explain why they can’t currently meet the emissions reduction goals and why an extension is in the national security interests of the country. The EPA said an email alone doesn’t guarantee an exemption but that the president “will make a decision on the merits.” The two-year exemptions can potentially be renewed, the agency said.

While California so far has been granted fewer exemptions than some other states, it also has consistently ranked as one of the worst states for air quality in the nation, said Barrett of the American Lung Assn.

The group’s most recent annual “State of the Air” report ranked San Bernardino as the nation’s most polluted county for ozone and particle pollution, while Los Angeles has been ranked the nation’s smoggiest city 25 of the last 26 years.

“For the millions and millions of people — and hundreds of thousands of children — living with asthma and other respiratory illnesses that people are dealing with on a daily basis, any erosion of the clean air protections under the Clean Air Act is a real step backward and a rejection of decades of peer-reviewed scientific literature about the harms of air pollution,” Barrett said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9b46e8b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5272x2768+0+590/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F54%2F27d48a1247d8842108d019cdb5dc%2F1167964-me-commercial-sterilizing-facility-01-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 07:03:14.031625

“People are owed what they’re owed.” President Joe Biden’s climate law created Solar for All as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
It was designed to promote community solar energy in underserved areas, through grants to each state and territory, though some grants went to nonprofits in states whose leaders did not want it.

Power Centers Wind, solar crackdown deepens The Treasury Department tightened the rules Friday for renewable energy projects to qualify for federal tax credits.","Soldier on. Hang it up. Fight.

Those are some of the options that solar energy nonprofits and states are weighing after the Trump administration moved last week to terminate the Biden-era $7 billion Solar for All program.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin argued that July’s passage of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act means the agency lacks both the authority and the money “to keep this boondoggle alive.”

So far, none of the 60 awardees has announced plans to challenge the actions nor to agree to the terminations. But three recipients, granted anonymity to speak about internal discussions, told our Jean Chemnick they’re weighing both options — including whether to accept EPA’s offer for access to money to help wind down their programs.

EPA is “basically trying to make it sound like you’ll never get your funding unless you agree to their terms, and that’s just not correct,” Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, told Jean about EPA’s termination notices. “People are owed what they’re owed.”

President Joe Biden’s climate law created Solar for All as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was designed to promote community solar energy in underserved areas, through grants to each state and territory, though some grants went to nonprofits in states whose leaders did not want it. The awards ranged from $43.5 million to nearly $250 million.

The Trump administration has been trying for months to terminate the other $20 billion of grants in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, but Solar for All had been safe, until Trump’s megabill became law.

Representatives of the three recipients told Jean that some awardees don’t have the money to continue their activities without the federal money. Some can’t even access EPA’s grant portal to cover past outlays.

Duanne Andrade, executive director of the Solar and Energy Loan Fund, which received a $156 million grant to set up a solar revolving loan for Florida, called EPA’s move “disheartening.”

“In Florida, we’re about to see the highest energy rate increase in history,” she told Jean. “And all of this impacts low- and moderate-income people more than anyone. These are the people that are paying more already for capital, for energy, for housing, for everything.”

Senate Democrats enter the fray

Meanwhile, supporters of Solar for All are pushing back on the Trump administration’s justification for terminating the grants.

Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) argued in a Friday letter that the Republican law repealed only unobligated funds. EPA had already obligated the Solar for All money, so it can’t be clawed back, they said, citing statements from congressional Republicans and the Congressional Budget Office.

“Neither CBO nor Republicans understood the repeal and rescission of the GGRF to save anything more than EPA’s unspent oversight dollars,” the Democrats write. “Wishful statutory interpretation on the part of EPA does not enable EPA to cancel lawfully obligated grants.”

Wind, solar crackdown deepens

The Treasury Department tightened the rules Friday for renewable energy projects to qualify for federal tax credits.

The new Treasury Department guidance would undo years of existing practice defining when a solar or wind project has started construction, a key metric that spells out when developers can claim tax credits, Kelsey Tamborrino and James Bikales report.

The guidance comes after Trump ordered Treasury in July to tighten the definition for the start of construction, in an attempt to limit “market distorting subsidies for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources.”

The Treasury rules have been at the center of tug-of-war between Republican moderates and hardliners in recent months, Benjamin Storrow writes. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Curtis of Utah, moderate Republicans, have argued that Treasury should continue to employ the traditional definition for the start of construction, while conservatives like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas have argued for a more stringent definition.

The still-mysterious Empire Wind study

A federal records request by POLITICO’s E&E News returned an almost completely redacted study by the Trump administration that had been used to justify canceling the Empire Wind project off the New York coast earlier this year, Ian M. Stevenson and Mike Soraghan write.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the Biden administration “rushed approval” of the project based on “flawed science.” Construction later restarted, but Interior has repeatedly refused to release the study cited by Burgum.

In the copy of the report, 27 pages were fully blacked out. Interior cited a “deliberative process” privilege that agencies sometimes use.

Plastics treaty negotiations collapse

United Nations talks on a treaty to end plastic pollution collapsed in the early hours of Friday morning, as countries failed to agree on the basic parameters of the text.

The latest setback in discussions followed a 10-day summit in Geneva, Switzerland. After nearly three years of deliberations, it was meant to be the final round of negotiations after previous talks in Busan, South Korea, also failed to yield a deal, Leonie Cater reports.

Most Americans recognize the blue Energy Star logo on the most energy-efficient appliances. The Trump administration wants to eliminate or privatize it. NPR's Jeff Brady reports on its future.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the Energy Star program has saved Americans over a half trillion dollars in energy costs since 1992. That's why supporters, like Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Protection Network - a group of former EPA employees - are defending Energy Star against plans to privatize or eliminate it.

JEREMY SYMONS: It's like sticking a vacuum into the wallets of American families and businesses and sucking cash out for no reason.

BRADY: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, at a May congressional hearing, questioned his own agency's calculations for the money Energy Star saved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE ZELDIN: I would happily and eagerly find out from inside of the agency how they had previously calculated that figure 'cause I anticipate that they're taking credit for a heck of a lot more than they should.

BRADY: NPR asked the EPA if Zeldin has learned more since then. Press secretary Brigit Hirsch said Energy Star's economic benefits remain unclear. But EPA's own staff backed up that half-trillion dollar savings estimate with five pages of technical notes about how the calculations were made.

SAPNA GHEEWALA DOWLA: Energy Star and EPA commonly use conservative, well-established methodologies to calculate the Energy Star savings.

BRADY: Sapna Gheewala Dowla is with the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy. Her group wants more funding for Energy Star, arguing that would save Americans even more money.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: We would love Energy Star to stay at EPA, stay fully funded and stay fully staffed. That is the ideal North Star.

BRADY: Calls for privatizing the program have come mostly from libertarian and conservative groups such as Heritage Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. But at that May hearing, Administrator Zeldin also appeared set on privatizing Energy Star.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ZELDIN: This program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government. And I've actually had multiple entities reach out to EPA over the course of the last few weeks because they want to take over Energy Star.

BRADY: Zeldin did not mention who contacted the EPA. And the agency's spokesperson declined an interview request and wrote in an email, we have nothing more to share at this time. One option for turning Energy Star into a business would be to charge companies to participate. Currently, the government pays those costs. Gheewala Dowla with the Alliance to Save Energy says that's one option.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: Charging for participation would be an interesting and creative solution but could potentially have additional barriers for small manufacturers, for community-based builders or potentially even public sector organizations that do rely on the program but operate on tight margins.

BRADY: Eliminating or privatizing Energy Star also would be disruptive for many in the real estate industry. Energy Star includes a program called Portfolio Manager that helps building owners track energy and water consumption. That information is then used to comply with local conservation regulations. Matt Ellis is the CEO of the real estate technology firm Measurabl.

MATT ELLIS: If there were to be any diminution or dismantling of Energy Star, what we can't do is lose the underlying data.

BRADY: Ellis' company and others are offering services that collect and store that information in case Energy Star goes away. Last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved continued funding for Energy Star. Now the rest of Congress will decide the program's fate in coming months.

""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises.","The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures, that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it.

The Department of Transportation froze the funds in February, and months passed with no indication of when funding would be restarted. A coalition of more than a dozen states sued the federal government, alleging that the administration was violating the law and defying the will of Congress. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements.

Officials made it clear they haven't changed their minds about the merits of funding chargers — but they're acknowledging the separation of powers that give Congress, not the executive branch, authority over spending decisions.

""While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the states' lawsuit against the freeze, said it was ""encouraging"" news that the administration is restarting the program. But, he said, it's not an automatic end to the legal challenge.

""It is promising that we're seeing some responses to our lawsuit and we're seeing some effort to give us the money that Congress has mandated,"" he told NPR. ""We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately.""

Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause.

""It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,"" Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement.

Stripping out requirements

The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers. To access the funds, states had to submit a plan for where and how they would build chargers. Once the plan was approved, each state's department of transportation would work with companies to install chargers, and then get reimbursed by the federal government.

It took more than two years after the law's passage for the first chargers to open to the public. As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project. But after the slow start, the same dataset shows that funding awards were accelerating through 2024 — until the Trump administration hit the brakes.

The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from ""a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy.""

The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. States will no longer be required to engage with rural or underserved communities while planning charger locations. They do not need to direct benefits toward disadvantaged communities. They don't need to demonstrate that they've factored in labor or safety standards, or provided opportunities for minority-owned businesses. They won't need to address evacuations, snow removal or extreme weather in their plans.

Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. States will have more discretion on charger locations.

The DOT didn't respond to NPR's requests for an interview. But in a statement posted on the department's website, Duffy said this new guidance would speed things up. ""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let's cut the waste and do it right,"" he wrote. ""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.""

Mixed reviews from the EV charger world

Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies.

""We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape,"" wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. ""Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs.""

The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was ""encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers.""

""We're optimistic,"" says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. ""They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program."" He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space.

Of course, removing some requirements won't eliminate the need to find locations and contract with builders and pull permits, all of which takes time.

And there's a common refrain in the EV charger world: While people don't mind the changes to the guidance, they are frustrated by the delay and disruption they caused.

Alex Laska of Third Way — who had been sharply critical of the inefficiencies of the Biden program — gave mixed reviews to the Trump administration revisions. He noted that some forms of ""red tape,"" like requirements about the type of charger, remain.

And other requirements have been deleted after states had already completed the work to meet them, meaning it won't actually save any time or effort.

Aside from loosening the requirements on location, the change is ""kind of a nothingburger,"" he says. ""This guidance was not worth holding up the program for, you know, now over half a year.""

Andrew Bennett, the CEO of DRIIVZ, a company that builds software for charging stations, says the freeze disrupted a lot of projects that might have gotten greenlit this year.

In the meantime, while chargers have been built with private money, Bennett says, it's not enough: ""We need about six times more just to keep up.""

Which regions are most affected by the battery recycling feedstock shortage?","The Growing Crisis in Battery Recycling Supply Chains

The lithium-ion battery recycling industry is facing a significant challenge that threatens to undermine its growth potential: a severe shortage of feedstock materials. This crisis is unfolding at a critical juncture in the industry's development, with recycling capacity expanding rapidly while available materials remain scarce. Recyclers across major markets are struggling to secure sufficient battery scrap and end-of-life materials to maintain operations, creating a competitive environment that has fundamentally altered the economics of battery recycling.

""Currently, we have shredding overcapacity in the country, so we [recyclers] are campaigning for the same material and the payables for the feedstock are pretty high,"" explains Anton Popiy, Market Intelligence and Product Manager at Ascend Elements, highlighting the intense competition in the U.S. market.

Key Factors Driving the Shortage

The feedstock shortage stems from several interconnected factors that have created a perfect storm for recyclers:

Delayed end-of-life volumes: The first wave of electric vehicle batteries has not yet reached recycling facilities in significant numbers, creating a gap between recycling capacity and available materials.

Manufacturing shifts: Battery cell production has increasingly concentrated in Asia, particularly China, reducing scrap availability in Western markets.

Production slowdowns: Reduced output at major battery manufacturers has further limited the availability of manufacturing scrap.

Competitive pressure: The rapid expansion of recycling capacity has created fierce competition for limited materials, driving up acquisition costs.

One European recycler noted to Fastmarkets: ""Cells are being made in China, and Europe is an assembly line only. Earlier this year, we had supply from one battery manufacturer, but that has stopped now,"" highlighting the impact of global manufacturing shifts on regional feedstock availability.

How Is the Feedstock Shortage Affecting Different Regions?

The lithium-ion battery recycling feedstock shortage is manifesting differently across global markets, with each region facing unique challenges based on their manufacturing base, regulatory environment, and competitive landscape.

European Market Challenges

European recyclers are particularly hard-hit by the feedstock crisis, with many facilities operating well below capacity. The shortage has fundamentally altered market dynamics, reversing previous arrangements where recyclers received ""gate fees"" to process materials. Now, most must offer competitive payables to secure feedstock, and some are even returning to charging gate fees due to severe supply constraints.

""Because of the lack of scrap available, we now need to take a gate fee again. Low capacity utilization is badly damaging operating margins at European recyclers, because fixed costs are very high and we don't have the volume,"" revealed a European recycler to Fastmarkets in June 2025.

Manufacturing shifts have played a critical role in Europe's feedstock crisis. As battery cell production has increasingly concentrated in Asia, particularly China, European recyclers have lost access to valuable manufacturing scrap. The result is a significant discrepancy between announced recycling capacity and actual operational capacity.

Specific examples illustrate the severity of the situation:

Reduced EV battery output at LG Energy Solution in Wrocław, Poland

Production challenges at Samsung SDI in Göd, Hungary

Uncertainty surrounding Northvolt's Revolt recycling facility, which was notably excluded from Lyten's takeover of remaining Northvolt assets

Asian Market Dynamics

In stark contrast to Europe, Asian markets—particularly South Korea—face a different set of challenges characterized by intense competition for imported materials and compressed margins.

Korean recyclers are aggressively pursuing black mass imports despite challenging economics. They're paying premium prices for feedstock while producing recycled, technical-grade materials that sell at discounted rates due to weak downstream market conditions.

""In terms of supply globally, we are seeing decreasing amounts of black mass produced. Due to competition [with the Southeast Asia market], we couldn't secure enough materials,"" a Korean recycler source told Fastmarkets in July 2025.

Another Korean recycler added: ""Recyclers in Korea are still looking very actively for materials in the global markets, at least to keep their plants running.""

China's recent policy change adds another dimension to the competitive landscape. As of August 1, 2025, China now allows black mass imports, though with strict impurity requirements. This Chinese battery recycling breakthrough creates new opportunities for producers of high-quality materials but also increases competition for already scarce resources.

North American Situation

The U.S. market mirrors global trends, with recycling capacity significantly exceeding available feedstock. Recyclers are ""campaigning for the same material,"" as Anton Popiy from Ascend Elements described it, leading to high payables for limited feedstock.

Despite the challenges, North American recyclers benefit from a growing domestic battery manufacturing base that may eventually provide more consistent access to manufacturing scrap compared to their European counterparts.

What Are the Economic Impacts of the Feedstock Shortage?

The lithium-ion battery recycling feedstock shortage has triggered significant economic ripple effects throughout the recycling value chain, fundamentally altering pricing dynamics and challenging the business models of established recyclers.

Pricing Trends and Market Indicators

The most visible economic impact is seen in black mass payable rates, which have climbed to multi-year highs in key Asian import markets. According to Fastmarkets' weekly assessments, black mass NCM/NCA payable indicators for both nickel and cobalt in South Korea reached 77-83% on August 13, 2025, up from 75-81% week-on-week. This represents the highest level recorded since August 2023.

""Major plants which are running at high capacities – although not many recyclers are able to do that – are willing to pay very competitive payables to attract raw materials,"" explained a Korean recycler source.

Despite the overall increase in black mass values, the payable rates for lithium content have declined significantly. Current assessments show lithium payables at just 0-2%, unchanged week-on-week and equaling the lowest level since pricing began in 2023. This reflects broader weakness in lithium pricing, making lithium recovery less economically attractive for recyclers.

Black Mass Payable Indicators (August 2025)

Metal Payable Range Trend Reference Point Nickel 77-83% ↑ from 75-81% Highest since August 2023 Cobalt 77-83% ↑ from 75-81% Highest since August 2023 Lithium 0-2% → Unchanged Lowest since pricing began

Operational Challenges for Recyclers

The economics of battery recycling are particularly vulnerable to capacity utilization issues due to the high fixed costs associated with these facilities. Without sufficient volume, recyclers struggle to cover their fixed costs, threatening the economic viability of their operations.

This dynamic has created a two-tier market:

Established recyclers with secured feedstock sources are able to maintain reasonable operating margins despite challenging market conditions.

Newer entrants without established supply chains face significant challenges acquiring sufficient materials at economically viable prices.

The quality of processed materials has become increasingly important in this competitive landscape. Companies that can produce high-quality black mass with low impurities can still command premium prices in key Asian markets, creating a quality-driven market segment that remains somewhat insulated from broader supply challenges.

How Are Battery Metal Prices Affecting the Recycling Economics?

The economics of lithium-ion battery recycling are closely tied to underlying battery metal prices, which provide the ultimate value recovery potential from recycled materials. Despite recent price rallies for both cobalt and lithium in 2025, battery metals prices remain significantly lower than they were three years ago, creating additional headwinds for recyclers.

Battery Metal Market Trends

The combination of high feedstock acquisition costs and relatively low output values has squeezed margins throughout the recycling chain. This effect is particularly pronounced in the Korean market, where recyclers are purchasing black mass at elevated prices while selling recycled technical-grade materials at discounted rates due to weak downstream demand.

The value of lithium in black mass has been especially impacted by broader market trends. In the Korean market, lithium's contribution to overall black mass value has decreased substantially over the past year amid weaker lithium pricing, making recycling this key metal less profitable for Korean buyers.

The Quality Premium

In this challenging economic environment, quality has become a key differentiator. Recyclers capable of producing black mass with low impurities and consistent composition can still command premium prices in key import markets such as South Korea. This quality premium helps offset some of the margin pressure created by high feedstock costs and relatively low metal prices.

For many recyclers, focusing on nickel and cobalt recovery has become increasingly important as lithium's contribution to overall economics has diminished. This shift has potential long-term implications for lithium recovery rates and circular economy objectives.

What Solutions Are Emerging to Address the Feedstock Shortage?

As the lithium-ion battery recycling industry grapples with persistent feedstock shortages, innovative companies are developing strategic responses to navigate this challenging landscape and position themselves for long-term success.

Industry Adaptations and Strategic Responses

Diversification of Feedstock Sources

Forward-thinking recyclers are expanding beyond their traditional focus on electric vehicle batteries to capture materials from:

Consumer electronics: Smartphones, laptops, and other portable devices contain valuable battery materials that can supplement automotive feedstock.

Energy storage systems: Grid-scale batteries and residential energy storage systems represent growing sources of potential feedstock.

Industrial applications: Batteries from material handling equipment, power tools, and other industrial applications provide additional feedstock opportunities.

This diversification strategy reduces dependence on automotive battery scrap during this transitional period when end-of-life electric vehicle batteries remain scarce.

Technological Innovations

Innovation is helping recyclers maximize value from limited materials through:

Enhanced pre-treatment processes: More efficient methods for battery disassembly and black mass production increase material recovery rates.

Flexible processing capabilities: Technologies that can handle a wider variety of battery chemistries expand the potential feedstock pool.

Impurity management: Advanced techniques for managing and removing impurities allow recyclers to process lower-grade materials while still producing high-quality outputs.

Companies able to produce black mass with low impurities and good quality can command premium prices in key Asian import markets such as South Korea, offsetting some of the challenges created by high feedstock acquisition costs.

Strategic Partnerships

The industry is increasingly recognizing that vertical integration and strategic partnerships offer potential solutions to feedstock security:

Direct relationships with battery manufacturers: These arrangements can provide more predictable manufacturing scrap flows.

Partnerships with automakers: Direct connections to vehicle end-of-life management ensure priority access to retired battery packs.

Consolidation within the recycling sector: Industry consolidation is beginning, with established players acquiring smaller competitors to secure their feedstock sources.

In Europe, newer post-treatment recyclers are actively seeking experienced talent, including ex-Northvolt staff with knowledge of scaling up recycling operations, to help navigate these challenging market conditions.

What Does the Future Hold for Battery Recycling?

The lithium-ion battery recycling industry is navigating a challenging transition period characterized by feedstock shortages and margin pressures. Looking ahead, several key factors will shape the industry's development and determine which companies successfully emerge from this challenging phase.

Industry Outlook and Projections

Medium-Term Supply Improvements

While the current shortage is acute, several factors point to improving feedstock availability in the coming years:

Maturing EV fleets: The first significant wave of electric vehicles will begin reaching end-of-life status within the next 3-5 years, providing a steadier stream of battery materials.

Manufacturing capacity growth: As battery manufacturing capacity expands globally, the volume of production scrap will increase correspondingly, benefiting recyclers with strong industry connections.

Product design evolution: Next-generation batteries increasingly incorporate design-for-recycling principles, improving material recovery economics.

Despite these positive trends, the transition period may continue to challenge recyclers for several years, particularly those without secured feedstock sources or financial resources to weather the current market conditions.

Regulatory Influences

Evolving regulations will play a crucial role in shaping future recycling dynamics:

Extended producer responsibility requirements: These regulations place greater responsibility on manufacturers for end-of-life management of their products, potentially creating more structured material flows.

Recycled content mandates: Requirements for minimum recycled content in new batteries would create guaranteed demand for recycled materials, potentially improving economics throughout the value chain.

Standardization efforts: Industry and regulatory moves toward greater standardization in battery design could significantly improve recycling economics by simplifying processing requirements.

Market Consolidation

The current challenging market conditions are likely to accelerate consolidation within the recycling industry:

Early-stage recyclers without strong feedstock relationships face significant challenges and may become acquisition targets.

Well-capitalized industry leaders are positioned to expand their market share through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions.

Integration across the value chain will likely increase as battery manufacturers, materials suppliers, and recyclers seek to create more resilient circular supply chains.

Industry Adaptation

The feedstock shortage is forcing the recycling industry to evolve, with several important adaptations emerging:

Increased focus on pre-processing efficiency: Maximizing material recovery from limited feedstock has become crucial to economic viability.

Geographic strategy refinement: Companies are reassessing facility locations to better align with both feedstock availability and output markets.

Business model innovation: New approaches to value sharing between feedstock providers and recyclers are emerging to create more sustainable economic relationships.

These adaptations will help the industry weather the current challenging period while building more resilient operations for the future. Companies pursuing innovative solutions like the Porsche battery recycling initiative are leading the way in developing sustainable approaches to the battery metals investment landscape.

FAQ: Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling Feedstock Shortage

What is causing the current lithium-ion battery recycling feedstock shortage?

The shortage stems from several interconnected factors: slower-than-expected growth in end-of-life battery volumes, reduced manufacturing scrap due to production shifts to Asia (particularly China), and increasing competition among recyclers as capacity has expanded faster than available materials. As one European recycler told Fastmarkets, ""Cells are being made in China, and Europe is an assembly line only,"" highlighting the impact of manufacturing location on scrap availability.

How are recyclers adapting to the feedstock shortage?

Recyclers are implementing various strategies, including paying higher prices for materials, diversifying feedstock sources beyond automotive applications, investing in technologies to process lower-grade materials, and forming strategic partnerships to secure more reliable supply streams. Some recyclers have even returned to charging gate fees for processing materials, reversing the previous trend where they paid to secure feedstock.

When will the feedstock shortage likely improve?

Industry experts anticipate gradual improvement as more electric vehicles reach end-of-life and as battery manufacturing capacity matures in various regions. However, the transition period with limited feedstock availability may continue for several years before supply and demand reach better balance. The first significant wave of electric vehicle batteries is expected to reach recycling facilities within the next 3-5 years.

Which regions are most affected by the battery recycling feedstock shortage?

All major recycling markets are experiencing challenges, but European recyclers appear particularly impacted due to manufacturing shifts to Asia and reduced output at key European battery plants like LG Energy Solution in Wrocław, Poland, and Samsung SDI in Göd, Hungary. Asian markets, especially South Korea, face intense competition for materials, with Korean recyclers ""looking very actively for materials in the global markets, at least to keep their plants running,"" according to industry sources. North American recyclers are dealing with significant overcapacity relative to available feedstock.

How does the feedstock shortage affect the economics of battery recycling?

The shortage has driven up input costs while output values remain constrained by relatively low battery metal prices. This has squeezed margins throughout the recycling chain, with many facilities operating well below capacity and struggling to cover their high fixed costs. According to Fastmarkets assessments, black mass payable indicators for nickel and cobalt have reached 77-83%, the highest levels since August 2023, reflecting the premium recyclers must pay to secure materials. Innovative approaches like the Livium recycling facility solution and investments in battery-grade lithium refinery capacity will be crucial to addressing these economic challenges.

Ted Budd (R-N.C.) applauded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s recent allocation of $409.4 million to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) for public water systems. This funding will improve local drinking water utility infrastructure so systems across the state are better equipped to withstand natural disasters.

“Since Hurricane Helene struck last September, repairing Western North Carolina’s damaged infrastructure to be stronger and more reliable in the future has been a key component of all ongoing recovery efforts as Western North Carolina rebuilds,” said Budd. “I am grateful to President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin for their efforts to ensure North Carolina receives critical grant funding to restructure and reinforce the quality of our water systems, enabling our recovering communities to build more durable infrastructure. This is a step in the right direction to aid reconstruction efforts and mitigate future natural disasters.”

“In February, I visited communities in Asheville to witness firsthand the crucial role drinking water utilities have in responding to natural disasters,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “This funding to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality will help secure the infrastructure of these systems to ensure EPA can fulfill its core mission to protect human health and the environment.”

These funds are part of the 2025 Supplemental Appropriation for Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Hawai’i Wildfires, administered by the State Revolving Fund. The funds may be used to improve drinking water treatment, distribute water, improve the source of water supply, replace or construct finished water storage tanks, and complete other infrastructure projects needed to protect public health through improved drinking water infrastructure.

North Carolina’s other U.S. Senator, Thom Tillis, also commented on the EPA’s funding allocation with a post on social media network X on Tuesday:

“As Western North Carolina continues to recover from Helene, the @EPA’s funding is an important investment in building stronger, more resilient water infrastructure. I appreciate @epaleezeldin’s commitment to supporting our state as we work to rebuild critical infrastructure and make communities whole again,” the post stated.

Rouzer touts Raglan

U.S. Rep. David Rouzer (R-NC7), whose district includes some northern and eastern regions of Robeson County, posted to social media Thursday after visiting Raglan Defense Technology in Wilmington.

“It was great to tour Raglan Defense Technology and see firsthand how their cutting-edge work supports our national defense,” Rouzer said. “In NC-07, they’re building the advanced systems which help keep our service members safe and our country secure. Manufacturing like this is not only the backbone of our economy, but it’s also vital to our defense readiness.”

Raglan engineers mission-critical solutions for defense and intelligence, its website says, building technologically advanced tactical vehicles and tools for all five branches of the U.S. military and other federal agencies.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-08-16 09:31:07+00:00,CBC,Can the ZEV mandate survive political pressure and industry objections? | CBC News,"Aaron Wherry, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/zero-emission-electric-vehicle-analysis-1.7610221,"""We will legalize, into the future, your right to drive a gas or diesel-powered truck or car by repealing the Liberal EV mandate,"" Poilievre said last week, while restating his desire to see a number of Liberal policies repealed.
But that may set up the ZEV mandate as a test of the ability of Mark Carney's government to defend and meaningfully advance climate policy — a test Justin Trudeau's government arguably failed on the carbon tax.
In arguing against the mandate, the auto industry also now points to a recent slump in EV sales in Canada.
""North America is on a little detour right now, but in the rest of the world, EV sales keep on rising.""
Poilievre says he would repeal the ZEV mandate (among other policies).","With the federal carbon tax dead and gone, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has found a new target among the Liberal government's climate policies — the electric vehicle availability standard, otherwise known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate.

""We will legalize, into the future, your right to drive a gas or diesel-powered truck or car by repealing the Liberal EV mandate,"" Poilievre said last week, while restating his desire to see a number of Liberal policies repealed.

In a Conservative fundraising email in June, Poilievre's deputy leader, Melissa Lantsman, put the issue in even more bracing terms, writing that the ""radical Liberals"" were planning to make gas-powered vehicles ""illegal"" and ""force"" people to buy ""expensive"" EVs.

Appealing to supporters in rural areas — where EVs might be less practical at the moment — Lantsman added that ""Liberals in Ottawa and in busy downtown cores think they know better than you.""

On Thursday, Poilievre announced that Conservatives would be launching a ""nationwide campaign"" to stop the mandate.

The Conservative leader is smart enough to know he is pushing against a policy that is already under pressure. But that may set up the ZEV mandate as a test of the ability of Mark Carney's government to defend and meaningfully advance climate policy — a test Justin Trudeau's government arguably failed on the carbon tax.

Whether or not the Charter can be read to give Canadians the ""right"" to own an internal-combustion engine, it's not quite the case that gas-powered vehicles will be made illegal. More specifically, the ZEV mandate establishes a series of escalating light-duty vehicle sales targets for auto manufacturers and importers, starting at 20 per cent in 2026 and reaching 100 per cent in 2035.

Companies have some flexibility if they are unable or unwilling to meet the annual target — they can buy credits from other sellers or invest in charging infrastructure.

The debate over EV policy

Advocates of action to fight climate change have supported mandates as a way to guarantee a predictable supply of EVs and accelerate adoption — British Columbia and Quebec have each had ZEV mandates for several years. But North American automakers have bristled at the prospect of additional regulation and would prefer to stick with less-prescriptive regulations aimed at emissions from passenger vehicles. Though those ""tailpipe"" standards have typically been harmonized with the United States and the Trump administration is currently intent on repealing its regulations.

Automakers have called on Carney's government to change or scrap the mandate. Against the backdrop of a trade war, the government seems willing to hear them out — Industry Minister Mélanie Joly told the Globe and Mail in July that the government was working with industry to ""find what would be that right level.""

In arguing against the mandate, the auto industry also now points to a recent slump in EV sales in Canada. But auto executives themselves have said the recent slump is a ""direct response"" to changes in the rebates offered by federal and provincial governments.

The federal government's EV incentive ended in January, Quebec's incentive was temporarily paused in February and British Columbia halted its rebate program in May. The Carney government has said it's working on a new rebate, but that promise might be pushing prospective buyers to wait.

Joanna Kyriazis, director of public affairs at Clean Energy Canada, says the Liberal government should broadly stay the course with its mandate, but there are compromises it could make. The Liberals could, for instance, build in additional flexabilities or adjust some of the near-term targets. It could even adjust the ultimate target of 2035.

""If this idea of a 100 per cent sales target is really polarizing and really scary to Canadians, then bring it down to 95 per cent — show that there's room for the niche applications or niche situations where in 10 years EVs still might not work,"" Kyriazis says, though adding that she thinks the technology will have advanced enough by then that such an allowance won't be necessary.

Such changes might have the effect of watering down the initial policy without deviating from the larger goal — significantly increasing the use of non-gas-powered vehicles for the sake of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

""[The current sales targets are] in line with where the rest of the world is going,"" Kyriazis argues. ""North America is on a little detour right now, but in the rest of the world, EV sales keep on rising.""

Worldwide, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids accounted for 22 per cent of all new car sales in 2024, according to data from the International Energy Agency. In Canada, according to the IEA, EVs accounted for 17 per cent of all sales (Statistics Canada says it was 14 per cent).

In the U.K. — where a Conservative government introduced a ZEV mandate in 2024, which was then amended by a Labour government — EVs accounted for 28 per cent of all new cars sold last year. In France, they accounted for 24 per cent.

""If you look at jurisdictions that have high levels of EV adoption, it's because they have put in place the conditions to create strong consumer demand. So you have incentives … and you have a much more effective charging infrastructure rollout,"" says Brian Kingston, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.

Beyond the question of which type of regulations make more sense, that argument might make the case for governments putting even more money toward building charging infrastructure, alongside reintroducing rebates for consumers.

The politics of EVs

In the meantime, there will be a political fight — and it will apparently be waged in terms of a culture war. In a video posted in June, Poilievre said the mandate was not about reducing emissions, but about ""imposing elite ideology on the common people.""

The last time a federal climate policy came under this much concentrated pressure, the carbon tax suffered from both the surging inflation that followed the pandemic and the falling popularity of the prime minister who introduced it. The Trudeau government then undercut its own policy with a carve-out aimed at voters in one region of the country.

Appearing before a Senate committee not long after the Trudeau government made that move, Mark Carney said that ""if something is going to be changed, then something at least as good is put in its place. Ideally, if you're going to change something, you put in place something better that still has that credibility and predictability that has the power that drives investment.""

That stated principle might hang over whatever the Carney government is considering now.

Ultimately — for Carney and Poilievre, for Canadians in urban and rural communities — there is the unforgiving math of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.

Canada is currently aiming to reduce its total national emissions by at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The federal government is further aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

The transportation sector accounted for 156.6 megatonnes of emissions in 2023 — 22.6 per cent of Canada's total emissions. Specifically, passenger cars and light trucks for 91.5 megatonnes — 13.2 per cent of the national total.

Poilievre says he would repeal the ZEV mandate (among other policies). But if not a mandate, how would Poilievre reduce and ultimately eliminate those emissions?",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7610543.1755291363!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/tech-autos.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-16 06:01:59.461317

Furthermore, when power companies begin the multi-year process of constructing a new power plant, they tend to overbuild in anticipation of future growth.
Duke Energy again seeking to raise SC power bills Power bills for Duke Energy residential customers in the Upstate could go up, on average, by $10.38 a month in March 2026.
Rates would still be handled differently across state lines, with North Carolina and South Carolina setting those separately under the authority of each state’s regulators.
Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis.","Duke Energy is asking state and federal regulators to approve to a merger of its two utility companies providing power to the Palmetto and Tar Heel states.

To get South Carolina regulators to agree, the utility company proposes shuffling money around between customer groups to prevent potential sticker shock to its electric customers in the Upstate.

Duke’s customers in the Pee Dee and eastern North Carolina pay more per megawatt than customers in the Upstate, Charlotte area and western North Carolina. Merging the companies could result in major hikes for customers in South Carolina’s northwest corner, if they’re asked to pay more for a portion of the East’s more expensive power costs.

So, rather than possibly seeing their bills go down, Duke’s wholesale customers — which include South Carolina’s electric cooperatives — will forgo $55 million annually over five years to keep Upstate bills steady. Meanwhile, North Carolina customers would give up $25 million worth of savings annually over six years, according to filings made with the two states’ utility regulators.

That means the merger itself won’t make rates go up or down, according to the company.

Duke Energy has provided power in the Pee Dee for more than a decade, after buying out Progress Energy. Still, Duke operated the Progress territory as a separate entity, with the company saying in 2012 it would merge the two at a later date.

With the Carolinas continuing to rank among the fastest growing states in the nation, according to U.S. Census data, Duke Energy tells regulators now is the time to bring the two service areas under one umbrella.

The merger would cost about $143 million, according to company filings, which doesn’t detail what that includes. But the company says it could produce about $3.2 billion in cost savings by 2038 by negating the need for additional power generation.

That projection does not mean power bills will go down.

Nearly all of that savings would come from the two territories acting as one, instead of performing legal and regulatory gymnastics to get each area’s customers the power they demand, according to the filings.

Since the Progress buyout, Duke claims to have saved customers across both areas upwards of $1 billion by buying fuel in bulk and sharing power generated at plants across both territories.

“But regulations limit further coordination between the two utilities; only a full combination can unlock additional savings,” according to a company statement.

The 2012 agreement lets the two companies share power back and forth to meet spikes in demand as needed. But they each still have to own and operate their own power sources, enough to keep the lights on in the two territories separately.

Furthermore, when power companies begin the multi-year process of constructing a new power plant, they tend to overbuild in anticipation of future growth. Under its current arrangement, if Duke ends up with extra power in the Pee Dee, it can’t simply put that excess — from a power plant paid for by Pee Dee customers — toward meeting demand in the Upstate, and vice versa.

Merging the two areas into one big territory would change that and make Duke’s overall balance sheet look better to investors by not leaving underutilized power sources on the books, according to Duke Energy.

Federal regulations also require the company to have access to reserve power for emergencies and a strategy for what to do if either area’s largest respective power source goes down. If they joined together, they would need backup plans for just one plant — McGuire Nuclear Station near Charlotte — if the reactor couldn’t operate for whatever reason.

Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027.

The merger is separate from Duke’s earlier requests to increase power rates for all of its 857,000 South Carolina customers.

Duke Energy again seeking to raise SC power bills

Power bills for Duke Energy residential customers in the Upstate could go up, on average, by $10.38 a month in March 2026. In the Pee Dee, residential customers could see a $21.66 monthly hike starting February 2026.

That would bring the bill for a so-called average household in the Upstate to about $154 a month.

Electricity would continue to be more expensive in the Pee Dee. The average bill for households there would rise to roughly $167 in March if the request is approved.

Then, if the merger is approved in 2027, Duke said it would gradually shift the two sets of rates until they are evenly matched.

Rates would still be handled differently across state lines, with North Carolina and South Carolina setting those separately under the authority of each state’s regulators.

The merger and rate hikes come on the heels of a massive new energy law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May.

Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis. Duke has not invoked the new process and has “not yet created a plan as to how and when to use this new tool,” a company spokesman previously told the SC Daily Gazette.

Still, the company highlighted the change as a positive when speaking with investors during its most recent earnings call last week.

At least one group — the South Carolina Policy Council, a think tank that advocates for limited government and free markets — remains skeptical that South Carolinians will benefit.

“They have their own reasons for the merger that are beneficial to them,” said Neil Wolin, a member of the Policy Council’s research team.

But it’s disingenuous to pitch the merger as a benefit and cost savings to customers when they won’t see any of that supposed savings in their utility bills, Wolin said.

“I don’t think South Carolinians are interested in deciphering” the benefits of rate relief amid rate hikes, Wolin continued. “They are getting their electricity bills, and they’re going up. No matter how many times (companies) say rates are going down, they are not. And that is the main issue.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines-1024x6841755299204.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=-Zd0qNZ5,N,,2025-08-16 08:02:32.579679

(AP) — Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That's after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That’s after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina — including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They would all continue to regulate the combined utility.",https://www.wwaytv3.com/content/uploads/2018/02/g/v/Customers_to_pay_higher_Duke_Energy_bill_0_8693809_ver1.0_640_360-e1519590414969.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 12:10:00.752201

Most Americans recognize the blue Energy Star logo on the most energy-efficient appliances. The Trump administration wants to eliminate or privatize it. NPR's Jeff Brady reports on its future.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the Energy Star program has saved Americans over a half trillion dollars in energy costs since 1992. That's why supporters, like Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Protection Network - a group of former EPA employees - are defending Energy Star against plans to privatize or eliminate it.

JEREMY SYMONS: It's like sticking a vacuum into the wallets of American families and businesses and sucking cash out for no reason.

BRADY: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, at a May congressional hearing, questioned his own agency's calculations for the money Energy Star saved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE ZELDIN: I would happily and eagerly find out from inside of the agency how they had previously calculated that figure 'cause I anticipate that they're taking credit for a heck of a lot more than they should.

BRADY: NPR asked the EPA if Zeldin has learned more since then. Press secretary Brigit Hirsch said Energy Star's economic benefits remain unclear. But EPA's own staff backed up that half-trillion dollar savings estimate with five pages of technical notes about how the calculations were made.

SAPNA GHEEWALA DOWLA: Energy Star and EPA commonly use conservative, well-established methodologies to calculate the Energy Star savings.

BRADY: Sapna Gheewala Dowla is with the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy. Her group wants more funding for Energy Star, arguing that would save Americans even more money.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: We would love Energy Star to stay at EPA, stay fully funded and stay fully staffed. That is the ideal North Star.

BRADY: Calls for privatizing the program have come mostly from libertarian and conservative groups such as Heritage Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. But at that May hearing, Administrator Zeldin also appeared set on privatizing Energy Star.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ZELDIN: This program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government. And I've actually had multiple entities reach out to EPA over the course of the last few weeks because they want to take over Energy Star.

BRADY: Zeldin did not mention who contacted the EPA. And the agency's spokesperson declined an interview request and wrote in an email, we have nothing more to share at this time. One option for turning Energy Star into a business would be to charge companies to participate. Currently, the government pays those costs. Gheewala Dowla with the Alliance to Save Energy says that's one option.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: Charging for participation would be an interesting and creative solution but could potentially have additional barriers for small manufacturers, for community-based builders or potentially even public sector organizations that do rely on the program but operate on tight margins.

BRADY: Eliminating or privatizing Energy Star also would be disruptive for many in the real estate industry. Energy Star includes a program called Portfolio Manager that helps building owners track energy and water consumption. That information is then used to comply with local conservation regulations. Matt Ellis is the CEO of the real estate technology firm Measurabl.

MATT ELLIS: If there were to be any diminution or dismantling of Energy Star, what we can't do is lose the underlying data.

BRADY: Ellis' company and others are offering services that collect and store that information in case Energy Star goes away. Last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved continued funding for Energy Star. Now the rest of Congress will decide the program's fate in coming months.

Kelly Armstrong welcomed U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to Grand Forks, touting the state’s role in achieving “U.S. energy dominance” through expanded oil, gas, and coal production.

As both sides continue to advocate for their vision of America’s energy future, North Dakota remains a focal point in the national conversation.

Speaking at a roundtable hosted by Sen. John Hoeven at the University of North Dakota’s Energy & Environmental Research Center, Armstrong said the state is “so much farther ahead than anywhere else in the country” when it comes to balancing energy innovation with reliability.

Key attendees:

Gov. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND)

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright

U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (host) (R-ND)

U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-ND)

Doug Goehring, North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner (R-ND)

Nathan Anderson, Director, North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources

Justin Kringstad, Executive Director, North Dakota Pipeline Authority

Andy Armacost, President, University of North Dakota

The roundtable, dubbed “Cracking the Code 2.0,” included federal and state officials, energy executives, and researchers. Among the topics discussed were enhanced oil recovery using captured carbon dioxide and federal support for the North Plains Connector, a 420-mile transmission line linking the Eastern and Western U.S. electric grids.

“You are not powering a data center or quantum computing or artificial intelligence on wind and solar alone,” Armstrong said. “The models don’t work; the metrics don’t work.”

As AI data centers scale rapidly across the U.S., their energy demands are surging. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, “As of 2023, U.S. data centers consumed approximately 176 TWh, about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity use. That’s more than double the approximately 70 TWh recorded in 2014.” The DOE projects that energy use will grow at a compound annual rate of between 13% and 27% through 2028, driven largely by AI workloads and high-performance computing. These figures underscore the urgency of modernizing infrastructure and integrating energy-efficient technologies as AI reshapes the digital and physical landscape

Armstrong praised the Trump administration’s support for fossil fuels, saying it lifted a “5,000-pound weight off the backs” of energy communities. “We have a chance to change the narrative, with a business economy that is about to figure out they need an energy policy based on reality and not ideology,” he said.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, renewable energy sources like wind and solar reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create jobs. The agency also points to the growing reliability of distributed energy systems and battery storage as tools to stabilize the grid during extreme weather events.

According to a 2021 report from the U.S. Department of Energy, clean energy investments support community resilience, lower energy costs, and expand access to reliable power in underserved areas. The report also highlights the vast renewable energy potential across the country, noting that the U.S. could generate more than 100 times its annual electricity needs through renewable energy sources.

The Environmental Protection Agency echoed those sentiments, noting that sustainable energy investments can lower consumer costs and expand access to underserved communities.",https://www.kxnet.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/03/Subsidizing-Energy.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 13:06:21.866258

New rate structures are enabling new programs for distributed energy resources and demand flexibility, helping customers get engaged by offering compensation for participating in grid management.
But distributed energy resources—solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and smart thermostats— are smaller, and much more flexible.
Engstrom sees dynamic rates and pricing as a solution to this challenge, if current utilities are willing to evolve their current mindset.
“There’s a lot of systems out there that manage the meter to cash business process for utilities,” Engstrom said, referring to traditional billing systems.","Utilities are transforming one of their most fundamental tools—rate design—to tackle the challenges of America’s electricity boom.

What was once primarily a mechanism for collecting revenue has transformed into an ecosystem of sophisticated solutions. New rate structures are enabling new programs for distributed energy resources and demand flexibility, helping customers get engaged by offering compensation for participating in grid management.

Scott Engstrom has watched this transformation unfold from the front lines. As co-founder and chief customer officer at GridX, he’s spent the past decade helping utilities design and implement rates that do more than just collect revenue, but actively shape how and when customers use electricity.

It’s a timely shift in customer engagement and billing, as utilities are facing massive demand growth from electrification and the booming AI economy. Data centers alone accounted for about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023 and are projected to consume between 6.7% and 12% by 2028, with load growth tripling over the past decade. This surge is forcing utilities to rethink fundamental assumptions about how electricity is priced and consumed.

“We believe that end customers have to know more about the cost of energy, and how they use energy impacts utility’s ability to change the energy they supply to their customers,” Engstrom explained during a recent interview on the With Great Power podcast. “Our mission is to help our clients, like utilities, and their customers understand the exact value of their clean energy choices.”

But the industry’s challenge isn’t just growing demand—it’s also the changing nature of resources on the grid.

For example, data centers represent big, consistent loads that need reliable power around the clock. But distributed energy resources—solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and smart thermostats— are smaller, and much more flexible. The challenge is resolving the dichotomy presented by these two trends.

Engstrom sees dynamic rates and pricing as a solution to this challenge, if current utilities are willing to evolve their current mindset.

“There’s a lot of systems out there that manage the meter to cash business process for utilities,” Engstrom said, referring to traditional billing systems. But the emergence of time-of-use rates and distributed energy resources created “the opportunity really to help utilities with a different cycle, which we call the utility product or rate lifecycle.”

This lifecycle approach treats utility rates more like consumer products. They need to be designed, tested, marketed, and continuously optimized. “We did really want to get the utilities to change their mindset and think about themselves as more of a product company,” said Engstrom. “More products and services were going to be needed to meet the kind of decarbonization and electrification goals that they were trying to achieve.”

And this approach can work. One of GridX’ California utility clients leveraged the company’s rates and customer engagement expertise to shave peak load during the 2022 heat waves. “On one of the peak days, customers responded to that price signal in the time of use rates to reduce load by 75 megawatts,” Engstrom said. That was equivalent to the utility’s third largest demand response program.

As demand continues to grow, this kind of customer engagement isn’t just helpful—it’s essential for meeting unprecedented load growth without building massive new infrastructure.

“As more and more customers have put distributed energy resources behind the meter, it just creates a lot more variability on the system,” Engstrom noted. And while traditional demand response programs can be “pretty clunky, expensive to administer,” time-of-use rates “can be a much more simple, elegant solution.”

Engstrom noted that because many customers have flexibility in how they use energy, they would welcome incentives to shift usage when it helps the grid. “If I was a business or a residential customer with an electric vehicle, I’d be happy to take advantage of that opportunity and reduce my utility bill,” he said.

Engstrom sees this flexibility—enabled by smart rate design— as an alternative to building expensive new power plants to meet surging demand. “Demand flexibility and programs and rates that are structured in the right way can deliver a lot of benefits both to the customer and to the utility and the grid,” he said.

Most Americans recognize the blue Energy Star logo on the most energy-efficient appliances. The Trump administration wants to eliminate or privatize it. NPR's Jeff Brady reports on its future.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the Energy Star program has saved Americans over a half trillion dollars in energy costs since 1992. That's why supporters, like Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Protection Network - a group of former EPA employees - are defending Energy Star against plans to privatize or eliminate it.

JEREMY SYMONS: It's like sticking a vacuum into the wallets of American families and businesses and sucking cash out for no reason.

BRADY: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, at a May congressional hearing, questioned his own agency's calculations for the money Energy Star saved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE ZELDIN: I would happily and eagerly find out from inside of the agency how they had previously calculated that figure 'cause I anticipate that they're taking credit for a heck of a lot more than they should.

BRADY: NPR asked the EPA if Zeldin has learned more since then. Press secretary Brigit Hirsch said Energy Star's economic benefits remain unclear. But EPA's own staff backed up that half-trillion dollar savings estimate with five pages of technical notes about how the calculations were made.

SAPNA GHEEWALA DOWLA: Energy Star and EPA commonly use conservative, well-established methodologies to calculate the Energy Star savings.

BRADY: Sapna Gheewala Dowla is with the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy. Her group wants more funding for Energy Star, arguing that would save Americans even more money.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: We would love Energy Star to stay at EPA, stay fully funded and stay fully staffed. That is the ideal North Star.

BRADY: Calls for privatizing the program have come mostly from libertarian and conservative groups such as Heritage Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. But at that May hearing, Administrator Zeldin also appeared set on privatizing Energy Star.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ZELDIN: This program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government. And I've actually had multiple entities reach out to EPA over the course of the last few weeks because they want to take over Energy Star.

BRADY: Zeldin did not mention who contacted the EPA. And the agency's spokesperson declined an interview request and wrote in an email, we have nothing more to share at this time. One option for turning Energy Star into a business would be to charge companies to participate. Currently, the government pays those costs. Gheewala Dowla with the Alliance to Save Energy says that's one option.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: Charging for participation would be an interesting and creative solution but could potentially have additional barriers for small manufacturers, for community-based builders or potentially even public sector organizations that do rely on the program but operate on tight margins.

BRADY: Eliminating or privatizing Energy Star also would be disruptive for many in the real estate industry. Energy Star includes a program called Portfolio Manager that helps building owners track energy and water consumption. That information is then used to comply with local conservation regulations. Matt Ellis is the CEO of the real estate technology firm Measurabl.

MATT ELLIS: If there were to be any diminution or dismantling of Energy Star, what we can't do is lose the underlying data.

BRADY: Ellis' company and others are offering services that collect and store that information in case Energy Star goes away. Last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved continued funding for Energy Star. Now the rest of Congress will decide the program's fate in coming months.

In this rapidly evolving landscape, the merger between Workhorse Group (WKHS) and Motiv Electric Trucks represents a bold, strategic move to consolidate two complementary forces into a single entity poised to dominate the $23 billion medium-duty EV market. For investors, this transaction is not just a merger of companies but a blueprint for creating a scalable, cost-competitive, and financially resilient leader in the commercial EV transition.

Strategic Synergy: Combining Strengths for Market Leadership

Workhorse and Motiv are not strangers to innovation. Workhorse has long been a pioneer in electric delivery vehicles, with a proven manufacturing footprint and a national dealer network. Motiv, meanwhile, has carved out a niche with its diverse product portfolio and deep relationships with top fleets. Together, they form a powerhouse capable of addressing the critical pain points of the medium-duty segment: unit cost, total cost of ownership (TCO), and operational scalability.

The merger's structure—a 62.5% stake for Motiv's controlling investor, 26.5% for Workhorse shareholders, and 11% for Workhorse's existing lender—creates a balanced ownership model that aligns incentives. By leveraging Workhorse's Union City, Indiana plant (with 5,000-unit annual capacity) and Motiv's fleet relationships, the combined entity can achieve economies of scale. This is critical in a market where unit costs must fall to match internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The companies project $20 million in cost synergies by 2026, driven by R&D, G&A, and facility efficiencies.

Financial Resilience: Liquidity, Debt Management, and Capital Structure

The merger's financial architecture is equally compelling. Workhorse's $20 million sale leaseback of its Union City facility and a $5 million convertible note provide immediate liquidity, while post-merger financing (a $20 million debt package including a $10 million revolving credit facility and $10 million asset-based lending) ensures operational flexibility. This simplifies the capital structure, reducing reliance on high-cost debt and creating room for future equity raises.

Critically, the combined company's debt is now largely secured by Motiv's controlling investor, which reduces default risk and frees up cash flow for growth. The $5 million convertible note, which may convert to equity post-merger, further aligns investor interests. For early-stage EV companies, a clean balance sheet is a rare but vital asset—one that Workhorse-Motiv now possesses.

Leadership and Execution: A Proven Management Team

Scott Griffith, Motiv's current CEO, will lead the combined company, bringing a track record of scaling EV startups. Rick Dauch, Workhorse's founder, transitions to an advisory role, ensuring continuity in manufacturing and operational expertise. This leadership mix—visionary strategy paired with hands-on execution—addresses a common weakness in EV ventures: the gap between innovation and commercialization.

The companies also plan to integrate common software, hardware, and IP across their Class 4–6 platforms. This not only reduces development costs but accelerates time-to-market for new models, a critical advantage in a sector where first-movers capture market share.

Market Positioning: Capturing the $23 Billion Opportunity

The medium-duty segment is a $23 billion market, with fleets prioritizing decarbonization and TCO. Workhorse-Motiv's combined portfolio already serves 10 of the largest fleets in North America, positioning them to capitalize on this demand. By achieving cost parity with ICE vehicles—a key goal outlined in the merger—this entity can accelerate adoption, particularly in urban delivery and logistics.

Investment Thesis: A Catalyst for Growth

For investors, the merger is a catalyst. The combined company's simplified capital structure, operational scale, and strategic focus on cost reduction create a compelling value proposition. Early investors benefit from a company with:

- Scalable production (5,000-unit capacity at Union City).

- Proven technology (Workhorse's vehicles have been road-tested for years).

- Strong fleet relationships (Motiv's partnerships with major logistics players).

- Financial discipline (debt reduction and liquidity secured).

The $20 million in projected synergies by 2026 is a conservative estimate. If the combined entity executes on its roadmap, the market could see even greater efficiencies, driving revenue growth and margin expansion.

Risks and Mitigations

No investment is without risk. Regulatory delays, supply chain bottlenecks, and execution risks are inherent in the EV sector. However, Workhorse-Motiv's merger mitigates many of these:

- Regulatory: The transaction requires shareholder approval, not regulatory clearance, reducing complexity.

- Supply Chain: The Union City plant is already operational, avoiding the delays of greenfield projects.

- Execution: A leadership team with complementary skills and a clear integration plan.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future of Transportation

The Workhorse-Motiv merger is more than a financial transaction—it's a strategic repositioning for dominance in the commercial EV transition. By combining strengths, simplifying capital structures, and targeting cost synergies, this entity is uniquely positioned to lead the shift to clean energy. For investors, the opportunity is clear: a company with the scale, technology, and financial resilience to thrive in a $23 billion market.

As the EV industry matures, early movers with strong fundamentals will outperform. Workhorse-Motiv is one such opportunity—offering a rare blend of innovation, execution, and financial discipline. For those willing to bet on the future of transportation, this merger is a compelling catalyst.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-16 05:02:58.716656

Southwest Airlines Sells Renewables Fuels Unit to Conestoga

Biofuel producer Conestoga Energy on Aug. 14 said it has acquired Saffire Renewables from Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures, giving the company access to technology it says is a key feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel production.

Financial details of the deal were not disclosed.

The acquisition includes Saffire’s intellectual property and certain related technologies, a proposed pilot production facility and key leadership team members that include Saffire’s CTO and director of engineering, according to a news release.

Saffire has exclusive license to Deacetylation and Mechanical Refining pretreatment technology developed at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab. The technology converts corn stover into low carbon-intensity (CI) ethanol used for SAF production. Expected to start operations in 2026, the pilot plant will be co-located at Conestoga’s Arkalon Energy plant in Liberal, Kansas.

Conestoga Energy CEO Tom Willis called SAF a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity and said the acquisition positions the company to bridge the supply-demand gap facing the aviation industry.

“The IP acquired in this transaction will provide us with tremendous optionality not only as it relates to SAF feedstock production, but across our operations,” Willis said. “The momentum behind low CI fuels is undeniable, driven by regulatory requirements, corporate commitments, and environmental necessity, and this acquisition is reflective of our commitment to delivering the lowest carbon biofuel solutions while creating new value streams for rural communities across America.”

As stated in the news release, Saffire’s proprietary process converts agricultural feedstocks into low-carbon intermediates for multiple end products. The technology operates at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure using standard industry equipment.

“Notably, the acquisition of Saffire will unlock attractive improvements to the economics of a wide range of existing Conestoga technologies and processes,” the release said.

CIP Snaps Up EDF’s Beehive BESS in Arizona

Private-equity fund Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) on Aug. 15 said it has acquired the 1 gigawatt-hour (GWh) Beehive battery energy storage system in Arizona from EDF Power Solutions North America.

CIP, which will manage project construction when it begins, said Beehive is expected to begin commercial operations in the first half of 2026. It has a 20-year tolling agreement in place with Arizona Public Service Co.

“With electricity demand rapidly increasing in the Southwest, we anticipate battery storage will play a critical role in powering innovation and economic growth,” said Tim Evans, partner and head of North America at CIP. “Beehive will provide reliable energy and grid services to customers in Arizona and build on CIP’s track record of developing, constructing, and operating energy infrastructure investments across the country.”

The project was acquired through CIP’s CI V flagship fund, which reached final close in March and exceeded its $14 billion target.

Located in Maricopa County, Arizona, Beehive sits on about 22 acres. The 25-megawatt (MW) system will serve approximately 1.4 million homes and businesses, according to EDF.

Thyssenkrupp Nucera Abandons US Green Hydrogen Projects No Longer Deemed Feasible

Thyssenkrupp Nucera is in intensive discussions with stakeholders in its U.S. projects and is abandoning those no longer deemed feasible due to tax and spending changes initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump, its CEO said Aug 13.

Global demand for green hydrogen had stalled amid concern among clean-tech players over what Trump’s policies would mean for the industry.

But Thyssenkrupp Nucera’s CEO Werner Ponikwar said the company had more clarity around the financial viability of U.S. projects after the enactment of U.S. legislation that eliminated some tax credits for low-carbon energy sources.

“We have sorted out all projects that have less chance of being realized due to the new framework conditions in the U.S.,” Ponikwar said in a call with journalists after the company reported results.

Trump’s sweeping spending and tax legislation has made it harder to develop green tech projects in the U.S. by effectively phasing out renewable energy tax credits after 2026 if projects have not started construction.

Ponikwar said that with projects still expected to receive funding if they start construction work before a revised end of 2027 deadline, Thyssenkrupp Nucera will be able to advance state-side projects, especially those in advanced stages.

“We are convinced that the hydrogen electrolysis market continues to offer enormous potential,” Ponikwar said, while adding that the company needs to be more patient than initially hoped.

If U.S. projects do not come to fruition, Thyssenkrupp Nucera will utilize its U.S. resources “for other purposes,” Ponikwar said, echoing his sentiments from December.

Sabanci Renewables Closes Purchase of Solar Farm in Texas

OCI Energy on Aug. 15 said it has completed the sale of the 100-MW Project Lucky 7 solar farm in Texas to Sabanci Renewables, wrapping up back-to-back transactions.

Located in Hopkins County on approximately 745 acres, Lucky 7 is scheduled to start commercial operations in 2027, OCI said in a news release.

“Project Lucky 7 marks another significant step in delivering clean and reliable energy,” Sabanci Renewables CEO Tolga Kaan Doğancıoğlu said.

The transaction came after OCI sold the 120-MW Project Pepper solar farm in McLennan County to Sabanci in July. OCI said it and Sabanci have agreed to explore future project opportunities.

“Our expanding collaboration with Sabanci Renewables reflects both companies’ commitment to delivering high-impact, long-lasting clean energy projects that strengthen grid security and support power market affordability” OCI Energy President Sabah Bayatli said.

Skycorp Expands into Solar Power Generation with Acquisition

Solar cable and connector manufacturer Skycorp Solar Group is expanding into power generation with an acquisition of solar power stations announced on Aug. 13.

The China-headquartered company said it executed an agreement to acquire 8,705 kilowatts of solar power stations for approximately $4.25 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of November, subject to customary closing conditions. Additional details about the transaction, including the seller, were not disclosed.

“Upon closing, these assets will be integrated into the company’s renewable energy operations, strengthening its role in the green energy transition and supporting global decarbonization goals,” Skycorp said in the release.

Skycorp also announced the activation of its strategic digital asset reserve account, which enables the company to accept cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins as payment. The company said it executed on Aug. 12 its first transaction under the framework, with an initial acquisition of 32.76 ETH under an automated crypto trading bot.

“In the long term, more ETH will be purchased to diversify the treasury and position the company to capture opportunities within the digital asset sector,” Skycorp said. “All transactions will be conducted under rigorous compliance, risk management and regulatory disclosure protocols.”

T1, Corning Reach Deal to Make Fully American-made Solar Panels

U.S. solar company T1 Energy and specialty glass maker Corning have reached a deal that will establish a fully domestic solar supply chain, connecting polysilicon, wafers, cells, and panels manufactured in the United States, they said Aug 15.

The deal will help T1 satisfy growing U.S. demand for panels produced with American-made components. Under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, solar companies will be restricted from claiming federal clean energy tax credits if projects contain meaningful amounts of equipment produced by “foreign entities of concern,” including China.

“This landmark supply chain agreement with Corning will help invigorate America with scalable, reliable, low-cost energy,” T1 CEO Daniel Barcelo said in a statement. “This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security.”

Under the agreement, Corning will supply T1 with solar wafers from its Michigan factory starting in the second half of 2026. Wafers are thin slices of silicon that are the building blocks of solar cells that transform sunlight into electricity.

China dominates global solar wafer manufacturing. Trump has criticized the solar industry for being too reliant on Chinese supply chains.

The deal is an expansion of an existing supply contract for solar-grade polysilicon, the industry’s raw material.

T1 will use the wafers, produced by Corning subsidiary Hemlock Semiconductor, at an Austin, Texas, cell facility that is under development, the companies told Reuters. Those cells will be assembled into panels at T1’s existing factory near Dallas.

Combined, the companies will employ about 6,000 workers in Michigan and Texas, they said.

Corning reached a similar deal with manufacturers Suniva and Heliene earlier this year.

Wind

Ørsted Seeks $9.4B to Cope with Trump’s Hostility to Wind Power

Shares in Ørsted plunged to a record low Aug. 11 as the wind farm developer asked shareholders for $9.4 billion to help fund a U.S. project, after potential partners were put off by U.S. President Donald Trump’s hostility to wind power.

The 60 billion crowns ($9.4 billion) rights issue is worth around half of the Danish company’s market value as of Aug. 8’s close.

Struggling in recent years with soaring inflation and logistical problems that increased costs, the offshore wind industry faced a further setback when Trump suspended licensing on his first day back in office in January.

“Ørsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the U.S. on top of the past years’ macroeconomic and supply chain challenges,” CEO Rasmus Errboe said.

Trump campaigned on a promise to end the offshore wind industry, saying it is too expensive and hurts whales and birds.

Ørsted said two-thirds of the new capital would be used to fund the construction of Sunrise Wind—one of its two remaining projects under development off the U.S. East Coast. The rest of the expected proceeds from the rights issue would strengthen Ørsted’s finances and help it develop the 8.1 gigawatts of offshore wind projects currently under construction by 2027, the company said.

Potential co-investors for Sunrise Wind pulled out after Trump’s administration in April ordered Equinor to halt the development of a neighboring fully permitted wind farm. The order, which sent shockwaves through the industry, was reversed the following month, however.

""Following the stop work order on Equinor’s Empire Wind project, the perceived risks of the U.S. offshore wind market among investors and banks increased significantly,"" Errboe said.

Ørsted depends on selling full or partial stakes in its offshore wind farms to finance new projects. Errboe, who replaced former CEO Mads Nipper earlier this year, has sought to cut costs and cancelled projects in the U.S. and Britain.

This robust growth, reported in a recent analysis by CleanTechnica, highlights the resilience of the EV sector even as some major markets face headwinds. The increase encompasses both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), with total sales reaching impressive figures that underscore a shift toward electrification worldwide.

Key drivers include technological advancements in battery efficiency and expanding charging infrastructure, which have lowered barriers to entry for consumers. In China, the world’s largest EV market, sales have skyrocketed, contributing significantly to the global tally. European nations, bolstered by stringent emissions regulations, have also seen steady uptake, with countries like Norway and Germany leading the charge.

US Policies Casting a Shadow

However, the United States presents a contrasting picture, where anti-electrification policies have tempered enthusiasm. Recent rollbacks on federal incentives, including reductions in tax credits for EV purchases, have slowed domestic sales growth. According to insights from BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook, the US market is experiencing a slowdown, with EV adoption rates lagging behind global averages. This policy shift, influenced by political debates over energy independence and fossil fuel reliance, has led some legacy automakers to reassess their electrification strategies.

Despite these challenges, certain US manufacturers are adapting successfully. Companies like Tesla and Ford have reported strong EV sales, leveraging innovation and consumer demand for sustainable options. The report from CleanTechnica notes that while overall US EV market share hovers around 10%, hybrids are gaining traction as a bridge technology, appealing to buyers wary of full electrification amid policy uncertainty.

China’s Dominance and Emerging Markets

China’s dominance in the EV space is unmistakable, with domestic brands like BYD and NIO capturing a lion’s share of global sales. Data from the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 projects that China’s EV fleet will continue to expand rapidly, supported by government subsidies and a mature supply chain. This growth is offsetting slower progress in the US, where anti-electrification sentiments have led to export restrictions on critical battery metals, further complicating the supply landscape.

Emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America are also contributing to the uptick, with affordable EV models from Chinese manufacturers penetrating these regions. A post on X from BloombergNEF earlier this year emphasized that EVs could represent one in four cars sold globally in 2025, driven by these diverse adoption patterns. This global diversification is crucial, as it reduces dependency on any single market’s policy whims.

Industry Implications and Future Projections

For industry insiders, this disparity raises questions about long-term strategies. Automakers must navigate a patchwork of regulations, investing in flexible production lines that can pivot between EVs and traditional vehicles. The Statista Market Forecast predicts the global EV market to reach US$1,084 billion by 2029, growing at nearly 7% annually, suggesting sustained momentum despite US hurdles.

Looking ahead, advancements in battery technology and potential policy reversals could accelerate growth. However, risks remain, including supply chain disruptions from geopolitical tensions. As noted in a Reuters article on recent sales data, global EV sales grew 21% year-on-year in July, with plug-in hybrids in China providing a buffer against softening BEV demand. This resilience indicates that while US policies may dampen local enthusiasm, the worldwide transition to electric mobility is forging ahead unabated.

Strategic Responses from Automakers

Legacy automakers are responding variably to these trends. General Motors and Volkswagen are ramping up EV investments, aiming to capitalize on global demand even as they face domestic challenges. Insights from GlobeNewswire’s Electric Vehicle Market Outlook highlight opportunities in leasing and shared mobility, which offer adaptable models for consumers hesitant due to policy flux.

Ultimately, the 27% global sales increase in 2025, as detailed in CleanTechnica’s coverage, underscores a pivotal moment for the industry. Stakeholders must balance innovation with advocacy to ensure that anti-electrification policies in key markets like the US do not derail the broader shift toward sustainable transportation.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-5229c0c2-20e7-4fd4-b5e7-bca767b36d5d.jpeg,N,,2025-08-16 05:01:45.021436

Announced on August 15, 2025, the deal aims to counter reliance on foreign imports, particularly from China, amid tightening federal regulations. T1, a rising player in renewable energy, will source hyper-pure polysilicon and advanced wafers from Corning, integrating them into its cell and panel production facilities in Texas.

The agreement comes at a pivotal time for the industry, as President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” imposes restrictions on federal clean energy tax credits for projects using equipment from “foreign entities of concern.” This policy, designed to bolster domestic production, has spurred companies like T1 to seek U.S.-based suppliers. According to details shared in a Reuters report, the partnership will connect every stage of solar manufacturing within the U.S., marking a significant step toward supply chain independence.

Building a Resilient Domestic Ecosystem: The deal not only addresses regulatory pressures but also positions T1 to capitalize on surging demand for American-made renewables, potentially creating thousands of jobs and reducing vulnerabilities to global trade disruptions.

Production is slated to ramp up in the second half of 2026, with Corning’s solar wafers feeding into T1’s under-development G2 facility in Austin for cell manufacturing, before final assembly at the operational G1 site in Dallas. This integrated approach could yield scalable, low-cost energy solutions, as highlighted by T1 CEO Daniel Barcelo in a statement: “This landmark supply chain agreement with Corning will help invigorate America with scalable, reliable, low-cost energy.” Industry analysts note that such vertical integration is rare in the U.S., where most panels still incorporate overseas components.

Financial markets reacted swiftly, with T1 Energy’s stock surging up to 20% on the NYSE following the announcement, as reported by Seeking Alpha. The boost reflects investor optimism about T1’s ability to tap into government incentives and meet growing demand from utilities and commercial projects prioritizing domestic sourcing. Corning, known for its specialty glass innovations, expands its role in clean energy, leveraging expertise from fiber optics to solar materials.

Job Creation and Economic Ripple Effects: Projections suggest the partnership could generate up to 6,000 U.S. jobs across manufacturing, research, and logistics, underscoring the broader economic benefits of revitalizing American solar production amid policy-driven shifts.

Beyond immediate outputs, the collaboration signals a broader push for technological advancement. Corning’s involvement brings proprietary wafer technology that enhances panel efficiency and durability, potentially giving T1 a competitive edge over imports. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from industry watchers, including energy analysts, have hailed the deal as a “game-changer” for U.S. energy security, with some noting parallels to past manufacturing booms spurred by tariffs and subsidies.

However, challenges remain. Scaling polysilicon production domestically is capital-intensive, and T1 must navigate raw material costs and workforce training. As detailed in a pv magazine USA article, the partnership supports a full domestic chain but requires ongoing investment to compete with lower-cost Asian producers. Still, with federal support, this could accelerate the U.S. toward solar self-sufficiency.

Policy Context and Future Implications: Enacted under the Trump administration, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is driving a renaissance in American manufacturing, but experts warn that sustained innovation will be key to long-term viability against global competitors.

For industry insiders, the T1-Corning pact exemplifies strategic adaptation to a protectionist environment. It may inspire similar alliances, fostering clusters of innovation in states like Texas. As renewable adoption accelerates—driven by corporate sustainability goals and grid modernization—the deal could lower costs for end-users while strengthening national energy resilience. T1’s projected output, combined with Corning’s materials prowess, positions the duo to capture a larger share of the multibillion-dollar solar market, potentially influencing global standards for sustainable manufacturing.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-8d79c369-6564-4af3-81ae-d2c9bb15fc95.jpeg,N,,2025-08-16 04:00:26.560288

Longevity advantages of the new Naxtra battery

The world’s largest battery company, CATL, has designed its new electric vehicle (EV) battery made from salt to last up to 3.6 million miles. This product, officially named Naxtra, is the world’s first mass-produced sodium-ion battery. The battery was initially announced in April, but information about its range has started to emerge.

CATL’s Naxtra costs just 10% of a lithium-ion unit’s price, and its design, lending itself to slow deterioration, may help retain 85% of its charging capacity after 3.6 million miles. Sodium-ion batteries are viewed as a viable replacement for lithium-ion batteries, given salt’s prevalence and leaving clean drinking water after mining salt water. However, earlier attempts at leveraging the design fell short, as they only offered half the power of a lithium-ion battery’s 185 Wh of energy for every kilogram of weight. CATL’s battery incorporates some lithium-ion cells to create a combined system that balances the two chemistries and operates more effectively in extreme temperatures. In turn, Naxtra is expected to exceed 10,000 cycles before degrading.

Batteries lasting more charge cycles could also help decrease fire risks associated with battery electric vehicles (BEVs), as degraded batteries getting charged to 100% have a higher likelihood of experiencing thermal issues. In an interview with Autoblog, transportation risk mitigation expert William S. Lerner noted, “Once you get into a plug-in hybrid, what you’re doing is you’re adding an electrical current from the charger to the vehicle. There’s roughly a 20-30% chance that something is going to happen when the vehicle is plugged in either on the charger or the vehicle end. When you start charging the vehicles, people don’t obey the charge to 80% rule, and the problem then becomes that the batteries are depreciating assets. Just like your mobile phone, it will last 600-2000 cycles, but after that, it starts degrading, and when it starts degrading, the average tendency is to top it off even more to keep it at 100%.”

A closer look at what Naxtra’s price means for EV buyers

Price is a significant factor defining the CATL Naxtra battery’s appeal. The cost of lithium-ion batteries is $100/kWh, and it took years of refining to reach this price. In contrast, the Naxtra battery costs $10/kWh, and the average battery capacity in 2025 is 70 kWh. For example, a Tesla Model Y Long Range or Model Y Performance comes with a 75.00 kWh battery. Naxtra achieves an energy density of 175 Wh/kg, just behind the 185 Wh/kg of average EV lithium-iron-phosphate batteries.

Final thoughts

Naxtra is currently being developed for six major Chinese automakers’ 2026 models. Sales of Chinese EVs have significantly increased in recent years, and combining these lower initial costs with a battery that could last up to 3.6 million miles or over 10,000 cycles could be revolutionary. By comparison, Tesla’s lithium iron phosphate batteries typically last 3,000 to 4,000 charge cycles before capacity degrades below the 70-80% threshold.

Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, launched his gubernatorial bid Wednesday, saying affordability, taxes and high electric bills will be central to his campaign.

Fazio, who announced the formation of an exploratory committee for governor on Aug. 1, said he decided to officially enter the political fray this week because, “Connecticut is a great state with great people, and the people of this state deserve better leadership and better outcomes than the third highest electric bills and the third highest taxes in the country. … I’m running to reduce their electric bills, to cut their taxes by $1,500 [annually] for the average family and … to create opportunity for all.”

Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has hinted at running for a third four-year term, but has made no formal announcement. Should he decide to run, Lamont would be challenged by State Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, Westport’s Republican First Selectwoman Jen Tooker and Fazio. New Britain Republican Mayor Erin Stewart has also formed an exploratory committee for a possible gubernatorial run.

Fazio, 35, told CT Examiner on Friday that he appeals to voters from every political persuasion, noting that he won his 2024 race in a district that backed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

“I have been the leading voice on the most important issues to regular voters,” said Fazio, one of just 11 Republican state senators in the General Assembly.

Fazio said a top priority has been his continued opposition to the public benefits charges in ratepayers’ electric bills. He pointed to what he considers one of his biggest accomplishments in the Senate — leading the passage of a 2023 bill requiring utilities to clearly list those charges.

“I followed up that [in 2025] by passing the first cut to public benefits programs broadly, in state history. However, because of opposition from my Democratic colleagues and the governor, I was only able to cut it by $100 million out of $1 billion. Now, I’m running to finish the job,” he said.

Further reducing the public benefits charges could save ratepayers about $50 a month on their bills, Fazio said.

In Connecticut, public benefit charges are fees added to electric bills to fund various state-mandated programs, including energy efficiency initiatives, support for low-income customers and the integration of electric vehicles.

Fazio is also pushing to cut taxes for the average Connecticut family.

“The governor raised taxes by nearly $1 billion altogether in his two terms,” he said. “I would cut taxes by $1,500. The governor presided over $400 million of increases in public benefit charges.”

Fazio said he’d implement a tax cut by slowing the growth of spending, simplifying the tax code, reducing some special interest tax credits and moderating the growth of debt.

Fazio, an investment advisor who lives in the Riverside section of Greenwich, criticized the governor but did not critique Tooker or Stewart on Friday.

“I’m not going to throw shade. I have respect for them. I respect that [Tooker and Stewart] are going for it,” Fazio said. “I’m running because I believe I’m the best general election candidate.”

In a statement to CT Examiner on Friday, Lamont’s Director of Communications Rob Blanchard said: “Gov. Lamont was elected by voters who wanted change and he delivered that by getting our state budget and economy back on track — but he didn’t stop there. He cut taxes for working families and championed free childcare for families making less than $100,000 and increased the minimum wage. Gov. Lamont is proud to put his record of change, affordability, and opportunity up against anyone. … Coming off a session when the Republican Senate Caucus proposed no budget or presented any ideas on making our state more affordable, we look forward to hearing Sen. Fazio’s ideas next session.”

On other issues, Fazio said he supports abortion rights, law enforcement, school choice, capping local property taxes, and limiting cellphone use in classrooms. He also called out salary increases for state employees over the past five years.

“In recent years, state employees have received a 33% pay increase compared to roughly a 15% increase for private sector workers,” he said. “So I believe in fairness and I don’t believe [in] the current situation.”

Fazio is a ranking member of both the Energy & Technology and Finance, Revenue & Bonding committees, and has spent the last several years as a weekly volunteer for Meals on Wheels, delivering food to seniors in need.",https://ctexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fazio-Number-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 05:01:49.692005

The Metro Mayors Caucus, which represents 38 cities across the Denver metro region, sent a letter to the PUC on Tuesday, throwing its support behind Xcel’s Distribution System Plan. The caucus cited economic growth and clean energy as reasons for approving the plan.

The letter said if the plan is not approved, Colorado faces future grid reliability risks, higher consumer costs and the loss of potential large employers.

“Competitor states such as Texas, Utah, Arizona, and North Carolina are actively building capacity to win these projects,"" the letter reads. ""Lost opportunities mean lost jobs, reduced tax base, and diminished competitiveness.""

Read the full letter below:

The Distribution System Plan, which was proposed in December, will add 3.1 gigawatts of new capacity. It will add 100 new or replaced distribution substation transformers, 36 substations and 300 new feeder lines by 2029.

The modernization of Xcel’s infrastructure will help prepare for increased energy needs, which have been fueled by the growing popularity of electric vehicles, electric heat pumps, distributed storage and rooftop solar. Xcel Energy anticipates over 400,000 electric vehicles will be driven in Colorado by 2029.

“The grid is an aging piece of infrastructure,"" said Jack Ihle, regional vice president of regulatory planning at policy at Xcel Energy. ""Many of these pieces of technology on it can be decades old, so we're looking to refresh that, expand the capacity and get ahead of these many new energy choices that are that customers are looking to do.""

The utility company also anticipates an increase in the average Colorado residential electric bill by 9.01%, or about $8.71 per month, by 2029 to fund the project. Small businesses could see an increase of 8.45%, or about $10.24 per month, by 2029.

“We invest in the totality of this through our finance mechanisms, and then we recover the cost from the customers,” Ihle explained.

That model of paying for infrastructure projects has drawn criticism from customers in the past, who have paid increased rates in recent years for wildfire mitigation, natural gas costs, and, most recently, a time-of-use rate change that charges more for electricity in the evening hours.

“We're very focused on the cost challenge. We understand that nobody likes to see bill or rate increases,” Ihle said. ""It's choice, it's reliability, and it's managing affordability in a prudent way.”

The ability to aggregate the power of many microgrids and other distributed energy resources (DERs) is ramping up in many countries, including the U.S., and coming to the aid of utility grids which are stressed by extreme temperatures and equipment outages.

China, which seeks to challenge the U.S. in other energy categories such as renewables and battery storage, now claims new heights in its work on virtual power plant (VPP) technology. State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Co. this week has reported a new VPP demand response which achieved 1.163 million kWH of load adjustment during a peak demand with record temperatures in China.

Virtual power plants aggregate tens, hundreds or even thousands of DERs into a single, dispatchable resource that can either reduce load or create supply during times of peak demand, helping the grid to stay in balance. In the State Grid Shanghai case, the utility aggregated resource generation and load decreases from 47 operators, which included data centers, HVAC and EV charging stations (pictured).

Demand response technology utilizing digitalization not only deploys distributed energy resources into the grid, but also adjusts the load from customers through devices controlling thermostats, lighting, heating and cooling.

The recent merger between Workhorse Group (WKHS) and Motiv Electric Trucks has positioned a new contender to dominate this $23 billion market. By combining Workhorse's manufacturing expertise and dealer network with Motiv's software-defined vehicles and fleet relationships, the merged entity is poised to deliver scalable, cost-competitive solutions. For investors, this merger represents a high-conviction entry point into a sector primed for explosive growth.

Strategic Synergies: Building a Scalable EV Platform

The merger's value lies in its ability to create a vertically integrated EV platform. Workhorse's Union City, Indiana plant—recently sold in a $20 million leaseback—provides a scalable manufacturing base, while Motiv's software architecture enables rapid customization for diverse fleet needs. Together, they aim to reduce unit costs by 20% through shared platforms and streamlined production. This synergy is not just theoretical: the combined company projects $20 million in cost savings by 2026, driven by optimized supply chains and shared R&D.

The financial structure further amplifies scalability. Post-merger financing includes a $20 million debt facility, with $10 million in revolving credit and $10 million in asset-based lending tied to purchase orders. This liquidity ensures the company can scale production without overleveraging, a critical advantage in a capital-intensive industry.

Cost-Parity Potential: A Tipping Point for Adoption

Achieving cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) trucks is the holy grail for EV manufacturers. The merged entity's roadmap targets this directly. By leveraging Motiv's software-defined vehicles—designed to minimize hardware complexity—and Workhorse's production efficiency, the company aims to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) for customers.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides a tailwind, offering $1 billion in EV incentives that could offset upfront costs for fleets. With the merged company's projected 36.16% CAGR in the medium-duty segment (2025–2030), cost parity could be reached faster than anticipated. Scott Griffith, the incoming CEO, has emphasized that TCO improvements will drive adoption in urban logistics and municipal services, where fuel and maintenance savings are most impactful.

Market Positioning: Avoiding the Heavy-Duty Overcrowd

While heavy-duty EVs attract headlines, the medium-duty segment remains underserved. Companies like BYD, Tesla, and Rivian dominate the heavy-duty space, but the Class 4–6 niche—targeted by the merged entity—is less competitive and more profitable. Workhorse's W56 step van and Motiv's Class 5 trucks already serve key markets like last-mile delivery and waste management, where electrification demand is surging.

The merger also strengthens customer relationships. Motiv's partnerships with Amazon and FedEx, combined with Workhorse's national dealer network, create a dual-channel advantage. This ensures the merged company can scale sales while maintaining service quality—a critical differentiator in a market where uptime is king.

Investment Thesis: A High-Conviction Play

For investors, the merger's timing is impeccable. The transaction is set to close in Q4 2025, aligning with the IRA's incentive window and the sector's inflection point. The combined company's simplified capital structure—bolstered by the $20 million SLB and $5 million convertible note—reduces financial risk while preserving equity value.

Key risks include execution challenges in integration and supply chain volatility. However, the merger's focus on cost synergies and liquidity buffers mitigates these concerns. The $23 billion medium-duty market, with its high growth rate and regulatory tailwinds, offers a clear path to profitability.

Conclusion: Electrifying the Future of Logistics

The Workhorse-Motiv merger is more than a consolidation—it's a strategic repositioning for leadership in the EV transition. By combining manufacturing scale, software innovation, and fleet relationships, the merged entity is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the $23 billion medium-duty truck market. For investors seeking exposure to the EV revolution without the volatility of pure-play startups, this merger represents a compelling, high-conviction opportunity.

As the EV transition accelerates, the ability to deliver cost-competitive, scalable solutions will define winners. The merged Workhorse-Motiv entity has laid the groundwork to become one of them.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-16 04:00:46.367787

Strengthening domestic manufacturing for the energy sector reduces reliance on foreign sources of critical materials and technologies.
Strengthening US energy infrastructure Modernizing the grid depends on better technology, together with the ability to manufacture and deploy it at scale.","Secretary of Energy Chris Wright called the nation’s transmission system the backbone of secure, reliable electricity delivery, and right now, that backbone is straining under the weight of 21st-century demands. Meanwhile on July 23 late last month, the White House released its AI Action Plan, which aims to fast-track data centers and power projects in an effort to show American leadership in AI. The plan includes grid modernization, including — notably — upgrades to power lines that can increase the amount of electricity transmitted along existing routes (aka reconductoring).

The USA may be producing more energy than ever, but without more transmission capacity to move that power where it's needed, factories, businesses, and entire industries risk being left in the dark. Improving transmission infrastructure isn't just about keeping the lights on; it's about keeping America competitive. That’s why all of us here at TS Conductor were proud to announce the opening of a second US manufacturing facility earlier this year.

Four reasons domestic manufacturing matters for the grid

To understand the urgency of upgrading the grid, it’s useful to look more closely at the underlying drivers.

Rising energy demand. AI-driven data centers and other high-tech industries are expanding quickly, with projections showing these could consume 12% of US electricity by 2028. Meeting growing energy needs will require building more (and more reliable) infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events and ensuring resilience to prevent blackouts.

Grid capacity strains. The US grid, especially in the East, faces significant pressure as older, polluting plants shut down. At the same time, an unprecedented queue of new domestic energy projects — from solar and wind to nuclear and geothermal — must be integrated to meet rising demand. Building the infrastructure to support both this new generating capacity and the growing energy load is vital, but challenges related to policy, permitting, and funding continue to slow progress.

Energy independence. Strengthening domestic manufacturing for the energy sector reduces reliance on foreign sources of critical materials and technologies. The Department of Energy highlights the importance of local production and infrastructure development in enhancing grid resilience — while also fostering job creation, economic growth, and a more self-reliant energy future.

Energy security. By bolstering local electricity generation, improving backup energy systems like grid and battery storage, and increasing the diversity of energy sources, the US can reduce its vulnerability to disruptions. A resilient grid enhances protection against external threats, ensuring the continuous flow of power across vital sectors.

A new era for the grid through advanced conductors

As energy demand rises and the grid faces increasing strain, infrastructure holds the key to unlocking a reliable, resilient, affordable, and sustainable energy future. Modernizing the nation’s transmission lines can help clear bottlenecks and enable more efficient power distribution across the country.

TS Conductor’s Aluminum-Encapsulated Carbon Core (AECC) technology proves a breakthrough in this area, enabling efficient grid capacity expansion and reducing grid congestion through reconductoring as well as for new transmission corridor development.

Featuring a pre-tensioned carbon fiber core encapsulated in aluminum, AECC can double or even triple transmission capacity while preserving the safety and reliability of traditional conductors and reducing costs. TS Conductor has use cases demonstrating a 30–40% reduction in total project CapEx for reconductoring lines in existing rights of way (ROWs) on existing structures. This is driven by the fact that no retrofit (e.g., raising towers or strengthening them) is required for AECC. For new line builds, TS Conductor AECC use cases demonstrate a total CapEx savings of 10–20%, due to the need for fewer and shorter towers as the span lengths can be longer with AECC’s low-sag features. Overall this technology significantly reduces energy losses, enhances efficiency, and drives grid resilience — all meaningful advantages as the US transitions to a more electrified economy.

Strengthening US energy infrastructure

Modernizing the grid depends on better technology, together with the ability to manufacture and deploy it at scale. To meet growing demand, TS Conductor is investing $134 million in a new, vertically integrated manufacturing facility near the Port of Savannah in Hardeeville, South Carolina. The project is expected to create approximately 462 advanced manufacturing jobs with above-average wages, with phase one slated to begin operations by the end of 2025. Beyond adding production capacity, this facility will help fortify domestic supply chains and accelerate grid modernization.

As the US faces rising electricity demand and the increasing threat of extreme weather, investing in domestic manufacturing ensures the infrastructure is in place to scale innovative solutions like AECC technology.

1. Suddenly, the Trump Administration Tightens the Vise on Wind Farms – The New York Times

The Trump Administration is imposing new hurdles on wind and solar development. The Interior Department is adding political review to previously routine approvals, pulling millions of acres from offshore wind eligibility, reconsidering existing permits, and reversing projects like the Lava Ridge wind farm. Meanwhile, the Transportation Department is recommending 1.2-mile setbacks near federal highways and directing the FAA to re-evaluate turbine height clearances nationwide.

More than 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year, and only 10% of that gets recycled. More than 90 countries are now negotiating a UN-backed Global Plastics Treaty in Geneva to deal with the problem, and the EU will require all packaging to be recyclable. The world’s large producers of consumer goods are looking for alternatives, but most have been costly or less functional.

Negative wholesale electricity prices are becoming more common in Europe, with Spain logging 404 negative hours in the first five months of this year. As renewables are added to the grid, sometimes supply will exceed demand, and producers pay to keep plants running because shutdowns can be costly or subsidies make generation still profitable. The trend could limit project returns, slowing investment. Solutions include grid-scale storage, long-distance transmission line,s and dynamic pricing to shift demand to periods of high supply.

In 2025, choosing a fuel-efficient car isn’t just about saving money — it’s a matter of lifestyle, values, and identity.

With rising gas prices and growing environmental concerns, drivers are turning to cars that deliver maximum miles per gallon and minimal emissions. The General takes a look at some of the most fuel-efficient vehicles of the year, the ones blending performance, innovation, and sustainability.

Why fuel efficiency matters more than ever

The average U.S. gas price as of July 28 was $3.12 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For daily commuters and families, this translates to hundreds in annual fuel savings or extra costs. Fuel-efficient vehicles not only reduce those expenses but also slash greenhouse gas emissions, helping drivers do their part in the fight against climate change.

A diverse landscape of efficient options

The 2025 lineup reflects the most diverse selection of eco-friendly vehicles in history. From hybrid sedans and compact SUVs to electric vehicles and even fuel-efficient pickup trucks, there’s something for every driver.

“The biggest misconception with OBBBA is that it’s pulling the rug out from under heat pumps,” David Rames, senior product manager at heat pump manufacturer Midea, said in an email.
Earlier this year, California also released a plan to rapidly scale heat pump adoption in the state to help achieve a long-term goal of installing six million electric heat pumps by 2030.

Heat pump installations have been outselling gas furnaces consistently since 2021 and that’s expected to continue as manufacturers capitalize on the improved energy efficiency of their products, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit organization serving the clean energy sector.

Despite some uncertainty in the HVAC market, driven in part by changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phases out some federal incentives for energy-efficiency upgrades, heat pump adoption is set to continue expanding, specialists in the field say.

OBBBA, signed in July, curtails solar and wind incentives and ends the 25D residential clean energy tax credit and the 25C energy efficient home improvement credit after this year. The bill also implements a credit phase-down for Section 48E investment tax credits, starting in 2034.

The law goes easier on geothermal heat pump projects, which can qualify for full 48E investment tax credit or the 45Y production tax credit if they begin construction by 2033, after which the credits gradually decrease, according to an analysis by the law firm Chapman and Cutler. Under OBBBA, the 2% base tax credit that was terminated for energy property projects was left alone for geothermal heat pumps, which have a 6% base tax credit.

“The biggest misconception with OBBBA is that it’s pulling the rug out from under heat pumps,” David Rames, senior product manager at heat pump manufacturer Midea, said in an email. “While it’s repealing federal incentives like 25C and 45L, it’s nudging the industry to accelerate a market shift that was already underway: one focused on affordability, ease of installation and retrofit readiness.”

For commercial and multifamily buildings, state- and utility-level programs remain strong and can still meaningfully reduce upfront costs, providing support outside the federal umbrella, according to Rames.

“States like New York (NYSERDA), Massachusetts (Mass Save), California (TECH Clean California), Vermont (Efficiency Vermont) and Oregon (Energy Trust) still offer rebates that can exceed $10,000 per system,” he said. “Many utilities also provide custom rebates for commercial-scale installations, especially in electrification or demand-response programs.”

For example, New York state is offering up to $750,000 in state cost-sharing funding for building and decarbonization efforts that use ground-source heat pumps, waste heat recovery, thermal energy storage and other low-emissions technologies as part of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s $10 million Large-Scale Thermal program.

The effort complements prior state-led initiatives to decarbonize facilities, campuses and neighborhoods, including a community heat pump program that added a ground-source system to a pair of residential towers in Brooklyn and a feasibility study to swap out a gas-fired steam system and distributed air-cooled chillers for a lower-temperature water loop on part of Cornell University’s Agricultural Experiment Station campus.

“We are hoping we can continue to increase the growth of thermal storage and other solutions that can take strain off the grid,” NYSERDA Program Manager Sue Dougherty said in a presentation at the International District Energy Association annual conference in June.

Earlier this year, California also released a plan to rapidly scale heat pump adoption in the state to help achieve a long-term goal of installing six million electric heat pumps by 2030.

Although heat pumps previously faced climate-related challenges, including not functioning efficiently at lower temperatures, this has changed in recent years, Rames said.

For example, eight manufacturers are participating in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge to develop and launch systems that can operate reliably at low temperatures. Four have or plan to bring commercialized versions to the market in 2025, with three expecting to in 2026, according to the DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

“Today’s advanced heat pumps, like Midea’s EVOX All Climate Heat Pump, deliver 100% heating at down to -31°F and 100% cooling at up to 140°F, making them viable in nearly every climate zone,” he said.

Today, heat pumps provide facility leaders with several advantages, including electrification-readiness; reduced HVAC energy use, with consistent [coefficient of performance], even in harsh conditions; and design flexibility, due to modular air handlers and dual-voltage compatibility, Rames said.

“Moving forward, adoption will hinge on ease of retrofit, available incentives and system longevity, areas where modern heat pumps now outcompete traditional gas-based systems,” he said.

New law focused on energy production takes effect

Spectrum News

House Bill 15, effective as of Thursday, August 14, 2025, introduces significant changes to Ohio’s energy landscape by ending subsidies tied to scandal-linked coal plants and streamlining the construction of new gas plants to meet rising electricity demand. The bill accelerates approval processes with the Public Utilities Commission and adjusts tax provisions to ease developer burdens, according to Greg Lawson of the Buckeye Institute. John Patrick Blackwood, spokesperson for the Office of Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, supports the measure, noting that Ohioans have paid roughly $500 million over the past five years to sustain two uneconomical coal-burning power plants—one located in Indiana—and that the law may benefit consumers and increase generation capacity. However, environmental law expert Victor Flatt warns the law raises concerns about fracking near state parks—highlighting potential disturbances such as noise, visual impacts, construction traffic, road congestion, and water runoff issues. [MDN: This is good news that HB 15 is now in effect. We previously told you all about this important new law (see OH Passes Bill (Now Law) to Encourage More Gas-Fired Power Plants).]

New York ignores consumer costs for climate goals—and pays the price

Energy in Depth/Mallory Smith

New York’s aggressive climate policies, particularly the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act mandating 100% zero-emission electricity by 2040, are driving up consumer costs—Con Edison’s plan to raise electricity bills by over 11% in the New York City area next year is a direct consequence of these mandates rather than business decisions. Utility companies warn that spending on green initiatives may be the first cut if consumers push back. Con Edison’s CEO acknowledged that investments in clean energy and resilience disproportionately burden lower- and moderate-income customers. These costs stem from New York’s history of restricting affordable and reliable energy—through pipeline blockades, denied permits, and litigation—resulting in canceled projects and limited natural gas supply, contributing to the Northeast having the highest regional electricity rates in the nation. Although Governor Hochul has recently signaled a shift toward affordability by supporting diverse energy sources and infrastructure investments, the article argues that her rhetoric must be matched by tangible policy—such as streamlining permitting and backing new natural gas pipelines—to ensure affordable, reliable energy for all. [MDN: The people the lefty Democrats say they love and protect, low-income, poor, people of color, are the ones paying more (percentage-wise) out of pocket for the Dems’ stupid energy policies. Yet they keep returning them to power. You get the government you deserve.]

New York’s official energy plan is no plan

Manhattan Contrarian/Francis Menton

New York’s 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act set ambitious goals—70% renewable electricity by 2030 and 100% zero-carbon by 2040—but six years in, progress has stalled. Closure of the 2 GW Indian Point nuclear plant, replaced by natural gas, reduced zero-carbon power, while large-scale wind and solar—especially offshore wind—have faltered after federal support was withdrawn. Despite looming deadlines, the state lacks a credible, detailed plan, offering instead voluminous, jargon-filled reports like the Draft 2025 Energy Plan from the New York State Energy Planning Board, which contains no concrete project lists, feasibility studies, or cost estimates. The NYISO’s 2025 Power Trends report is shorter but equally cautious, burying a key admission: until advanced nuclear or hydrogen is commercialized, fossil fuels remain essential for grid reliability. This understated warning underscores the gap between political aspirations and practical realities, leaving New York with lofty rhetoric but no viable roadmap to meet its climate mandates. [MDN: As we have said for years, NY is screwed. There is NO WAY the climate plan is going to work. At some point, it will be abandoned, or the Democrats in Albany will be thrown out of office, and then it will be abandoned. It will be interesting to watch as this plays out.]

Wave of LNG FIDs and data center mania spur a flood of gas pipelines projects

RBN Energy/Housley Carr

Construction is underway or imminent at seven Gulf Coast LNG export terminals totaling 16 Bcf/d, while booming data-center development in Texas and Louisiana—such as Meta’s planned $10 billion campus in Richland Parish, LA, fueled by 2,200 MW of gas-fired power (~330 MMcf/d of gas demand)—is driving further demand. Yet, existing pipeline networks are maxed out, even as U.S. LNG feedgas flows have recently topped 15 Bcf/d and are expected to double within six to seven years. Production from the Permian, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford will supply much of this, but to match growing needs, a wave of pipeline projects is being fast-tracked. Key pipelines reaching FID include Woodside’s Louisiana LNG and its Line 200, Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Midscale trains 8 and 9, and Venture Global’s CP2 Phase 1 and CP Express. Additional projects—from Haynesville to Gillis, Permian-to-South Texas, and beyond—will come online through 2027, with even more capacity expected into the early 2030s.

Kelcy Warren among energy leaders who transformed American oil and gas

ABC Money

Kelcy Warren, co-founder and Executive Chairman of Energy Transfer, has played a pivotal role in reshaping the American oil and gas industry through bold, strategic leadership. Since launching the company in 1996 with just 200 miles of pipelines and 20 employees, he transformed it into a midstream powerhouse controlling nearly 125,000 miles of infrastructure across the United States. His agility in responding to market upheavals—such as during the 2008-09 gas price collapse—led to decisive moves like the rapid $2 billion acquisition of Louis Dreyfus midstream assets in 2011, securing a strong foothold in natural gas liquids and creating a “naturally hedged” energy portfolio. Under his stewardship, Energy Transfer became a major exporter, repurposing import infrastructure into export terminals and now ships approximately 20 percent of the world’s natural gas liquids to 93 countries, while also becoming the largest global exporter of ethane. [MDN: Energy Transfer has built and operates major pipelines in the M-U, including the Mariner East pipelines and Rover. ET exports ethane from Marcus Hook, near Philadelphia.]

To win the AI race, we need to build out American transmission

RealClearEnergy/Sarah Rosa

President Trump’s AI Action Plan highlights the urgent need to expand and modernize the U.S. electric grid to meet surging demand from AI, manufacturing onshoring, and electrification, with electricity use projected to rise 25% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Experts, including DOE’s National Transmission Planning Study, warn the grid must at least double in size, yet new high-voltage line construction has sharply declined while China vastly outpaces U.S. buildout. Permitting remains a major barrier, with approvals often taking 7–18 years, and aging infrastructure from the 1960s–70s needing upgrades. Solutions include deploying grid-enhancing technologies to boost capacity by up to 30%, reforming NEPA and CWA processes, granting FERC backstop siting authority, resolving cost allocation issues, and using capacity contracting to de-risk financing. Without streamlined approvals and investment in both new and upgraded lines, rising demand will drive up electricity costs, threatening U.S. competitiveness in the AI race and energy affordability. [MDN: Unless we get permitting reform and stop the left’s lawfare, we will lose the AI race to China. It’s really that simple.]

Oil climbs from two-month lows

Bloomberg/Julia Fanzeres, Alex Longley

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rebounded from a two-month low, settling at $63.96 a barrel, while Brent closed at $66.84, in thin summer trading. Market attention is focused on Friday’s planned summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, with investors weighing the potential impact on U.S. sanctions against the OPEC+ member. Trump warned of “very severe consequences” if Putin fails to agree to a ceasefire, but analysts expect neither a decisive ceasefire nor aggressive new sanctions. Despite the rebound, oil prices remain down over 10% this year as OPEC+ completes the reversal of output cuts begun in 2023. Expectations of a record supply glut in 2026 and weaker crude balances for the rest of the year are weighing on sentiment. RBC analysts noted supplies are already “primed to back up” in the Atlantic Basin, reinforcing the bearish supply outlook even as price volatility remains muted in the quiet northern hemisphere summer.

The report projects that by 2025, supply shortages could reach 30% for power transformers and 10% for distribution transformers, creating challenges for utilities and delaying new generation projects.

Wood Mackenzie’s study, Untangling the U.S. Transformer Supply Chain Crisis, notes that demand for power transformers has surged 116% since 2019, while distribution transformer demand has grown 41%. Rising electricity consumption — up 7% since 2020 after a decade-long decline — coupled with aging infrastructure and a surge in clean energy projects, has fueled the pressure.

“Domestic manufacturing capacity simply cannot keep pace,” said Ben Boucher, senior analyst for supply chain data and analytics at Wood Mackenzie. “By 2025, imports are expected to make up 80% of U.S. power transformer supply and 50% of distribution transformer supply. This imbalance is raising costs, lengthening lead times, and delaying critical projects.”

The report also highlights policy and trade developments as complicating factors. New tariffs, including a planned 50% tariff on copper in August, are expected to drive up costs for both imported and domestically manufactured transformers. In addition, recent legislation — including President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — is projected to alter demand for step-up transformers by scaling back clean energy incentives.

Despite these challenges, manufacturers have announced more than $1.8 billion in new North American capacity investments since 2023. While those projects may provide some relief, Wood Mackenzie cautions that they will not be enough to fully close the supply gap given the pace of demand growth.

“The U.S. transformer market stands at a critical juncture,” Boucher said. “Without coordinated action on standardization, workforce development, raw material supply, and trade policy, extended lead times and elevated costs could become the new normal — with major consequences for grid modernization and clean energy deployment.”","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/08/689fa0e0c87acd361c7ad90d-gettyimages1585727774.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-15 23:59:37.278701

Honda Prologue leads used EV sales growth in July

After it delivered the first customer models last March, the Honda Prologue quickly became one of the most popular EVs in the US.

Throughout the second half of the year, Honda sold an average of over 5,000 Prologues every month. In November, it was the third best-selling EV, trailing only the Tesla Model Y and Model 3.

Honda’s electric SUV continues to be a top seller this year. Last month, it outsold the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai IONIQ 5. Since delivering the first Prologue model last March, Honda has now sold 52,500 units in the US.

According to Cox Automotive’s latest EV Market Monitor report, used Honda Prologue EVs are selling faster than expected.

Used EV sales rose sharply in July to 36,670, up 23.2% from June and 40% compared to last year. Honda had the biggest increase in used EV sales, more than doubling (+103%) month-over-month. Hyundai (+61.3%) and Rivian (60.5%) ranked second and third.

Tesla led used EV sales last month, selling 15,903 vehicles, up 18% year-over-year. GM’s Chevy (3,499 units, +28.6%), Ford (1,967 units, +25.7%), Mercedes-Benz (1,724 units, -12.3%), and Nissan (1,659 units, +19.9%) rounded out the top five.

Although its market share slipped to 43.4% from 45.2%, Tesla remained the leader by a wide margin. Other luxury brands, including BMW and Audi, reported higher used EV sales in July, with increases of 43.87% and 38%, respectively.

According to the report, used EV listing prices reached $35,263 last month, a 1.9% decrease from June. With a price gap of just $1,266, a record low, used electric vehicle prices are closing in on ICE vehicles.

New EV sales also picked up in July. With over 130,000 EVs sold, up 26% from June, the electric vehicle market share reached 9.1%, the second-highest to date.

Ahead of the $7,500 federal tax credit deadline, set to expire at the end of September, 11 brands posted their best EV sales of the year. The top five included Tesla, Chevy, Hyundai, Ford, and Honda. Volkswagen surged to sixth after electric vehicle sales surged 454% last month.

The Honda Prologue starts at $47,400, but with the credit, you can snag one for under $40,000 right now. Honda is also offering monthly leases as low as $159 in California and other ZEV states. In other regions, it’s still listed for as low as $229 per month.

Even Honda’s luxury brand, Acura, is selling more electric vehicles than expected. Through the first half of the year, the Acura ZDX outsold the Cadillac Lyriq, and it’s based on the same GM Ultium platform.

Sales are expected to continue picking up ahead of the deadline. As Cox Automotive highlighted, “July’s performance sets a strong precedent, and as policy support winds down, the market’s ability to respond to real-time demand and brand-level dynamics will be critical in shaping the next phase of growth.”",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Honda-Prologue-lease-Civic.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-16 00:59:05.886539

Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.
Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.
Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina — including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina.
The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That’s after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina — including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Most Americans recognize the blue Energy Star logo on the most energy-efficient appliances. The Trump administration wants to eliminate or privatize it. NPR's Jeff Brady reports on its future.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The Environmental Protection Agency estimates the Energy Star program has saved Americans over a half trillion dollars in energy costs since 1992. That's why supporters, like Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Protection Network - a group of former EPA employees - are defending Energy Star against plans to privatize or eliminate it.

JEREMY SYMONS: It's like sticking a vacuum into the wallets of American families and businesses and sucking cash out for no reason.

BRADY: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, at a May congressional hearing, questioned his own agency's calculations for the money Energy Star saved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE ZELDIN: I would happily and eagerly find out from inside of the agency how they had previously calculated that figure 'cause I anticipate that they're taking credit for a heck of a lot more than they should.

BRADY: NPR asked the EPA if Zeldin has learned more since then. Press secretary Brigit Hirsch said Energy Star's economic benefits remain unclear. But EPA's own staff backed up that half-trillion dollar savings estimate with five pages of technical notes about how the calculations were made.

SAPNA GHEEWALA DOWLA: Energy Star and EPA commonly use conservative, well-established methodologies to calculate the Energy Star savings.

BRADY: Sapna Gheewala Dowla is with the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy. Her group wants more funding for Energy Star, arguing that would save Americans even more money.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: We would love Energy Star to stay at EPA, stay fully funded and stay fully staffed. That is the ideal North Star.

BRADY: Calls for privatizing the program have come mostly from libertarian and conservative groups such as Heritage Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. But at that May hearing, Administrator Zeldin also appeared set on privatizing Energy Star.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ZELDIN: This program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government. And I've actually had multiple entities reach out to EPA over the course of the last few weeks because they want to take over Energy Star.

BRADY: Zeldin did not mention who contacted the EPA. And the agency's spokesperson declined an interview request and wrote in an email, we have nothing more to share at this time. One option for turning Energy Star into a business would be to charge companies to participate. Currently, the government pays those costs. Gheewala Dowla with the Alliance to Save Energy says that's one option.

GHEEWALA DOWLA: Charging for participation would be an interesting and creative solution but could potentially have additional barriers for small manufacturers, for community-based builders or potentially even public sector organizations that do rely on the program but operate on tight margins.

BRADY: Eliminating or privatizing Energy Star also would be disruptive for many in the real estate industry. Energy Star includes a program called Portfolio Manager that helps building owners track energy and water consumption. That information is then used to comply with local conservation regulations. Matt Ellis is the CEO of the real estate technology firm Measurabl.

MATT ELLIS: If there were to be any diminution or dismantling of Energy Star, what we can't do is lose the underlying data.

BRADY: Ellis' company and others are offering services that collect and store that information in case Energy Star goes away. Last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved continued funding for Energy Star. Now the rest of Congress will decide the program's fate in coming months.

As the U.S. solar market expands rapidly, First Solar's focus on domestic manufacturing and technological innovation sets it apart from competitors.","The US Treasury Department has tightened rules on clean energy tax credits, requiring solar companies to use domestic components and labor. The new rules aim to boost the US solar industry and create jobs. First Solar, a leading solar module manufacturer, has seen its net sales primarily from the US, with a smaller portion from India, France, and other countries. The company's sales are expected to be affected by the new rules.

The U.S. Treasury Department has recently implemented stricter rules for clean energy tax credits, mandating that solar companies use domestic components and labor. This move is part of an effort to bolster the U.S. solar industry and create jobs. The new guidelines, outlined in Notice 2025-42, aim to prevent the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility for tax credits and restrict the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of the facility has been built [1].

First Solar, a leading manufacturer of solar modules, has primarily derived its net sales from the U.S., with a smaller portion from international markets such as India and France. The company's sales are expected to be affected by the new rules. First Solar has traditionally relied on a vertically integrated model, controlling its entire value chain from semiconductor cell production to module assembly and recycling. This approach has helped the company mitigate risks from volatile material costs and geopolitical tensions [2].

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has significantly influenced the U.S. clean energy landscape, and First Solar has positioned itself to capitalize on this transformation. The IRA's 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (MPTC) has provided First Solar with a new revenue stream, allowing the company to monetize tax credits generated from domestic production of solar modules and components. In 2025 alone, First Solar sold over $1.5 billion in 45X credits, funding its 10 GW U.S. manufacturing expansion [2].

The new Treasury rules may present challenges for First Solar, but the company's strategic focus on domestic manufacturing and its substantial cash reserves position it to navigate these changes. First Solar's vertically integrated model and IRA-driven cost advantages create a durable competitive advantage in the U.S. solar market, which is expected to meet 55% of annual demand by 2035 [2].

Investors should monitor the impact of the new rules on First Solar's operations and financial performance. However, the company's strategic alignment with the energy transition and its ability to capitalize on IRA incentives make it a compelling long-term investment. As the U.S. solar market expands rapidly, First Solar's focus on domestic manufacturing and technological innovation sets it apart from competitors.

With rising gas prices and growing environmental concerns, drivers are turning to cars that deliver maximum miles per gallon and minimal emissions. The General takes a look at some of the most fuel-efficient vehicles of the year, the ones blending performance, innovation, and sustainability.

Why fuel efficiency matters more than ever

The average U.S. gas price as of July 28 was $3.12 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For daily commuters and families, this translates to hundreds in annual fuel savings or extra costs. Fuel-efficient vehicles not only reduce those expenses but also slash greenhouse gas emissions, helping drivers do their part in the fight against climate change.

A diverse landscape of efficient options

The 2025 lineup reflects the most diverse selection of eco-friendly vehicles in history. From hybrid sedans and compact SUVs to electric vehicles and even fuel-efficient pickup trucks, there’s something for every driver.

Drawing on the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios, the study calculates that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) could deliver between 30 and 780 gigatonnes of cumulative CO2 removal this century—enough, at the high end, to offset more than two decades of current global energy emissions.

Rethinking the Role of the G20 and the Energy Transition South Africa’s G20 presidency offers a unique platform to push an equitable energy transition forward.
Tara Laan, IISD The just energy transition is not just about megawatts and solar panels.","As the global clean energy transition gains momentum, one principle becomes increasingly clear: we cannot talk about equity without addressing gender. And yet, for many women in South Africa—especially those in coal-affected regions like Komati in Emalahleni—the energy transition feels divorced from their everyday realities.

Women and underrepresented groups are among the most vulnerable to climate change and tend to face higher rates of energy poverty. As economies and communities transition away from fossil fuels, marginalized groups could be disproportionately impacted if governments depend on top down policy-making and overlook lived realities.

Yet, the energy transition is also an opportunity to help level the playing field. With a fair share of government resources and a voice in decision making, communities can shape their own future—and evidence shows that this has shared benefits for the whole economy.

During a Think 20 convening hosted by Oxfam South Africa and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)—held in recognition of South Africa’s G20 presidency and putting the spotlight on the role of women in the energy transition during women’s month—the message was clear: climate justice is gender justice. If the energy transition is to be truly just, it must center the voices, needs, and leadership of women and underrepresented communities.

A System That Excludes Women by Design

Too often, the models used to finance and implement energy transition projects are designed around a formal economy—one that assumes business registration, credit history, and institutional connections. This leaves many women, especially informal workers and entrepreneurs, locked out.

As Linet Miriti, Chief Gender Officer at the African Development Bank (AfDB) noted in remarks on gender and just transition, even with progressive initiatives like Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA), systemic barriers persist—from gender data gaps to rigid eligibility requirements and male-dominated value chains. Still, progress is possible. In Mpumalanga, 25 women farmers are leading the way in climate-smart agriculture, supported by AfDB-backed initiatives that combine financing with skills development.

Women are not just energy consumers. They are innovators, producers, and community leaders—and yet they’re structurally locked out of the very solutions meant to empower them.

Linet Miriti, African Development Bank

Decision-making power also demands much needed attention. Women, youth, and persons with disabilities, must have the power to inform and decide on the solutions that will actually work for them. Placing those affected in charge of decision making can have a multitude of benefits, for governments and communities supporting inclusive solutions and community buy-in of energy transitions.

If there’s no childcare, no transport, no stipends, women won’t access skilling programs. It’s not about availability. It’s about accessibility.

Lebogang Mulaisi, Presidential Climate Commission

Participation That’s Not Just Performative

Recent research on community participation in Mpumalanga’s energy transition demonstrates that while institutions insist consultation has occurred, community members often feel otherwise. The issue is not whether draft policies have been shared with communities—it’s about the relevance of those policies and the respect shown for community input in their formulation.

Often when communities say, “We haven’t been consulted,” it does not mean they are not aware of the consultations but rather that, “they weren’t heard.” Presentations offered at town halls are often pre-packaged, focused on what’s already been decided. When community members ask about schools, water, safety, or children's wellbeing—questions central to their lives—there are no answers.

This disconnect is rooted in how problems are defined. Policy-making still operates from the top down, with experts diagnosing problems and designing solutions before communities are brought in—if at all.

Researchers from the Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI) in partnership with IISD adopted a different approach: ethnographic research. Listening to stories, rather than distributing questionnaires, uncovered critical overlooked issues such as:

vanishing community infrastructure (e.g. water, roads, sports fields) previously provided by coal companies,

lack of child care and support for children with learning difficulties,

lack of qualified psychologists in regions dealing with intergenerational disadvantage,

the essential role of informal care and local networks in community survival.

These findings underline the urgent need to move beyond performative participation in the just transition process toward genuine co-production of solutions and policies. When women are included from the outset, they are not just beneficiaries of new programs but active creators, leaders, and decision-makers. This leads to more equitable participation in training, access to resources, entrepreneurship, and leadership in the green economy, sustaining long-term social transformation.

Rethinking the Role of the G20 and the Energy Transition

South Africa’s G20 presidency offers a unique platform to push an equitable energy transition forward. Yet for many citizens, the G20 still feels like a distant diplomatic process. As Bertha Chikoro from GenderCC-Southern Africa noted, “It’s happening here—but to most South Africans, it’s happening out there.”

It's very important that government support for clean energy and just transition doesn't exacerbate or perpetuate disadvantage as we move through the energy transition.

Tara Laan, IISD

The just energy transition is not just about megawatts and solar panels. It is about transforming entire economic systems, reshaping value chains, and redefining who drives development. As Mmathebe Zvobwo from True Caller South Africa put it, we should view this transition like the steam engine in the first industrial revolution or AI in the current digital era—it’s a moment to rebuild the economy from the ground up. That means:

integrating energy transition jobs and skills into local economies,

rethinking value chains so that women and marginalized groups are not merely included, but centered,

creating local economic ecosystems where renewable energy becomes a driver of both public and economic good.

A Call to Action

Lebogang Mulaisi of the Presidential Climate Commission warned: if we don’t act now—with urgency and accountability—we risk repeating the failures of the past.

This transition is not just about technology or emissions—it’s about who holds the power to shape the future.

Without a mindset shift that sees underrepresented people as solution-holders, not just ‘vulnerable groups,’ we’re not transitioning — we’re reinforcing old systems.

Nkateko Chauke , Oxfam South Africa

If we get it right, this moment could be a turning point—not just for clean energy, but for equity and justice. If we get it wrong, we risk deepening the very inequalities the transition promises to address.

To make the energy transition truly just, governments in South Africa and across the G20 have a powerful opportunity: to design policies and investments that put women and marginalized communities at the heart of the new energy economy—not on the sidelines.",https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-08/women-solar-panel-walking.jpg?itok=qTn9QaxW,N,,2025-08-16 03:59:41.500930

Boosting EV Charging Infrastructure

The largest portion of the funding—$9.7 million—comes from Natural Resources Canada’s (NRCan) Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program (ZEVIP). This will support 23 projects installing over 850 new EV chargers nationwide, with most located in Quebec. Installations will include a mix of Level 2 and DC fast chargers in public spaces, workplaces, multi-unit residential buildings, and along highways.

Major recipients include Propulsion Québec, which will add 320 Level 2 chargers across the province, and Les Pétroles R.L. Inc., which will deploy 62 chargers, including 34 fast-charging units. Other projects will target specialized needs—such as IKEA’s installation of heavy-duty truck chargers in Beauharnois, and the University Hospital of Montreal’s chargers for ambulance fleets.

Advancing Battery and Fleet Technology

Another $8 million is allocated through the Energy Innovation Program (EIP) to fund six projects that tackle challenges in the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sector. These initiatives focus on improving battery performance, developing vehicle-to-grid charging solutions, and optimizing charging in remote and northern climates.

Highlights include Gamotech Inc., which is creating mobile auxiliary energy storage units for heavy-duty trucks to power construction and municipal equipment, and Calogy Solutions, developing high-voltage lithium-ion battery prototypes for commercial vehicles.

Greener Commercial Transportation

The remaining $7.9 million comes from NRCan’s Green Freight Program (GFP), supporting four projects that will help transportation, construction, and public works fleets transition to cleaner operations. This includes purchasing trucks powered by compressed and renewable natural gas, lowering both emissions and fuel costs.

Aligning with National Climate Goals

Transportation accounts for roughly 18% of Canada’s total greenhouse gas emissions, with a significant share from heavy-duty vehicles. The new investments align with Canada’s ZEV mandate, which requires 20% of new vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2026, ramping up to 100% by 2035.

To support these targets, Ottawa aims to have 50,000 public EV chargers installed nationwide by 2030. Currently, NRCan data shows about 13,623 public charging stations in operation.",https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/canada.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 05:01:54.497449

According to a dealer bulletin, the 2025 Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology – AKA the electric G-Wagon – now comes with $9,500 in lease cash, up from last month’s $7,500. That’s a 27% jump in savings. The move comes just weeks before the $7,500 EV lease tax credit loophole closes on September 30.

Like most EVs leased in the US, the G-Class has been able to qualify for the credit even though it’s excluded from purchase incentives. That benefit is about to disappear, which likely explains why Mercedes is boosting the offers now.

The electric G-Wagon doesn’t come cheap. With a base price of $162,650, the $9,500 incentive amounts to only a 5.8% discount. The SUV also carries a steep advertised lease: $1,869 per month for 36 months with $14,613 due at signing. Factor it all in, and you’re really paying about $2,275 a month for 10,000 miles a year. Current Mercedes deals run through September 2.

For context, the 2025 G 580’s lease money factor now sits at 0.00180, which works out to around 4.3% APR – lower than the standard rates previously on offer.

Performance-wise, the electric G-Wagon earns an EPA rating of 62 MPGe and an electric range of 239 miles. Not groundbreaking numbers, but for buyers who want the iconic G-Wagon experience with zero tailpipe emissions, this is it.

With federal lease credits ending soon, Mercedes appears to be betting that drivers looking for a last chance at big EV savings will jump now rather than later.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 1, 2025, EPA published a proposed rule titled ``Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards'' (90 FR 36288). The public comment for this proposed rule was scheduled to end on September 15, 2025. The public hearing on this rule is scheduled for August 19, 20, and 21, 2025. In EPA's Federal Register notice announcing the public hearing (90 FR 36125), EPA stated the agency would hold the public hearing on August 19 and 20, and EPA would consider adding a third day, August 21, if needed. EPA has now decided to add a third day (August 21, 2025) and is considering adding a fourth day (August 22, 2025). The Clean Air Act requires that the record of proceedings allowing oral presentation of data, views, and arguments on a proposed rule be kept open for 30 days after completion of the proceeding to provide an opportunity for submission of rebuttal and supplementary information. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(5). Because EPA plans to hold a third of public hearing for this proposed rule, and is considering adding a fourth day, the final ``proceeding allowing oral presentation of data, views, and arguments,'' will be held on August 21, 2025, and potentially on August 22, 2025. For this reason, the public comment period for this proposed rule is extended and will now end on September 22, 2025.

FHWA published a Notice and Request for Comment on August 13, 2025, indicating the availability of the new guidance and requesting comments to inform further changes as appropriate.

The interim final guidance is available on the agency's website.

Comments can be submitted via www.regulations.gov and are due August 27, 2025. States have 30 days to submit their EV Infrastructure Deployment Plans.

NEVI is a state funding program that was established by the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act.

State governments receive federal funding based on an established formula. Whether public power is eligible to apply for grant funding within their respective state depends on how the state runs their NEVI program. Industry analysis and dashboards reveal that funding thus far has largely been distributed to non-utilities.

The FHWA press release describes how this new guidance supersedes previous guidance documents and policies, with the exception of those with clear and express statutory language.

The new guidance seeks to streamline the program, reduce requirements, and provide states with more flexibility.

Compared to the initial NEVI guidance, this version:

• Minimizes plan content requirements;

• Simplifies plan approval process;

• Reduces community engagement requirements ;

• Provides states flexibility in determining distance between stations;

• Minimizes requirements for states to consider electric grid integration and renewable energy;

• Encourages selection of charging locations where station owners are also the site host;

• Eliminates requirements for states to address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience, and terrain considerations; and

• Provides states with more flexibility to determine when their system is built out allowing NEVI funds to be used on public roads statewide.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-15 23:00:43.455265

Even though the guidance is less restrictive than some clean energy developers feared, the move still represents the latest action taken by the Trump administration to derail wind and solar projects since passage of the GOP’s sweeping new tax law.

The law terminated existing investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects that start producing electricity after 2027, but provided more time for projects that begin construction within a year.

Trump then directed Treasury to “strictly enforce” the end of the credits for wind and solar facilities, including by issuing new guidance concerning when a project is deemed to have begun construction. Traditionally, that longstanding metric has allowed projects to qualify by taking steps such as incurring 5 percent of a project’s total cost or beginning physical construction activities.

Tax lawyers and clean energy developers have warned the guidance could mark an unprecedented and legally dubious attempt to rewrite congressional intent, and could be challenged in court.

The guidance could have immediate impacts for hundreds of planned solar and wind projects across the country. Adrian Deveny, founder and president of policy advisory firm Climate Vision, said the new guidance will “pull the rug out from under the entire pipeline of wind and solar projects that are in development.”

Deveny, who helped craft the clean energy credits as a former policy director for Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, said Trump is “determined to jack up American energy bills.”

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement called it a “blatant rejection” of what Congress passed in the tax law.

In the weeks following Trump’s directive, the administration has also undertaken a host of actions across agencies to further imperil wind and solar development, including major actions at the Interior Department that have received pushback from some Senate Republicans.

The House Freedom Caucus said in an X post Friday that the new guidance, along with Interior’s permitting restrictions, “build on the successful repeal of the Green New Scam in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“These steps are fully consistent with Congress’s intent in enacting OBBBA and strengthen our electric grid while protecting taxpayers,” said the Freedom Caucus, adding that Republican senators holding up Treasury nominees are “out of step with the President’s plan, the will of Congress, and the very platform the Republican Party ran and won on.”

Grassley, meanwhile, said in a statement that the guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand.”

“I appreciate the work Secretary [Scott] Bessent and his team put in to issue guidance that reflects some of the concerns Congress and industry leaders have raised,” Grassley said. A spokesperson declined to address whether he would lift the holds.

Curtis said in a statement he is continuing to review the changes but praised Treasury for “balancing various concerns and perspectives.”

The new guidance — which is not open to public comment — will apply to projects after Sept. 2.

To demonstrate they have commenced construction, all wind projects and most solar projects will be required to show they are conducting physical work, rather than relying on the 5 percent safe harbor. Only solar facilities generating less than 1.5 megawatts, typically rooftop solar installations, would be allowed to use the safe harbor.

Projects will also have to demonstrate a “continuous program of construction,” with only limited exceptions permitted for certain construction delays.

Keith Martin, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said the new guidance discards the “bright-line 5 percent test” in favor of a “less clear facts-and-circumstances approach.”

While many developers relied on the physical work test in the past, it “leaves some uncertainty about how much work is required,” Martin said. “The financiers and tax insurers will have to decide where they feel comfortable drawing lines.”

Still, the guidance does not go as far as some in the clean energy industry had feared, maintaining the so-called continuity window that gives a project four years to be placed into service after construction begins.

The four-year window has been a particular issue for some conservatives and opponents of prior guidance, who argued it punts the end date for the solar and wind credits beyond the Trump administration’s promised timeline for ending the subsidies.

The guidance also appears to largely maintain the same physical work test that dates back more than a decade and gives developers a two-week timeline to qualify under the existing policy. Some developers had worried the guidance would apply immediately or even retroactively.

In a statement, Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, credited the “continued advocacy” of senators who crafted the tax credit compromise for “avoiding greater impediments to energy deployment” in Friday’s guidance.

Trump’s executive order also directed Treasury to take prompt action to implement the foreign entity of concern restrictions in the tax law, which bar credits from going to companies with links to countries like China and could disqualify projects even if they meet the commence construction standard. The guidance issued Friday states in a footnote that the agency is “currently drafting additional guidance” on those provisions.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F93%2F82%2F9cfcc5c94ed581dfa4ca34a48405%2Fcongress-tax-cuts-42082.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 23:01:07.055634

Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, at a summit she held at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Friday.

Titled “The Regulatory Pendulum,” Maloy’s forum focused on how federal regulations have swung back and forth depending on what political party controls the White House, and how that’s created uncertainty not only in energy development, but also delays in completing major projects like bridges and pipelines.

She and the panelists argued it’s holding Utah and the U.S. back by bogging major projects down in years of bureaucratic processes.

The forum’s perspectives focused on regulatory issues, and speakers did not include environmental advocates. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, a preservation nonprofit that has been a vocal critic of mining and industrial development in Utah’s redrock wilderness, did not immediately return a request for comment Friday.

During the form, Maloy highlighted proposed legislation she’s sponsoring — the Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforcement Act, or the FREE Act — meant to streamline the federal permitting process.

Simplifying federal regulations has been discussed for decades, with only incremental statutory changes passed by Congress and temporary changes from presidential executive orders. But Maloy said she’s “hopeful” that Congress can get it done, saying “we have the right alignment right now between all three branches of government.”

“We have an administration that’s willing to break out of a lot of paradigms and do things differently than they’ve been done before,” Maloy said, though she acknowledged that approach alone is “controversial.”

But she argued “that’s what it’s going to take to get permit reform done.”

“We have a Congress that has bipartisan agreement that we need to do a permitting reform. That alone is a huge rarity. And we have a judicial branch that, in my opinion, keeps daring Congress to do it better,” she said.

Maloy said the courts have sent a clear message that Congress needs to write clearer laws that leave federal agencies the power to “fill in the gaps,” which she said has led to an unwieldy federal permitting process.

“Much like a weed that grows up in (a crack in ) the sidewalk, it doesn’t just fill the gaps. It makes the gap wider, causes problems, and makes everything uneven,” Maloy said

Even though Republicans currently control the White House and Congress, however, Maloy said it’s going to take bipartisan support to fix the issue.

“It has to be bipartisan, because administrations change,” she said. “Both sides of Congress swing back and forth. And in order to stop this pendulum and not have the pettiness of, ‘We’re going to roll that back just because it came from the other side,’ we’re going to have to have both sides bought in. And I think there’s reason to hope for that too.”

This year’s version of Maloy’s FREE Act advanced out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in May, with a 23-19 vote. Though none of the Democrats on that voted in favor of her bill, “they didn’t try to stop it,” she said.

“Those are the things we’re up against, where nobody actually disagreed with the bill, in fact they’re really excited about it,” Maloy said, “but because of how party politics work” Democrats voted against it, and now she’s having a hard time finding a Democratic co-sponsor because of those no votes in committee.

Still, she said she’s hopeful there will eventually be bipartisan support, since people from both sides are becoming frustrated with how long permitting processes can take, whether it’s for a mining project, a bridge or a solar farm.

Jeffrey Rosen, currently a nonresident senior fellow at the right-of-center think tank, the American Enterprise Institute, spoke at Maloy’s summit. He previously worked for President Donald Trump’s first administration as acting attorney general and deputy attorney general, as well as deputy U.S. secretary of transportation.

Rosen gave an overview of past attempts at streamlining federal regulations spanning decades, but he said there’s plenty of “unfinished work” for Congress to do.

“The reality is the problem of permitting delays continues to need more work to be done, even though … we’ve spent 25 years trying to address this,” he said, applauding Maloy for her efforts. “It’s a subject that doesn’t seem glamorous or easy to understand, and yet it plays such a huge role in our country as to what gets built, what gets mined, how power is supplied and delivered, and lots of other crucial components of our economy and quality of life.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Maloy-summit-2-2048x1734.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 21:01:12.205402

As energy bills reach an all-time high in the past 12 years, four states are lending a helping hand to their residents.

Electricity prices in many areas are currently at or near all-time highs thanks to a number of factors such as increased demand, general inflation, rising fuel costs, and investments in grid upgrades.

Americans are being confronted with yet another summer of record high prices to keep their homes cool, per a recent report from National Energy Assistance Directors Association, or NEADA.

The average electricity cost from June to September is expected to reach $784 this year, marking the highest price of electricity in at least 12 years.

These high costs are especially harmful to low-income households, with an increasing number of Americans becoming unable to pay their energy bills.

They are at risk of having their electricity shut off and being left vulnerable to extreme summer temperatures.

Low-income households struggling to pay for heating and cooling costs can turn to LIHEAP, a federal program that provides bill payment assistance and energy crisis assistance to Americans in all US states and territories.

Some states also have their own specific programs to help cash-strapped Americans with their energy bills.

Launched in 2024, the Residential Energy Assistance Payment, or REAP, program will automatically apply seven credits worth $25 each to qualifying New Jersey residents' utility bills this summer, per the New Jersey Board of Public Utilitieswebsite.

The utility credit, which adds up to $175, does not require an application, as utility companies in New Jersey already determined households eligible for REAP's second round and began applying the first $25 credit on August 1.

REAP eligibility was determined using enrollment data previously collected on households who qualified for the Winter Termination Program between November 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025.

The program protects participants from having their utilities shut off in winter if they are unable to pay.

TEXAS

Over in Texas, the Comprehensive Energy Assistance Program, or CEAP, helps low-income households with their energy needs by helping to pay their utility bills.

In order to qualify for assistance from CEAP, households generally need to have a gross income at or below 150% of the federal poverty guidelines.

The allocation limits, per the CEAP website, are:

Households at 0-50% of the poverty line: up to $2,400

Households at 51-75%: up to $2,300

Households at 75-150%: up to $2,200

Texas’s CEAP offers such high annual benefits because it is designed to cover both high summer cooling costs and emergency energy needs in an extreme climate rather than a small monthly discount.

Beyond just utility bill assistance, for example, CEAP offers a Crisis Assistance Component, which may include payments or appliance repairs when households lose service connection or are facing extreme weather conditions.

GEORGIA

Georgia has several state programs to help residents with energy bills.

Georgia Power customers with a household income at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, for example, can receive a $33.50 discount each month on their electric bill.

This comes out to $402 in savings per year.

""The discount is limited solely to the metered electric service and fuel cost recovery components of a customer's bill and does not apply to sales taxes or any other aspect of the bill,"" reads the state's Public Service Commission website.

This program started in May last year and has since been expanded, offering substantial support in covering utility costs for seniors, SSI recipients, and more.

CALIFORNIA

Californians struggling to pay their utility bills as energy costs surge are in luck, as many utility companies and community organizations offer smaller-scale or emergency assistance funds for certain service areas, per the National Relief Program website.

The Energy Assistance Fund, or EAF, for example, hands out a one-time bill payment of up to $200 for those in need of help, or $300 for all-electric households.

The program is specific to Southern California Edison, or SCE, customers.

Meanwhile, Californians who have received a disconnection notice can get their hands on a one-time energy credit of up to $300 via PG&E's REACH program.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful.
Stripping out requirements The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers.
As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project.
""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises.","The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures, that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it.

The Department of Transportation froze the funds in February, and months passed with no indication of when funding would be restarted. A coalition of more than a dozen states sued the federal government, alleging that the administration was violating the law and defying the will of Congress. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements.

Officials made it clear they haven't changed their minds about the merits of funding chargers — but they're acknowledging the separation of powers that give Congress, not the executive branch, authority over spending decisions.

""While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the states' lawsuit against the freeze, said it was ""encouraging"" news that the administration is restarting the program. But, he said, it's not an automatic end to the legal challenge.

""It is promising that we're seeing some responses to our lawsuit and we're seeing some effort to give us the money that Congress has mandated,"" he told NPR. ""We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately.""

Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause.

""It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,"" Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement.

Stripping out requirements

The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers. To access the funds, states had to submit a plan for where and how they would build chargers. Once the plan was approved, each state's department of transportation would work with companies to install chargers, and then get reimbursed by the federal government.

It took more than two years after the law's passage for the first chargers to open to the public. As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project. But after the slow start, the same dataset shows that funding awards were accelerating through 2024 — until the Trump administration hit the brakes.

The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from ""a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy.""

The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. States will no longer be required to engage with rural or underserved communities while planning charger locations. They do not need to direct benefits toward disadvantaged communities. They don't need to demonstrate that they've factored in labor or safety standards, or provided opportunities for minority-owned businesses. They won't need to address evacuations, snow removal or extreme weather in their plans.

Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. States will have more discretion on charger locations.

The DOT didn't respond to NPR's requests for an interview. But in a statement posted on the department's website, Duffy said this new guidance would speed things up. ""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let's cut the waste and do it right,"" he wrote. ""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.""

Mixed reviews from the EV charger world

Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies.

""We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape,"" wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. ""Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs.""

The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was ""encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers.""

""We're optimistic,"" says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. ""They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program."" He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space.

Of course, removing some requirements won't eliminate the need to find locations and contract with builders and pull permits, all of which takes time.

And there's a common refrain in the EV charger world: While people don't mind the changes to the guidance, they are frustrated by the delay and disruption they caused.

Alex Laska of Third Way — who had been sharply critical of the inefficiencies of the Biden program — gave mixed reviews to the Trump administration revisions. He noted that some forms of ""red tape,"" like requirements about the type of charger, remain.

And other requirements have been deleted after states had already completed the work to meet them, meaning it won't actually save any time or effort.

Aside from loosening the requirements on location, the change is ""kind of a nothingburger,"" he says. ""This guidance was not worth holding up the program for, you know, now over half a year.""

Andrew Bennett, the CEO of DRIIVZ, a company that builds software for charging stations, says the freeze disrupted a lot of projects that might have gotten greenlit this year.

In the meantime, while chargers have been built with private money, Bennett says, it's not enough: ""We need about six times more just to keep up.""

The new Treasury guidance came in response to an executive order Trump issued in the wake of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress passed six weeks ago.
Wrangling among Republicans over the solar and wind tax credits threatened to derail the landmark legislation, until a compromise was reached that protected wind and solar projects from the phaseout of their tax credits if they started construction within the next 12 months.
“The Treasury Department’s decision to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits undermines the integrity of our energy grid and our legislative process,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement.
“Throughout these conversations, we have shared the goal of responsibly ending the decades-long tax credits for these industries while providing a soft landing.","Wind and solar projects will have to meet more difficult work requirements to continue to access federal tax credits over the next four years, under guidance the Trump administration unveiled Friday.

Although renewable energy advocates said that the Treasury Department’s new guidelines amounted to an acceleration of the phaseout of federal support for wind and solar, there was widespread relief throughout the industry that the crackdown was not greater. Three of the four biggest gains on Wall Street for the day were posted by solar companies, led by Sunrun, the nation’s largest rooftop solar installer, with a 33 percent jump in price.

The new Treasury guidance came in response to an executive order Trump issued in the wake of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress passed six weeks ago. Wrangling among Republicans over the solar and wind tax credits threatened to derail the landmark legislation, until a compromise was reached that protected wind and solar projects from the phaseout of their tax credits if they started construction within the next 12 months.

The Treasury Department’s new guidance essentially changes the long-standing definition of what it means to “start construction.” Advocacy groups for the industry and environmental groups immediately protested that the new guidance flew in the face of the agreement that members of Congress reached.

“The Treasury Department’s decision to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits undermines the integrity of our energy grid and our legislative process,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. “In the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress explicitly chose to provide energy companies with one year to phase out tax credits to keep energy prices low while meeting growing power demand.”

But some industry analysts believed renewables dodged a bullet. Wind and solar developers will still get four years to complete their credit-eligible projects. And although work will have to be continuous in order for a project to maintain eligibility for tax credits, the Treasury Department included a lengthy list of interruptions that will be considered excusable, such as work stoppages for severe weather or natural disasters, or for labor shortages or inability to obtain specialized equipment.

Climate advocates would have preferred the “rules to stay the same—just as they would have preferred the entire clean energy tax credit framework to remain as it had been when the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022,” said Pavel Molchanov, managing director of renewable energy and clean technology for the investment firm Raymond James. “But, considering the current political landscape, the outcome was about as benign as it could have been.”

Previously, the Treasury Department viewed the start of construction as paying or incurring 5 percent of a project’s cost. That simple 5 percent test is eliminated for all projects that are greater than 1.5 megawatts. Instead, those projects will need to meet a more complex “physical work test” to qualify. Under the test, “work of a significant nature” must be performed, and the work must be continuous without interruption.

Because for most large projects, there will be no strict measure of what it means to begin work, such as the dollar amount of work done or the percentage of work completed, there will be more room for the Treasury Department to make judgment calls on whether work has started in time for the project to qualify for tax credits.

Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the result will be uncertainty for projects and greater difficulty for companies in obtaining financing.

“Congress provided a narrow but clear path for businesses bringing investments and jobs to communities around the country with new solar and wind projects, but this administration is trying to erect new roadblocks,” Kennedy said.

Soon after he signed the One Big Beautiful Bill, Trump issued an executive order directing the Treasury Department to rapidly “eliminate the market distortions and costs imposed on taxpayers by so-called ‘green’ energy subsidies.” The order reportedly came in response to the concerns of fiscal conservatives in the House who nearly derailed the bill in its final hours.

But two Republican advocates for wind and solar reportedly were pressing the Trump administration for lenience: Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and John Curtis of Utah. Grassley announced he would maintain a hold on Trump’s Treasury nominees over the issue.

In an emailed statement on Friday, Grassley appeared optimistic about the impact of Treasury’s guidance, saying that it “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand.”

Curtis said he would be reviewing the new Treasury guidance to understand its full impact.

“I appreciate the work of Secretary [Scott] Bessent and his staff in balancing various concerns and perspectives to address the President’s executive order on wind and solar projects,” he said in a statement. “Throughout these conversations, we have shared the goal of responsibly ending the decades-long tax credits for these industries while providing a soft landing.

“I will continue working to ensure Utah companies—and all American innovators—have the certainty and opportunity they need to deliver the future we all want: affordable, reliable, clean energy rooted in American ingenuity,” Curtis added.

When asked whether they would lift their hold on Treasury nominees in response to the new guidance, a spokesperson for Grassley said that he is “continuing to review the guidance and speak with the industry,” while Curtis’s spokesperson said that there was “no change as of now.”

A record-setting plug-in hybrid that redefines luxury commuting and off-road capability

Range Rover has just given its Sport PHEV a headline-worthy achievement: the longest electric-only range of any luxury plug-in hybrid SUV on sale today. At 53 miles per charge, the 2025 model outpaces its competitors and reinforces the brand’s commitment to blending performance, refinement, and all-terrain ability.

Why does this car matter right now?

The luxury SUV market is shifting rapidly toward electrification, but many buyers remain hesitant to commit to full EVs. The Range Rover Sport PHEV P460e Dynamic SE meets them halfway, providing substantial electric range for daily driving without sacrificing a long-distance gasoline safety net. With a 31.8-kWh battery roughly triple the capacity of many rivals, the Range Rover delivers real-world EV capability that can handle a week’s worth of short commutes before the gas engine needs to fire up.

This matters in 2025 because buyers increasingly demand EV-like efficiency without charging anxiety. According to industry data, sales of Land Rover plug-in hybrids are up 29 percent year-over-year, signaling a sweet spot between sustainability and practicality. For Range Rover, it’s an opportunity to own the conversation around long-range PHEVs while reinforcing its position as a luxury leader.

How does it compare to rivals?

With 53 miles of EPA-estimated electric range, the Sport PHEV bests the BMW X5 xDrive50e (40 miles), the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe (26 miles), and the Volvo XC90 Recharge (32 miles). Its 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine paired with a 160-kW electric motor produces 543 horsepower , enough to launch the nearly 5,600-pound SUV from 0 to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds. That puts it squarely in performance SUV territory, competing with six-figure Bentleys and Aston Martins.

Off-road capability remains a differentiator. While rivals focus on tarmac poise, the Range Rover Sport PHEV comes standard with Terrain Response 2, adjusting power delivery and suspension settings for sand, snow, mud, and more. Land Rover validated the system in 50°C desert heat and across 300-foot dunes, a proving ground few hybrids dare attempt.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

The 2025 Range Rover Sport PHEV suits drivers who want luxury, real electric range, and legitimate off-road skill. It’s ideal for suburban commuters who can charge at home, countryside dwellers who value go-anywhere ability, and executives who appreciate arriving in silence. Pet owners and golfers will appreciate the 31.9 cubic feet of cargo space, while passengers enjoy heated rear seats, a 19-speaker Meridian sound system, and air suspension that glides over rough pavement.

Those who live in cramped cities might think twice. At nearly 16 feet long and more than 6.5 feet wide, navigating tight parking garages can be stressful. And with a base price of $96,575, it demands a budget that could buy a smaller luxury SUV and a dedicated EV for daily use. For some, the Range Rover’s scale and cost will outweigh its technical prowess.

What is the long-term significance?

The 2025 Range Rover Sport PHEV signals a future where plug-in hybrids are more than a stopgap between gasoline and full electric. By offering EV range that rivals some early electric cars, it challenges other manufacturers to invest in larger battery packs and more capable hybrid systems. If the market responds positively, we could see more PHEVs targeting 50-plus miles of range, which would significantly reduce fuel consumption without requiring drivers to change their travel habits.

In broader terms, it’s a reminder that sustainability can be aspirational. The Sport PHEV wraps its advanced tech in a package that appeals to status-conscious buyers, proving that environmental responsibility doesn’t have to come at the expense of craftsmanship, capability, or performance.",https://www.wnct.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2025/08/download-2025-08-15T144217.026.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-15 23:01:25.089253

In conclusion, Duke Energy's proposed merger is more than a cost-cutting exercise—it is a strategic pivot in a sector redefining its role in the 21st-century energy economy.","In 2025, the U.S. energy sector is witnessing a seismic shift as regulatory frameworks and market dynamics converge to redefine long-term investment strategies. At the forefront of this transformation is Duke Energy's proposed merger of its two Carolinas-based utilities—Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). This $3.2 billion savings-driven reorganization, pending regulatory approval, is not merely a corporate restructuring but a strategic response to a broader energy infrastructure realignment. For investors, the merger underscores how policy shifts and consolidation trends are reshaping the utility sector's value proposition.

Regulatory Tailwinds and Policy-Driven Returns

The 2025 regulatory landscape in the Carolinas has created a fertile ground for utility consolidation. North Carolina's Power Bill Reduction Act, enacted in early 2025, removed a 2030 carbon emissions target and introduced cost-recovery mechanisms for capital projects. This legislative pivot has enabled utilities like Duke Energy to secure long-term funding for infrastructure upgrades while maintaining rate stability—a critical factor for investor confidence.

Federal policies under the Trump administration further amplify this trend. By extending the life of coal plants and incentivizing natural gas and nuclear development, the administration has prioritized reliability and affordability over rapid decarbonization. While this slows the net-zero transition, it stabilizes utility earnings by reducing exposure to volatile renewable energy markets. For Duke Energy, this means its $87 billion capital plan—focused on grid modernization and new gas generation—can proceed with regulatory support, ensuring predictable returns for shareholders.

Consolidation as a Catalyst for Efficiency

Duke Energy's merger of DEC and DEP is emblematic of a national trend: utilities are consolidating to streamline operations and reduce costs. The company projects $1 billion in customer savings by 2038 through operational efficiencies, including the elimination of redundant infrastructure and regulatory filings. By merging four retail rate structures into one, Duke aims to cut administrative overhead by 3% and operational costs by 97%, creating a leaner entity capable of scaling investments in grid resilience and renewable integration.

This consolidation is not without precedent. Since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Progress Energy, the company has already saved customers $1 billion through joint dispatch and shared infrastructure. The proposed full merger now seeks to unlock the next phase of savings by removing regulatory barriers to cross-state coordination. For investors, this signals a shift toward larger, more integrated utility models that can better manage the complexities of modern energy systems.

The ""Share the Benefits"" Plan: Balancing Regional Interests

A key hurdle for the merger is addressing regional cost imbalances, particularly in South Carolina, where retail customers may face higher near-term expenses. Duke's ""Share the Benefits"" plan—a $55 million annual contribution from wholesale customers and a $25 million annual transfer from North Carolina retail customers—demonstrates the company's commitment to equitable outcomes. This proactive approach not only mitigates regulatory pushback but also aligns with investor preferences for stakeholder-focused governance.

Market Implications and Investor Opportunities

The merger's success hinges on regulatory approvals, but its implications for the broader market are already evident. The S&P 500 Utilities Index has outperformed the broader market in 2025, rising 9.2% compared to the S&P 500's 6.2%. This outperformance reflects investor confidence in utilities' ability to secure rate base growth and navigate macroeconomic headwinds. Duke Energy, with its 3.5% dividend yield and 5–7% EPS growth guidance through 2029, is a prime example of how strategic consolidation can enhance shareholder value.

Moreover, the decline in 10-year Treasury yields to 4.23% in 2025 has reduced capital-raising costs for utilities, further boosting valuations. For Duke, this means its $87 billion capital plan can be funded at lower interest rates, enhancing returns on equity. Investors should also note the company's disciplined capital allocation, including the recent $2.48 billion sale of its Tennessee gas business, which strengthens its FFO-to-debt ratio and reduces credit risk.

Positioning for the Future

As the energy transition accelerates, Duke Energy's merger positions it to lead in a sector increasingly defined by scale and regulatory agility. The combined utility will have the operational flexibility to optimize distributed generation, reduce solar curtailment, and invest in transmission upgrades critical for meeting surging demand. With AI-driven data centers and electric vehicle adoption driving electricity use, utilities that can scale infrastructure efficiently will outperform peers.

For investors, the Carolinas merger is a harbinger of a larger trend: energy portfolios must now prioritize companies with strong regulatory alignment, robust capital plans, and consolidation strategies. Duke Energy's ability to navigate 2025's policy shifts while delivering tangible customer savings makes it a compelling long-term holding.

In conclusion, Duke Energy's proposed merger is more than a cost-cutting exercise—it is a strategic pivot in a sector redefining its role in the 21st-century energy economy. As regulatory and market forces continue to converge, utilities that embrace consolidation and innovation will drive the next wave of infrastructure growth. For investors, the Carolinas merger offers a blueprint for capitalizing on this transformation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-15 20:04:39.408397

Governors Island, now a public climate solutions hub, engages innovators in developing sustainable ideas.

Seaweed City, a project on the island, uses kelp to help purify water and promote marine biodiversity.

The Billion Oyster Project, one of the island’s key initiatives, has restored over 150 million oysters to New York Harbor.

Key quote:

“It’s remarkable how the default solutions for improving the city’s waterways are often energy-intensive, engineered, and not conducive to marine life. By contrast, seaweed restoration supports biodiversity in a natural and sustainable way.”

— Shanjana Mahmud, co-executive director of Seaweed City

Why this matters:

Governors Island has found a new life as a beacon for climate innovation, bringing sustainability front and center in New York Harbor. Now home to projects like Seaweed City and the Billion Oyster Project, as well as a hotspot for urban composting and green initiatives, the island has become a living lab for climate solutions. As climate change puts increasing pressure on coastal cities, this transformation to environmental incubator is a hopeful glimpse of what urban spaces could become — dynamic, regenerative hubs driving solutions for a more sustainable future.

In short:

San Francisco International aims to become the world’s first zero-carbon, zero-waste airport with initiatives like food donations and a plastics ban.

Portland International is rolling out a Green Plate Program with reusable dishware, expanding airport-wide after its trial run.

Newark Liberty and other airports are starting to recycle cigarette butts, a significant environmental concern because their toxic components often end up in waterways and the ocean.

Key quote:

""Airports are a breeding ground for cigarette litter.""

— Ernie Simpson, global VP and chief scientist, TerraCycle

Why this matters:

With growing pressure to reduce waste and environmental impact, many airports are turning to innovative solutions that not only aim to clean up their act but also shift how we think about travel. These efforts are focused on shifting the entire travel experience toward a healthier, more environmentally conscious future. Though much more remains to be done, these projects offer potential if replicated more broadly.

In short:

The Jackpile Mine, once the world’s largest open-pit uranium mine, remains a toxic Superfund site, with contaminated water and soil still affecting local people, animals, and agriculture.

New Mexico uranium workers exposed after 1971 are now eligible for a one-time $100,000 payment under the expanded Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act (RECA), but the application process is not yet open and is surrounded by confusion.

Advocacy groups warn that the physical and social fallout — illness, environmental damage, and the risk of renewed mining — continues to affect the Pueblo community, highlighting gaps in accountability and safety measures.

Key quote:

""I get calls every week: Somebody passed away. Cancer. These horrible diseases that are not even qualified diseases for RECA compensation. We’ve had a lot of our young people die of cancer. They’re in their twenties and thirties.""

— Lorretta Anderson, co-founder, Southwest Uranium Miners Coalition Post-71

Why this matters:

Children playing near old tailings, farmers tending fields laced with radioactive remnants, and families drinking contaminated water and living with chronic illnesses all carry the invisible cost of an industry that boomed and then went bust. Jackpile left a legacy of contaminated water, soil, and serious health problems that the community continues to wrestle with today. Laguna Pueblo’s struggle is a stark reminder that some environmental and health crises don’t end when the last miner walks away — they linger for generations, quietly shaping lives and landscapes.

Now, with demand for nuclear power accelerating, the uranium industry has come knocking again in many impacted communities, promising that new technologies will guard against the health and environmental devastation of past mining eras. For those still dealing with legacy mining waste, the industry's promises ring hollow.

In short:

Isabelle Boemeke, a Brazilian model, runs the social media persona Isodope, breaking down nuclear concepts with playful analogies like Legos and gummy bears to reach younger audiences.

Her advocacy is paired with serious financial backing: She has invested in a nuclear startup and pledged $10 million toward nuclear initiatives, reflecting a broader push for expanding nuclear power in the U.S. and globally.

Boemeke's husband, Joe Gebbia, works in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency and is a close friend of Elon Musk’s.

Critics caution that her influencer approach obscures the risks of nuclear waste, which remains lethal for hundreds of thousands of years, and question the motivations behind glamorizing an industry with serious safety concerns.

Key quote:

“If nuclear power were clean, if it didn’t leave waste that is lethal for the next 240,000 years, we would be fine with it.”

— Linda Seeley, vice president of Mothers for Peace

Why this matters:

Boemeke has a clear stake in the industry. She is investing in nuclear startups and pledging $10 million to push the technology forward. Critics warn that turning reactors into influencer content risks glossing over the dark side: radioactive waste that can remain deadly for hundreds of thousands of years, lingering questions about power plant safety risks, and whether style is trumping substance in the nuclear debate.

In short:

The Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) initiative promotes fresh, healthy foods, but worsening climate conditions — heat, drought, floods, and storms — are reducing crop yields and food quality, especially for small and organic farmers.

Despite supporting MAHA’s goals, the Trump administration has slashed climate and renewable energy programs for farmers, rolled back emissions rules, and passed legislation that favors conventional, fossil-fuel-intensive agriculture.

Scientists warn that rising carbon dioxide reduces crop nutrition and productivity, and that agricultural systems are increasingly unstable in the face of extreme weather and biodiversity loss.

Key quote:

“We’re changing those biophysical conditions at the fastest rate in the history of our species. It’s the climate that we’re changing, but it’s also biodiversity loss and pollution and changes in access to water. It’s not just climate change, it’s everything change.”

— Samuel Myers, director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Planetary Health

Why this matters:

Farmers are facing a double bind: They’re encouraged to grow more nutritious, whole foods to fight diet-related disease, but the climate instability caused by fossil fuel emissions is making it harder to do so. Unpredictable weather, severe droughts, floods, and heatwaves are straining farm operations and shrinking yields. At the same time, higher levels of carbon dioxide are making crops less nutritious, with key declines in iron, zinc, and protein content. These pressures are especially acute for small-scale and organic farms that use sustainable practices but are often excluded from subsidies and insurance protections. As federal policy shifts away from climate resilience and toward industrial agriculture, the long-term ability of U.S. farmers to produce healthy, affordable food is increasingly at risk.

In short:

Delegates from 184 countries clashed over whether the treaty should cap plastic production or focus on recycling, reuse, and safer chemical use.

Powerful fossil fuel-producing nations and the plastics industry resisted production limits, arguing the treaty should prioritize waste management.

Negotiators released a revised draft recognizing the unsustainable growth of plastics and the need for a coordinated global response, but no consensus was reached.

Key quote:

“We are going in circles. We cannot continue to do the same thing and expect a different result.”

— Graham Forbes, head of Greenpeace delegation in Geneva

Why this matters:

Negotiations produced a draft that acknowledges the runaway growth of plastics and the global health and environmental risks — microplastics in oceans, toxic chemicals leaching into food and water, and communities burdened by mountains of waste — but it’s still just words on paper. The world is still waiting for leadership to turn concern into concrete action.

In short:

Climate scientists, led by Texas A&M’s Andrew Dessler, are organizing a public comment to rebut a Department of Energy report that questions the dangers of fossil fuels and supports ending the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine launched a self-funded, fast-tracked review of greenhouse gas impacts on human health, aiming to deliver its findings before the EPA finalizes its decision.

The Trump administration has deleted climate data from government websites and removed agency officials, prompting watchdog groups to safeguard and repost public science data.

Key quote:

“Attacks on science are dangerous because they erode one of society’s most effective tools for understanding the world and making decisions in the public interest.”

— Andrew Dessler, climate researcher at Texas A&M University

Why this matters:

Climate science is a cornerstone of environmental regulation in the U.S., especially under the Clean Air Act, which allows the EPA to act when pollutants endanger public health. Fossil fuel emissions — particularly carbon dioxide and methane — are deeply tied to climate change, which affects air quality, food systems, extreme weather, and infectious disease risks. Undermining the scientific consensus on these links weakens the legal and political basis for federal action. Stripping data from public view and silencing scientists blocks transparency and accountability in decision-making.

Project will Provide Enough Clean Energy to Power More than 266,000 Homes Each Year, Propel L.A. Forward in Transition to 100% Clean Energy by 2035

MOJAVE, CA (August 5, 2025)—Mayor Karen Bass today announced the completion of the Eland Solar-plus-Storage Center project, one of the largest solar and battery energy storage projects in the entire country. The power that will be generated by both phases of the Eland project – Eland 1 and Eland 2 – will meet 7 percent of Los Angeles’s total energy consumption while helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Eland can provide enough power to supply more than 266,000 households across Los Angeles. B-roll will be uploaded here.

“We are building a greener Los Angeles. The Eland Solar-plus-Storage Center project alone will generate enough power to serve more than 266,000 homes in Los Angeles and push the city’s clean energy share above 60 percent, a major milestone in L.A.’s transition to being powered by 100% clean energy by 2035,” said Mayor Karen Bass. “This is L.A.’s clean energy future – I want to thank LADWP, Arevon, and all of the partners who made today possible.”

“Today’s celebration marks a critical step toward LADWP’s accelerated goal of 100% clean energy by 2035,” said LADWP CEO Janisse Quiñones. “The Eland project represents what we need to achieve this objective — scale, energy storage, reliability, and innovation — while demonstrating what is possible when public and private sectors partner to benefit our city. This project has had the lowest cost for solar and storage, translating to more affordable bills for our LADWP customers.”

“When the City of Los Angeles first pursued renewable power some twenty years ago, it did so on moral grounds. It was ‘the right thing to do’ to reduce the City’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said Jonathan Parfrey, Executive Director of the Climate Resolve. “Flash forward to today – and solar power is now the right thing to do economically, producing electricity at a cost lower than that of coal, natural gas and nuclear power. Our children – and generations beyond – will thank the City of Los Angeles for its farsighted investment in renewable power.”

“When LADWP invests in solar energy, we all benefit,” said Victor Sanchez, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. “We can meet the challenges of climate change, create family-sustaining jobs, and build robust publicly-owned utilities for all. Innovative and sustainable solutions like the Eland Solar & Storage Center can help build a resilient Los Angeles.”

“Projects like Eland represent the kind of long-term infrastructure investments that strike the right balance: supporting energy reliability, reducing costs, and creating jobs without placing undue burdens on businesses or residents,” said Stuart Waldman, President of the Valley Industry & Commerce Association (VICA).

Since taking office, Mayor Bass has made significant strides in building greener, more resilient infrastructure in Los Angeles. This project is possible through a collaboration between LADWP and Arevon Energy, Inc., the developer, owner and operator of Eland, to procure the power produced from Eland under a long-term power purchase agreement. On average, the cost of generation and storage is about 4 cents per kilowatt hour.

In 2019, the Los Angeles City Council approved the two power purchase agreements that paved the way for Eland 1 and Eland 2 to be developed. Since then, LADWP has worked to deliver the Eland project as one of the lowest cost solar and battery storage projects ever built that will deliver low-cost renewable energy to Angelenos for decades to come.

Phase 1 of Eland was completed and energized in December of last year. Now with Phase 2 completed, the project is forecasted to help L.A. reach 64 percent clean energy by the end of the year. Over the 25-year term of the contract, the Eland power purchase agreement will save LADWP’s ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

LADWP has over 1,100 megawatts (MW) of utility-scale solar previously installed and Eland is unique in that it is LADWP’s first utility-scale, integrated solar and battery project. Eland’s two large-scale solar facilities will capture a combined 400 megawatts of solar energy and store up to 1,200 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy — all of which can be distributed to customers to meet peak demand in the evening and night-time hours when solar energy is unavailable by discharging solar power after the sun has gone down.

Based on the 2025 LSU survey, big majorities of Louisiana residents favor a variety of mitigation and relief efforts.","“Climate is what we expect,” said Mark Twain, “weather is what we get.”

Little wonder it’s become a political issue.

As fierce partisanship takes hold of American politics, all issues get sucked into the vortex. Public policies, good and bad, are seen through the lens of politics, not the common good. This applies to a host of issues, including the effects of weather patterns in Louisiana and across the nation.

A recent Gallup poll enlightens us on the regional nature of the weather issue: Among Southerners, hurricanes are, far and away, the top weather concern. Among Midwesterners, it’s tornadoes; among Easterners, flooding and storms; among Westerners, conditions that lead to wildfires.

For Louisiana and other coastal states, the weather reality and perceptions of climate change are of great consequence. But how do they relate and shape possible solutions?

Large swaths of Louisiana residents, based on the 2024 LSU/Reilly Center/Manship School survey, say their communities have experienced long periods of unusually hot weather, floods, intense storms and rising sea levels that erode shorelines. The survey also found that big majorities of affected residents — 66% to 88% — believe climate change contributed to these problems, a lot or a little.

A nationwide poll for USA Today finds that more Democrats than Republicans say extreme weather — heat, cold, severe thunderstorms, droughts, wildfires, flooding, tornadoes and hurricanes — has become more frequent and more intense over the past 10 years. While 84% of Democrats believe extreme weather will become more frequent in the near future, 38% of Republicans agree.

A nationwide Pew Research survey found that 60% of Democrats say they experienced long periods of unusually hot weather in the last year, compared with 37% of Republicans. This pattern holds across multiple forms of extreme weather, including floods, intense storms, droughts, major wildfires and rising sea levels.

What does this mean?

Says the Pew study: “Partisanship shapes perceptions of extreme weather itself, as well as the connection to climate change. Republicans are less likely to report extreme weather events than Democrats. And while most Republicans who do report experiencing extreme weather events draw a link to climate change, they are much less likely than Democrats to see a strong connection.”

For example: The Pew poll finds that 68% of Democrats and 26% of Republicans think climate change has contributed “a lot” to recent severe weather, like floods and extreme storms. In addition, 72% of Democrats and 43% of Republicans think climate change contributed “a lot” to rising sea levels that erode beaches and shorelines.

What about solutions?

The most popular proposals nationwide, according to Pew, are stricter building standards for new construction in high-risk communities (77% support) and financial assistance to rebuild after extreme weather events (64%). Only 14% of Americans favor requiring people to move out of high-risk communities and 28% favor buying homes and moving residents to lower-risk areas.

By much smaller margins, more Americans than not favor banning new construction in high-risk communities, and more than not also favor helping “cover the rising cost of homeowners’ insurance.”

Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support all of these national proposals. However, big majorities of both parties favor stricter building standards (71% of Republicans, 84% of Democrats) and financial assistance to rebuild (60% of Republicans, 68% of Democrats).

This goes to show that even in a divided nation — with partisans from each side fixated on crushing the opposition — common ground can still be found.

Based on the 2025 LSU survey, big majorities of Louisiana residents favor a variety of mitigation and relief efforts. It found that 81% support paying homeowners to strengthen their roofs to reduce risk of damage from storms; 79% favor financial assistance for people who live in high-risk areas to relocate to safer spots; 71% oppose new construction in high-risk areas and 66% support financial assistance to residents in high-risk areas to rebuild their homes in the same place.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/a9/2a90a0ad-88b8-4db4-a1ce-6db831a7d397/686b4e0de48b2.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-15 20:06:04.959202

The Charlotte-based utility raised its five-year capital expenditure plan by $4 billion, joining other major U.S. utilities investing heavily in power lines and generation to support growing demand from AI-focused data centers, transportation electrification, industrial growth and population increases.

Duke will sell a stake in its Florida utility serving about 2 million customers for $6 billion to Brookfield Asset Management. The sale will occur in phases starting next year. The funds will finance Duke’s capital plan and reduce holding company debt.

The company also plans to use proceeds from the recent sale of its Piedmont Natural Gas business in Tennessee to Spire for $2.8 billion, it announced last week.

“The transactions really position the company for the growth ahead with the capital expansion, generation modernization, and grid work in front of us,” Duke Chief Financial Officer Brian Savoy said.

Rates would still be handled differently across state lines, with North Carolina and South Carolina setting those separately under the authority of each state’s regulators.
Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis.","Duke Energy is asking state and federal regulators to approve to a merger of its two utility companies providing power to the Palmetto and Tar Heel states.

To get South Carolina regulators to agree, the utility company proposes shuffling money around between customer groups to prevent potential sticker shock to its electric customers in the Upstate.

Duke’s customers in the Pee Dee and eastern North Carolina pay more per megawatt than customers in the Upstate, Charlotte area and western North Carolina. Merging the companies could result in major hikes for customers in South Carolina’s northwest corner, if they’re asked to pay more for a portion of the East’s more expensive power costs.

So, rather than possibly seeing their bills go down, Duke’s wholesale customers — which include South Carolina’s electric cooperatives — will forgo $55 million annually over five years to keep Upstate bills steady. Meanwhile, North Carolina customers would give up $25 million worth of savings annually over six years, according to filings made with the two states’ utility regulators.

That means the merger itself won’t make rates go up or down, according to the company.

Duke Energy has provided power in the Pee Dee for more than a decade, after buying out Progress Energy. Still, Duke operated the Progress territory as a separate entity, with the company saying in 2012 it would merge the two at a later date.

With the Carolinas continuing to rank among the fastest growing states in the nation, according to U.S. Census data, Duke Energy tells regulators now is the time to bring the two service areas under one umbrella.

The merger would cost about $143 million, according to company filings, which doesn’t detail what that includes. But the company says it could produce about $3.2 billion in cost savings by 2038 by negating the need for additional power generation.

That projection does not mean power bills will go down.

Nearly all of that savings would come from the two territories acting as one, instead of performing legal and regulatory gymnastics to get each area’s customers the power they demand, according to the filings.

Since the Progress buyout, Duke claims to have saved customers across both areas upwards of $1 billion by buying fuel in bulk and sharing power generated at plants across both territories.

“But regulations limit further coordination between the two utilities; only a full combination can unlock additional savings,” according to a company statement.

The 2012 agreement lets the two companies share power back and forth to meet spikes in demand as needed. But they each still have to own and operate their own power sources, enough to keep the lights on in the two territories separately.

Furthermore, when power companies begin the multi-year process of constructing a new power plant, they tend to overbuild in anticipation of future growth. Under its current arrangement, if Duke ends up with extra power in the Pee Dee, it can’t simply put that excess — from a power plant paid for by Pee Dee customers — toward meeting demand in the Upstate, and vice versa.

Merging the two areas into one big territory would change that and make Duke’s overall balance sheet look better to investors by not leaving underutilized power sources on the books, according to Duke Energy.

Federal regulations also require the company to have access to reserve power for emergencies and a strategy for what to do if either area’s largest respective power source goes down. If they joined together, they would need backup plans for just one plant — McGuire Nuclear Station near Charlotte — if the reactor couldn’t operate for whatever reason.

Duke’s target date for the merger is Jan. 1, 2027.

The merger is separate from Duke’s earlier requests to increase power rates for all of its 857,000 South Carolina customers.

Duke Energy again seeking to raise SC power bills

Power bills for Duke Energy residential customers in the Upstate could go up, on average, by $10.38 a month in March 2026. In the Pee Dee, residential customers could see a $21.66 monthly hike starting February 2026.

That would bring the bill for a so-called average household in the Upstate to about $154 a month.

Electricity would continue to be more expensive in the Pee Dee. The average bill for households there would rise to roughly $167 in March if the request is approved.

Then, if the merger is approved in 2027, Duke said it would gradually shift the two sets of rates until they are evenly matched.

Rates would still be handled differently across state lines, with North Carolina and South Carolina setting those separately under the authority of each state’s regulators.

The merger and rate hikes come on the heels of a massive new energy law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May.

Within that legislation is a provision making it easier for power companies to raise rates on an annual basis. Duke has not invoked the new process and has “not yet created a plan as to how and when to use this new tool,” a company spokesman previously told the SC Daily Gazette.

Still, the company highlighted the change as a positive when speaking with investors during its most recent earnings call last week.

At least one group — the South Carolina Policy Council, a think tank that advocates for limited government and free markets — remains skeptical that South Carolinians will benefit.

“They have their own reasons for the merger that are beneficial to them,” said Neil Wolin, a member of the Policy Council’s research team.

But it’s disingenuous to pitch the merger as a benefit and cost savings to customers when they won’t see any of that supposed savings in their utility bills, Wolin said.

“I don’t think South Carolinians are interested in deciphering” the benefits of rate relief amid rate hikes, Wolin continued. “They are getting their electricity bills, and they’re going up. No matter how many times (companies) say rates are going down, they are not. And that is the main issue.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 20:04:31.616255

The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program offers a very timely opportunity for those manufacturers get a formidable head start, while also benefiting our economy and creating jobs in New Jersey,” Emigholz said.","With nuclear energy a priority for the Trump administration, both of the state's gubernatorial candidates – as well as beleaguered New Jersey rate payers – the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program signed into law this week could set off a chain reaction of economic opportunity.

The NJBIA-supported bill, which creates a $500 million incentive program exclusively for New Jersey manufacturers, specifically offers $100 million in tax credits for the first two years of the program for clean energy projects like nuclear, solar, geothermal and green hydrogen.

But it’s the renewed urgency for nuclear power in New Jersey, and revamped focus on the industry from the Trump administration, where the chemistry could really come in for the program, according to NJBIA Chief Government Affairs Officer Christopher Emigholz.

“If you’re a manufacturer that creates components for nuclear power certainly, the timing of this program is perfect,” Emigholz said.

“We know the NJEDA is eager to get the program started. We know that it was a big win to have nuclear listed as one of the types of clean energy. We know that New Jersey desperately needs nuclear power amid our energy supply decreases and rising costs. And we know the federal conditions are ripe for expanding nuclear power here and around the country.

“And while we know that larger nuclear projects do not happen quickly, the supply chain and workforce needs are more immediate. The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program offers a very timely opportunity for those manufacturers get a formidable head start, while also benefiting our economy and creating jobs in New Jersey,” Emigholz said.

Senator Michael Testa (R-1), one of the co-sponsors of the legislation along with Manufacturing Legislative Caucus Co-chair Senator Linda Greenstein (D-14), said for targeted manufacturers, the program provides “the tools they need to grow, compete globally and have success right here in the Garden State.”

In May, President Donald Trump announced four executive orders aimed at reinvigorating the U.S. nuclear energy industry by accelerating nuclear reactor licensing and testing, increasing the nuclear workforce, and adding 300 gigawatts of new U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050.

Simultaneously, the president has also greatly reduced the prioritization of wind power, which has also stopped in New Jersey.

Increased energy costs, resulting from New Jersey’s growing status as an energy importer, have become a primary election issue in the Garden State – and both gubernatorial candidates Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D) have endorsed the need for more nuclear power generation in the state.

Under the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program, eligible businesses in certain manufacturing industries can receive a tax credit award equal to the lesser of 0.1% of the eligible business’s total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time jobs or 25% of the eligible business’ total qualified investment, subject to a total cap of $150 million per project.

Maura Healey on Thursday announced plans for $2.45 billion in additional fiscal year 2025 spending, coupled with outside sections setting the date of the 2026 statewide primary election and responding to shifts in federal policy.

The bill allocates $2.05 billion in funding to MassHealth, the massive public health insurance program that is the largest program in the annual state budget. While the coming federal Medicaid cuts are dominating headlines, Healey’s office says federal reimbursements will cover all but $540 million of the $2 billion.

While the bill’s bottom line might cause lawmakers to feel sticker shock as Massachusetts grapples with the impacts of federal economic uncertainty, the governor’s office says the net cost of the bill to the state is $947 million after “revenue offsets.”

“The question is going to be, are you able to, with this spending proposal as put forward by the Healey administration, end the year in balance? Do you have sufficient resources to cover spending and not draw down from your stabilization fund and things like that? And I think the answer to that is yes,” Massachusetts Taxpayers Association President Doug Howgate told the News Service, adding that he expects the year to likely end in “some level of surplus.”

“I think the larger question is kind of long-term spending trends,” Howgate said.

Spending allocated in the $60.9 billion fiscal 2026 annual budget rose by 5.4% over fiscal 2025, according to MTF, but Healey and the Legislature have added hundreds of millions of dollars in fiscal 2025 spending through numerous supplemental spending bills.

Healey has signed six spending bills in 2025 and filed two others. Supplemental spends include a bill plugging the emergency shelter system, one addressing state employee health insurance costs, another allocating millions to child care, and one attempting to solve a pay dispute between the state and court-appointed attorneys. Healey also signed a supplemental income surtax spending bill in June.

“With this legislation, we are controlling spending and ensuring that our state budget remains responsible, while also strengthening our ability to weather economic unpredictability coming from Washington,” Healey said in a statement about her latest budget bill, which aims to close the books on fiscal 2025.

The MassHealth spending boost might have been influenced by several factors, Howgate said.

“My guess would be that some chunk of this is reflective of the breakdown of Steward finances that we saw,” Howgate said. “Another factor is when the FY25 budget was signed, at the time, I think there was some feeling that it had been kind of underfunded from MassHealth budget assumptions by several hundred million dollars.”

“And the other trend that has been occurring over the last couple years that we saw reflected in the FY26 budget is this idea that the acuity of MassHealth members has been higher than expected,” Howgate said.

States across the country are preparing for changes to Medicaid required under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Medicaid work requirements are not expected to begin in most states until the end of 2026, and funding changes to Medicaid and food stamps are slated to begin in 2028, according to New York Times reporting.

A MassHealth spokesperson, who communicated on background only, noted that states have felt the impact of increasing health care costs and said the program has seen significant above-budget cost growth tied to long-term care, drug spending and medical care utilization. The program’s caseload also remains 250,000 cases higher than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which the office said places additional pressure on the budget.

The closeout budget also sets aside $163 million for a reserve for costs accrued by sheriffs, who oversee county jails and houses of correction. It’s an amount an Administration and Finance spokesperson called “slightly larger than we typically see.” Each sheriff’s office manages their own expenses, and historically the allocation goes toward any deficiencies they’ve incurred throughout the year.

“The budgeting for the sheriffs is consistently a challenge, and I think it is a challenge that we need to kind of figure out a better way forward for,” Howgate said. “That is something that is a bit of a signal to me that I think it’s time once again, this happens not that infrequently, to take a close look at, as everyone in this Commonwealth is challenged with living within a budget and living within our means, how do we make sure that’s true for the sheriffs as well?”

The proposal Healey outlined would also deposit $125 million into the state’s stabilization fund and use $150 million in income surtax revenue to fund recurring K-12 school aid increases required under the funding reform law known as the Student Opportunity Act.

The final certification of fiscal 2025 surtax resources doesn’t occur until December, though the Department of Revenue preliminarily certified the number at around $3 billion in July. The administration determined its closeout budget with that figure, which Healey’s office said exceeded its spending threshold by $1.7 billion.

Healey’s proposal bill would also create an Economic Resiliency and Federal Response Fund built on capital gains tax revenues collected in the fiscal year that ended June 30 “to ensure that the state remains fiscally resilient against the negative impacts of federal budgetary and policy decisions,” according to Healey’s office.

As state officials repeatedly beat the drum of fiscal storm clouds, lawmakers included an about $800 million cushion in their fiscal 2026 annual budget, and the governor vetoed $130 million from the Legislature’s already-slimmed-down proposal. Healey also recently proposed a separate spending initiative as a way to address federal fluctuations specifically in research and education support.

Massachusetts is also facing federal resistance in its push to get more offshore wind energy on the grid. Healey’s proposal would delay the state’s deadline to contract 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind power from 2027 to 2029 “due to uncertainty surrounding federal permitting and tax credits” and changing market conditions.

The Department of Energy Resources said in early August that it has put any offshore wind procurement expected in 2025 on pause until at least 2026. Healey’s bill also proposes to remove a requirement that a solicitation for more wind energy be conducted every 24 months.

Another outside section would decouple state vaccine authority from federal recommendations, proposing that the Department of Public Health be able to set independent standards for Massachusetts should the federal government fail “to maintain a robust schedule of vaccine recommendations.” Healey tucked a similar policy into a spending bill in July, which remains before House Ways and Means five weeks after she submitted it.

The new proposal also would set Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2026 as the statewide primary election day. In 2026, Labor Day falls on Monday, Sept. 7.

The bill addresses funding gaps for universal free school meals and at public health hospitals, the governor’s office said, and new spending includes $20 million for the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, $20 million to propel tourism during the 2026 World Cup, and $5 million in reproductive health care provider grants.

Another provision would again enable the Register of Motor Vehicles to make driving records public that detail a history of motor vehicle violations with “guardrails,” and another proposes to make state institutional records public if they’re more than 75 years old.

Completion of the closeout budget enables the state comptroller to finish an annual financial report that’s due by Oct. 31. Lawmakers routinely continue their deliberations on the spending bill into the fall, preventing the comptroller from meeting that deadline.",https://www.lowellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/low-l-healey-080525-01.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-08-15 20:05:19.384702

AMARILLO, Texas, Aug. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, developer of the 11 GW private grid campus for next-generation hyperscale AI in collaboration with the Texas Tech University System, today announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ASP Isotopes Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPI) and its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE) to explore the development of a High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) enrichment facility at Fermi America's site in Carson County, Texas.

The planned facility would use advanced laser-based isotope separation technology to produce HALEU — a specialized nuclear fuel essential for many Generation IV and small modular reactor (SMR) designs. With very few commercial HALEU suppliers currently operating in the Western world, the project is intended to strengthen U.S. and allied supply chains, reduce reliance on Russian enrichment, and accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

Fermi America's private grid campus will be anchored by four AP1000® nuclear units using conventional fuel, with the potential to integrate advanced reactor technologies in future phases. The addition of domestic HALEU production capability would position the private grid as both a significant clean energy generator and a strategic nuclear fuel hub. ""Our nation's ability to lead in advanced nuclear energy is directly tied to our capacity to fuel it here at home,"" said Toby Neugebauer, Co-Founder and CEO, Fermi America. ""This decision helps ensure that America's next generation of nuclear reactors will be powered by American innovation, technology, and resolve.""

""This collaboration represents a decisive step toward securing the nuclear fuel needed for the next wave of advanced reactors,"" said Mesut Uzman, Chief Nuclear Construction Officer, Fermi America. ""It reinforces our mission to build the most advanced, resilient, and secure private grid in the world.""

""Advanced reactors cannot be built without HALEU, and our Quantum Enrichment™ technology is designed to deliver it with speed, precision, and environmental responsibility,"" said Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO, ASP Isotopes Inc. ""Partnering with Fermi America gives us the platform and location to play a central role in the emerging Western HALEU market.""

""Energy security is national security,"" said Rick Perry, Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy. ""This project will help America control its own destiny in nuclear power, create jobs here in Texas, and send a clear message that the United States intends to lead – not follow – in the race for advanced, carbon-free energy.""

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. HALEU demand could exceed 50 metric tons annually by 2035, with similar needs emerging in Europe and Asia. The proposed project would help meet this demand, supporting the clean energy transition while enhancing energy security.

But recycled steel can’t entirely displace demand for high-strength ​“primary” steel.","Qiyam Ansari was driving to work the morning of Aug. 11 when he felt and saw an explosion occur just down the road in Clairton, Pennsylvania. Thick black smoke burst from the U.S. Steel facility along the Monongahela River, filling the air with an acrid stench, and the ground began shuddering from a series of blasts.

The explosion at Clairton Coke Works killed two steelworkers and injured 10 others, some of whom were trapped under charred rubble. For about an hour, brownish clouds rose from the wreckage of the facility, which processes coal for use in steelmaking.

“The smell of ammonia was insane,” Ansari said, recalling the first few minutes after the initial blast. ​“It burned my throat, my nostrils, and my eyes started to water. It was horrible.”

Ansari is the executive director of Valley Clean Air Now, a community-led organization, and his office in Glassport sits across the river from Clairton. As soon as he arrived at work, he slipped on a face mask, turned on air purifiers, and began alerting residents to take the same precautions.

In the near term, Nippon Steel, which acquired the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker in June, will likely need to spend millions of dollars to repair Clairton and make it safer and cleaner, both for the plant’s roughly 1,400 workers and for residents in surrounding towns. Even before the explosion, the coking plant was plagued with equipment failures and excessive air pollution, for which U.S. Steel has paid millions in fines and legal settlements in recent years.

In the long run, however, what to do with Clairton and other coal-based operations remains an open and urgent question for America’s steel industry — one that has major implications for the climate and the nation’s legacy steel communities.

Producing iron and steel is an extremely dirty business, responsible for as much as 9% of global carbon dioxide emissions and a significant amount of toxic air pollution. In the United States, seven coal-based steel mills and 10 coking plants are still operating across Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia.

Many of the facilities are aging and in need of extensive repairs. In June, Nippon Steel committed to spending $2.4 billion in the Mon Valley as part of a $11 billion capital investment in U.S. Steel’s footprints through 2028. Nippon has pledged to transfer its ​“advanced technologies” to the sites, though it hasn’t shared specific plans. (Nippon didn’t immediately return requests for comment.)

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is boosting federal support for fossil-fuel-based steelmaking, including by introducing tax credits for mining metallurgical coal — the kind used in coking factories — and by easing regulatory pressure on steel mills.

Environmental groups are urging steelmakers to instead chart a new course for the industry by investing in modern and low-carbon methods for manufacturing iron and steel.

“If there are going to be future investments, it doesn’t make sense to extend the life of these really old, outdated processes that don’t help the climate and don’t help community health,” said Matt Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a coalition of about 50 local advocacy groups in southwestern Pennsylvania.

“It makes sense to talk about what would position steelmaking for the 21st century,” he added.

Making metal — with or without coke

When U.S. Steel opened the Clairton Coke Works in the early 20th century, Pennsylvania was the beating heart of America’s steel industry, thanks to the region’s abundant coal deposits.

Coking plants bake metallurgical coal in ovens at high temperatures to remove impurities that could weaken steel. Along with purified ​“coke,” the process produces a litany of hazardous air pollutants, such as lead and arsenic, and it creates a lethal gas byproduct that contains methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide.

The coke is used in what’s known as ​“integrated” steelmaking. Coke is combined with iron ore and limestone in a scorching-hot blast furnace to produce iron. The molten metal is then moved into a basic oxygen furnace where it becomes steel — the essential and abundant material used in bridges, buildings, ships, cars, and household appliances.

The number of U.S. coal-based steelmaking facilities has declined over the decades, owing largely to growing competition overseas and shifting market conditions at home. No new steel facilities that use coal have been built in the U.S. in decades. Today, roughly 30% of the country’s steel production is made the traditional way.

The remaining 70% of domestic steel output comes from electric arc furnaces, many of which are scattered across the U.S. South. These giant facilities use electricity to melt scrap metal — a method that can significantly curb CO2 emissions and reduce air pollution compared to using coal, especially if that electricity is being generated with clean energy.

But recycled steel can’t entirely displace demand for high-strength ​“primary” steel. In order to truly clean up steelmaking, the industry must end its reliance on coal, experts say.

“We know that there are alternatives that don’t involve coke-making,” Hilary Lewis, steel director at Industrious Labs, said days after the Clairton explosion. ​“And if we have ways to do this that are safer for workers, safer for communities, we should be seriously considering them.”

Today, the leading alternative for coke-fed blast furnaces is the ​“direct reduced iron” process, or DRI. Existing DRI plants typically use fossil gas to convert iron ore into iron, which is relatively cleaner than using coal. But if producers swapped gas for green hydrogen — made with renewable power — they could slash the overall CO2 emissions from steelmaking by up to 90%.

The iron can then be melted into steel in an electric arc furnace, ideally one that’s also powered by carbon-free electricity, though that’s not typically the case today.

Green steel’s path is still uncertain in U.S.

For now, this fossil-fuel-free arrangement mostly remains out of reach, given the challenging economics and the persistent lack of green hydrogen supplies globally.

A handful of commercial-scale projects are slowly advancing in Europe and China. But plans to build two hydrogen-based steel mills in the United States have recently been abandoned.

Last year, the steelmakers SSAB and Cleveland-Cliffs were selected to receive up to $500 million each from the Biden-era Department of Energy to build green steel facilities in Mississippi and Ohio, respectively. In January, SSAB told Canary Media it had withdrawn from federal award negotiations. In July, Cleveland-Cliffs said it informed the DOE — now under President Donald Trump — that the company was no longer pursuing its project, citing the lack of hydrogen and its intention to keep using ​“beautiful coal, beautiful coke, beautiful natural gas.”

The Trump administration is encouraging the U.S. steel industry to double down on coal. In May, Energy Secretary Chris Wright designated metallurgical coal as a ​“critical material” for the U.S. supply chain. The GOP megalaw passed last month allows coal producers to claim the advanced manufacturing tax credit through 2029, helping to reduce the cost of coal-based steelmaking, both domestically and in countries that import U.S. metallurgical coal.

Most notably for Clairton Coke Works, the Environmental Protection Agency recently moved to delay requiring coking plants to comply with new air-quality standards until July 2027. The rules set caps on previously unregulated air pollutants. They also required plants to monitor pollution — a measure that can provide key data about a community’s exposure risk following major accidents.

In the wake of the fatal explosion at Clairton, the Allegheny County Health Department said it was increasing air-quality monitoring near the facility to assess for pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, fine particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide. Initial reports suggest the weather helped to lessen the potential pollution impact from the blast by dispersing plumes, rather than trapping them in place.

“The community has definitely responded and rallied around us, and I’m very grateful for that,” he said. ​“But it’s unfortunate, because I feel like all of this could have been avoided.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2228931637.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=5b9ee8e6421297b341feb5fc7b97a432,N,,2025-08-15 20:03:38.131644

It appears to be the only state that’s passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.","When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.

“We thought absolutely, let’s do this right away,” said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.

These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven’t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.

The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer’s backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.

“We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” Dwyer said.

Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.

Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility’s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home’s circuit breaker.

Removing hurdles for plug-in solar

Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.

“The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. “It is clear that we are hitting a nerve — many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.”

Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they’re allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.

Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn’t understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.

Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility’s policy.

During the early days of plug-in solar’s growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“Utilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,” Cudd said.

This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that’s passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.

“Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here in the United States,” Ward said.

Bright Saver says they are lobbying other states for similar legislation.

Alexis Abramson, dean of the University of Columbia Climate School, also applauded Utah’s move.

“We actually need more localities, more states putting in allowances for this type of equipment,” she said.

Plug-in solar availability and savings potential

Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.

Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.

“I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,” he said.

He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.

Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.

“I think anyone can install this,” he said. “It’s not complicated. It doesn’t require a technical degree.”

Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company’s basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.

Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom’s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.

The company advises customers to notify their power company before installation, but it has “never had any pushback from any utility,” said Michael Scherer, one of the founders of Craftstrom.

China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.

“This is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,” Oliver said, adding: “As this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.”

The Charlotte-based energy company said the proposed combination of Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP) would save customers more than $1 billion through 2038.

Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress (DEP) have operated as separate utilities since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Progress Energy. Immediately after that merger was approved, Duke Energy received scrutiny from shareholders for ousting a newly minted chief executive hours after the deal was done.

In 2015, Duke Energy agreed to settle a $146 million lawsuit that alleged executives and board members misled shareholders about who would be chief executive of the utility after the merger.

Duke Energy Carolinas supplies energy to the western half of North Carolina, including the Charlotte region. Duke Energy Progress covers the eastern half of North Carolina, including the Triangle.

Both subsidiaries also serve parts of the southeastern United States in South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.

Duke Energy Carolinas currently owns 20,800 megawatts of energy capacity, supplying electricity to 2.9 million customers across a 24,000-square-mile service area in N.C. and S.C.

Duke Energy Progress owns 13,800 megawatts of energy capacity, supplying electricity to 1.8 million customers across a 28,000-square-mile service area.

Combined, the company said it serves 8.6 million customers and collectively owns over 55,000 megawatts of energy capacity.

A merger would play into Duke Energy’s next move to modernize its infrastructure to meet the Carolinas’ growing energy needs, the company says.

If the proposal is approved, the targeted date of the merger would be January 1, 2027.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, in the press release.

“There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services. We look forward to sharing more details with our customers on how rates will evolve over time if the combination is approved by regulators.”

WRAL reached out to Duke Energy officials for comment on how exactly a merger could save customers the promised $1 billion.

In its proposal, the company listed four benefits they say the merger would deliver:

New generation and transmission: A combined utility could more effectively plan, execute and operate new generation and transmission across a broader geographic footprint.

Better generation reliability: A combination would improve distribution of resources while reducing the need to restrict solar production due to oversupply, grid congestion or lack of demand.

Less confusion: A combined entity would project a more uniform approach in programs, services and rates.

More regulatory efficiencies: With two utilities each operating across two states, Duke Energy said it maintains four retail rate structures, produces four separate annual filings and more. A combination would reduce the time and expense by eliminating duplicative filings and proceedings.

Bill Norton, a Duke Energy spokesperson, said the company would have more to say about these changes after 2027 if and when the proposed merger can provide actual, substantial rate changes for customers.

Nonprofit leader Duke Energy's proposed merger won't save customers money

On Friday, WRAL News spoke with NC WARN executive director Jim Warren to hear his perspective on the proposed merger.

NC WARN describes itself as a 37-year-old nonprofit organization tackling the accelerating crisis posed by climate change by building people power for a swift North Carolina transition to clean power, and by promoting energy and climate justice.

""Saving customers money is not consistent with Duke Energy's business model,” Waren said. “In fact, Duke's business model is to put as many customer dollars into the rate system because that's how they make their money.""

The announcement comes weeks after the state legislature overturned Gov. Josh Stein's veto of a bill repealing Duke Energy's carbon reduction deadlines.

In a statement to WRAL News about the announcement, Stein's office says, ""Gov. Stein remains focused on working to ensure the lowest-cost, cleanest energy possible for North Carolina’s ratepayers.""

Warren said he is not convinced of Duke Energy's claim that the proposed merger could open a path to more efficient and cleaner forms of electricity production.

""They want people to think they are green,"" Warren said.",https://images.wral.com/ac1e780c-e185-4001-96a4-2c88a974e366?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-08-15 21:01:16.461812

In an interview, General Motors CEO Mary Barra confirmed that the Bolt EV is returning with some upgrades, including over 300 miles of range and a faster charging system. Production will begin in late 2025, and the car is expected to hit the market in 2026. It’s part of GM’s plans to reclaim ground from Tesla and meet the rising demand for cheaper, more accessible electric vehicles.

As reported by Electrek, the next-gen Bolt will use LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) battery chemistry, which helps lower costs and extend battery life. The new Bolt will also adopt the North American Charging Standard, giving drivers access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, which is a major convenience upgrade. On top of that, it’s getting a refreshed design, updated lighting, and a quieter, smoother ride thanks to its fully electric motor.

Like most EVs, the Bolt will require less maintenance than gas-powered cars (no oil changes, no tailpipe), and drivers could save hundreds on fuel costs each year. EVs are also much cleaner to operate. An MIT study found that gas-powered cars produce around 350 grams of planet-warming gas pollution per mile over their lifetimes, while EVs produce just 200 even when powered by the average U.S. electric grid.

Some who are critical about making the switch to EVs point to the environmental impact of mining for EV battery materials, but the full picture tells the full story. The clean energy transition is estimated to require digging up 30 million tons of minerals per year, but we currently extract more than 16.5 billion tons of dirty energy annually. And while dirty energy gets burned and cannot be used again, battery materials can be reused or recycled.

Installing solar panels can also cut EV charging costs even more. Charging with home solar is much cheaper than relying on public stations or the power grid. EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from trusted and legitimate local installers and can help homeowners save up to $10,000 on a system.

As more automakers like General Motors roll out hybrid and electric options, EVs will be more affordable and practical for everyday drivers. If you want to start making a difference for both the environment and your personal bank account, making your next car an EV is a good place to start.

“Tesla has just about completely lost their head start. Now that the serious automotive players are in the market, the only way to succeed is to be a serious product-focused company. Fluff and filler will only work for so long,” one commenter wrote under the Electrek report.

Whispers from the heart of Detroit suggest General Motors is preparing a shocking return for one of its most iconic nameplates: a high-performance, three-motor Camaro EV, potentially slated to debut as early as next year. This isn't just a plan to electrify a beloved car; it's a high-stakes gamble to prove that the soul of American performance—raw power, aggressive styling, and heart-pounding excitement—can thrive when powered by volts instead of gasoline.

A Lesson in Branding: Avoiding the Mach-E's Pitfall

When Ford launched the Mustang Mach-E, it was a commercial success but a branding controversy. By placing the hallowed Mustang name on a four-door electric crossover, Ford alienated a significant portion of its loyal fanbase. While the Mach-E is a competent EV, for many purists, it simply wasn't a Mustang. It broke from the two-door, performance-coupe norm that had defined the brand for over half a century.

Herein lies GM's first major opportunity. By all accounts, the rumored Camaro EV is envisioned as a proper two-door sports coupe. This single decision could allow GM to succeed where Ford stumbled with enthusiasts. Instead of asking customers to accept a completely different type of vehicle, GM would be presenting a direct evolution of the form factor they know and love. It's a strategy that respects the nameplate's heritage, suggesting that while the powertrain is changing, the fundamental spirit of the Camaro—a stylish, powerful, personal performance car—remains intact. This approach doesn't just create a new EV; it builds a bridge for lifelong fans to cross into an electric future.

A Void in the Market and a Stumbling Rival

In the rapidly expanding universe of electric vehicles, there is a surprising black hole where the electric muscle car should be. The market is filled with hyper-quick sedans and futuristic supercars, but there are precious few options for those who want the classic, aggressive proportions of an American muscle coupe. This creates a massive, untapped market for a car like an electric Camaro.

Dodge was the first to charge into this void with its new Charger Daytona EV, but its launch has been a cautionary tale. The car has been plagued by reports of software glitches, build quality concerns, and a divisive reception to its synthetic ""Fratzonic Chambered Exhaust"" sound. Furthermore, its substantial weight—a common issue for EVs—has raised questions about its agility and overall driving dynamics. For GM, the Charger's struggles provide a perfect blueprint of what to avoid. The path is clear: deliver flawless software, ensure impeccable build quality from day one, engineer a sound that feels authentic and exhilarating, and use the full might of the Ultium platform to manage weight and optimize handling.

GM's Blueprint for an Electric Icon

So, can GM pull this off? The potential is certainly there. The Ultium platform is a flexible and powerful foundation, and the rumored three-motor setup is tantalizing. Such a configuration would likely mean one motor on the front axle and two at the rear, enabling true torque vectoring for mind-bending cornering ability and blistering, all-wheel-drive acceleration that could humble hypercars.

But success will require more than just raw speed. The design must be unmistakably Camaro—low, wide, and menacing. The interior needs to blend futuristic tech with a driver-focused cockpit that feels special. Most importantly, GM must nail the intangible ""feel"" of a performance car. This means responsive steering, a balanced chassis, and an acoustic experience that stirs the soul, even if it's not the product of internal combustion. If GM can deliver a car that looks like a Camaro, launches like a rocket, and handles with a level of precision that its gas-powered predecessors could only dream of, it will have a winner. Success would mean not just outselling the competition, but capturing the hearts of a new generation of enthusiasts while convincing the old guard that the future of muscle is in good hands.

Wrapping Up

The potential return of the Camaro as a three-motor EV is one of the most exciting developments in the automotive world. It represents a golden opportunity for GM to learn from the missteps of its rivals and create the definitive electric muscle car. By respecting the iconic two-door form, addressing the challenges that have plagued the new Charger, and leveraging the full performance potential of its Ultium platform, GM has a chance to do more than just launch a new car. It has the chance to create a new legend and prove, once and for all, that the thunder of American muscle doesn't need gasoline to shake the world.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations — primarily residential — grew more than fivefold between 2014 and 2022.
“This is an industry-wide problem.” Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor’s inbox, he produced a 14-page report cataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019.
Some 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.","James Showalter describes a pretty specific if not entirely implausible nightmare scenario. Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage. This unassuming gray box converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home.

“You’ve got to have a solar stalker” for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system.

Showalter, the CEO of EG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn’t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it’s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA published an advisory detailing security vulnerabilities in EG4’s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system.

For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4’s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they’re learning is that modern solar inverters aren’t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there’s excess power, feeding it back into the grid.

Much of this has happened without people noticing. “Nobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,” observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. “Now we’re talking about it at the national and international level.”

Security shortcomings and customers’ complaints

Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations — primarily residential — grew more than fivefold between 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change.

Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent.

When pressed about his company’s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. “This is not an EG4 problem,” he says. “This is an industry-wide problem.” Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor’s inbox, he produced a 14-page report cataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019.

Not all of his customers — some of whom took to Reddit to complain — are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA’s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures.

“These were fundamental security lapses,” says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. “Adding insult to injury,” continues this individual, “EG4 didn’t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.”

Asked why EG4 didn’t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a “live and learn” moment.

“Because we’re so close [to addressing CISA’s concerns] and it’s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the ‘done’ button, and then advise people, so we’re not in the middle of the cake being baked,” says Showalter.

TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that “no known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.”

Connections to China spark security concerns

While unrelated, the timing of EG4’s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment.

Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries. According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers — components that hadn’t appeared on official hardware lists.

This reported discovery carries particular weight given China’s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.

The geopolitical implications haven’t escaped notice. Lithuania last year passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany.

But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4’s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company’s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NIST warns that “if you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.”

The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations.

Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers’ solar inverters, as evidenced by security researchers last year.)

The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection standards currently apply only to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms.

Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements.

But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum.

On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes.

“When you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,” he explains. “But when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.”

Put another way, the real concern isn’t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity.

Showalter has embraced CISA’s intervention as what he calls a “trust upgrade” — an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures.

But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company’s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they’d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1308318231.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-08-15 19:01:54.127662

When it comes to the elimination of the solar credit, if you own a home to qualify for the solar tax credit before it goes away, you must have the solar system fully installed by the end of this year.","SAN ANTONIO — In July, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the Treasury Department to eliminate some clean energy incentives. That could affect the bills of homeowners across Texas.

One of the industries that will take a hit from the Big Beautiful Bill is solar. Starting January 1st, 2026, the 30 percent residential solar tax credit will no longer exist. The oil and gas industry will also be affected as legislation to reduce methane is relaxed.

""Methane is a powerful climate pollutant. It's also the main ingredient of natural gas. And the law requires that the largest emitters pay a fee on their excessive methane emissions. So, what the law did, the tax law, was delay that fee for industry for ten years,"" Elizabeth Lieberknecht, manager of the Regulatory and Legislative, Midcontinent division of the Environmental Defense Fund, said.

Jay Young, an oil and gas expert with the King Operating Corporation added, ""There's not one company that doesn't watch everything that they do in regards to pollution or putting methane or natural gas. So we do the best we can to drill a well produced oil and gas, put it down the pipeline and get paid for it.""

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar won't be able to meet the rising demand for energy, which is why they're reversing legislation from the Biden administration, and shifting away from clean energy and more towards fossil fuels.

""The clean tax credits or the tax credits and incentives for the clean energy that are putting Texans to work, and clean energy jobs and investing in new facilities to generate clean power and transmitted to the grid, those programs are being gutted while we are facing increasing demands on our electricity,"" said Lieberknecht.

Young said the need for these fossil fuels isn't going away anytime soon.

""We have an addiction to oil, and there's nothing that's going to replace it anytime soon,"" Young said. ""So we have to produce oil and gas.""

Energy storage and renewables: Invest in companies like Tesla, Enphase, and Plug Power to capitalize on the shift to decentralized power.","The AI revolution is no longer a distant promise—it is a present-day reality reshaping global energy markets. By 2025, AI data centers are projected to consume 22% of the electricity used by all U.S. households, driven by the insatiable demand for computational power to train and deploy large language models, generative AI, and autonomous systems. This surge in energy consumption is creating a crisis of scale, forcing tech giants and governments to rethink infrastructure strategies. For investors, the fallout from this crisis is a goldmine: energy storage, grid modernization, and smart demand-response technologies are emerging as critical enablers of AI's growth—and their markets are poised for explosive expansion.

The Energy Appetite of AI: A New Era of Infrastructure Demand

AI data centers are no longer just digital hubs; they are power-hungry industrial complexes. In 2024, data centers already consumed 4.4% of U.S. electricity, and by 2028, over half of their energy use will be dedicated to AI. This shift is driven by the computational intensity of AI workloads: a single 5-second video generated by AI models like CogVideoX requires 3.4 million joules, while reasoning tasks in models like OpenAI's GPT-5 use 43 times more energy than traditional queries.

The carbon footprint of this growth is staggering. Data centers already use electricity that is 48% more carbon-intensive than the U.S. average, due to their reliance on fossil-fueled grids and 24/7 operations. To meet AI's demands, tech companies are racing to secure power through a mix of nuclear, geothermal, and renewable energy projects, while also investing in microgrids and energy storage to decouple from unreliable grids.

Energy Storage: The Unsung Hero of AI Infrastructure

Energy storage is the linchpin of this transition. As AI data centers require continuous, high-capacity power, battery storage systems are becoming indispensable. The global energy storage market is projected to grow from $31.4 billion in 2024 to $59.16 billion by 2029, driven by falling battery costs (down 85% since 2010) and the need to stabilize renewable energy sources.

Key investment opportunities:

- Lithium-ion and flow batteries: Companies like Tesla (TSLA) and LG Chem (LGCL) are scaling production to meet demand for grid-scale storage.

- Green hydrogen: Startups like Plug Power (PLUG) are developing hydrogen storage solutions to complement renewables.

- Microgrid developers: Firms like Enphase Energy (ENPH) and Sunrun (RUN) are building decentralized energy systems for data centers.

Grid Modernization: From Fragile to Resilient

The U.S. grid, already strained by aging infrastructure, is ill-equipped to handle the 11–15% of total electricity demand that data centers will represent by 2030. Grid modernization is no longer optional—it's a necessity. Smart demand-response technologies, which allow data centers to dynamically adjust energy use during peak periods, are gaining traction. For example, Google's recent agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Power Authority let it reduce AI workload loads during grid stress events, effectively turning data centers into grid allies.

Market trends:

- Smart demand response: The market is expected to grow at a 15.7% CAGR, reaching $59.16 billion by 2029.

- Grid-enhancing technologies: Innovations like reconductoring and virtual power plants (VPPs) are being deployed to optimize transmission.

- Policy tailwinds: The U.S. Department of Energy's $500 billion ""Stargate"" initiative and state-level programs (e.g., Illinois' 20-year tax breaks for data centers) are accelerating infrastructure upgrades.

Microgrids and Green Bonds: Financing the AI Energy Transition

Microgrids—localized grids that can operate independently or in tandem with the main grid—are becoming the default model for AI data centers. These systems integrate renewables, storage, and dispatchable power (e.g., natural gas or nuclear) to ensure reliability. For instance, Fermi America's $300 billion Texas project combines solar, gas, and future nuclear reactors to power a 11 GW data center complex.

Green bonds are the financial vehicle of choice for these projects. In 2024, Constellation Energy issued the first U.S. corporate green bond for nuclear projects, while Google and Meta are leveraging green bonds to fund geothermal and solar projects. The global green bond market is expected to grow by 13% annually, with AI-driven infrastructure accounting for a significant share.

Strategic Investment Playbook

For investors, the AI energy crisis presents a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity:

1. Energy storage and renewables: Invest in companies like Tesla, Enphase, and Plug Power to capitalize on the shift to decentralized power.

2. Grid modernization: Target firms developing smart grid software (e.g., Schneider Electric) and VPP platforms (e.g., Stem Inc.).

3. Green bonds and ESG infrastructure: Allocate capital to green bond ETFs and renewable energy developers (e.g., NextEra Energy).

The risks are real—grid instability, regulatory delays, and technological bottlenecks—but the upside is undeniable. As AI becomes the backbone of the digital economy, the infrastructure to power it will be the most lucrative asset class of the 2030s.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-15 20:05:24.454263

Historically, Duke Energy Progress customers have paid slightly higher rates than Duke Energy Carolinas customers, said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
Following current cycles, observers expect Duke Energy Progress to file for a rate increase sometime this fall and Duke Energy Carolinas to do the same in the early part of next year.
There are about 13,500 employees for Duke Energy based in North Carolina and 4,000 in South Carolina, according to Duke Energy.
Duke Energy previously merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy in 2012, and maintains a corporate office in downtown Raleigh for Duke Energy Progress.","This story was updated at 7:30 p.m. to add information about South Carolina as well as more information on the rate impacts.

The proposed merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress leaves customers with one big question: Will it lower my bill?

Duke says the consolidation will result in cost savings of more than $1 billion and as much as $3.2 billion by 2038, but how that may affect customers’ bills is complicated.

Historically, Duke Energy Progress customers have paid slightly higher rates than Duke Energy Carolinas customers, said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.

“How to balance that without any undue discrimination or causing harm to existing customers is going to be a challenge,” Neal said.

Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, put it more bluntly, telling NC Newsline in a statement:

“This merger will impact customers the same way everything Duke does impacts customers — their rates will keep going up and Duke will make billions.”

In its regulatory filing, Duke Energy said the move would optimize efficiency between the two utilities, and is needed as demand on the energy grid grows.

Kendal Bowman, North Carolina president for the two entities, said in testimony with the North Carolina Utilities Commission that the merger would allow “the combined utility to continue to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers at a lower overall system cost.”

Duke Energy Carolinas serves western areas of the state, including Charlotte and its surrounding area, while Duke Energy Progress covers the eastern half of North Carolina, including the Raleigh region. It’s a total of about 3.8 million retail customers in North Carolina, according to Duke Energy. Both utilities also operate in neighboring South Carolina as well, serving about 855,000 retail customers there.

“They’re already part of the same company, so it seems maybe rate cases, expenditures on lawyers, and that sort of thing will go down,” Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said. “There are areas where I would be happy to criticize Duke, but probably not on the merger.”

But there is speculation over what a merger would actually mean.

North Carolina has a multi-year rate plan system where Duke Energy files rate plans for a three-year period. This was last done three years ago.

Following current cycles, observers expect Duke Energy Progress to file for a rate increase sometime this fall and Duke Energy Carolinas to do the same in the early part of next year.

Duke is aiming to complete the merger on Jan. 1, 2027.

“The question in our minds is, ‘what does it mean to be filing for this merger at the same time you’d be filing for new rates?'” said Sue Sturgis, research and communications manager at the Energy and Policy Institute.

Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton told NC Newsline the details of that are still being worked out.

Shuffling costs

But to get South Carolina regulators to agree to the merger, the utility company proposes shuffling money around between customer groups to prevent potential sticker shock to its electric customers in South Carolina’s Upstate.

Just as in eastern North Carolina, Duke’s customers in the Pee Dee pay more per megawatt than customers in the Upstate, Charlotte area and western North Carolina. Merging the companies could result in major hikes for customers in South Carolina’s northwest corner, if they’re asked to pay more for a portion of the East’s more expensive power costs.

So, rather than possibly seeing their bills go down, Duke’s wholesale customers — which include South Carolina’s electric cooperatives — will forgo $55 million annually over five years to keep Upstate bills steady. Meanwhile, North Carolina customers would give up $25 million worth of savings annually over six years, according to filings made with the two states’ utility regulators.

That means the merger itself won’t make rates go up or down, according to the company.

In a statement, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said no retail rates would change immediately upon the merger’s completion. If the merger is approved in 2027, Duke said it would gradually shift the two sets of rates until they are evenly matched.

Few job cuts

The company does not expect to make significant personnel cuts as a result of the merger. There are about 13,500 employees for Duke Energy based in North Carolina and 4,000 in South Carolina, according to Duke Energy.

Duke Energy previously merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy in 2012, and maintains a corporate office in downtown Raleigh for Duke Energy Progress.

“Since our teams have largely operated as a combined organization since the 2012 merger, most personnel efficiencies have already been realized. There may be some very limited reductions in corporate-related areas, but we anticipate impacts will be managed through natural attrition and careful headcount management over time rather than anything immediate,” Norton wrote in an email.

In her testimony with the state Utilities Commission, Rachel Elliott, director of rates and regulatory planning for Duke Energy Carolinas, said the company expected about 3% of the projected savings to come from corporate administrative costs, such as having to only file one rate case, saving on legal fees and other regulatory expenses.

The merger would need to be approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any future rate changes will remain subject to regulatory approval. North and South Carolina regulators decide rate cases separately.

At least one South Carolina group — the South Carolina Policy Council, a think tank that advocates for limited government and free markets — is skeptical of the deal will benefit customers.

“They have their own reasons for the merger that are beneficial to them,” said Neil Wolin, a member of the Policy Council’s research team.

But it’s disingenuous to pitch the merger as a benefit and cost savings to customers when they won’t see any of that supposed savings in their utility bills, Wolin said.

“I don’t think South Carolinians are interested in deciphering” the benefits of rate relief amid rate hikes, Wolin continued. “They are getting their electricity bills, and they’re going up. No matter how many times (companies) say rates are going down, they are not. And that is the main issue.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/duke-goldsboro-icn-one-time-use-1024x5761755301538.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=B0zmZsTc,N,,2025-08-15 23:01:13.665769

(AP) — Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That's after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Labor is planning to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act after failing to deliver promised changes in its first term.

Jim Chalmers, speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of next week’s next economic reform roundtable, said better rules and processes were needed for faster approvals, while still protecting nature.

“It will be one of the main ways that people think through our regulatory challenges and our challenges around the time it takes to get projects approved,” Chalmers said.

“In all the consultation I’ve been doing – in housing, renewable energy projects – there are too many instances where people are burning cash waiting for approvals to build things that we desperately want people to build.”

Legislating a federal environment protection agency was a “very high and immediate” priority for the re-elected Labor government, the new environment minister, Murray Watt, said in May.

Watt signalled he wanted nature laws passed quickly to avoid another drawn-out political fight.

The former Treasury boss and environment campaigner Ken Henry has pitched the redesign as a productivity measure, comments Chalmers welcomed in his Guardian interview. He said other stakeholders had expressed similar views about the Howard-era laws to him privately in recent months.

“The status quo is no longer acceptable on the EPBC Act,” the treasurer said.

The goal of cutting cumbersome environmental regulation while maintaining environmental protections has eluded both sides of politics for more than a decade.

The Abbott government campaigned against “green tape” and gave state and territory governments sole responsibility for approving projects.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, scuttled a deal with the Greens to pass the so-called “nature positive laws” at the end of 2024, fearing a backlash in resources-reliant Western Australia.

Labor wants to push changes through federal parliament within 18 months, likely as one package of laws rather than in multiple stages – as attempted by the former environment minister Tanya Plibersek.

Treasury included reforms to environmental rules that would free up an estimated 30,000 additional housing approvals in a list of potential outcomes from the roundtable, which was leaked to the ABC on Thursday.

Chalmers said there were already “green shoots” emerging in Australia’s housing affordability and supply crisis, promising further moves to accelerate construction and planning approvals.

Welcoming an uptick in recent official homebuilding data, the treasurer said Labor was determined to speed up approvals for as many as 65,000 new homes, part of efforts to build 1.2m new dwellings by 2029.

“We’ll do better on housing if everyone does their bit,” Chalmers said.

“I’m confident that people in all parts of the system, investors, states and territories, certainly the commonwealth, the industry, there is a real appetite to work together to build more homes more quickly, and so that’s why we’ve got such an open mind to the ideas that people have been raising with us.”

The 1.2m target will be a challenge for the Albanese government, with Treasury and industry warning sluggish approval times and workforce shortages will make it hard to reach.

But Chalmers said work by the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, and this week’s change by corporate regulator Asic to ­review rules requiring superannuation funds to disclose stamp duty paid on residential real estate will help speed up new construction.

The so-called RG97 rule forces investors to declare stamp duty costs and is considered a deterrent to some investment. If implemented, the change could mean an extra 35,000 homes being built, Chalmers said.

“The last four or five datasets on housing, we’ve seen green shoots.”

Chalmers used an address to the National Press Club on 18 June to suggest the roundtable could deliver concrete tax reform proposals, declaring that “no sensible progress can be made on productivity, resilience or budget sustainability without proper consideration of more tax reform”.

But weeks later, it was clear that the prime minister had become concerned the government was losing control of expectations, and moved quickly to rein in excitement over what the roundtable would achieve.

“The government will make decisions, and the roundtable isn’t a substitute for government decision-making,” Albanese said on 6 August.

Days later, the prime minister killed off any immediate hopes of tax reform.

“The only tax policy that we’re implementing is the one that we took to the election,” he said.

Labor has faced calls from unions for a minimum 25% tax rate on high earners. The ACTU called for a 25% levy on LNG exports and caps to limit diesel fuel rebate payments to big corporations, as well as a four-day week for some workers.

The Productivity Commission has already proposed slashing the company tax rate to 20% for firms with less than $1bn in annual turnover, as well as a 5% net cashflow tax on about 500 of the country’s biggest businesses, including miners and supermarkets.

Albanese has ruled out changes to the rate and base of the GST and negative gearing, while changes to generous capital gains tax concessions and negative gearing rules for property investors look too politically sensitive.

With expectations now firmly lowered, questions have been asked about the value of the three-day roundtable, particularly in the context of the enormous ministerial and departmental effort involved.

“There’s been a heap of effort, working around the clock for four weeks to make sure that people’s voices are heard and that we can shape up a meaningful and useful roundtable,” Chalmers said.

“I see it as three days to help inform three budgets.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6073c59c9fb9d00673f224185677c18c7e6e7bcb/457_0_5387_4310/master/5387.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=900441a5a3a550b43ae94dca1bb53102",N,,2025-08-15 19:03:21.962127

Methodology

The Dallas Fed’s Texas Employment Forecast projects job growth for the calendar year and is estimated as the 12-month change in payroll employment from December to December.

The forecast is based on the average of four models. Three models are vector autoregressions for which Texas payroll employment is regressed on the lags of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices, the U.S. leading index and the Texas Leading Index. The fourth model is an autoregressive distributed lag model with regression of payroll employment on lags of payroll employment, current and lagged values of U.S. GDP growth and WTI oil prices, and Texas COVID-19 hospitalizations through March 2023. Forecasts of Texas payroll employment from this model also use forecasts of U.S. GDP growth from Blue Chip Economic Indicators and WTI oil price futures as inputs. All models include four COVID-19 dummy variables (March–June 2020).",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/Images/research/forecast/employee-walk-pri.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 19:03:50.993175

The UK grid faces a ‘zombie queue’ of projects seeking government and planning permissions. The queue covers 700GW of projects waiting for connection, far exceeding the required 200GW set out in the Paper.

The plans include to reduce the zombie queue include:

reforming grid access to prioritise strategic projects

launching a ‘connections accelerator’ by the end of 2025

using the Planning and Infrastructure Bill to streamline development.

In addition to the grid, the UK’s ports require upgrades to support renewable deployment, particularly the supply of offshore wind turbines. This is evidenced by Orsted’s announcement that it will use Teesworks for its Hornsea 3 supply port and the recent funding by the National Wealth Fund of the Teesside Port.

Financing and market support

New initiatives like the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme (2027) will reduce industrial power costs by up to £40/MWh. This is critical given UK industry currently pay some of the highest energy prices in Europe.

There is also support for Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) to expand funding avenues.

The National Wealth Fund will commit at least £5.8 billion over this Parliament and Great British Energy will receive an additional £700 million to support renewable energy growth.

Carbon Capture and net zero strategy

The UK’s Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sector trails Norway in cross-border carbon trading. From January 2027, the UK will introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to link domestic carbon pricing with Europe. The Industrial Strategy seeks to position the UK as Europe’s CO₂ storage hub, creating new employment opportunities — especially for oil and gas workers.

Climate leadership and political messaging

Ed Miliband’s climate emergency speech reinforces the government’s commitment to net zero and climate science. He stresses that climate action is both an economic opportunity and a moral responsibility to future generations. Miliband also rebuts critics who claim UK net-zero targets are unattainable, arguing leadership on climate is central to national identity.

However, Reform has questioned the economic value of the UK’s stated net zero plans together with the pressures that such a plan will have on the UK’s energy pricing. Reform MP for Boston and Skegness, Richard Tice, has stated that all AR7 applications will be revoked should Reform come to power in the next general election.

Oil and Gas overlooked

The strategy barely mentions oil (three times) and gas (seven times) across 160 pages.

Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) chief David Whitehouse has urged the government to recognise oil and gas as essential to industrial UK. The UK's energy reliance is still 75% on oil and gas, yet domestic production is projected to meet less than one-third of future demand, with the demand through to 2050 being estimated at 15 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE). Whitehouse advocates targeting at least 50% as a North Sea target for the UK to be self-sufficient, for example, extracting 7.5 BBOE from UK waters.

The Industrial Strategy’s short-term plans (such as lowering electricity bills for manufacturers) are seen as inadequate without long-term investment in North Sea energy, which should be seen as an integral and essential part of the UK’s energy mix for the next 25 years.

This message is further expanded upon by Richard Tice, who has stated that any companies bidding in the upcoming Allocation Round 7 (AR7) are doing so at their own risk, as should Reform come to power, all AR7 will be reassessed.

“These were fundamental security lapses,” says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously.
Lithuania last year passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters.
Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid.
(Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers’ solar inverters, as evidenced by security researchers last year.)","When pressed about his company’s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. “This is not an EG4 problem,” he says. “This is an industry-wide problem.” Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor’s inbox, he produced a 14-page report cataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019.

Not all of his customers — some of whom took to Reddit to complain — are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA’s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures.

“These were fundamental security lapses,” says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. “Adding insult to injury,” continues this individual, “EG4 didn’t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.”

Asked why EG4 didn’t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a “live and learn” moment.

“Because we’re so close [to addressing CISA’s concerns] and it’s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the ‘done’ button, and then advise people, so we’re not in the middle of the cake being baked,” says Showalter.

TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that “no known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.”

Connections to China spark security concerns

While unrelated, the timing of EG4’s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment.

Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries. According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers — components that hadn’t appeared on official hardware lists.

This reported discovery carries particular weight given China’s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.

The geopolitical implications haven’t escaped notice. Lithuania last year passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany.

But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4’s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company’s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NIST warns that “if you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.”

The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations.

Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers’ solar inverters, as evidenced by security researchers last year.)

The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection standards currently apply only to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms.

Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements.

But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum.

On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes.

“When you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,” he explains. “But when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.”

Put another way, the real concern isn’t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity.

Showalter has embraced CISA’s intervention as what he calls a “trust upgrade” — an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures.

But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company’s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they’d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vn8f2NBITjMBvUxFTTppNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/c0d7f374dcf88fd0f34819e5dee97b46,N,,2025-08-16 00:00:10.679512

Effort supports the intent of South Carolina leaders to address growth by continuing to operate proven electricity capacity in the state

GREENVILLE, S.C., Aug. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy has announced its submission of the final license application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Station, located near Salem, S.C. The application, if approved, would extend the plant's operations for an additional 50 years.

A flexible, dynamic, efficient and emission-free way to store and deliver large quantities of energy, pumped storage hydro plants store and generate energy by moving water between two reservoirs at different elevations. Located in Oconee County, S.C., Bad Creek is designed to produce significant amounts of energy when our customers need it most, performing a vital role as the largest ""battery"" on the company's system since 1991.

Why it matters: As part of the company's responsibility to serve nearly 860,000 retail electric customers across South Carolina, Duke Energy needs to not only build large amounts of new generation but also extend the lives of those proven workhorse facilities like Bad Creek and the company's existing nuclear fleet to support the economic success and growth the state is experiencing.

Duke Energy recently completed upgrades to the four units at the Bad Creek pumped storage facility in Salem, S.C. The upgrades add a total of 320 megawatts of carbon-free energy to the company's system, increasing the total capacity of the station to 1,680 megawatts.

This commitment to relicense the Bad Creek facility reflects the investments the company is making to maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

Next steps: The current operating license for the project expires in July 2027 and Duke Energy consulted with more than 70 stakeholders to propose a new license that would run for another 50 years.

Duke Energy expects a decision on our operating license application from FERC in 2027, before the original license expires.

Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.
Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.
Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina -- including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina.
The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That's after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina -- including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They would all continue to regulate the combined utility.

Under the big new tax and spending law passed by Republicans last month, solar and wind projects must commence construction by early July 2026 to access tax credits.
But it will apply to most other clean-energy developments, from community solar farms to massive utility-scale solar and wind projects.
But these industries are already reeling under the much-shortened timeline for securing tax credits under last month’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act; previously, under the Inflation Reduction Act, developers had until at least 2032 to commence construction and thereby secure tax credits.
The directive came after pressure from the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus members in the House of Representatives, who were upset that the law preserved tax credits for wind and solar projects at all.","The Trump administration has set up yet another roadblock for wind and solar power in the U.S. — one that will make it harder for clean-energy developers to qualify for federal tax credits before they expire next summer.

Treasury Department guidance released Friday puts new restrictions on the ​“safe-harboring” rules that have for decades guided whether solar and wind developers are considered to have ​“commenced construction,” a key milestone required to secure tax-credit eligibility.

The rules, which will go into effect on September 2, are likely to further slow the rollout of wind and solar power — two of the fastest-growing sources of energy in the country, both of which have been under siege by President Donald Trump since January.

Clean-energy industry advocates attacked the guidance as an improper use of executive authority that will make it harder for the U.S. to meet growing electricity demand and will further drive up electricity bills. But industry analysts noted that the new rules, though restrictive, could have turned out even worse.

Under the big new tax and spending law passed by Republicans last month, solar and wind projects must commence construction by early July 2026 to access tax credits.

For projects larger than 1.5 megawatts in size, Treasury’s new guidance eliminates one way for developers to prove they’ve started work: spending at least 5% of the total cost of the project by the deadline. That new restriction won’t apply to residential and commercial solar installations, so companies in that space such as Sunrun, Freedom Forever, SolarEdge, and Enphase, saw their share prices rise on Friday.

But it will apply to most other clean-energy developments, from community solar farms to massive utility-scale solar and wind projects. Starting in just a few weeks, projects larger than 1.5 megawatts will have only one option for proving they’re under construction: They must demonstrate that they are undertaking ​“physical work of a significant nature” on a continuous basis.

The test is not new, and project developers have relied on it in the past. But it is less straightforward than the 5% safe-harbor rules, creating uncertainty that could make it harder or more expensive for developers to lock down financing for a project.

“Unless you’re pretty far along, you’re not going to go build some roads and install racking overnight,”​said Andy Moon, CEO and cofounder of Reunion Infrastructure, a company that manages clean-energy tax-credit transfers. ​“It’s not so easy to change your plans and accelerate something that fast.”

Clean-energy industry groups declined to speculate about how the changes would impact the hundreds of gigawatts of solar and wind projects now under development across the country. But these industries are already reeling under the much-shortened timeline for securing tax credits under last month’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act; previously, under the Inflation Reduction Act, developers had until at least 2032 to commence construction and thereby secure tax credits. Analysts have said the drastically shortened tax-credit window will cut clean-energy growth by more than half over the coming decade.

That’s a problem for a country facing rising demand for power for data centers, factories, and broader economic growth. Solar, batteries, and wind made up 96% of new capacity added to U.S. grids last year and will remain the primary option for new power in the next few years, given that there are five- to seven-year wait times for new gas turbines and even longer construction timelines for nuclear and geothermal power plants.

“This is yet another act of energy subtraction from the Trump administration that will further delay the buildout of affordable, reliable power,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a Friday statement.

Since Trump signed the megalaw in July, his administration has taken a host of anti-wind and anti-solar actions, including subjecting projects to byzantine Interior Department reviews, setting ​“capacity density” restrictions for projects on federal lands, and potentially halting already permitted wind farms both onshore and offshore.

Shortly after the law passed in July, Trump ordered the Treasury Department to review the safe-harbor rules. The directive came after pressure from the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus members in the House of Representatives, who were upset that the law preserved tax credits for wind and solar projects at all. In that same executive order, Trump also told Treasury to develop rules governing ​“foreign entity of concern” restrictions; those rules, which are still in development, could be even more disruptive to the industry.

“The Treasury Department’s decision to accelerate the phaseout of clean energy tax credits undermines the integrity of our energy grid and our legislative process,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association trade group, said in a Friday statement. ​“Congress explicitly chose to provide energy companies with one year to phase out tax credits to keep energy prices low while meeting growing power demand.”

Friday’s guidance came despite entreaties from Senate Republicans Chuck Grassley of Iowa and John Curtis of Utah, who negotiated the tax-credit amendment to the final bill. Though both senators voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which cleared the Senate by just one vote, earlier this month they placed holds on three of Trump’s Treasury Department nominees in an attempt to force the administration to negotiate a less harmful change to the safe-harbor rules.

Grassley’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday afternoon.

“Frankly, I think the intervention worked,” said Pavel Molchanov, a Raymond James analyst covering cleantech companies. ​“Treasury could have gone really far in the direction of making life difficult.”

Molchanov cited rules left unchanged in Friday’s guidance, such as the four-year window for projects that commence construction by July 2026 to complete their work to secure their tax-credit eligibility. ​“Imagine if they had said, ​‘Oh, did we say four years? It’s actually two.’”

Similarly, the ​“physical work” requirements listed in Friday’s guidance are not outside the bounds of what a large-scale solar or wind project developer can reasonably take on over the next year, he said. Exemptions for extreme weather, permitting delays, and other obstacles to continuing work should shield developers from risks of being declared out of compliance with those requirements, he said.

“The good news is that it’s still almost 11 months until July 2026, so developers have plenty of room to make adjustments before starting construction,” Molchanov said. ​“From my perspective, it’s actually better than expected. But maybe my expectations were just so low to begin with.”

Jeff Cramer, CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a trade group that represents companies building smaller-scale solar and battery projects, decried the new guidance as a violation of the deal Republicans made in crafting the megalaw. But he also said that simply knowing the rules of the game is a help.

“I think the only good news is that there may now be less uncertainty,” he said. ​“The onus is now on the states to ensure that any projects that can meet that July 2026 deadline can do that.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Treasury.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=27eb62b7d965a2a22454719d18a495bc,N,,2025-08-15 18:03:34.240329

""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises.","The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures, that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it.

The Department of Transportation froze the funds in February, and months passed with no indication of when funding would be restarted. A coalition of more than a dozen states sued the federal government, alleging that the administration was violating the law and defying the will of Congress. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements.

Officials made it clear they haven't changed their minds about the merits of funding chargers — but they're acknowledging the separation of powers that give Congress, not the executive branch, authority over spending decisions.

""While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the states' lawsuit against the freeze, said it was ""encouraging"" news that the administration is restarting the program. But, he said, it's not an automatic end to the legal challenge.

""It is promising that we're seeing some responses to our lawsuit and we're seeing some effort to give us the money that Congress has mandated,"" he told NPR. ""We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately.""

Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause.

""It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,"" Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement.

Stripping out requirements

The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers. To access the funds, states had to submit a plan for where and how they would build chargers. Once the plan was approved, each state's department of transportation would work with companies to install chargers, and then get reimbursed by the federal government.

It took more than two years after the law's passage for the first chargers to open to the public. As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project. But after the slow start, the same dataset shows that funding awards were accelerating through 2024 — until the Trump administration hit the brakes.

The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from ""a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy.""

The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. States will no longer be required to engage with rural or underserved communities while planning charger locations. They do not need to direct benefits toward disadvantaged communities. They don't need to demonstrate that they've factored in labor or safety standards, or provided opportunities for minority-owned businesses. They won't need to address evacuations, snow removal or extreme weather in their plans.

Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. States will have more discretion on charger locations.

The DOT didn't respond to NPR's requests for an interview. But in a statement posted on the department's website, Duffy said this new guidance would speed things up. ""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let's cut the waste and do it right,"" he wrote. ""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.""

Mixed reviews from the EV charger world

Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies.

""We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape,"" wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. ""Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs.""

The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was ""encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers.""

""We're optimistic,"" says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. ""They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program."" He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space.

Of course, removing some requirements won't eliminate the need to find locations and contract with builders and pull permits, all of which takes time.

And there's a common refrain in the EV charger world: While people don't mind the changes to the guidance, they are frustrated by the delay and disruption they caused.

Alex Laska of Third Way — who had been sharply critical of the inefficiencies of the Biden program — gave mixed reviews to the Trump administration revisions. He noted that some forms of ""red tape,"" like requirements about the type of charger, remain.

And other requirements have been deleted after states had already completed the work to meet them, meaning it won't actually save any time or effort.

Aside from loosening the requirements on location, the change is ""kind of a nothingburger,"" he says. ""This guidance was not worth holding up the program for, you know, now over half a year.""

Andrew Bennett, the CEO of DRIIVZ, a company that builds software for charging stations, says the freeze disrupted a lot of projects that might have gotten greenlit this year.

In the meantime, while chargers have been built with private money, Bennett says, it's not enough: ""We need about six times more just to keep up.""

NASDAQ: ASPI (""ASPI” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today announced that the Company and its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (“QLE” or “Quantum Leap Energy”), an advanced materials company focused on the development of technology and processes for the production of advanced nuclear fuels, have entered into a Joint Venture Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Fermi LLC (“Fermi America”), regarding a joint venture pursuant to which the parties intend to collaborate on the research, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels on the planned HyperGrid Campus in Carson County, Texas.

The non-binding MOU contemplates QLE and Fermi America entering into definitive agreements pursuant to which the parties will form a new entity in Texas as a joint venture for the research and development, and then the construction, of an advanced nuclear fuel enrichment facility capable of producing large quantities of High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) for small modular reactors. It is anticipated that the advanced nuclear fuel facility will provide for the conversion and deconversion of uranium products, as well as the fabrication of fuel assemblies. In addition, the MOU contemplates ASPI entering into a separate lease for the development and construction of a 100% ASPI-owned enrichment research and commercial production facility for stable isotopes and advanced materials (excluding advanced nuclear fuels), which may include critical materials, such as Silicon-28, Germanium-70, Ytterbium-176, Nickel-64, Xenon-129, Zinc-68 and Chlorine-37.

The property leased by Fermi America from the from the Texas Tech University System for the HyperGrid Campus is strategically located near the DOE-operated Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, offering unique proximity to a federally hardened and environmentally characterized site. The site is pre-qualified for nuclear deployment under DOE and NRC precedent studies and is governed by sovereign institutional control held by Texas Tech University, as lessor. The HyperGrid Campus is expected to be the world’s largest hybrid energy and data infrastructure campus and is anticipated to generate over 11 GW of electricity to supply data centers, as well as other industries. Pantex is the primary United States nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility that aims to maintain the safety, security and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and is home to the site where most U.S. nuclear weapons are constructed and assembled.

Fermi America, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and former Texas Governor Rick Perry, along with Former Quantum Private Equity Co-Founder, Toby Neugebauer, aims to meet the rapidly growing energy demands tied to AI infrastructure. Fermi America has submitted its Combined Operating License Application to build four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors as part of its HyperGrid Project. Fermi America plans to begin construction on the nuclear power complex in 2027 and aims to have the first reactor operational by 2032. Fermi America has also entered into an MOU with Hyundai E&C for the construction and engineering of Nuclear Reactors on the HyperGrid site.

The Joint Venture MOU by and among ASPI, QLE and Fermi America was signed at a signing ceremony that took place in Dallas, Texas on August 14, 2025 and was attended by representatives of all parties, including Mr. Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASPI, Dr. Ryno Pretorius, CEO of Quantum Leap Energy, and Mr. Toby Neugebauer, CEO of Fermi America.

Toby Neugebauer, Co-Founder of Fermi America, said, “ Over the last three decades, our country has been asleep at the wheel, forcing reliance on foreign nations for critical technology materials such as next-generation semiconductors and nuclear energy. Fermi is determined to restore America as global leaders in the nuclear space, and our partnership with ASP Isotopes and Quantum Leap Energy is the natural next step.”

Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASP Isotopes and Chairman of Quantum Leap Energy, said “ During the last three years, ASP Isotopes has constructed three isotope enrichment facilities in South Africa to produce isotopes to enable faster semiconductors and next-generation cancer therapies. As a U.S. company, our goal has always been to bring these technologies to the United States to ensure that the United States has a domestic supply of these materials and reduce its reliance on imports from other countries. We are excited to enter into this joint venture with Fermi America to accelerate this goal. ”

Ryno Pretorius, CEO of Quantum Leap Energy, commented that “ QLE is excited to enter the United States domestic production market as a provider of Nuclear Fuel Services to meet the rapidly growing demands of the Fermi America HyperGrid project, as well as existing and future partners in the United States. Our goal is to scale our technologies as quickly as possible to reduce the bottleneck on the nuclear fuel industry and unlock clean American nuclear energy that will provide consistent, base load power, not only for AI but millions of Americans. We believe Fermi America is another key strategic partner to help us develop and scale our nuclear fuel services and solutions in the United States with an initial base in Texas. ”

During the next 30 years, global energy consumption will likely double ( 1) . The advanced nuclear fuels required during the next 50 years are expected to differ significantly from those used in the last 50 years. AI demand requires high base load energy which will be partially supplied by large growth in the nuclear industry from Small Modular Reactors. Many small modular and advanced reactors in the future are expected to require HALEU. The Company has received interest from potential customers who collectively require over $37 billion of HALEU between the present day and 2037, at current market prices.

ASPI has previously announced that it has entered into two supply agreements with TerraPower, LLC for HALEU from an initial uranium facility they expect to construct at Pelindaba in South Africa. The initial core supply agreement is intended to support the supply of the required first fuel cores for the initial loading of TerraPower’s Natrium project in Wyoming during the 2027/28 timeframe. The long-term supply agreement is a 10-year supply agreement of up to a total of 150 metric tons of HALEU, commencing in 2028 through end of 2037. The construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility in Texas, USA would become the second facility owned or co-owned by QLE for the production of HALEU. ASPI and QLE are also in discussions with the UK government regarding the construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility in the UK. ASPI has also previously announced its intention to spin out QLE as a separate public company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 4Q25.

The signing of the Joint Venture MOU with Fermi America was facilitated by Ocean Wall Limited, who acted as adviser to both ASP Isotopes and Fermi America in establishing this strategic partnership.

The manufacturer scheduled a ceremonial groundbreaking for September and is on track to begin construction next year, company representative Peebles Squire says. The startup will still use its originally selected contractor, Clayco, for the job.

The plan calls for a 16-million-sq-ft manufacturing plant on an 1,800-acre campus. It will be built in two phases, each adding production capacity for 200,000 vehicles, Squire says.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) originally announced Rivian’s plan to build the plant in 2021. In 2023, the company said it selected Chicago-based Clayco to build the facility, along with Jacobs as engineer and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as design architect. But last year, shortly after Rivian revealed a $5.4-billion loss over its prior fiscal year, the company said it would pause the project and produce an upcoming SUV at its existing plant in Normal, Ill., instead of at the Georgia facility.

A few months later, Rivian announced it would build a $1.5-billion expansion on the Illinois plant.

In January, Rivian closed a loan agreement with the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s Loan Programs Office for up to $6.6 billion to support the Georgia project, on top of an incentive package from Georgia worth $1.5 billion. Under terms of an economic development agreement with the state, Rivian must invest at least $5 billion and create 7,500 full-time jobs by the end of 2030.

Last month, Rivian also announced it would open an East Coast headquarters office in Atlanta, in addition to the manufacturing campus about 40 miles east of the city. That office is scheduled to open this year, with an expansion to follow.

With OBBBA’s overhaul of TCJA’s international tax provisions, the IRS should prioritize working with taxpayers to minimize the burden of compliance.","Introduction

With the recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the Treasury Department and the IRS will now need to update or create forms and their corresponding instructions, create processing systems for new taxpayer information, educate employees and the public, and issue guidance and regulations. Provisions such as the new individual income tax deductions for tip and overtime income and international tax changes will require detailed regulations to implement.

Concerns are growing about how the IRS will implement the law, with former IRS communications chief Terry Lemons stating that implementing OBBBA “is going to require a lot of changes across really the whole swath of IRS operations.” Yet the fact that most of the tax cuts are extensions of current policy should make implementation of OBBBA easier than some past major changes to the tax code. Additionally, the Administration can draw on lessons learned during past instances where the IRS implemented major changes to the tax code in a relatively short time period. To build upon our proposals for the IRS to enhance customer service, modernize its technology, close the tax gap, and safeguard taxpayer rights, this paper identifies several key best practices for implementing OBBBA.

Taxpayers need the Treasury Department and the IRS to communicate tax law changes early, put everything online, and issue guidance that is clear, fair, and timely.

Communicate early and often.

While the mantra, “communicate early and often” is typically used in interpersonal situations, the necessity of communicating tax law changes with taxpayers as early and as often as possible cannot be overstated. This is especially important with OBBBA, as it makes retroactive changes to tax law and revises eligibility criteria for existing credits and deductions. Communicating tax law changes in plain language, even before formalizing regulations and guidance, can go a long way toward helping taxpayers understand how the changes impact them.

Make Information about When Policy Changes Go into Effect Accessible

Tax law changes that apply to the current 2025 tax year may present administrative challenges, but the IRS has had to cope with them several times before. The most wide-ranging example in recent history is the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021, which made several retroactive changes to key individual income tax provisions including the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and unemployment taxation.

Some of OBBBA’s most novel and complex provisions are retroactive to the beginning of the current 2025 tax year. These provisions include deductions for tip and overtime income, the deduction for car loan interest payments, and the additional standard deduction for seniors.

Yet, because little information has been conveyed yet to the broader public, tipped workers may not know that the tips they earn today are eligible for the new deduction. Tipped workers could benefit by proactively standardizing their record keeping, since tipped income can be more difficult to document than overtime income recorded by employers or car loan interest payments recorded by lenders.

Communicate Changes to Eligibility Criteria

Several elements of OBBBA change eligibility requirements for existing tax provisions or introduce eligibility criteria for new provisions. Specifically, the Child Tax Credit now requires Social Security numbers from child and taxpayer (and where the taxpayer is a married couple, both of them). The Premium Tax Credit (PTC) can now only be taken by U.S. citizens, green card holders, and certain refugees.

These changes could affect millions of taxpayers. If U.S. citizens or otherwise eligible individuals have not taken the steps to get required documentation, early communication could help them prepare in time to receive the credits they lawfully qualify for. The IRS must ensure information about eligibility changes is relayed to Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAS), Low-Income Tax Clinics (LITC), and other local offices that meet taxpayers where they are.

Provide Plain Language Explanations

OBBBA includes many tax law changes that are applicable to generalized groups of taxpayers including college students and graduates, non-citizens, small business owners, and more. Describing OBBBA’s changes for these taxpayers in plain language would provide a clear and reliable source of information for taxpayers, helping to counteract politically charged misinformation about the bill. The IRS has already started this by providing plain language explanations of new individual tax deductions.

Put everything online.

It is a simple fact that meeting taxpayer needs in the modern age means allowing them to find the information they need easily and quickly online. OBBBA implementation is an opportunity for the Trump Administration to deliver on its promises to modernize the IRS and the federal government more broadly. An effective online strategy should include changes to the IRS.gov website to increase navigability, enhance the usefulness of Online Accounts, and increase digital taxpayer service options.

Enhance Website Navigability

The IRS website is often not intuitive, contains duplicative pages, and can be difficult to navigate. The new Administration recognizes this issue and made some changes to the website earlier this year. While some of these changes were very helpful, such as moving the Login button to a more noticeable part of the site, the rushed rollout led to typos and other minor errors that undermined the improvements.

There are many ways the IRS can improve the navigability of its website in its implementation of OBBBA, in part by mirroring the approach taken during implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). After TCJA became law, the IRS created an entirely new landing page titled “tax reform” where it housed summaries of the provisions affecting individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt entities along with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) pages for various topics. The tax reform page remains active under the “News” menu option on the site alongside pages for the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Taxpayers First Act.

The IRS should not only create a separate page for updates regarding OBBBA, it should also make it prominent on the front landing page as soon as taxpayers go to the site. With the website currently having two menu bars, one with left-justified bold text and one with smaller right-justified text, taxpayers may not notice the “News” button which would lead them to updates on specific laws passed. Consolidating the two menu bars and adding a link to where taxpayers can find information specifically about OBBBA would reduce the number of times taxpayers click through the site before finding the page they are looking for.

In addition, to make it easier for taxpayers and tax professionals to be apprised of updates, the IRS should adopt RSS-compatible formatting for its index of data and publication releases at irs.gov/downloads. That index also lacks clear explanations of the available information, so NTUF put together a resource to help users navigate it more easily: A Guide to the IRS’s Index of Documents and Data. The IRS could incorporate this into its website.

Improve Functionality of Online Accounts

The IRS currently has limited digital self-service options available to taxpayers, and the tools that are available fall short of taxpayer needs. Many private companies, utility providers, and state tax departments allow customers to create online accounts to manage their balance and interact with the business or agency.

Currently, individuals can create Individual Online Accounts through the IRS website that allow them to view or request tax transcripts, pay tax due, and view some notices. Tax professionals can create Tax Pro accounts and the IRS recently expanded the availability of Business Tax Accounts. Yet these accounts lack important features when compared with online accounts available to taxpayers through local tax agencies in 41 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.

The National Taxpayer Advocate’s “Most Serious Problems” identified return processing and challenges using Online Accounts as the second Most Serious Problem for taxpayers in 2023. The report found that the inability for taxpayers to respond to notices online across all available accounts, even if these notices are some of the few that are accessible via accounts, makes these accounts a less effective tool. The report also explained that documents that taxpayers upload to the IRS are actually still manually routed by an IRS agent, which increases processing time and can lead taxpayers to call phone lines anyway.

As part of its effort to modernize its technology, the IRS is updating Online Accounts for individuals and businesses. Earlier this year, the IRS announced that it added the ability to view and download W-2, 1099-NEC, and other forms. Taxpayers now have access to over 200 different notices via Online Accounts.

The new forms and notices likely to be created and existing ones needing to be updated because of OBBBA should all be accessible via Online Accounts. In addition, Online Accounts must be overhauled on the backend to allow for seamless processing of taxpayer information to truly create a two-way communication experience.

Issue clear, timely, and fair guidance.

The most critical step to implement any new tax law is issuing guidance and regulations. The IRS recently failed to provide clear, timely, and fair guidance in its regulatory implementation of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

ARPA lowered the threshold for reporting third-party financial transactions on platforms like eBay or Etsy or using vendors such as PayPal or Venmo. Instead of $20,000 and 200 transactions to trigger filing of a Form 1099-K, ARPA reduced it to $600. Year after year, the IRS issued statements at the eleventh hour that it was delaying or changing implementation of new 1099-K requirements, seemingly without the legal authority to do so. If the IRS thought the ARPA threshold was unworkable, it never sought legislative action to address it. Ultimately, OBBBA repealed the ARPA changes to the 1099-K threshold.

Failure to implement the law in a timely fashion also occurred with the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT, or book tax) enacted by IRA. For the CAMT, the IRS proposed a 600 page rule for its implementation on September 12, 2024, two years after the law was enacted. This unnecessary complexity, delay, and injustice to taxpayers cannot happen again.

Guidance and rules are most needed for new tax provisions included in OBBBA such as the “no tax on . . .” provisions and the remittances tax. OBBBA does some work in the bill itself, defining certain food service and cosmetic services as generally being qualified tipped lines of business. But the law directs the Secretary of the Treasury to provide guidance to “prevent abuse of the deduction.”

The law also includes substantial changes to TCJA provisions that will surface more prominently in the regulatory process than they did during debate of the bill. For example, the Opportunity Zones program underwent significant eligibility changes with OBBBA and will need regulatory guidance to determine which areas qualify for the tax incentive. International tax changes will also need extensive clarification due to the complexity of international tax law and interactions with other provisions.

Prioritize Clarity When Crafting Guidance

Clarity, readability, and accuracy are essential for IRS guidance. Unfortunately, the IRS has bungled this task in the recent past. In 2022, the IRS sent letters containing errors to millions of taxpayers receiving the Child Tax Credit. The IRS then encouraged taxpayers to rely on information in their Online Accounts rather than the information from the letters.

Notices are so frequently unclear that legislation has been introduced to improve clarity of the most common type of notice, the so-called math error notice that 2.2 million taxpayers receive to adjust their tax paid after filing.

Release Information in a Timely Manner

Timely issuance of guidance will be essential in implementing OBBBA, especially in light of provisions effective this tax year and those that affect large corporations. The Administration claims that teams within the IRS are already being put together to implement the law, so hopefully we can expect guidance to be issued shortly.

Ensure Fairness in the Regulatory Process

New regulations need to respect taxpayers’ rights, involving taxpayers throughout the duration of the regulatory process and listening to their concerns. The new Administration is currently updating or withdrawing regulations proposed during the Biden Administration. Regulations that put an undue burden on taxpayers, such as digital asset regulations proposed by the last Administration and withdrawn recently, are quite simply not fair.

There are a few steps the Treasury Department and the IRS can take to make its regulatory process more fair when implementing OBBBA. First, it should have open comment periods for regulations with an adequate amount of time for taxpayers to submit concerns alongside public hearings for contentious policies. Second, if an overwhelming majority of taxpayers express concern about proposed guidance, the IRS must make changes to address these concerns in its final rule. Finally, the IRS must communicate lengthy guidelines in a clear and concise manner so taxpayers can understand their obligations.

Earlier this year, the IRS solicited public input on items to be included in its Priority Guidance Plan. We look forward to reviewing the plan when it is released.

Flexible Regulatory Approaches

For OBBBA’s other most complex provisions, the IRS should utilize regulatory sandboxes and safe harbors to guide taxpayers through compliance. The IRS has already announced that it plans to provide transition relief for taxpayers and employers while implementing new individual income tax deductions. Safe harbors are effective methods to protect taxpayers who make an earnest effort to meet their obligations under the new law. For example, the IRS has provided a simplified option for taking the home office deduction so taxpayers do not have to calculate the cost basis for individual assets. Similarly, the IRS could create an employer safe harbor for the tip income deduction that relies on previously issued tip income guidance.

Using a regulatory sandbox approach would allow the IRS to conserve resources by relying on private sector expertise to assist with development of sensible regulations at a time when the IRS staff count is declining. This approach may be especially useful for complex business tax provisions such as international tax changes. After passage of TCJA, the IRS received input on proposed regulations for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) for nearly one year, finalizing rules in June 2019. Even so, in July 2020 errors in the regulations were identified that required corrections to be issued. With OBBBA’s overhaul of TCJA’s international tax provisions, the IRS should prioritize working with taxpayers to minimize the burden of compliance.

Conclusion

OBBBA implementation will benefit from considering all of these elements together holistically. When the IRS puts out new information on a tax law change, it should do so as early as possible using online methods and ensure the information is clear, timely, and fair.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2024/10/AdobeStock-131610852.jpeg?v=20241023111800,N,,2025-08-15 20:04:12.355563

Imagine if Detroit had doubled down on horse-drawn carriages instead of embracing the automobile. What if, out of loyalty to farriers and coachbuilders, we halted innovation and dug in our heels? Had that happened, another city would have cemented its position as Motor City. It may sound ridiculous, but this same story is repeating itself in the solar industry. We have the technology of the future, it’s benefiting Michiganders, and yet our federal government is digging in its heels and doubling down on longstanding fossil fuel industry subsidies and investments.

Despite the federal pushback that aims to stall necessary progress, our team at Absolute Solar is building the future one solar system installation at a time. We’re building a clean energy economy that’s affordable, accessible, and rooted in American innovation. We’ve installed and overseen nearly 20 megawatts of solar development, employ 25 people, and design systems that boost property values and deliver savings for homeowners, farmers, businesses, and nonprofits alike. Our work addresses kitchen table issues like energy independence, job creation, grid reliability, and severe weather. We are building resilient communities and safeguarding natural resources for future generations.

Furthermore, solar systems produce their most power during peak demand, precisely when our electrical grids need it most. This helps flatten the demand curve, providing grid resilience and lowering demand-related rates for everyone.

Solar demand is booming. In fact, in 2024 solar and storage accounted for 84% of all new electric generating capacity added to the grid. Despite this, the federal government is intentionally stalling our momentum. Just last month, the feds stripped funding for solar tax credits and a few days later they halted Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants. These were opportunities that directly brought down energy costs for consumers in rural communities, who often face the highest energy bills. They were popular programs. In fact, since 2014, Michigan was one of the top 10 states to receive REAP grants. They were also bipartisan. 75% of the grants were awarded to districts represented by Republicans.

Yet instead of evening the playing field, the government is picking winners and favoring an already entrenched, heavily subsidized fossil fuel industry. Temporary, and now rescinded, tax incentives for solar from the Inflation Reduction Act pale in comparison to the $10 billion-40 billion in annual subsidies that the federal government has given to the oil and gas industry each year for decades. If renewable energy didn’t make strong economic sense, the oil industry wouldn’t be working so hard to stop it. But we won’t stop.

We will continue to expand consumer choice, drive down electricity prices, create good paying jobs, grow energy independence, and help build the resilient grid needed for the future. We will continue to educate the public on solar and build strategic solar systems that put money back in the pockets of everyday people.

Rolling back solar incentives hits small business owners, farmers, and rural communities hardest. These are the same people often touted by politicians as “the backbone of America.” Now they’re being left behind, unable to pass down family farms or reduce energy bills because policymakers caved to pressure from the fossil fuel industry.

Taking away the tools that make solar accessible for all hurts working-class Americans. We’re not asking for special treatment. We’re asking for a level playing field. Just as Detroit put the world on wheels, America has the chance to lead the world in harnessing the sun.",https://s43098.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/solar-APPA-unsplash-1024x676.png.webp,N,,2025-08-15 19:03:41.458973

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate.

OBBBA established new deadlines for wind and solar development, allowing projects that start construction before the end of this year to qualify for the tax credits as they currently stand.
The new guidance also contains a carve-out that allows solar projects that are less than 1.5 megawatts to use the 5% rule, which will help rooftop solar and smaller community-scale installations.
Trump’s executive order came after a reported deal he made with House Freedom Caucus Republicans who wanted to axe the tax credits altogether.
“It’s not good, it’s not helpful, but from my perspective, the guidance could have been a lot worse,” David Burton, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright who specializes in energy tax credits, told me.","The Trump administration issued new rules for the wind and solar tax credits on Friday, closing the loop on a question that has been giving developers anxiety since the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in early July.

For decades, developers have been able to lock in tax credit eligibility by establishing that they have officially started construction on a project in one of two ways. They could complete “physical work of a significant nature,” such as excavating the project site or installing foundational equipment, or they could simply spend 5% of the total project budget, for instance by purchasing key components and putting them in a warehouse. After that, they had at least four years to start shipping power to the grid before stricter work requirements kicked in.

Shortly after signing the OBBBA, however, Trump issued an executive order directing the Treasury Department to revise its definition of the “beginning of construction” of a wind or solar project. Under the new law, this definition can make or break a project. OBBBA established new deadlines for wind and solar development, allowing projects that start construction before the end of this year to qualify for the tax credits as they currently stand. But projects that start construction between January 1 and July 4 of 2026 will have to follow stringent new rules limiting the use of materials with ties to China in order to qualify.

The start construction date also affects how long a developer has to complete a project and still qualify for credits. Projects that start before July 4 of next year have at least four years, while those that start after must meet an impossibly short timeline of being up and running in just a year and a half, by the end of 2027.

Some worried the new guidance would narrow that four year timeframe or affect project eligibility retroactively. Neither happened. The only major change the Treasury department made to the existing guidance was to get rid of the 5% safe harbor provision. While this is not nothing, and will certainly disqualify some projects that might otherwise have been able to claim the credits, it is nowhere near as calamitous for renewables as it could have been.

Projects can still establish they have started construction by completing “physical work of a significant nature,” and the definition of physical work still includes off-site work, such as the manufacturing of equipment. That means it’s still possible for a company to simply place an order for a custom piece of equipment, like a transformer, to establish their start date — as long as they have a binding contract in place and can demonstrate that the physical production of the equipment is underway.

The new guidance also contains a carve-out that allows solar projects that are less than 1.5 megawatts to use the 5% rule, which will help rooftop solar and smaller community-scale installations.

Trump’s executive order came after a reported deal he made with House Freedom Caucus Republicans who wanted to axe the tax credits altogether. The order directed the Treasury to prevent “the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” and restrict “the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Treasury’s relative restraint, then, comes as something of a relief. “It’s not good, it’s not helpful, but from my perspective, the guidance could have been a lot worse,” David Burton, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright who specializes in energy tax credits, told me. “Utility-scale solar and wind developers should be able to plan around this and not be that harmed.”

That doesn’t mean clean energy groups are happy about the changes, though. “At a time when we need energy abundance, these rules create new federal red tape,” Heather O’Neill, president and CEO of the industry group Advanced Energy United, said in a statement. “These rules will make it more difficult and expensive to build and finance critical energy projects in the U.S.”

The changes don’t go into effect until September 2, so for the next two weeks, all projects can still utilize the 5% safe harbor.

Even though the rules are not the death-blow for projects that some anticipated, there’s still one big unknown that could squeeze development further: The Treasury department has yet to put out guidance related to the new foreign sourcing rules created by the OBBB. One of the big fears there is that companies will have to prove their lack of ties to China so far up their supply chains that compliance becomes impossible.

We probably won’t be left wondering for long, though. Trump’s executive order asked for those rules within 45 days, putting the due date on Monday.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQ2OTQyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNzgwNDg0N30.PGPzD_ZVqcGxRs2u5Vux5WakxCo2iB_mLbk4wq2TopY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-08-15 18:02:29.216232

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful.
Stripping out requirements The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers.
As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project.
""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises.","The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures, that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it.

The Department of Transportation froze the funds in February, and months passed with no indication of when funding would be restarted. A coalition of more than a dozen states sued the federal government, alleging that the administration was violating the law and defying the will of Congress. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements.

Officials made it clear they haven't changed their minds about the merits of funding chargers — but they're acknowledging the separation of powers that give Congress, not the executive branch, authority over spending decisions.

""While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the states' lawsuit against the freeze, said it was ""encouraging"" news that the administration is restarting the program. But, he said, it's not an automatic end to the legal challenge.

""It is promising that we're seeing some responses to our lawsuit and we're seeing some effort to give us the money that Congress has mandated,"" he told NPR. ""We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately.""

Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause.

""It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,"" Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement.

Stripping out requirements

The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers. To access the funds, states had to submit a plan for where and how they would build chargers. Once the plan was approved, each state's department of transportation would work with companies to install chargers, and then get reimbursed by the federal government.

It took more than two years after the law's passage for the first chargers to open to the public. As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project. But after the slow start, the same dataset shows that funding awards were accelerating through 2024 — until the Trump administration hit the brakes.

The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from ""a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy.""

The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. States will no longer be required to engage with rural or underserved communities while planning charger locations. They do not need to direct benefits toward disadvantaged communities. They don't need to demonstrate that they've factored in labor or safety standards, or provided opportunities for minority-owned businesses. They won't need to address evacuations, snow removal or extreme weather in their plans.

Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. States will have more discretion on charger locations.

The DOT didn't respond to NPR's requests for an interview. But in a statement posted on the department's website, Duffy said this new guidance would speed things up. ""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let's cut the waste and do it right,"" he wrote. ""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.""

Mixed reviews from the EV charger world

Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies.

""We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape,"" wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. ""Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs.""

The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was ""encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers.""

""We're optimistic,"" says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. ""They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program."" He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space.

Of course, removing some requirements won't eliminate the need to find locations and contract with builders and pull permits, all of which takes time.

And there's a common refrain in the EV charger world: While people don't mind the changes to the guidance, they are frustrated by the delay and disruption they caused.

Alex Laska of Third Way — who had been sharply critical of the inefficiencies of the Biden program — gave mixed reviews to the Trump administration revisions. He noted that some forms of ""red tape,"" like requirements about the type of charger, remain.

And other requirements have been deleted after states had already completed the work to meet them, meaning it won't actually save any time or effort.

In the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress explicitly chose to provide energy companies with one year to phase out tax credits to keep energy prices low while meeting growing power demand.","The Trump administration has announced another policy that will likely harm the U.S. renewable energy industry. New guidance from the Treasury Department announced August 15 will make it even harder for wind and solar power projects to take advantage of federal tax credits, which already were under fire from the White House.

Friday’s move is the latest in a series of actions by President Trump to strike down existing rules that support renewable energy, and is another blow to clean energy in the wake of Republican lawmakers’ recent passage of a sweeping new tax law.

Energy industry analysts said the latest action by the Treasury aims to fulfill pledges the president made to legislators in exchange for their support for the spending and tax law he signed in July. Some lawmakers, including GOP members from states with economic stakes in wind and solar, have pushed back on the new rules. The Treasury Dept. did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new guidance.

The GOP law passed in July terminated existing investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects that start producing electricity after 2027. It did, however, provide more time for projects that begin construction within a year. Trump subsequently directed the Treasury Dept. to “strictly enforce” the end of the credits for solar and wind installations, and also issued new guidance around what is meant by beginning construction. That guidance meant projects might not quality even if they met a longstanding metric, which allowed solar and wind farms to qualify for credits by taking various steps, including having already incurred 5% of a project’s total cost, or the actual start of construction.

Unprecedented Action

Clean energy developers along with attorneys well-versed in tax law have called the guidance potentially illegal, and certainly unprecedented. The guidance says it is “is effective for applicable wind and solar facilities the construction of which did not begin … prior to September 2, 2025.”

The new rules will require all wind power projects, and all but small solar projects, to show they are conducting physical construction, rather than relying on the 5% “safe harbor” as previously recognized. Only solar projects less than 1.5 MW, which means most rooftop solar installations, would continue to quality under safe harbor.

New projects also will need to show they are continuously under construction, though some exceptions could be granted depending on the “relevant faces and circumstances” of the delay.

Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, among the lawmakers who has questioned Trump’s actions around renewable energy, said he would continue to object to the consideration of nominees to Treasury posts until he is “certain that such rules and regulations adhere to the law and congressional intent.”

Heather O’Neill, president and CEO of Advanced Energy United, an energy industry business group that works to shape state and regional policy, told POWER, “At a time when we need energy abundance, these rules create new federal red tape. They eliminate long-standing precedent for how companies demonstrate they’ve begun project development. These rules will make it more difficult and expensive to build and finance critical energy projects in the U.S. that are needed to power homes, small businesses, and new manufacturing and industry dependent on reliable and affordable energy.”

O’Neill added, “While our industry responds to these changes, governors and state leaders must take urgent action to help already-proposed projects make it across the finish line. With energy demands set to soar and jobs at risk, states across the country should take executive action to speed up project procurement, siting, and permitting approvals while longer-term reforms are made. Consumers will be hit with higher energy bills and a less reliable grid unless state leaders prioritize bringing low-cost, ready-to-build clean energy online as fast as possible.”

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association (ACP), in an email to POWER wrote: “The Treasury Department’s decision to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits undermines the integrity of our energy grid and our legislative process. In the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress explicitly chose to provide energy companies with one year to phase out tax credits to keep energy prices low while meeting growing power demand. We acknowledge and appreciate the hard work of Senators who led the effort to elevate pragmatism over partisanship in the legislative process. Their continued advocacy to protect this legislative agreement was instrumental in avoiding greater impediments to energy deployment.”

‘Side Deal’ to Derail Renewables

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), in a statement said: “The Treasury Department’s new guidance to further restrict energy tax credits is part of an unprecedented side deal the administration made with anti-clean energy ideologues to undermine Congress and further harm America’s solar industry. This is a blatant rejection of what Congress passed in H.R. 1, and it threatens thousands of small businesses across the country that are the backbone of our clean energy economy.

“This is yet another act of energy subtraction from the Trump administration that will further delay the buildout of affordable, reliable power. American families and businesses will pay more for electricity as a result of this action, and China will continue to outpace us in the race for electricity to power AI,” said Hopper, echoing the comments of others in the energy industry who have said attacks on renewable energy harm efforts around Trump’s call for U.S. “energy dominance.”

“SEIA is carefully reviewing the guidance and evaluating next steps to protect the industry’s and America’s interests, as we have been since this side deal was announced last month,” said Hopper. “In the meantime, we urge the Trump administration to stop the political games, stop punishing businesses, and get serious about how to actually build the power we need right now to meet demand and stay competitive.”

The guidance is expected to stall or halt “hundreds” of planned wind and solar projects, according to industry analysts. Adrian Deveny, founder and president of Climate Vision, a policy advisory firm, told POLITICO the new guidance would “pull the rug out from under the entire pipeline of wind and solar projects that are in development.” Deveny previously served as a policy director for New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and worked on the clean energy credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful.
Stripping out requirements The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers.
As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project.
""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises.","The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures, that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it.

The Department of Transportation froze the funds in February, and months passed with no indication of when funding would be restarted. A coalition of more than a dozen states sued the federal government, alleging that the administration was violating the law and defying the will of Congress. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements.

Officials made it clear they haven't changed their minds about the merits of funding chargers — but they're acknowledging the separation of powers that give Congress, not the executive branch, authority over spending decisions.

""While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the states' lawsuit against the freeze, said it was ""encouraging"" news that the administration is restarting the program. But, he said, it's not an automatic end to the legal challenge.

""It is promising that we're seeing some responses to our lawsuit and we're seeing some effort to give us the money that Congress has mandated,"" he told NPR. ""We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately.""

Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause.

""It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,"" Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement.

Stripping out requirements

The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers. To access the funds, states had to submit a plan for where and how they would build chargers. Once the plan was approved, each state's department of transportation would work with companies to install chargers, and then get reimbursed by the federal government.

It took more than two years after the law's passage for the first chargers to open to the public. As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project. But after the slow start, the same dataset shows that funding awards were accelerating through 2024 — until the Trump administration hit the brakes.

The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from ""a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy.""

The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. States will no longer be required to engage with rural or underserved communities while planning charger locations. They do not need to direct benefits toward disadvantaged communities. They don't need to demonstrate that they've factored in labor or safety standards, or provided opportunities for minority-owned businesses. They won't need to address evacuations, snow removal or extreme weather in their plans.

Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. States will have more discretion on charger locations.

The DOT didn't respond to NPR's requests for an interview. But in a statement posted on the department's website, Duffy said this new guidance would speed things up. ""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let's cut the waste and do it right,"" he wrote. ""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.""

Mixed reviews from the EV charger world

Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies.

""We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape,"" wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. ""Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs.""

The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was ""encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers.""

""We're optimistic,"" says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. ""They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program."" He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space.

Of course, removing some requirements won't eliminate the need to find locations and contract with builders and pull permits, all of which takes time.

And there's a common refrain in the EV charger world: While people don't mind the changes to the guidance, they are frustrated by the delay and disruption they caused.

Alex Laska of Third Way — who had been sharply critical of the inefficiencies of the Biden program — gave mixed reviews to the Trump administration revisions. He noted that some forms of ""red tape,"" like requirements about the type of charger, remain.

And other requirements have been deleted after states had already completed the work to meet them, meaning it won't actually save any time or effort.

Aside from loosening the requirements on location, the change is ""kind of a nothingburger,"" he says. ""This guidance was not worth holding up the program for, you know, now over half a year.""

Andrew Bennett, the CEO of DRIIVZ, a company that builds software for charging stations, says the freeze disrupted a lot of projects that might have gotten greenlit this year.

In the meantime, while chargers have been built with private money, Bennett says, it's not enough: ""We need about six times more just to keep up.""

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina -- including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina.
The combination needs approval from North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy Corp. says its move to combine electric utility subsidiaries in North and South Carolina into one entity could save customers more than $1 billion over a decade.

The Charlotte-based utility said it formally asked federal and state regulators on Thursday for permission to join together Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, which have several million customers. The savings would come in part from streamlining operations and spreading out infrastructure expenses.

The two entities have operated separately since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Raleigh-based Progress Energy. Duke Energy, which likens the request to moving two company divisions into one, said in a news release that it wants the change to be effective Jan. 1, 2027.

The two entities combined own 34,600 megawatts of energy capacity, producing electricity for 4.7 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in service areas covering 52,000 square miles (134,680 square kilometers). Duke Energy is the dominant electric utility in North Carolina.

Under the current setup, Duke Energy must maintain four different retail-rate structures — two for each subsidiary in each state — and produce four annual filings for state regulators who approve rates — creating confusion for the public. If the combination is approved, the company said, rates would blend gradually between the sets of customers.

The company says a combination means fewer resources would be needed to meet electric demands compared to if the two entities remained separate. They could run fewer energy production units, using less fuel and spending less on maintenance, the release said. The two entities already work together on managing electricity demand and other efficiencies.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO at Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services.”

Duke Energy, one of the nation’s largest electric holding companies, said it projects retail customer savings from the combination to reach more than $1 billion through 2038. That’s after any expenses, with additional savings expected after that.

Duke Energy Carolinas’ coverage area spans much of central and western North and South Carolina, including Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina, and Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

Duke Energy Progress generally covers eastern and central North and South Carolina -- including Raleigh, Fayetteville and Wilmington in North Carolina and Florence and Sumter in South Carolina. But its coverage area also includes Asheville, North Carolina, in the west.

Danielle Spalding, Cirba Solutions’ Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs: Battery EPR regulations vary by state and battery format, covering small, medium, or large formats, and in some instances, specific chemistries.
From a supply chain resilience perspective, how does Cirba Solutions’ material recovery process contribute to the domestic sourcing of battery materials?
Given that legislation is constantly in flux, how does Cirba Solutions guarantee that its customers remain compliant over time?","According to reports, a sweeping set of extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws is set to overhaul how batteries are collected, transported, and recycled in the United States. Guided by the US Environmental Protection Agency’s developing national EPR framework, the new guidelines place increased financial and operational responsibility on manufacturers and retailers for managing batteries from production to end-of-life. Ultimately, the framework will set recycling targets, push design changes to make batteries easier to reclaim, and require transparent reporting from all battery stakeholders.

Cirba Solutions is hoping to be an integral player in the industry transition. The North American battery recycler has more than three decades in the industry and runs a nationwide logistics network and multiple processing facilities that extract high-purity lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese for reuse. Battery Technology spoke with Danielle Spalding, Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs at Cirba Solutions, to learn more about the company’s insights into EPR compliance.

What are the most common compliance gaps or misunderstandings you’re seeing from OEMs and battery manufacturers as they adapt to state-level EPR legislation?

Danielle Spalding, Cirba Solutions’ Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs: Battery EPR regulations vary by state and battery format, covering small, medium, or large formats, and in some instances, specific chemistries. Oftentimes, a single law may include multiple formats or chemistries under one set of requirements, making it challenging for manufacturers to interpret. Without clear guidance, manufacturers may unintentionally misclassify products, increasing the risk of noncompliance.

How are EPR laws influencing design-for-recyclability or battery packaging decisions upstream?

Spalding: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Department of Energy (DOE) to develop a battery EPR framework that addresses battery recycling goals, including product design. Levers such as incentives or eco-modulated fees may encourage manufacturers to consider recyclability earlier in the design process, resulting in products that are easier to disassemble and allowing for efficient battery removal at the end-of-life.

Can you explain how Cirba Solutions’ tracking and reporting infrastructure functions across multiple jurisdictions, especially considering how formats, chemistries, and reporting thresholds differ by state?

Spalding: Cirba Solutions partners with companies to help them navigate the complexity and varied requirements across different states and battery types, giving organizations peace of mind when it comes to regulatory compliance and the safe handling, recycling, and processing of batteries. Our team provides regulatory reporting in accordance with different states’ requirements to ensure our partners comply with the law.

From a supply chain resilience perspective, how does Cirba Solutions’ material recovery process contribute to the domestic sourcing of battery materials?

Spalding: Cirba Solutions plays a critical role in strengthening the US capabilities to source and refine critical minerals by taking end-of-life batteries and gigafactory scrap and refining them into battery-grade salts. This process recovers materials like lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, which have historically been limited by reliance on virgin sources or imports. By boosting our domestic supply through recycled materials, we shorten lead times and reduce dependence on and exposure to volatile global supply chains.

This closed-loop recovery process not only strengthens our national security but also provides manufacturers with a more sustainable alternative to battery-grade critical materials. With a strong domestic foundation, the U.S. will be better positioned to meet the growing demand for critical materials needed for batteries, energy storage, and electrification technologies.

While the statute is now law, DOE is still in the process of implementing the new 1706 program.","The newly enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) brings sweeping changes to the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO), overhauling its authorities and reshaping its future role in energy infrastructure financing. Most notably, the law repeals the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) loan authority for LPO programs and replaces the Section 1706 Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) program with a new Energy Dominance Financing authority. Additionally, the OBBB provides $1 billion in new funding for the program, which is estimated to provide up to $200 billion in lending authority.

Repeal of IRA Loan Authority

Section 50402 of the OBBB rescinds the unobligated loan commitment authority that was originally appropriated to LPO under the IRA. This includes funding across multiple Title 17 categories – including Innovative Energy (1703), State Energy Financing Institutions (SEFIs), and the now-superseded 1706 EIR program. Though LPO retains any loan authority already committed through conditional commitments or closed deals, the repeal effectively constrains future award capacity under preexisting program categories unless reauthorized or funded through other means.

A New Section 1706: Energy Dominance Financing

Section 50403 of the OBBB reimagines the 1706 program from the ground up. Rather than focusing on emissions reductions or repurposing legacy infrastructure, the new 1706 authority prioritizes energy supply, grid reliability and critical minerals development. Officially titled ""Energy Dominance Financing,"" the new program:

Expands project eligibility to include:

Projects that retool, repower, repurpose or replace infrastructure that has ceased operations

Projects that increase the capacity or output of operating infrastructure

Projects that support forecastable electric supply at intervals necessary to maintain grid reliability or system adequacy

eliminates prior emissions requirements, repealing the former mandate that fossil energy projects use technologies to avoid or reduce greenhouse gas emissions

broadens the definition of ""energy infrastructure"" to include facilities and activities needed to identify, lease, develop, produce, process, transport, transmit, refine or generate energy and critical minerals – a sweeping expansion from the former, narrower scope focused on electricity and fossil fuels

provides $1 billion in new appropriations through fiscal year (FY) 2028, with up to 3 percent available for administrative costs

What This Means for Project Sponsors

The practical implications of these changes are substantial:

Trump Administration Approval of LPO. At the end of the first Trump Administration, it became apparent that the administration was preparing to use the DOE LPO to support second-term projects and objectives. This ""revamp"" of the DOE LPO confirms the Trump Administration's desire and ability to use the program in the coming years.

Wider Eligibility. Projects that would not have qualified under the prior emissions-focused 1706 program – including midstream fossil infrastructure, baseload generation and grid stability resources – may now qualify under the broadened Energy Dominance authority.

Shift in Policy Orientation. The statute's focus has shifted from emissions reduction and climate goals to energy reliability, capacity expansion, and supply chain security. This aligns with the Trump Administration's broader ""energy dominance"" agenda and may open doors for traditional energy and mineral projects that previously faced barriers to federal support.

Programmatic Changes. While the statute is now law, DOE is still in the process of implementing the new 1706 program. Furthermore, the program continues to adjust to changes in the administration and new leadership, which include cuts to personnel and structural changes that are still being implemented.

What Comes Next

""The Treasury Department's decision to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits undermines the integrity of our energy grid and our legislative process. In the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congress explicitly chose to provide energy companies with one year to phase out tax credits to keep energy prices low while meeting growing power demand. We acknowledge and appreciate the hard work of Senators who led the effort to elevate pragmatism over partisanship in the legislative process. Their continued advocacy to protect this legislative agreement was instrumental in avoiding greater impediments to energy deployment.""

A recent court ruling in a lawsuit challenging the approval, granting an extension to the federal government to respond in the case, indicates the approval is being reconsidered.

South Bethany property owner Edward E. Bintz filed a lawsuit Feb. 7 against the U.S. Department of the Interior challenging the approval of the construction and operations plan as it relates to the Coastal Zone Management Act. BOEM is an agency that falls under the Department of Interior umbrella.

The federal government was supposed to respond to the lawsuit by Aug. 1, but asked for an extension instead. In a July 28 ruling by the U.S. District Court’s District of Delaware, the extension was granted because the Department of Interior intends to reconsider its approval of the construction and operations plan as part of a second lawsuit filed by Ocean City, Md., in the District of Maryland.

“The plaintiffs in both cases seek essentially the same relief, requesting vacatur of agency approvals and permits,” said the ruling.

The outcome of the department’s reconsideration has the potential to affect the plaintiff’s case, and an extension in the response date would not significantly impact the proceedings in the case, said the ruling.

In a prepared statement following the ruling, Bintz said the government’s decision to reconsider its construction and operations plan approval and request a voluntary remand is welcome news.

“I’m confident in my lawsuit, and I know Ocean City is confident in its lawsuit. But if the Department of Interior undertakes an objective review of the Biden administration’s approval of the COP, I’m confident that Interior’s COP approval will be revoked,” said Bintz. “Ocean City, Caesar Rodney Institute and others addressed in detail during the public comment process the flawed process by which the project was approved, and its many environmental and other problems. Unfortunately, they were ignored in the Biden administration’s rush to approve the project.”

When reached for comment, Nancy Sopko, US Wind external affairs vice president, said, “US Wind does not comment on ongoing litigation, but we remain confident that the federal permits we secured after a multi-year and rigorous public review process are legally sound.”

The US Wind project comprises up to 121 wind turbine generators, up to four offshore substations, up to four offshore export cables and one meteorological tower. The offshore export cables are proposed to land at 3R’s Beach, north of Bethany Beach, and interconnect with a proposed substation on land next to the Indian River power plant outside Dagsboro.

Wind Energy Area designations rescinded

A couple of days after the lawsuit announcement, July 30, BOEM issued a statement that said it is rescinding all designated Wind Energy Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf.

“By rescinding WEAs, BOEM is ending the federal practice of designating large areas of the OCS for speculative wind development, and is de-designating over 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon and the Central Atlantic,” read the statement.

The Wind Energy Areas were originally established to identify offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy development.

In November 2022, the BOEM announced the creation of eight draft Wind Energy Areas off North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, covering about 1.7 million acres.

In July 2023, the federal agency announced the final location for three new Wind Energy Areas off the coasts of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.

The three areas totaled about 356,550 acres – the first is 101,767 acres about 26 nautical miles from Delaware Bay; the second is 78,285 acres about 23.5 nautical miles from Ocean City, Md.; the third is 176,506 acres about 35 nautical miles from the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay off Virginia.",https://www.capegazette.com/sites/capegazette/files/2025/08/field/image/US%2BWind%2Boffshore%2Bwind%2Bfarm%2Bsite.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 19:04:11.702811

A record-setting plug-in hybrid that redefines luxury commuting and off-road capability

Range Rover has just given its Sport PHEV a headline-worthy achievement: the longest electric-only range of any luxury plug-in hybrid SUV on sale today. At 53 miles per charge, the 2025 model outpaces its competitors and reinforces the brand’s commitment to blending performance, refinement, and all-terrain ability.

Why does this car matter right now?

The luxury SUV market is shifting rapidly toward electrification, but many buyers remain hesitant to commit to full EVs. The Range Rover Sport PHEV P460e Dynamic SE meets them halfway, providing substantial electric range for daily driving without sacrificing a long-distance gasoline safety net. With a 31.8-kWh battery roughly triple the capacity of many rivals, the Range Rover delivers real-world EV capability that can handle a week’s worth of short commutes before the gas engine needs to fire up.

This matters in 2025 because buyers increasingly demand EV-like efficiency without charging anxiety. According to industry data, sales of Land Rover plug-in hybrids are up 29 percent year-over-year, signaling a sweet spot between sustainability and practicality. For Range Rover, it’s an opportunity to own the conversation around long-range PHEVs while reinforcing its position as a luxury leader.

How does it compare to rivals?

With 53 miles of EPA-estimated electric range, the Sport PHEV bests the BMW X5 xDrive50e (40 miles), the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe (26 miles), and the Volvo XC90 Recharge (32 miles). Its 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine paired with a 160-kW electric motor produces 543 horsepower , enough to launch the nearly 5,600-pound SUV from 0 to 60 mph in 5.4 seconds. That puts it squarely in performance SUV territory, competing with six-figure Bentleys and Aston Martins.

Off-road capability remains a differentiator. While rivals focus on tarmac poise, the Range Rover Sport PHEV comes standard with Terrain Response 2, adjusting power delivery and suspension settings for sand, snow, mud, and more. Land Rover validated the system in 50°C desert heat and across 300-foot dunes, a proving ground few hybrids dare attempt.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

The 2025 Range Rover Sport PHEV suits drivers who want luxury, real electric range, and legitimate off-road skill. It’s ideal for suburban commuters who can charge at home, countryside dwellers who value go-anywhere ability, and executives who appreciate arriving in silence. Pet owners and golfers will appreciate the 31.9 cubic feet of cargo space, while passengers enjoy heated rear seats, a 19-speaker Meridian sound system, and air suspension that glides over rough pavement.

Those who live in cramped cities might think twice. At nearly 16 feet long and more than 6.5 feet wide, navigating tight parking garages can be stressful. And with a base price of $96,575, it demands a budget that could buy a smaller luxury SUV and a dedicated EV for daily use. For some, the Range Rover’s scale and cost will outweigh its technical prowess.

What is the long-term significance?

The 2025 Range Rover Sport PHEV signals a future where plug-in hybrids are more than a stopgap between gasoline and full electric. By offering EV range that rivals some early electric cars, it challenges other manufacturers to invest in larger battery packs and more capable hybrid systems. If the market responds positively, we could see more PHEVs targeting 50-plus miles of range, which would significantly reduce fuel consumption without requiring drivers to change their travel habits.

In broader terms, it’s a reminder that sustainability can be aspirational. The Sport PHEV wraps its advanced tech in a package that appeals to status-conscious buyers, proving that environmental responsibility doesn’t have to come at the expense of craftsmanship, capability, or performance.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/08/download-2025-08-15T144217.026.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-15 18:04:43.631831

The EPA last month reversed a decision under the Biden administration to target sections of the rivers for cleanup based on high nitrate levels.

The Des Moines Water Works Board of Trustees said in a Thursday statement it’s becoming harder to manage nitrates in the rivers to keep drinking water within legal limits.

Lawn watering in the metro area was banned for the first time this summer so that nitrate removal systems could keep up.

The EPA said in a statement it is sharing data on spring and summer nitrate levels with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and is working with the state to ensure water quality standards are met.

*The U.S. Department of Energy has proposed cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in its budget for renewable energy programs. Secretary Chris Wright discussed the agency’s approach during a tour of the Ames National Laboratory at Iowa State University.

Wright says he supports technologies that most contribute to U.S. energy.

“Wind, solar and batteries provide 3 percent of the United States energy, yet (are) the majority of the budget at the Department of Energy. That's just nonsensical,” he said.

The think tank Ember Energy reports wind and solar last year provided a combined 17 percent of U.S. energy, surpassing coal for the first time.

Wright says priorities for the agency include nuclear and next generation geothermal.

“We have to stabilize our electricity grid, we need to get away from the nonsense that somehow we're not going to use fossil fuels in the near future,” Wright said.

The Department of Energy removed the National Climate Assessments from its website earlier this year. Wright says climate change is a “true physical phenomenon,” but not the “world’s greatest problem.”

*State officials have confirmed the first case of West Nile virus in Iowa this year, as announced Thursday.

The affected person is between the ages of 41 and 60 and lives in northern Iowa.

West Nile virus is transmitted through infected mosquitos. Many people experience no or minor symptoms from the virus. But some can develop serious ones like high fever, headaches, disorientation and muscle weakness and should seek medical attention.

While rivals focus on tarmac poise, the Range Rover Sport PHEV comes standard with Terrain Response 2, adjusting power delivery and suspension settings for sand, snow, mud, and more. Land Rover validated the system in 50°C desert heat and across 300-foot dunes, a proving ground few hybrids dare attempt.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

The 2025 Range Rover Sport PHEV suits drivers who want luxury, real electric range, and legitimate off-road skill. It’s ideal for suburban commuters who can charge at home, countryside dwellers who value go-anywhere ability, and executives who appreciate arriving in silence. Pet owners and golfers will appreciate the 31.9 cubic feet of cargo space, while passengers enjoy heated rear seats, a 19-speaker Meridian sound system, and air suspension that glides over rough pavement.

Those who live in cramped cities might think twice. At nearly 16 feet long and more than 6.5 feet wide, navigating tight parking garages can be stressful. And with a base price of $96,575, it demands a budget that could buy a smaller luxury SUV and a dedicated EV for daily use. For some, the Range Rover’s scale and cost will outweigh its technical prowess.

What is the long-term significance?

The 2025 Range Rover Sport PHEV signals a future where plug-in hybrids are more than a stopgap between gasoline and full electric. By offering EV range that rivals some early electric cars, it challenges other manufacturers to invest in larger battery packs and more capable hybrid systems. If the market responds positively, we could see more PHEVs targeting 50-plus miles of range, which would significantly reduce fuel consumption without requiring drivers to change their travel habits.

In broader terms, it’s a reminder that sustainability can be aspirational. The Sport PHEV wraps its advanced tech in a package that appeals to status-conscious buyers, proving that environmental responsibility doesn’t have to come at the expense of craftsmanship, capability, or performance.",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/download-2025-08-15T144217.026.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-15 19:04:29.162642

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful.

""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises.","The Trump administration is reopening a federal program to fund the installation of high-speed EV chargers along freeways nationwide, after a six-month freeze in funds and a legal battle with states.

President Trump has repeatedly denounced the multibillion dollar program, called the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (or NEVI) program, as wasteful. It was created in 2021 through a bipartisan act of Congress, and unlike many other Biden-era climate measures, that law remains on the books; Congress has not reversed it.

The Department of Transportation froze the funds in February, and months passed with no indication of when funding would be restarted. A coalition of more than a dozen states sued the federal government, alleging that the administration was violating the law and defying the will of Congress. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the DOT has started the process of unfreezing the money by releasing new guidance that will allow the funds to flow again — while removing a number of Biden-era requirements.

Officials made it clear they haven't changed their minds about the merits of funding chargers — but they're acknowledging the separation of powers that give Congress, not the executive branch, authority over spending decisions.

""While I don't agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote in a statement posted on the department's website.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is leading the states' lawsuit against the freeze, said it was ""encouraging"" news that the administration is restarting the program. But, he said, it's not an automatic end to the legal challenge.

""It is promising that we're seeing some responses to our lawsuit and we're seeing some effort to give us the money that Congress has mandated,"" he told NPR. ""We're going to stay focused on making sure that all the monies that are promised across this multi-state coalition are, in fact, given out appropriately.""

Charging companies and EV advocates have celebrated the end of the freeze, and in many cases praised the streamlining of the rules — even as they chafe at the long pause.

""It's ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,"" Katherine García, the director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, wrote in a statement.

Stripping out requirements

The NEVI program earmarked $5 billion for high-speed EV chargers along highway corridors, designed to serve the needs of long-distance EV drivers. To access the funds, states had to submit a plan for where and how they would build chargers. Once the plan was approved, each state's department of transportation would work with companies to install chargers, and then get reimbursed by the federal government.

It took more than two years after the law's passage for the first chargers to open to the public. As of August 16, some 4,000 ports have been funded but only 382 are open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse data project. But after the slow start, the same dataset shows that funding awards were accelerating through 2024 — until the Trump administration hit the brakes.

The slow speed of the rollout has been criticized by both conservative critics of the NEVI program and by some EV advocates who supported the program but wanted it to move faster. Alex Laska, with the center-left think tank Third Way, co-authored a report earlier this year that said the Biden-era NEVI program suffered from ""a morass of government red tape, roadblocks, and bureaucracy.""

The new guidance from the Trump administration strips out a number of requirements added under Biden. States will no longer be required to engage with rural or underserved communities while planning charger locations. They do not need to direct benefits toward disadvantaged communities. They don't need to demonstrate that they've factored in labor or safety standards, or provided opportunities for minority-owned businesses. They won't need to address evacuations, snow removal or extreme weather in their plans.

Charging stations will also no longer be required to be less than 50 miles apart — a concern for some large rural states — or within a mile of a freeway. States will have more discretion on charger locations.

The DOT didn't respond to NPR's requests for an interview. But in a statement posted on the department's website, Duffy said this new guidance would speed things up. ""If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let's cut the waste and do it right,"" he wrote. ""The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.""

Mixed reviews from the EV charger world

Some of these changes — in particular, the flexibility about site location — have been celebrated by EV advocates and charging companies.

""We appreciate the Department's overall efforts to cut red tape,"" wrote Levi Kamolnick, the director of federal policy at CALSTART, a nonprofit that works with companies and governments to promote clean transportation. ""Streamlining the program will unlock more financial gains—including good jobs.""

The executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a pro-EV nonprofit, wrote in a statement he was ""encouraged by the Department's commitment to removing unnecessary barriers.""

""We're optimistic,"" says Ryan McKinnon, the spokesman for the Charge Ahead partnership, which represents gas stations and retailers who want to add chargers. ""They sort of cut through a lot of red tape that had slowed down the original program."" He says the new guidance will particularly help states like Wyoming and Montana — with big open space.

Of course, removing some requirements won't eliminate the need to find locations and contract with builders and pull permits, all of which takes time.

And there's a common refrain in the EV charger world: While people don't mind the changes to the guidance, they are frustrated by the delay and disruption they caused.

Alex Laska of Third Way — who had been sharply critical of the inefficiencies of the Biden program — gave mixed reviews to the Trump administration revisions. He noted that some forms of ""red tape,"" like requirements about the type of charger, remain.

And other requirements have been deleted after states had already completed the work to meet them, meaning it won't actually save any time or effort.

Aside from loosening the requirements on location, the change is ""kind of a nothingburger,"" he says. ""This guidance was not worth holding up the program for, you know, now over half a year.""

Andrew Bennett, the CEO of DRIIVZ, a company that builds software for charging stations, says the freeze disrupted a lot of projects that might have gotten greenlit this year.

In the meantime, while chargers have been built with private money, Bennett says, it's not enough: ""We need about six times more just to keep up.""

Yes! The credits are ending.

On September 30, 2025, Federal tax credits for EVs/PHEVs will expire for both new and used purchases/leases. This incentive was originally scheduled to end December 31, 2032. However, due to legislative changes (One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB)), which was signed into law on July 4th, 2025, the elimination of these credits has been accelerated.

Now hold tight Y’all! I have some good news!

Buyers who are interested in EVs or PHEVs, such as the Mazda CX-70 and Mazda CX-90 PHEV, which are currently still eligible for a $7500 federal tax incentive if the vehicle is leased, as long as the vehicle(s) are sold and “placed into service” by the expiration date of Sept 30, 2025.

Note: “Placed into service” means the customer has signed a contract at the dealer to buy the vehicle.

EVs/PHEVs – Federal Tax Credit & Benefits

What Is the Federal Tax Credit?

For those who are not familiar, the Federal Tax Credit offers financial incentives to buyers who purchase qualifying electric (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The amount of the tax credit varies depending on factors such as battery capacity, manufacturing requirements, and vehicle classification. Buyers of eligible vehicles can receive up to $7,500 in federal tax credits, reducing the overall cost of ownership.

Benefits of purchasing an Electric Vehicle/Plug-in hybrid

I’ve noticed that over the last month EVs and PHEVs have been on the rise in my area. I am assuming it has to do a lot with this tax credit ending in just over a month. If so, this totally makes sense on the buyer’s end, because now would be the time to purchase/lease the model you are interested in to secure that credit.

Now, I know that the Tax Credit is a huge incentive, but if you are still interested, and need a little more time or just not ready to take that plunge yet here are a few more benefits to owning an EV/PHEV.

Check out a few below…

PHEV

A Plug-in hybrid offers you the best of both worlds with a combination of electric efficiency and traditional gasoline convenience.

PHEVs can operate on electric power alone for a significant portion of daily driving.

Smooth and quiet driving experience.

Reduced fuel consumption.

Extended range.

No range anxiety, because when the battery depletes, the gasoline engine seamlessly takes over. This flexibility allows drivers to undertake longer trips without the need to plan around charging stops.

Lower emissions.

regenerative braking.

Convenient charging options. PHEVs can be charged using a standard 120V outlet or a faster 240V home charging station. Making it easy to recharge overnight and have a full electric range each morning.

EV

EVs have fewer moving parts than traditional gasoline cars, which reduces maintenance cost. You don’t need oil changes, and the regenerative braking system can extend the lifespan of brake pads.

Potentially lower total cost of ownership, due to no fuel and no maintenance.

Zero tailpipe emissions.

Smooth, quiet ride and better handling.

Regenerative braking.

Possible discounted utility rates.

EVs and PHEVs offer an array of benefits from low maintenance, low to no fuel costs to smoother rides. Grab yours today before the federal tax credit has expired.

Historically, Duke Energy Progress customers have paid slightly higher rates than Duke Energy Carolinas customers, said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.
And Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress retail rates would gradually blend over time.
There are about 13,500 employees for Duke Energy based in North Carolina and 4,000 in South Carolina, according to Duke Energy.
Duke Energy previously merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy in 2012, and maintains a corporate office in downtown Raleigh for Duke Energy Progress.","The proposed merger of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress leaves customers with one big question: Will it lower my bill?

Duke implies yes, saying the consolidation will result in cost savings of more than $1 billion through 2028.

Others aren’t so sure.

Historically, Duke Energy Progress customers have paid slightly higher rates than Duke Energy Carolinas customers, said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.

“How to balance that without any undue discrimination or causing harm to existing customers is going to be a challenge,” Neal said.

Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, put it more bluntly, telling NC Newsline in a statement:

“This merger will impact customers the same way everything Duke does impacts customers — their rates will keep going up and Duke will make billions.”

But in its regulatory filing, Duke Energy said the move would optimize efficiency between the two utilities, and is needed as demand on the energy grid grows.

Kendal Bowman, North Carolina president for the two entities, said in testimony with the North Carolina Utilities Commission that the merger would allow “the combined utility to continue to deliver safe and reliable energy to our customers at a lower overall system cost.”

Duke Energy Carolinas serves western areas of the state, including Charlotte and its surrounding area, while Duke Energy Progress covers the eastern half of North Carolina, including the Raleigh region. It’s a total of about 3.8 million retail customers in North Carolina, according to Duke Energy.

“They’re already part of the same company, so it seems maybe rate cases, expenditures on lawyers, and that sort of thing will go down,” Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said. “There are areas where I would be happy to criticize Duke, but probably not on the merger.”

But there is speculation over what a merger would actually mean.

North Carolina has a multi-year rate plan system where Duke Energy files rate plans for a three-year period. This was last done three years ago.

Following current cycles, observers expect Duke Energy Progress to file for a rate increase sometime this fall and Duke Energy Carolinas to do the same in the early part of next year.

Duke is aiming to complete the merger on Jan. 1, 2027.

“The question in our minds is, ‘what does it mean to be filing for this merger at the same time you’d be filing for new rates?'” said Sue Sturgis, research and communications manager at the Energy and Policy Institute.

Duke Energy spokesperson Bill Norton told NC Newsline the details of that are still being worked out.

In a statement, Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas, said no retail rates would change immediately upon the merger’s completion. And Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress retail rates would gradually blend over time.

The company does not expect to make significant personnel cuts as a result of the merger. There are about 13,500 employees for Duke Energy based in North Carolina and 4,000 in South Carolina, according to Duke Energy.

Both utilities operate in neighboring South Carolina as well, serving about 855,000 retail customers there.

Duke Energy previously merged with Raleigh-based Progress Energy in 2012, and maintains a corporate office in downtown Raleigh for Duke Energy Progress.

“Since our teams have largely operated as a combined organization since the 2012 merger, most personnel efficiencies have already been realized. There may be some very limited reductions in corporate-related areas, but we anticipate impacts will be managed through natural attrition and careful headcount management over time rather than anything immediate,” Norton wrote in an email.

In her testimony with the state Utilities Commission, Rachel Elliott, director of rates and regulatory planning for Duke Energy Carolinas, said the company expected about 3% of the projected savings to come from corporate administrative costs, such as having to only file one rate case, saving on legal fees and other regulatory expenses.

The merger would need to be approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any future rate changes will remain subject to regulatory approval.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-08-15 20:28:42+00:00,Sustainable Times,Offshore Wind in Turmoil: Is U.S. Policy Blowing Ørsted Off Course? - Sustainable Times,Hanaa Siddiqi,,,,,https://www.sustainabletimes.co.uk/post/offshore-wind-in-turmoil-is-u-s-policy-blowing-%25C3%25B8rsted-off-course,"Ørsted has warned that recent regulatory changes in the United States could slow the growth of offshore wind, increase energy costs, and alter investment priorities.
The company noted that the US has seen “unprecedented adverse regulatory developments” that have made investors more cautious about backing offshore wind.
With those options off the table, Ørsted will now take full ownership of Sunrise Wind.
In 2024, its training programme helped 335 union workers in Rhode Island, New York, and Connecticut gain offshore wind credentials.
For now, the US still represents a market with significant long-term potential for offshore wind, but Ørsted’s latest moves show that the road ahead may be far more complicated than once expected.","Ørsted has warned that recent regulatory changes in the United States could slow the growth of offshore wind, increase energy costs, and alter investment priorities. The concern comes as key tax credits are set to begin phasing out in 2027.

In its second-quarter 2025 investor presentation, the company pointed to what it described as “material adverse developments” in the US regulatory landscape, stating that these have increased the perceived risk of offshore wind projects in the country.

While the sector still has strong long-term growth potential, Ørsted says shifting regulations and a more demanding financing environment are creating immediate hurdles. The company noted that the US has seen “unprecedented adverse regulatory developments” that have made investors more cautious about backing offshore wind.

One major casualty of these changes is the planned sale of a partial equity stake in the 924 megawatt Sunrise Wind project off New York, along with the non-recourse financing that would have supported it. These deals had been central to Ørsted’s fully funded business plan, but the current market conditions have made them unworkable.

With those options off the table, Ørsted will now take full ownership of Sunrise Wind. This decision requires an additional 40 billion Danish kroner, or approximately $ 6.3 billion, in funding between 2025 and 2027. It also means more capital expenditure over a longer timeframe, and greater reliance on the company’s balance sheet rather than external project financing.

To fill the funding gap, Ørsted plans to raise 60 billion Danish kroner, approximately $ 9.4 billion, through a rights issue. The Danish State, as the majority shareholder, is backing the move. The company states that the new capital will help maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating, provide more flexibility in timing partnerships and asset sales, and safeguard long-term operational cash flow.

The shift in US conditions has also prompted Ørsted to rethink its wider strategy. The company is scaling back further development in the United States and focusing instead on its core European markets and selected Asia-Pacific opportunities. The US onshore business will operate as an independent unit. Ørsted’s investment approach is now prioritising value over volume, aiming for returns of 150 to 300 basis points above its weighted average cost of capital at the point of investment.

The policy backdrop is also changing. On July 4, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which rolls back several clean energy measures from the Inflation Reduction Act and boosts support for fossil fuels. For wind power, the legislation brings a sharp phase-out of tax credits beginning in 2027. Production and investment tax credits will only be available to projects starting before the end of 2025 or meeting strict operational deadlines.

Researchers at Princeton University warn that the rollback could result in 70 gigawatts less wind and solar capacity by 2030. They estimate it could raise the average US household’s annual energy bill by $165 and reduce the projected national emissions cut from 40 per cent to just 3 per cent.

The changes could also create uncertainty for developers, shortening project timelines, tightening supply chain compliance rules under the Foreign Entity of Concern designation, and potentially slowing both offshore and onshore wind expansion at a crucial moment for climate goals.

Despite the headwinds, Ørsted continues to invest in the US workforce development. In 2024, its training programme helped 335 union workers in Rhode Island, New York, and Connecticut gain offshore wind credentials. The company says this strengthens the domestic supply chain and creates local jobs.

For now, the US still represents a market with significant long-term potential for offshore wind, but Ørsted’s latest moves show that the road ahead may be far more complicated than once expected.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_73c9911f52ec4b0e8c9f9e95545bc392~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_73c9911f52ec4b0e8c9f9e95545bc392~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-08-15 17:03:53.326627

EPA obligated all of the grant funds before September 30, 2024.","Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), led 30 of their Senate colleagues in demanding Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin obey the law and restore all previously obligated funding for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), which includes Solar for All, the National Clean Investment Fund, and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator.

Despite the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s (OBBBA) unambiguous terms on “unobligated balances,” Administrator Zeldin has falsely claimed that rescissions also apply to obligated funding and has recently used that to justify illegally terminating $7 billion in previously obligated Solar for All investments. Under the Solar for All program, states, territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations in all 50 states have already been obligated $7 billion for initiatives that lower household energy bills by expanding access to affordable solar energy. Across the country, energy officials are raising the alarm that the loss of Solar for All funding could undermine grid resilience, cost jobs, and increase household energy costs.

“When the proposed repeal and rescission of unobligated GGRF funds was initially proposed in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, CBO scored the provision as saving $19 million, the remaining appropriated funding for EPA administration and oversight of the program,” wrote the Senators. “If the OBBBA had somehow clawed back GGRF money that the federal government had already obligated, that estimate would have been as much as $27 billion: $7 billion for Solar for All, $11.97 billion for the NCIF, and $8 billion for the CCIA. CBO confirmed, further, that repeal of the program language did not create any additional savings. The rescission and repeal together only saved $19 million.”

Even Republicans have made clear that already obligated funding is not subject to rescission in the OBBBA. During the markup of the Energy and Commerce Committee title for the House version of the bill, then-Chair of the Environment Subcommittee Morgan Griffith (VA-09) stated, “I just want to point out that these provisions that we are talking about only apply as far, as this bill is concerned, to the unobligated balances. So if a grant was already given, as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward …. If the grant has already been granted and the money is obligated, then this—then our language does not affect that… [W]e can’t rescind expenditures that have already been obligated.”

Mandy Gunasekara, EPA Chief of Staff in the first Trump administration and author of the EPA chapter in Project 2025, told a reporter that, “Once money is out the door, I don’t know of a way you can claw it back.”

“Despite [EPA’s] baseless attacks, the bottom line is that neither CBO nor Republicans understood the repeal and rescission of the GGRF to save anything more than EPA’s unspent oversight dollars. Wishful statutory interpretation on the part of EPA does not enable EPA to cancel lawfully obligated grants,” concluded the lawmakers.

In addition to Senators Van Hollen and Whitehouse, the letter was signed by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Angus King (I-Maine), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Tina Smith (D-Minn), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

The full letter is available here and below:

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

We write regarding the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) continued efforts to illegally claw back billions of dollars in already-obligated clean energy funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). On July 3, 2025, EPA’s Department of Justice (DOJ) counsel represented to the D.C. Circuit that, once enacted, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) “would rescind the appropriated [GGRF] funds that plaintiffs sought to reinstate through this action.” Counsel for those GGRF grantees—who had received funding though the GGRF’s National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA)—countered this faulty representation in a letter filed with the court on July 7, 2025; one of the undersigned (and Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with jurisdiction over EPA) entered a statement into the Congressional Record on July 9, 2025, further rebutting this erroneous representation.

Unfortunately, EPA continues to make false claims that the OBBBA rescinded previously-obligated GGRF funding. On August 7, 2025, EPA announced that it was rescinding all grant funding issued under the GGRF’s Solar for All program, again improperly relying on the OBBBA as justification, and began sending termination letters to those grantees.

Section 60002 of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reads as follows:

SEC. 60002. REPEAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. Section 134 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7434) is repealed and the unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section (as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act) are rescinded.

By its express language, the OBBBA only rescinds “unobligated balances” under Clean Air Act Section 134. Section 134 had been enacted into law on August 16, 2022, as Section 60103 of the Inflation Reduction Act. Pub. L. 117-169, 136 Stat. 2065 (Aug. 16, 2022). That provision appropriated almost $27 billion (available only through September 30, 2024) for three grant programs, and directed EPA to begin making grants within 180 days of enactment. It then appropriated $30 million to EPA to administer these programs. EPA obligated all of the grant funds before September 30, 2024. For two of the grant programs (NCIF and CCIA), the funds were fully disbursed into private bank accounts before September 30, 2024. For Solar for All, 49 of the 60 grantees are state-level entities and six are Tribes. The largest state recipients include Texas (over $249 million), several states receiving over $156 million (among them North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Louisiana, and Missouri), West Virginia (over $106 million), South Carolina (over $124 million), and Alaska (over $62 million). All funds were obligated by August 2024 and are held at the Department of the Treasury for grantees to draw down. Recipients have so far utilized between $30 and $50 million, with drawdowns expected to have increased significantly this fall as grantees have now been able to fully design their programs, complete competitions for fund recipients, and overcome hurdles created by EPA’s earlier freeze. Some projects have already been completed thanks to the funding.

The strongest evidence for the status of those funds, aside from the plain text of the OBBBA, is the scoring of the OBBBA by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Lawmakers relied on CBO’s “score,” or the estimated cost or savings of each provision, to ensure the reconciliation bill met each Committee’s savings or spending instructions as set by the Budget Committees.

When the proposed repeal and rescission of unobligated GGRF funds was initially proposed in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, CBO scored the provision as saving $19 million, the remaining appropriated funding for EPA administration and oversight of the program. (See Appendix A.) That does not include a penny of the three grant programs. If the OBBBA had somehow clawed back GGRF money that the federal government had already obligated, that estimate would have been as much as $27 billion: $7 billion for Solar for All, $11.97 billion for the NCIF, and $8 billion for the CCIA. CBO confirmed, further, that repeal of the program language did not create any additional savings. The rescission and repeal together only saved $19 million. At no point did the Majority dispute this score.

Upon enactment, CBO made its final OBBBA budget estimates publicly available. This final estimate for Section 60002 confirms that repeal and rescission of the GGRF only saved the government $19 million—those dollars that EPA had been awarded for program administration and oversight.

What’s more, numerous Republicans have made clear that it is not legally possible to claw back funding that has already been obligated. For instance:

During the House Energy & Commerce Committee mark-up of the OBBBA on May 13, 2025, Congressman Griffith (R-VA), then-Chair of the Environment Subcommittee, stated: “I just want to point out that these provisions that we are talking about only apply as far, as this bill is concerned, to the unobligated balances. So if a grant was already given, as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward. . . . If the grant has already been granted and the money is obligated, then this—then our language does not affect that… [W]e can’t rescind expenditures that have already been obligated.”

In June 2024, E&E News quoted Mandy Gunasekara, an EPA Chief of Staff in the first Trump administration and author of the EPA chapter in Project 2025, as saying of the GGRF funding, “Once money is out the door, I don’t know of a way you can claw it back.”

EPA’s attacks on Solar for All continue a pattern of false statements about GGRF, including defamatory accusations you have made that “the entire [GGRF] scheme, in my opinion, is criminal” and that GGRF was “all of the above” when asked if it was “either a kickback, a theft, or graft.” You have led the Trump Administration in waging an unprecedented assault on the NCIF and CCIA portions of the GGRF program, unlawfully weaponizing the federal government in an inexplicable exercise to wage allegations of fraud meant to trigger the narrow basis for terminating grants set forth in those grant agreements, even after:

the criminal chief for the Washington, DC, United States Attorney’s Office quit over the incident;

a magistrate judge refused to issue a search warrant on the DC Acting United States Attorney’s baseless assertions;

at least one other United States Attorney’s Office refused to seek a warrant for the same bogus matter;

DOJ officials failed to find any meaningful evidence of criminality during their investigation; and

DOJ attorneys backtracked on the fraud allegation in real time, when asked to explain the reason for freezing access to private bank accounts in a DC courtroom.

Despite these baseless attacks, the bottom line is that neither CBO nor Republicans understood the repeal and rescission of the GGRF to save anything more than EPA’s unspent oversight dollars. Wishful statutory interpretation on the part of EPA does not enable EPA to cancel lawfully obligated grants.

Your actions undermine thousands of projects that will deliver more affordable housing, community centers for refuge during extreme weather events, and clean energy to American communities. Your attempts to retroactively seize funding from grantees, and then to misrepresent the basis for your actions, are illegal. We urge you to reverse course and restore this important funding.

In 2025, choosing a fuel-efficient car isn’t just about saving money — it’s a matter of lifestyle, values, and identity.

With rising gas prices and growing environmental concerns, drivers are turning to cars that deliver maximum miles per gallon and minimal emissions. The General takes a look at some of the most fuel-efficient vehicles of the year, the ones blending performance, innovation, and sustainability.

Why fuel efficiency matters more than ever

The average U.S. gas price as of July 28 was $3.12 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For daily commuters and families, this translates to hundreds in annual fuel savings or extra costs. Fuel-efficient vehicles not only reduce those expenses but also slash greenhouse gas emissions, helping drivers do their part in the fight against climate change.

A diverse landscape of efficient options

The 2025 lineup reflects the most diverse selection of eco-friendly vehicles in history. From hybrid sedans and compact SUVs to electric vehicles and even fuel-efficient pickup trucks, there’s something for every driver.

New EV sales increased 26.4% last month compared with June and were up 19.7% year over year, according to a new analysis from Cox Automotive. Used EV sales were up 23.2% compared with a month ago.

EV sales vastly outpaced overall auto sales, which rose 1.6% last month, according to the U.S. Commerce Dept.

As part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, consumers who buy a new plug-in electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle are able to claim up to $7,500 as a federal tax credit for the purchase. Those who buy a used clean vehicle for $25,000 or less from a licensed dealership are entitled to as much as $4,000 back on their purchase.

But that won’t last much longer. The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit is scheduled to end Sept. 30 following the passage of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Sales of new EVs in July rose to 130,082 units and were the second-highest month on record. Eleven brands –– including Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford and Honda –– said they had their best EV sales of the year last month.

Used EV sales increased to 36,670 in July and were up 40% compared with a year ago. Tesla led the top brands for used EV sales, followed by Chevrolet, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan.

The average transaction price for a new EV in July was $55,689 — 2.2% less than June and 4.2% less than a year ago. Prices — long a top reason for car buyers to avoid electrics and stick with gas — have now fallen to within $7,611 of a comparable gas model.

The average transaction price for a used EV in July was $35,263 — down 1.9% from June and 1.6% compared with a year ago. The price gap between used EVs and internal-combustion-engine vehicles is now at a record low of just $1,266.

The rush to buy EVs has lessened available supply. The number of available new electric vehicles fell to 87 days — a metric for how long it would take to sell all of the current inventory –– decreasing 32.3% compared with July and 49% compared with a year ago. Audi had the largest number of EV days’ supply (168) in July. Toyota had the lowest (42 days).

Days’ supply of used EVs also fell. Used electric vehicles now have less supply than gas-powered models. Tesla had the lowest days’ supply of used EVs (29.4), followed by Chevrolet and Nissan. GMC, Ford and Rivian had the highest supply of used EVs at 64 days.

“With the IRA tax credit set to expire at the end of September, urgency is likely to remain high, positioning the EV market for continued strength through the remainder of Q3,” Cox Automotive said in an analysis Friday. “July’s performance sets a strong precedent, and as policy support winds down, the market’s ability to respond to real-time demand and brand-level dynamics will be critical in shaping the next phase of growth.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/July_EV_sales,N,,2025-08-15 17:04:02.831082

Rules for Large Wind and Solar Projects Released - The New York Times,"Brad Plumer, www.nytimes.com, brad-plumer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/climate/irs-wind-solar-tax-credits.html,"The Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued new rules that would restrict the ability of wind and solar companies to claim federal tax breaks, a move that analysts said could threaten the viability of many renewable energy projects under development.
guidance eliminates this so-called “5 percent safe harbor” rule for large wind and solar farms, although it keeps it in place for rooftop solar projects and other smaller solar installations.
Renewable energy industry groups criticized the move, which comes as the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of new restrictions on federal permitting for wind and solar projects across the country.
The removal of federal subsidies means that the amounts of new wind energy and solar energy added in the United States over the next five years are expected to be 50 percent lower and 23 percent lower than previously projected, according to BloombergNEF.
While many renewable energy projects will remain competitive without subsidies, the group found, some will no longer be economically viable.","The Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued new rules that would restrict the ability of wind and solar companies to claim federal tax breaks, a move that analysts said could threaten the viability of many renewable energy projects under development.

President Trump’s giant domestic policy bill, which was signed into law on July 4, was already set to rapidly phase out lucrative tax credits for new wind and solar farms unless they began construction in the next 12 months. The new I.R.S. guidance would add further restrictions by tightening longstanding rules for what counts as the “beginning of construction,” which will make it harder for many projects to qualify.

Previously, a wind or solar farm was said to have begun construction if the developer spent at least 5 percent of the project cost, which many companies did by purchasing electrical transformers or other large equipment ahead of time. The developer could then claim any tax breaks that were in effect that year, as long as they finished construction within the next four years.

The new I.R.S. guidance eliminates this so-called “5 percent safe harbor” rule for large wind and solar farms, although it keeps it in place for rooftop solar projects and other smaller solar installations.

Renewable energy industry groups criticized the move, which comes as the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of new restrictions on federal permitting for wind and solar projects across the country.

“This is yet another act of energy subtraction from the Trump administration that will further delay the build-out of affordable, reliable power,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “American families and businesses will pay more for electricity as a result of this action, and China will continue to outpace us in the race for electricity to power A.I.”

To assuage those concerns, Mr. Trump issued an executive order shortly after the bill passed, directing the Treasury Department to limit the ability of wind and solar projects to qualify for the fast-disappearing tax credits.

That move faced pushback from some in Mr. Trump’s own party. Earlier this month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, placed holds on three of Mr. Trump’s nominees for the Treasury Department, saying he was concerned that the agency would flout the intent of Congress.

The removal of federal subsidies means that the amounts of new wind energy and solar energy added in the United States over the next five years are expected to be 50 percent lower and 23 percent lower than previously projected, according to BloombergNEF. While many renewable energy projects will remain competitive without subsidies, the group found, some will no longer be economically viable.

Those projections do not account for the Trump administration’s most recent restrictions, which experts say could cause turmoil for hundreds of wind and solar projects that were expected to start construction over the next year in order to claim the credits.

Under the new I.R.S. guidance, wind and solar companies can still qualify for the credit if they begin certain physical construction activities over the next year, such as digging the foundations for a wind farm or installing the racks that hold solar panels, and then work continuously to complete the project. While many of the biggest and most sophisticated developers may be able to meet this “physical work test,” many smaller and medium-size developers might struggle to qualify, experts said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/15cli-irs-climate-credits-pjgw/15cli-irs-climate-credits-pjgw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 17:03:13.925991

And yes, the truck will have a targeted 0-to-60 time as quick as the Mustang EcoBoost and with more downforce.
Parts travel down the assembly line in a kit, within which all fasteners, scanners and power tools required for the job are included in the correct orientation for use.
Ford plans to invest nearly $2 billion into the Louisville plant to assemble the midsize electric truck, securing nearly 2,200 hourly jobs.
Digital infrastructure upgrades will provide the plant with the fastest network with the most access points of any Ford plant globally, enabling more quality scans.","An electric pickup as fast as the Mustang EcoBoost that costs only $30,000? That is what Ford promises will be first to come off the line of its new universal electric vehicle platform and production system.

Set to launch in 2027, the midsize, four-door electric pickup represents the debut of a new family of Ford EVs produced using the novel system, which takes its cue from the time-tested Ford manufacturing process while reconceptualizing the traditional assembly line.

The system represents a company investment of about $5 billion and will create or secure nearly 4,000 jobs.

“We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters — design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure and cost of ownership — and do it with American workers,” said Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford. “We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty, so this had to be a strong, sustainable and profitable business.

“From day one, we knew there was no incremental path to success. We empowered a tiny skunkworks team three time zones away from Detroit, we tore up the moving assembly line concept and designed a better one, and we found a path to be the first automaker to make prismatic LFP batteries in the U.S.”

The new platform reduces parts by 20 percent compared to a typical vehicle, requiring 25 percent fewer fasteners and 40 percent fewer workstations dock-to-dock while providing a 15 percent faster assembly time. For example, the wiring harness in the new midsize truck will be more than 4,000 feet shorter and 10 kilograms lighter than the one in Ford’s first-generation electric SUV.

Lithium iron phosphate prismatic batteries also foster space and weight savings while reducing costs and enhancing durability for customers. The platform’s cobalt-free and nickel-free LFP battery pack is a structural subassembly that also serves as the vehicle’s floor, providing a low center of gravity that improves handling while facilitating a quiet cabin and allowing for ample interior space.

Assembled at the Ford Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for U.S. and export markets, the new truck is expected to provide more passenger room than the latest Toyota RAV4, not including the frunk and a truck bed that allows gear to be locked into place.

And yes, the truck will have a targeted 0-to-60 time as quick as the Mustang EcoBoost and with more downforce. With the low center of gravity, instant torque from the electric motors and a well-engineered chassis are geared toward making the truck as fun to drive as it is practical.

“We took inspiration from the Model T — the universal car that changed the world,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer. “We assembled a really brilliant collection of minds across Ford and unleashed them to find new solutions to old problems. We applied first-principles engineering, pushing to the limits of physics to make it fun to drive and compete on affordability. Our new zonal electric architecture unlocks capabilities the industry has never seen.

“This isn’t a stripped-down, old-school vehicle.”

The new EV production system transforms the traditional assembly line into an “assembly tree.” Instead of relying on one long conveyor, three subassemblies run down their own lines simultaneously and then join together.

The front and rear of the vehicle will be assembled separately thanks to large, single-piece aluminium unicastings that replace dozens of smaller parts traditionally used in production. The structural battery is also an independent subassembly that includes seats, consoles and carpeting.

Parts travel down the assembly line in a kit, within which all fasteners, scanners and power tools required for the job are included in the correct orientation for use. The system dramatically improves ergonomics for employees by reducing twisting, reaching and bending.

“We put our employees at the center and recreated the factory from scratch,” said Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas Manufacturing. “We live and breathe continuous improvement, but sometimes you need a dramatic leap forward. We expect ergonomic breakthroughs and complexity reduction through elimination of parts, connectors and wire will flow through to significant quality and cost wins.”

The assembly time for the new truck could be as much as 40 percent faster than that of the plant’s current vehicles, time Ford plans to reinvest into insourcing and automation to improve quality and cost, ultimately netting a 15 percent speed improvement.

Ford plans to invest nearly $2 billion into the Louisville plant to assemble the midsize electric truck, securing nearly 2,200 hourly jobs. The project is supported by an incentive offer from the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority.

“This announcement not only represents one of the largest investments on record in our state; it also boosts Kentucky’s position at the center of EV-related innovation and solidifies Louisville Assembly Plant as an important part of Ford’s future,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said. “Thanks to Ford’s leaders for their continued faith in Kentucky and our incredible workforce.”

The plant will expand by 52,000 square feet to move material more efficiently. Digital infrastructure upgrades will provide the plant with the fastest network with the most access points of any Ford plant globally, enabling more quality scans.

The investment in the Louisville plant is in addition to Ford’s previously announced $3 billion investment in BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, which will build the prismatic LFP batteries for the midsize electric truck starting next year.

The deal will help T1 satisfy growing U.S. demand for panels produced with American-made components. Under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, solar companies will be restricted from claiming federal clean energy tax credits if projects contain meaningful amounts of equipment produced by “foreign entities of concern,” including China.

Under the agreement, Corning will supply T1 with solar wafers from its Michigan factory starting in the second half of 2026. Wafers are thin slices of silicon that are the building blocks of solar cells that transform sunlight into electricity.

China dominates global solar wafer manufacturing. Trump has criticized the solar industry for being too reliant on Chinese supply chains.

The deal is an expansion of an existing supply contract for solar-grade polysilicon, the industry’s raw material.

T1 will use the wafers at an Austin, Texas, cell facility that is under development, the companies told Reuters. Those cells will be assembled into panels at T1’s existing factory near Dallas.

Both companies combined will employ about 6,000 workers in Michigan and Texas, they said.

Corning reached a similar deal with manufacturers Suniva and Heliene earlier this year.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been credited with spurring billions of dollars of private investment as well as onshoring domestic energy production and manufacturing. But after the chaos and uncertainty of President Donald Trump’s first few months in office, things look very different for the IRA and the industry it sought to boost.

“It’s a shadow of its former self,” says Michael Gerrard, professor and faculty director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.

Here’s how it all breaks down three years down the line.

“A real roller coaster ride”

Since the IRA’s passage on August 16, 2022, there has been about $169.7 billion worth of net new investments in clean energy technology and manufacturing projects, according to Atlas Public Policy. The research group’s Clean Economy Tracker monitors private-led investments and jobs generated from announcements of commercial scale facilities for battery production, mineral processing, electric vehicles, carbon-free electricity, and more. Alongside those billions in investments, companies have announced about 166,000 net new jobs.

“The IRA has been a real roller coaster ride. In August of 2022, Manchin and Schumer cut their deal, and then throughout the rest of the Biden administration, we saw tremendous energy and growth,” Gerrard says. “And then when Trump won the election, it became clear that the roller coaster was going to start going downhill.”

The erosion of the bill’s core features following the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” together with the uncertainty created by changing global tariffs, have had a measurable impact on renewable energy and clean tech. All told, Atlas estimates that there have been $20 billion worth of canceled investments and 25,500 canceled jobs since the passage of the IRA, as well as $3.9 billion worth of retracted investments and 12,600 retracted jobs. A vast majority of those cancellations and retractions—some $18.7 billion worth—have occurred just since the start of the year when Trump took office.

Business and advocacy group E2, which uses Atlas’s Clean Economy Tracker, as well as its own, has a slightly larger figure. It estimates companies have scaled back, canceled, or closed $22 billion worth of investments in new factories and clean energy projects and close to 16,600 announced jobs just in the first half of 2025. That’s more than 10 times the nearly $2 billion worth of projects canceled, closed, or downsized throughout all of 2024.

E2 communications director Michael Timberlake says those cancellation figures can include projects announced prior to the IRA’s passage. Atlas Public Policy data further shows that wind, batteries, and electric vehicles are the biggest losers on a relative basis, meaning those sectors have the highest percentages of investment cancellations or retractions compared with overall new investments.

Notable announcements include several closures and cancellations from lithium-ion battery recycling company Li-Cycle, which filed for bankruptcy in May before its acquisition by Glencore. The company had been building a hub in Rochester, New York, worth just shy of $1 billion that was meant to employ 270, according to the Democrat & Chronicle. Meanwhile, German energy developer RWE announced in April that it halted its U.S. offshore wind operations for the time being, Electrek reported. E2 notes RWE was pursuing a $1.1 billion project in South Carolina.

Furthermore, new investments in sectors like solar, wind, batteries, and EVs have dramatically slowed. Only $7.2 billion worth of clean economy projects have been announced since the start of the year—a 60 percent drop from the $18.3 billion announced the previous year, and an 89 percent decline from the post-IRA peak investment year in 2023, according to E2.

“Companies need certainty more than anything,” Timberlake says. “The past six, seven months have been quite difficult for companies to make any kind of clear decisions.”

After stepping into office, Trump quickly froze IRA-related federal funding, both outstanding and previously allocated funding. That funding, much of it grants and loans, was in legal limbo until April, when a federal judge ordered the administration to immediately reinstate it. In July, the passage of the budget reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, eliminated any unallocated funding from the IRA, rolled back some programming, and curtailed and eliminated certain tax credits.

International law firm Steptoe noted in an alert to clients that the biggest incentive rollbacks concerned electric vehicles and residential energy efficiency credits, which are now scheduled to end before the close of 2025. Other heavily affected credits are those for wind and solar projects, clean hydrogen, and advanced manufacturing for wind components. Many of the changes have to do with new time restrictions for qualifying projects.

“Large-scale solar and wind is going to be hard hit,” Timberlake says.

There were, however, some exceptions to the broad rollbacks, including credits for clean fuel, nuclear energy production, carbon sequestration, and advanced manufacturing for components that do not concern wind, according to Steptoe.

“What we saw as a result of all of this tumult in Washington, at least from a legislative point, is a recognition that some facets of the clean economy are essential for the U.S. economy,” says Atlas Public Policy founder Nick Nigro.

“A bundle of internal contradictions”

All the while, Trump has threatened, levied, and revoked tariffs at a rapid clip, weakening political relationships and upending industries. Although this level of uncertainty has been destabilizing for a variety of industries, renewable energy and climate tech have been in a particularly precarious position given the administration’s ongoing attacks on climate science.

This all comes at a time when most experts agree the world will barrel past the 1.5-degree Celsius global warming benchmark, established by the Paris Agreement—if it hasn’t already. Furthermore, experts warn a deemphasis on renewable energy technologies will mean the U.S. is virtually assured to fall behind as the rest of the world races to develop climate change mitigation technologies of the future.

“I think the combination of the cutbacks on the IRA and the wildly fluctuating tariffs greatly harm our competitive position in the world,” says Columbia’s Gerrard.

In fact, many of these moves the Trump administration has made against electric vehicles and the development and onshoring of renewable energy run counter to the president’s own stated goals. On his first day in office, one of Trump’s energy-related executive orders resolved to “unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources” in order to “restore American prosperity.” But by undermining the U.S. push into renewable energy and EVs, experts say he is also undermining the nation’s future competitive advantage.

“Trump’s energy policies have been a bundle of internal contradictions,” Gerrard says. “He says he wants energy dominance, but he’s knocking down the cheapest, fastest-growing form of energy: wind and solar.”

He adds, “Killing the motor vehicle emission standards and greatly constraining electric vehicles means that many of the U.S.-made cars will only appeal to a U.S. market.”

After a year of so much uncertainty in the business world, it will take time for the dust to settle.

Atlas’s Nigro also says that it will be crucial to monitor how Trump administration officials exercise additional powers, which have the potential to make it more difficult for companies to take advantage of the pared back tax incentives in the budget reconciliation bill. That said, the next six to 12 months are likely to be a better indicator than the past year of how far-reaching Trump’s policy changes will be on renewable energy and the clean economy. For his part, Nigro anticipates investments will resume, but at a much slower pace than the historic levels the industry saw after the historic IRA.

“I expect us to return to an elevated level—not the not the ‘24, ‘23 historically high levels of investment, but certainly elevated, which would still be meaningful for this transition,” Nigro says. “It just won’t be quite as fast.”","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/vip/2025/08/ira-climate-biden-inc-2219897352.jpg",N,,2025-08-15 17:04:06.449602

At a time when energy demand is increasing, we should be looking to get the most affordable and easiest to deploy energy–clean energy– on the grid, not halting its development. Clean energy solutions are not only popular, but also help lower utility bills for hard-working families and communities across the country. Now more than ever, we need to prioritize energy solutions that keep costs low, protect the health and safety of our communities, and protect the environment.”

The Eco Ambassador Council (EAC), a coalition catalyzed by Carter Bank and composed of local businesses—including Blair Construction, Clark Gas & Oil, Frith Construction, Hooker Furnishings, Intertape, Jones & DeShon Orthodontics, and Pickle & Ash—has announced funding for five transformative environmental projects across Southern Virginia and the Dan River Basin.

These businesses work together with their charitable investments to drive regional change by supporting initiatives that build community resilience, expand access to nature, protect ecological health, and promote economic growth.

Each initiative represents a shared commitment to sustainability, safety, equity, and the restoration of natural spaces—directly benefiting local communities while protecting the region’s unique ecosystems.

“These projects demonstrate the power of local action,” said Tyler Carter, EAC member and community reinvestment administrator for Carter Bank. “Each one addresses a different facet of environmental health such as making nature more accessible, restoring ecosystems, or simply keeping people safe on the river. They’re proof that with the right support, small communities can lead big change.”

Teaching Water Safety

One initiative, Water Safety Education for All, is led by the Dan River Basin Association (DRBA). It brings free, beginner-friendly kayak safety classes to underserved communities in Henry County, Martinsville, Patrick County, and Danville. Participants, many of whom have never had access to formal instruction, will learn core river skills such as trip planning, boat fitting, paddle techniques, and Leave No Trace ethics.

Each participant will also receive personal safety gear, including river maps, dry shirts, waterproof flashlights, whistles, and multi-tools. The program is designed to promote safe recreation, outdoor equity, and stewardship of regional waterways.

Clearer River Signage

Also led by DRBA, the Play It Safe River Access Safety Signage Initiative will install more than 50 permanent, bilingual signs at public river access points in Virginia and North Carolina. The signs will feature paddling tips, emergency contacts, river condition guidelines, and environmental ethics.

Featuring universal icons and English/Spanish messaging, the signs are designed to improve safety for all users—including those with limited literacy—and enhance emergency response capabilities.

“With the support of the EAC, we’re breaking down barriers—whether physical, economic, or cultural—to create welcoming spaces where everyone can safely and meaningfully connect with the outdoors,” said Anna Wheeler, DRBA’s recreation and stewardship manager. “The EAC is an incredible network of business leaders who truly understand the environmental needs and challenges facing our region and are committed to combining their resources to make the greatest possible impact.”

Fred Clifton Park Revitalization

In Patrick County, EAC funding will support the Fred Clifton Park Renovation project to breathe new life into a scenic community asset known for its breathtaking overlook and peaceful setting. Volunteers will repaint worn structures, clean up the grounds, and install interpretive signs to highlight the park’s geological, ecological, and cultural significance.

Located near the popular Lovers Leap scenic stop along the Blue Ridge Parkway, the enhanced park will better serve both residents and travelers, encouraging longer visits, greater engagement with nature, and a deeper appreciation of the region’s natural heritage.

“We are excited to receive the grant,” said James Houchins, Patrick County’s director of economic development and tourism. “The Eco Ambassador Council’s dedication to enhancing green spaces is a great service to local communities. I have often said that Patrick County has many hidden gems, and Fred Clifton Park is one! This grant will help keep the park fresh and inviting.”

Woodland Trail Bridge Rebuild

In Spencer, the Woodland Trail Bridge Rebuild will restore a vital trail connector at the Spencer-Penn Centre. The deteriorated bridge currently limits access to a looped trail used by seniors, families, and individuals with disabilities for exercise, wellness, and education.

Led by local volunteers, the rebuilt bridge will ensure continued access to the only outdoor trail in Spencer that is fully accessible to those with mobility needs.

“After some major storms wiped out the bridge on the Woodland Trail, we are so excited to know that thanks to the Eco Ambassador Council, the bridge will be rebuilt and the full trail will again be accessible to our community,” said Susan King Sabin, executive director of the Spencer-Penn Centre. “These partnerships are critical to providing the best resources and opportunities to our neighbors and visitors. Having beautiful assets only matters if they are accessible to everyone.”

River Restoration in Stuart

The South Mayo River Structures Removal Project, led by the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources (VDWR), will eliminate two low-head dams and two sets of concrete bridge piers in Stuart. The outdated structures block fish migration, collect debris, endanger paddlers, and degrade habitat.

Removing them will improve safety and open nearly 10 miles of the South Mayo River to aquatic species, including the state-threatened Orangefin Madtom and lay the groundwork for potential reintroduction of extirpated mussel species. In addition to ecological gains, this three-week project will significantly improve safety and river access in Stuart — supporting eco-tourism, recreation, and a community-wide connection to the health of the river.

“The Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources is incredibly excited to have been awarded grant funds from the EAC to support the removal of defunct structures in the South Mayo River,” said Louise Finger, stream restoration biologist with VDWR. “These funds, in combination with support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Virginia Tech, and other partners, will improve aquatic habitat, fish passage, and safe, recreational use of the river.”

Beyond the Checkbook

EAC support includes more than financial backing. Members will also be hands-on and engage their workforce to volunteer for some of the projects. As these five projects move forward in the coming months, they will collectively promote safety, education, environmental equity, and a deeper sense of connection to the natural resources that belong to the Dan River Basin.

“These projects show what’s possible when local businesses step beyond the day-to-day grind and come together to invest in the shared future of our communities and environment,” said Anna Lester, vice president of Clark Gas & Oil and partner at Pickle & Ash. “The EAC is more than just funding—it’s about building a culture of stewardship, connection, and collective responsibility.”

As these five projects unfold in the months ahead, their collective impact will ripple through the region—strengthening environmental equity, improving safety, and deepening the community’s connection to the Dan River Basin.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-mountainmedianews-co/sites/10/2025/08/businesses-8-16-fi.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 19:03:57.990847

DOE Selects Companies for Advanced Reactor Pilot

The U.S. Department of Energy selected 11 projects for expedited deployment of advanced reactors. Through the advanced reactor pilot, the companies may proceed with development without Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing. Though the companies are responsible for financing the projects, the removal of NRC licensing may allow the companies to reach reactor criticality faster. The DOE has expressed a goal of at least three operational test reactors in the program by July 2026. Ten companies are participating in the program: Aalo Atomics, Antares Nuclear, Atomic Alchemy, Deep Fission, Last Energy, Oklo, Natura Resources, Radiant Industries, Terrestrial Energy and Valar Atomics.

State Policy Updates

State legislatures have introduced over 200 bills related to nuclear energy and spent nuclear fuel during the 2025 session. Below is a selection of bills with recent action:

Delaware SCR 18 (enacted) establishes a task force to assess the feasibility, cost, reliability, environmental implications and regulatory considerations for the deployment of SMRs in the state. The task force must report to the Legislature, governor and legislative services by Dec. 31, 2025.

New Hampshire HB 189 (enacted) amends the state’s definition of clean energy to include small-scale nuclear reactors and renewable energy, adding SMRs to the state’s 10-year energy strategy.

New York SB 8458 (introduced) directs the state energy research and development authority and other relevant environmental and energy agencies to develop a regulatory structure to facilitate the construction and operation of advanced reactors in the state. The bill, known as the Nuclear Energy Deployment Act, would also create grants and a fund for nuclear energy deployment, along with a nuclear energy coordinator position.

NRC Sends Confirmatory Order to Constellation Over Quad Cities Violations

Constellation Energy has received a confirmatory order, or alternative dispute resolution, due to operator errors that occurred at its Quad Cities nuclear plant in Illinois in 2023. The order issues corrective and preventive actions, as requested by Constellation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During a March 2023 refueling outage, workers failed to close open valves and coolant water sprayed onto two employees, though radiation exposure was at safe levels, the company said. Employees who were found responsible were fired. Constellation must now take corrective and preventive actions as outlined by the NRC and update the agency on progress.

WIPP Approved to Expand Storage

The Environmental Protection Agency has approved an expansion of New Mexico’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or WIPP. The underground facility will expand into two new areas, opening seven 33-foot storage rooms. WIPP began operation in the late 1990s and now houses just over 100,000 cubic meters of nuclear waste, primarily from the past production of nuclear weapons. The site is designed to be a permanent storage solution, but is not designated as a site for spent nuclear fuel from the U.S. reactor fleet.

Construction Partner Selected for X-Energy TRISO Fuel Facility

X-Energy and its fuel company TRISO-X have selected Clark Construction Group to complete construction on a fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. The new contractor will begin work in September. The facility, which will produce TRISO fuel for X-Energy’s Xe-100 SMR, is part of the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. X-Energy currently has partnerships with Dow and Amazon to provide power to sites in Texas and Washington, respectively, when the Xe-100 is deployed.

General Matter Announces Paducah Enrichment Project

The DOE recently announced that it will lease a parcel of land at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, located in Kentucky, to General Matter for the development of a domestic uranium enrichment facility. Though the DOE leases the land, the facility is private. The Paducah plant was used to enrich uranium from the 1950s to 2013. Construction on the new facility is set to begin in 2026, with uranium enrichment beginning by 2030. It is estimated that the project will create about 140 jobs and bring $71 million in economic benefits to the area. General Matter is part of the DOE’s high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) availability program.

DOE Makes 5th Loan Disbursement for Michigan’s Palisades Restart

The DOE has dispersed just over $300 million of a $1.52 billion loan guarantee to Holtec International to facilitate the restart of Michigan’s Palisades Nuclear Plant. The August disbursement is the fifth one from the loan, which was initially designated under the Biden administration. In late July, the NRC moved Palisades’ status from “decommissioning” to authorize an operating license. Palisades has been approved to return to operations once the remainder of the licensing steps are approved. The plant still must undergo maintenance and upgrades, but Holtec hopes to have it operating by the end of this year.

Denver International Airport Announces SMR Feasibility Study

The Denver International Airport has published a request for proposals to study the feasibility of an SMR on the airport’s campus. The study will assess whether an SMR is feasible, the potential costs, funding opportunities, regulatory obstacles and risks. The airport expects the study, which has a budget of $1.25 million, to take up to one year. Colorado currently does not have any nuclear reactors.

Our scenarios suggest that the speed of the energy transition would likely not be drastically altered, at least in the European Union, by introducing tariffs.
In the European Union, assuming tariffs don’t lead to a reprioritization of its energy independence goals, investment in renewables is likely to continue.","A cleaner planet for generations to come, and more energy security and independence for more people, sound like no-brainers. Then comes the off-again, on-again, slight slaps on the wrist and knockout blows to friends and enemies alike, which describes the chaotic picture of the Trump administration’s tariff policy.

Targeting the clean-energy transition around the world and what tariffs might mean to it is “How Might Tariffs Affect the Energy Transition?”, a new paper from management consultants McKinsey & Company.

First off, the article says, achieving clean energy does not exist in a vacuum. Climate-change concerns and more secure supply chains exist alongside fast-evolving technologies and geopolitical tensions amid changing alliances.

To aid understanding, McKinsey outlines three tariff scenarios and their likely impact on the supply chain across five clean-energy technologies: EVs and battery energy storage (considered here) and solar, onshore wind, and offshore wind, projecting capital expenditures and energy capacity outlook to 2035.

While authors don’t suggest any scenario is more or less likely than another, results are notable both for what may change and what likely won’t. Moderate tariffs alone would likely have a limited effect on the adoption of clean technologies, especially in Europe, but under the sustained application of the highest-tariff scenario considered, renewable-energy adoption will stall in the United States, and solar and wind adoption could soften in Europe by 2035.

Thresholds for change

The paper’s three tariff scenarios map out a few possible futures and illustrate the sensitivity of technologies to tariffs in different locations. “The terrain of announced and enacted tariffs changes daily and may or may not match the scenarios presented,” the authors say. The scenarios are:

As of June 2025, China and the United States have paused the more than 100 percent tariffs between their countries, the paper notes. The United States has applied an additional 30 percent tariff on all goods entering from China, and China has responded with a 10 percent tariff on all goods entering from the United States. The European Union continues tariffs of up to 35 percent on Chinese EVs but has otherwise not proposed or received new tariffs.

The BESS perspective

China dominates the supply chain for battery energy storage systems (BESS) as the primary global exporter, the report says, but that is changing. Unlike in solar PV modules, critical raw materials for batteries such as lithium and cobalt are accessible across Latin America, Africa, and Australia (lithium in Chile and Argentina, cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Australia), providing opportunities for manufacturing supply chains outside ASEAN countries.

“We estimate that BESS capacity will increase approximately 70 percent by 2035 in the United States and nearly sixfold by 2035 in the European Union,” the report states. The global tensions escalation scenario could result in 4 percent less capacity in the United States and up to 10 percent less capacity in the European Union by 2035 relative to the productivity acceleration scenario. The volume of imports from China to the European Union is higher than to the United States, which has substantial domestic production, partially explaining the larger effect on BESS in the European Union.

Tariffs add uncertainty to the clean-energy landscape. In the broadest sense, our scenario analysis indicates that adoption of clean-energy technologies will likely take longer and cost more the longer tariffs last and the higher they are. Even so, we see that the adoption of clean technologies will continue. Stakeholders who evaluate their supply chains for vulnerabilities and strengths in the face of tariffs will be poised to better navigate the uncertain landscape

EV manufacturing capacity is spread across the globe, with high production volumes in China, the United States, the European Union, Mexico, and Canada, the last two of which host facilities for EU and US OEMs. EV imports excluding parts represent approximately 30 percent of the EU market, mostly from China. In the United States, imports from Mexico, Canada, and the European Union represent 35 percent of the market.

By 2030, adoption of EVs in the United States is projected to be 14 percent under the productivity acceleration scenario. Meanwhile, in the European Union—where penetration is already higher than in the United States—EVs could have approximately 50 percent sales penetration in the productivity acceleration scenario versus 41 percent in the global tensions escalate scenario by 2030. The global tensions escalation scenario could create additional considerations for the European Union’s planned ban on internal combustion engine vehicles set for 2035.

High tariffs could slow adoption and increase the cost of energy technologies. In the United States, sustained high tariffs could delay the penetration of renewable energy after 2035. In a productivity acceleration scenario, the United States is poised to achieve a 69 percent clean-energy mix by 2035 (Exhibit 2) and 68 percent under both tariff scenarios, compared with 49 percent today. However, the sustained imposition of tariffs in the global tensions escalation scenario could stall the expansion of the share of clean energy beyond 2035.

Independent of tariffs, the United States will generate more energy from natural gas in 2035 than it does today, according to McKinsey analysis; tariffs could make the proportion slightly larger. In 2035, gas represents 29 percent of capacity in the productivity acceleration scenario and 30 to 31 percent of capacity in the no-real-disruption and global tensions escalate scenarios.

Our scenarios suggest that the speed of the energy transition would likely not be drastically altered, at least in the European Union, by introducing tariffs. The cost of the resulting energy systems could be approximately 2 percent more in the United States and approximately 3 percent more in the European Union by 2050, according to our analysis. These amounts have large uncertainty, but we already see rising costs in these industries.

Charting a way forward

Even after testing an array of tariff scenarios, much remains unpredictable. Our analysis focuses on the manufacture and deployment of energy technologies, but it does not encompass all the supply chain interconnections that could be affected by tariffs. Nor does it account for possible changes to energy demand triggered by tariffs. It’s also uncertain how long tariffs may stay in effect.

Faced with this uncertainty, it is still helpful to consider the results of a scenario analysis for what we may learn directionally from how interactions play out under the conditions imposed by a forward-looking energy system model. Clean-tech OEMs, energy producers, and network operators could consider examining their portfolios, their geographical footprints, and their supply chains to identify their vulnerabilities and strengths in the face of tariffs and to minimize their risks.

OEM leaders face challenges that differ depending on their technology and region, leading them to different strategies. The future of legislation, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act, could matter as much as or more than tariffs. Similarly, export controls of rare earth materials could have a large impact on OEMs. Even so, focusing on investing where the market is relatively insensitive to tariffs, stepping back where demand is poised to fall, and diversifying the supply chain could help OEM manufacturers adapt their operations to the tariff landscape.

Energy producers in the United States face lower returns for clean technologies under tariff scenarios. Wind energy costs are likely to be less affected than solar, and, regardless of tariffs, natural gas is likely to be an increasing part of the US energy mix because of its low cost combined with rising energy demand. In the European Union, assuming tariffs don’t lead to a reprioritization of its energy independence goals, investment in renewables is likely to continue.

Network operators in both the United States and the European Union could consider aligning their investments with energy producers, planning for industrial electrification over the long term—especially in Europe—and continuing to invest in grid maintenance.

Tariffs cast a shadow of uncertainty across the clean-energy sector.

In one email exchange, Dr. Koonin reached out in February to Mr. Zeldin’s chief of staff, Eric Amidon.","A new lawsuit in federal court alleges that the Trump administration violated the law by secretly recruiting a group of people who reject the scientific consensus on climate change to write a report downplaying global warming.

The Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists, both environmental groups, accused the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency of “flagrant violations” of a law that governs advisory committees.

The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday. It alleges that in March Chris Wright, the energy secretary, “quietly arranged for five handpicked skeptics of the effects of climate change” to form a committee called the Climate Working Group that then wrote a report downplaying the threat of rising greenhouse gas emissions. Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, cited the report to justify a plan to repeal the legal foundation for regulating climate pollution.

But the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 does not allow federal agencies to recruit or rely on secret groups when engaging in policymaking, according to the lawsuit. The law requires that any groups developed to advise federal policy must be disclosed and that meetings, emails and other records be made public.

On Thursday the environmental groups filed a separate motion asking the court to block the E.P.A. from moving forward with a plan to repeal a scientific determination made by the government in 2009 that climate pollution harms public health and welfare. That assessment, known as the endangerment finding, is the basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Officials with the Department of Energy did not respond to a request for comment. An E.P.A. official said the agency does not comment on current or pending litigation.

The authors of the Department of Energy report were Steven E. Koonin, a physicist and author of a best-selling book that calls climate science “unsettled”; Judith Curry, a climatologist who has cautioned of alarmism about warming; John Christy, an atmospheric scientist who doubts the extent to which human activity has caused global warming; Roy Spencer, a meteorologist at the University of Alabama, Huntsville; and Ross McKitrick, an economics professor at the University of Guelph in Canada.

Dr. Koonin said in an email that he is not an attorney and not qualified to offer an opinion on the lawsuit. Dr. Curry said in an email that the Climate Working Group “provided technical information to the DOE, not policy advice.” Dr. Christy declined to comment, and Dr. Spencer and Mr. McKitrick did not respond to requests for comment.

Documents obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund under public records laws show that Dr. Koonin began contacting Trump administration officials within weeks of President Trump’s inauguration. In one email exchange, Dr. Koonin reached out in February to Mr. Zeldin’s chief of staff, Eric Amidon.

“I was told (through a mutual friend of mine and the Administrator’s) that I should contact you to set up a meeting with Mr. Zeldin,” Dr. Koonin wrote. “The subject is to offer technical assistance from me and colleagues in the review of the Endangerment Finding.”

Mr. Amidon replied that the agency was “moving right along on this topic” and said he would set up a call for Dr. Koonin with E.P.A. officials. On Friday Dr. Koonin said the call never occurred, writing in an email, “A search of my records shows no further contact with the EPA (whether by phone, video, or in person)” after the Feb. 16 email exchange.

Dr. Koonin did send Mr. Amidon a memo of what he called “inconvenient truths” on climate change, including a claim widely rejected by mainstream scientists that “there is no basis to conclude that human emissions enhance natural ‘greenhouse’ warming in any amount.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/15CLI-CLIMATE-SCIENCE-LAWSUIT-mqfc/15CLI-CLIMATE-SCIENCE-LAWSUIT-mqfc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 17:03:42.566689

Renewable projects have historically been able to qualify for federal clean energy tax credits once a developer spent 5 percent of a project’s cost. But that threshold would be scrapped under new Treasury guidance.

The order comes after President Donald Trump ordered Treasury in July to tighten the definition for the start of construction, in an attempt to limit “market distorting subsidies for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources.”

Under the new rules, developers would need to prove they had embarked on significant construction activities to qualify for the credits.

For a wind project, that could mean pouring a concrete pad for a foundation, according to the guidance. For solar, that could mean installation of racks that hold panels. Manufacturing of major project components would also qualify. Bloomberg News was first to report the guidance.

Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The guidance comes after Congress overhauled the tax credits available to renewable projects in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Under the law, companies that start construction before July 4, 2026, are able to qualify for tax credits through the end of the decade.

The Treasury rules have been at the center of tug-of-war between Republican moderates and hardliners in recent months. Moderates like Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Curtis of Utah have argued that Treasury should continue to employ the traditional definition for the start of construction, while conservatives like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas have argued for a more stringent definition.

Renewable interests and environmentalists quickly lambasted the rule. The Solar Energy Industries Association called the rule a “blatant rejection of what Congress passed.”

“This is yet another act of energy subtraction from the Trump administration that will further delay the buildout of affordable, reliable power,” SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement.

Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resource Defense Council, said Congress had provided “a narrow but clear path” for clean energy projects to receive tax credits under Trump’s budget law.

While advancements in AI promise enhanced efficiency and innovation, these benefits come with substantial energy and cooling demands. Notably, 56% of global data centre energy is currently sourced from fossil fuels, as per the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

It is within this context that Rolls-Royce is redirecting its focus towards Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as a cleaner energy alternative for powering its AI usage.

Strategic implementation of SMRs

Rolls-Royce is committing to a nuclear energy transformation by integrating SMRs into its existing operations. The effort involves laying the groundwork for SMR implementation, with agreements to establish three reactors in the UK and six more in the Czech Republic.

SMRs deliver up to 300 MW of electricity, highlighting their efficiency compared to traditional nuclear power plants.

Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO at Rolls-Royce, underscores the company's expansive nuclear capabilities, stating: ""There is no private company in the world with the nuclear capability we have. If we are not the market leader globally, we did something wrong.""

It's projected that by 2050, there will be a requirement for approximately 400 SMRs, paving the way for an overhaul in energy sourcing within supply chains.

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation has endorsed the potential of SMRs as a cost-effective and efficient alternative to larger reactors. The US sees similar investments, with companies like Google collaborating with Kairos Power to integrate SMRs by 2030. This momentum underscores an emerging trend in the integration of cleaner energy solutions to empower AI capabilities.

Leveraging AI in operations

Rolls -oyce is not new to AI; its implementation in the company dates back to 1999, initially to predict maintenance for aviation engines.

Today, AI extends across their manufacturing processes, involving automated quality checks and collaborations with R2 Data Labs. Here, data harnessing optimises performance and customer value, transforming operational procedures.

Further expanding its climate-conscious initiatives, Rolls-Royce implements technologies such as the mtu EnergetIQ, which uses data-driven strategies to balance energy requirements against pricing and weather data.

Jan Henker, Senior Expert Automation and Controls at Rolls-Royce, elaborates: “If you want to achieve perfect interplay in leveraging the strengths of the different technologies, not just today, but tomorrow, next week and beyond, then what you need isn't a fixed operating strategy but one that constantly recalculates itself automatically.

""That requires an over-arching, data-driven solution – in other words, the optimiser function of mtu EnergetIQ.”

Such innovations position Rolls-Royce at the forefront in refining sustainable practices in AI deployment.

The wider impact of SMR Investment

The SMR initiative is set to produce enough energy to power a million homes, providing stable, affordable and emissions-free energy for at least 60 years. Expected outputs of 470 MW of low carbon energy by each SMR equate to the production capacity of 150 onshore wind turbines.

Such contributions are poised to infuse up to US$73bn into the UK economy between 2025 and 2105.

The UK supply chain stands to benefit significantly, with a focus on domestic manufacturing and assembly to maintain high-quality standards and mitigate site-level disruptions. This operational structure is instrumental in supporting global SMR rollout while enhancing local industry capabilities.

Moreover, the development of these SMR plants in the UK is projected to create 40,000 regional jobs by 2050.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/1edaa4d25e7a6058e37dae375207fcb6:2868e29936c7e1758e39e82bb1f4bb68/rr-smr.webp.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 18:02:53.849092

“This is much better than expected,” said Phil Shen, a clean energy analyst with Roth Capital Partners, who added the changes were minimal overall.

Sunrun Inc., the nation’s biggest residential solar installer, jumped 33% Friday and home solar equipment provider SolarEdge Technologies Inc. rose 17%. NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest large-scale solar and wind developer, climbed 4%. NexTracker Inc., a solar equipment provider, was up 12%.

The issuing of the rules follows an executive order by President Donald Trump directing the Treasury Department to place new limits on the tax credits, part of an escalating campaign waged by the administration against wind and solar power. The crackdown includes policies that could halt the construction of renewable projects on public and private lands. It arrives as the country is scrambling to add more power supplies to meet soaring electricity demand from data centers running artificial intelligence.

Under Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill signed into law July 4, solar and wind developments are eligible for tax credits if they begin construction within 12 months.

Until now, projects were considered eligible for the credits if developers had spent at least 5% of the planned projects cost. The new rule eliminates the 5% standard for large solar and wind projects, instead requiring developers prove “physical work of a significant nature” has been taking place on an ongoing basis. However, solar facilities not greater than 1.5 megawatts can still use the 5% of planned project expense standard to qualify.

“There was some expectation that the rule-making would make it very onerous to safe harbor tax credits, but this seems pretty straight forward,” said Robert Barnett, a clean energy analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “This is particularly favorable news to the residential and small commercial solar companies.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ADKICERWKmp72wxMbbCW.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_holding_pen_162/a5c7b54e8dc15aedc12e8693733f1edb,N,,2025-08-15 18:02:34.931186

""This could mean squeezing the battery back into shape, for example, or applying targeted heat to trigger self-repair mechanisms inside.""
In the EU, the PHOENIX team conceded that a battery decked out with sensors will be more expensive to make.","Self-healing electric vehicle batteries being designed in Europe could soon bring unprecedented longevity to the highway by doubling pack lifespans.

That means that a hypothetical family that buys an EV when their child is born could use the same cleaner ride to pick them up from college graduation more than 20 years later — as long as the rest of the vehicle is still functional.

As a result, battery lifespan — once a hurdle to adoption — is becoming a strength. Car and Driver reported that packs already last between eight and 15 years.

According to a press release from Horizon, a European Commission magazine, experts at PHOENIX, a European Union-funded initiative, intend to put to rest any fear about battery health with sensor and self-repair tech.

It's an effort that's in line with the EU's goal of cutting transportation-related air pollution production from new cars in a decade.

""The idea is to increase battery lifetime and reduce its carbon footprint because the same battery can repair itself so that fewer resources are needed overall,"" Johannes Ziegler, a materials scientist at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, said in Horizon.

The PHOENIX smart batteries are being developed by experts from multiple countries. They work by using advanced sensors to gather much more information than current battery monitoring systems.

In addition to heat and voltage, the tech will gauge physical swelling, generate internal heat maps, and identify specific gases, according to the release.

Gas presence can be a sign of pending failure and dreaded thermal runaway. That's the catastrophic precursor to rare, yet serious fires. In reality, it's widely reported that gas cars are more likely to catch fire than EVs.

Added layers of safety can all but eliminate the risk.

""When the battery's brain decides repair is needed, healing is activated,"" the PHOENIX experts said in the release. ""This could mean squeezing the battery back into shape, for example, or applying targeted heat to trigger self-repair mechanisms inside.""

The researchers are exploring several methods, including applying targeted heat to reform chemical bonds.

Magnetic fields that break up troublesome dendrites, which are branch-like metallic formations that grow during operation and can cause failure, are another self-repairing feature.

Researchers elsewhere are working on stretchable, self-healing batteries with fascinating potential, too. California's Liminal also has inspection tech that identifies pack flaws as the cells are being made, reducing failure risk.

Longer-lasting, safer batteries prevent valuable cell components from becoming hazardous waste, as reported by NPR. Better technology and increased recycling efforts are part of the reason industry experts expect pack costs to soon drop by half.

Each EV that replaces a gas-burning ride prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The fumes are linked by NASA to increased risks for extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves.

President Donald Trump's spending bill is sunsetting EV tax credits years early. But you can lock in $7,500 in incentives if you make the switch before Sept. 30. EV owners also enjoy about $1,500 in annual gas and maintenance savings.

In the EU, the PHOENIX team conceded that a battery decked out with sensors will be more expensive to make. The researchers are analyzing which monitors provide the best value.

The goal is a smaller, lighter, and longer-lasting power pack.

Slate's pitch is keep the vehicle as simple as possible to save on manufacturing costs, and then let owners add on and customize the truck however they want.

The Slate Truck is compact — two doors and two seats in its most basic form. It is spare — if you want an infotainment system, you have to add that yourself. And, you can. The vehicle is almost endlessly customizable.

Slate plans to sell more than 100 accessories for its truck, including a kit that will convert it to a 5-seat SUV. But Slate also wants to make the truck ""open source,"" meaning anyone could make accessories for the pickup.

So far, more than 100,000 people have made reservations for Slate's small barebones truck.

Price has been Slate's big selling point. Nearly half of American car shoppers say the top drawback to EVs is sticker price, according to a May 2025 survey by J.D. Power. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has been levying tariffs on foreign automakers and slashed federal incentives for EVs, making it more difficult for consumers to buy EVs.

Earlier in 2025, the company advertised that its truck would start below $20,000 with the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. It then wiped that language from its website around the time the Trump Administration issued an executive order in July that began the rollback of EV incentives.

The company says the case for its cheap truck will remain strong after federal EV tax credits expire in September.

The question for Slate is whether the vehicle is still compelling at around $27,000 or $28,000 as it would be around $20,000. There is only one vehicle in the United States transacting below $20,000 — the Mitsubishi Mirage. But below $30,000 there are about 20 models, according to Cox Automotive. One of those is the Ford Maverick, which comes with either a straight internal combustion engine or a hybrid powertrain, and has many of the features the Slate lacks.

Tougher rules on how projects can qualify for federal clean energy tax credits could slow development of new electricity generation at a time of surging power demand driven by artificial intelligence and the digital economy.

KEY QUOTE

""Any regulatory friction that slows down deployment of new generation today directly impacts our ability to meet AI-era electricity demands tomorrow,"" the coalition wrote in its letter to Bessent. The letter is dated August 4 but was seen by Reuters on Friday.

CONTEXT

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in July directing Treasury to tighten clean energy tax credit rules, including redefining what it means for a project to have started construction.

The industry has relied on the existing rules for the last decade, and advisory firm Clean Energy Associates projected this week that the United States could lose about 60 gigawatts of planned solar capacity through 2030 if stricter ""beginning of construction"" rules are implemented.

BY THE NUMBERS

Between 2017 and 2023, the U.S. data center industry contributed $3.5 trillion to the nation's gross domestic product and directly employed over 600,000 workers, according to the DCC.

WHAT'S NEXT

The Treasury Department is expected to issue updated guidelines as soon as August 18.

Under Trump, They Could Get Greenlit","Deep Vakil, Bob Berwyn",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15082025/new-york-williams-gas-pipeline-permits/,"Hundreds of New Yorkers rallied against new natural gas pipelines in their state as a deadline loomed for the public to comment on a revived proposal to expand the gas pipeline that supplies downstate New York.

A 2019 New York state law mandates a 40 percent reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels, and at least 85 percent by 2050.","Hundreds of New Yorkers rallied against new natural gas pipelines in their state as a deadline loomed for the public to comment on a revived proposal to expand the gas pipeline that supplies downstate New York.

Oklahoma-based natural gas company the Williams Cos. had shelved that pipeline and another New York project years ago over repeated denials of the necessary state permits. It resuscitated both in May after being thrown a lifeline: The White House, which had moved to block a large-scale wind farm off the coast of New York, said it would drop that opposition in exchange for state Gov. Kathy Hochul agreeing to greenlight Williams’ proposals.

Hochul has said she didn’t make any promises about the pipelines, and only indicated a willingness to approve them if state and federal requirements were met.

But the situation has alarmed community groups, environmental activists and New York politicians pressing for the state to meet its ambitious clean-energy goals. They noted that Williams’ Northeast Supply Enhancement, or NESE, has a comment period of 45 days that will close Aug. 16 without any public hearings.

“It looks like Kathy Hochul is doing a dirty deal with Donald Trump. She’s fast-tracked the permitting process, not allowed public hearings and is limiting public participation in what looks to be a setup,” said Pete Sikora, climate and inequality campaigns director at the advocacy group New York Communities for Change. “She should stop moving to do Trump’s bidding while torching our future.”

New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation said in a statement that its review process for natural gas pipeline proposals is “thorough, transparent, and guided by stringent state and federal environmental laws and regulations,” adding that the process “encourages public input at every step‎ and ensures the protection of public health and the environment.”

On Saturday, more than 500 rallygoers marched across the Brooklyn Bridge, chanting, “Which side are you on, Hochul, which side are you on?” They were joined by New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, who is challenging her in the 2026 gubernatorial primary.

“This is New York, the Empire State. If we don’t set the bar, who the hell else is going to do it?” asked Delgado, in his address to rallygoers before the march.

In a subsequent interview with Inside Climate News, he added, “The fossil fuel industry is posing a direct threat to our communities. We have a responsibility to hold the line here in New York and make sure that that doesn’t happen.”

Ken Lovett, a senior advisor on energy and environment for Hochul, said in a statement: “The only commitment the Governor has made is to work with everyone, including the Trump Administration, on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law. She believes an all-of-the-above approach will improve reliability, reduce costs for New Yorkers, and result in lower emissions.”

The NESE project would extend Williams’ existing Transco system by 37 miles at a cost of around $1 billion. Most of it would be built off the coasts of New Jersey and Staten Island before connecting into existing underwater pipelines just south of the Rockaways. The project’s website says: “As demand continues to grow, especially in densely populated areas like Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Long Island, so too must the capacity to deliver reliable energy.”

The other pipeline, named Constitution, would span roughly 125 miles from the Marcellus shale fields of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, to Schoharie County, New York, delivering fracked gas into systems that currently supply parts of the Northeast.

Williams, which did not respond to requests for comment, aims to have both up and running in two years.

States in the Northeast, “despite being located next to one of the world’s most prolific gas basins, continue to grapple with constrained gas supplies and higher electricity prices,” Amy Andryszak, president and CEO of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said in a statement. The trade group, representing over two dozen North American gas pipeline companies, also argues that natural gas can complement the growth of intermittent renewables.

Between 2016 and 2020, both of Williams’ pipeline projects hit roadblocks when the state, under then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, refused to issue water permits needed to begin construction. New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation previously concluded that both projects would threaten water quality in the state. The NESE pipeline, which would also run through New Jersey, received a similar determination from that state’s Department of Environmental Protection.

Williams decided to move on from the projects. That was before President Donald Trump kicked off his second term this year with a flurry of measures to boost fossil fuels and block clean energy.

In April, Trump’s Department of the Interior issued a stop-work order for Equinor’s Empire Wind project that was already approved and underway, putting at risk more than 1,500 jobs and clean power for half a million New York City homes. New York Attorney General Letitia James sued the federal government to get that project resumed. But Equinor chief executive Anders Opedal, in an interview with FT, said Hochul told him she had “an angle to talk to the administration.”

On May 19, Interior lifted the stop-work order, and Hochul said in a statement, “New York will work with the Administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law.” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum was less circumspect, writing on the social-media platform X that he was encouraged by Hochul’s “willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” A week later, the White House told POLITICO’s E&E News that Hochul “caved” and will allow “two natural gas pipelines to advance” through New York.

Delgado criticized the compromise struck by Hochul, his boss and political rival, calling her “performative” on climate action. In response, the governor’s office pointed to the state’s plans to invest more than $1 billion in climate efforts, progress on renewables and transmission projects, a proposal for a new nuclear plant and over 178,000 clean-energy jobs.

A 2019 New York state law mandates a 40 percent reduction in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels, and at least 85 percent by 2050. Deploying offshore wind, like the 2-gigawatt Empire Wind farm, forms a key part of the strategy to deliver on those climate goals.

“The Trump administration’s decision to not permit new offshore wind projects and to successfully push Congress to cut tax incentives on electric vehicles and solar energy is having an impact on all states’ abilities to meet short-term climate goals,” the governor’s office said in a statement. “Even with the roadblocks, New York remains a national leader on solar energy and offshore wind power.”

However, approving new gas pipelines with multi-decade lifespans keeps the state hooked on planet-warming fossil fuels for longer and, critics say, jeopardizes the very climate targets that offshore wind is meant to serve. As of 2022, the most recent data in New York’s progress tracker, the state had lowered emissions by 9 percent.

“We need to make sure we’re enforcing our law, and New York is treacherously off from it,” said Keanu Arpels-Josiah, a 20-year-old Swarthmore freshman and lead organizer with Fridays For Future NYC.

A 2018 analysis by PSE Healthy Energy found that over a two-decade period, the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the two pipelines’ operations and the use of the transported gas would equate to more than 14.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. That’s like putting roughly 3.4 million more gasoline-powered cars on the streets each year.

“We know that investment in fossil fuels only exacerbates the climate crisis and drives up utility costs,” Delgado said. “Why do we keep moving in this direction?”

According to National Grid, whose gas-utility territory includes Staten Island, Long Island and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, the cost to construct NESE would be borne by ratepayers, increasing monthly heating bills by about $7.50. But it also estimates that over 15 years, the pipeline would save downstate residents around $2.75 billion on their bills. Sally Librera, president of National Grid New York, said in a statement that its assessment finds the NESE pipeline would “ensure our gas network continues to operate dependably and supports the region’s growing energy needs.”

New York City relies heavily on natural gas for power and heating. Shipping more gas into the city could provide some relief on energy costs in the near term, especially during winters, when demand peaks and supply shortages can cause price spikes.

The limitations of existing pipeline capacity puts “critical supply constraints on natural gas infrastructure during major winter storms,” Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the American Gas Association, said in a statement. A 2023 report from federal regulators found that during Winter Storm Elliott the previous December, utilities in New York City narrowly averted a system collapse. It would have taken “many months” to restore service, the report said.

At the same time, prolonged burning of fossil fuels also makes extreme weather events more intense and more frequent. Superstorm Sandy, which hit the city in 2012, caused over $13 billion in physical damage and resulted in some $6 billion in lost economic activity.

In Arpels-Josiah’s view, Hochul is siding with fossil-fuel donors and Trump over the future of younger generations because she thinks it’s politically expedient.

“We will defeat this pipeline—just like we defeated the Williams NESE pipeline in 2019, just like we defeated the Constitution pipeline in 2016, just like we won the fracking ban in 2014,” he said. “Our movements are strong, and this is just another fight.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229080168-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 16:02:09.857430

Most of this demand is expected to come from AI training, which is projected to reach 40 TWh by 2026 and 402 TWh by 2030. The power demand for AI inference is also anticipated to accelerate toward the end of the decade.

In August 2024, Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's global head of data center energy, was interviewed during an episode of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Talk podcast.

In the interview, she discussed how Google's data centers consume a significant amount of electricity, prompting the tech giant to participate in the ongoing energy revolution.

In early August 2025, Indiana Michigan Power, a subsidiary of American Electric Power, announced that it had filed a special joint contract with Google to address the utility’s capacity needs through clean energy generation.

This contract aims to provide reliable and affordable service to all customers.

According to the press release, by participating in this program, Google would be able to reduce or shift its electricity demand, performing non-urgent tasks during times when the electric grid experiences less stress.

This initiative is designed to minimize peak load during periods of high energy demand, similar to programs currently offered for residential and commercial/industrial customers.

As a large customer, Google’s involvement enhances Indiana Michigan Power’s ability to manage electricity demand during peak times, ultimately helping to lower overall energy costs.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) recently announced a partnership to expand on a 2019 agreement, aiming to provide carbon-free renewable power for Google’s data centers in Tennessee and Alabama.

As the third-largest electricity generator in the U.S., TVA operates over 16,000 miles of transmission lines and serves 10 million people across a seven-state region.

Earlier this year, the American Public Power Association reported that Goldman Sachs Research forecasts a 50% increase in global power demand from data centers by 2027, potentially rising as much as 165% by the end of the decade compared to 2023.

Goldman Sachs also highlighted that large hyperscale cloud providers and corporations developing extensive language models for natural language processing require significant amounts of information and power-intensive processors for training.

Currently, the global data center market consumes about 55 gigawatts of power, with cloud computing workloads accounting for 54%, traditional business functions (like email and storage) at 32%, and AI workloads constituting 14%.

As demand for power from data centers grows, the electric grid will need approximately $720 billion in spending through 2030.

In June 2025, AutoGPT.net, a leading source for breaking news and expert insights on artificial intelligence, published a list of the top 20 AI energy companies transforming the industry.

These companies are leveraging AI to lower carbon emissions and enhance the reliability of clean energy sources such as wind and solar.

The energy sector has become better at predicting energy demand, making renewable resources more accessible by balancing supply and demand while improving grid reliability to reduce power outages.

AutoGPT describes AI as the “brain” of the energy industry.

The top AI energy companies include Siemens Energy, General Electric (GE), Shell AI, BP AI, ExxonMobil AI solutions, Tesla Energy, Iberdrola, Schneider Electric, Enel, Repsol, Duke Energy, E.ON, NextEra Energy, National Grid, Engie, Envision Energy, Xcel Energy, Dominion Energy, Ørsted, and the EDF Group.

Seeking Alpha, a financial services company, noted that growing electricity demand is prompting utilities to invest significantly in grid modernization initiatives.

These efforts involve substantial capital costs, partially funded through significant rate hikes.

Such infrastructure investments are vital for replacing aging systems and meeting the soaring demand from data centers, underscoring the partnership between major tech companies and energy providers.

Moreover, Nvidia and AMD have seen their semiconductor technologies increasingly integrated into nuclear applications, energy management, and radiation detection systems, highlighting the strong relationship between AI and the utilities sector.

Noteworthy AI-utility agreements include a landmark contract between Meta and Constellation Energy, signed in early June, which guarantees nuclear energy for Meta’s data centers.

Additionally, Amazon has secured a contract for 1.9 GW from Talen Energy’s Susquehanna atomic station to support AWS facilities in Pennsylvania.

Recently, Matt Sage shared on social media the importance of reducing power usage in AI data centers during times of grid strain.

He emphasized that Google’s decision to implement this strategy is significant given the rapid growth in size and power demand of data centers.

The AI industry is currently valued at $242 billion, projected to reach $584 billion by 2032.

Utilities are struggling to keep up with this growth and face challenges in passing on billions in additional costs to consumers.

For instance, I&M’s $1.3 billion cost recovery plan was rejected in court.

Google's “back-down” system temporarily halts non-urgent computing tasks, such as processing a YouTube upload, and can redirect these tasks to other data centers.

According to Sage, this method represents more than just minor operational adjustments—it serves as a serious warning.

If the growth of AI and cloud computing remains unchecked, it could create bottlenecks in the electric grid, resulting in lost productivity and increased long-term costs.

Sage suggests that the clear solution is to significantly expand energy storage capacity.

Energy storage acts as a safeguard for uptime; with sufficient battery capacity, data centers could operate smoothly during peak demand periods without needing to throttle services.

Therefore, energy storage is not only crucial for clean energy initiatives but also an essential component of investing in AI and digital infrastructure.",https://www.blackengineer.com/downloads/8581/download/Screenshot%202025-01-08%20at%2010.59.21%E2%80%AFAM.png?cb=a816c343a7ca4f6705623148591dff13&w=1200,N,,2025-08-15 18:04:50.218927

No, this isn’t the setup to an elaborate joke. Instead, it describes the circumstances under which Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe shared some of his company’s upcoming plans. Scaringe appeared on an episode of comedian Daniel Tosh’s podcast Tosh Show and addressed some of the most pressing questions around EVs, including affordability.

Scaringe pointed out that there needs to be more electric options at different price points. “When you move down into that $50,000 price point or around there, there’s really very few choices,” he told Tosh. He described his company’s recent partnership with Volkswagen as being one way of reaching that goal.

It also sounds like Rivian doesn’t plan on building dozens of different models. (As Autoblog’s James Ochoa pointed out, the R2 and R3 are set for release in 2026 and 2027, respectively.) When Tosh asked how large Scaringe saw Rivian’s lineup getting, the CEO suggested their goal was to have “maybe five or six different vehicles.” Scaringe added they are working on the R4 and R5 — though he didn’t reveal much about them on the air — and said, “There may be an R6.”

Battery technology was another area where Scaringe made an interesting point — even if technology allowed for a battery with a range of 500 to 600 miles on a single charge, he anticipated that would translate into smaller, more powerful batteries rather than an EV that could drive from New York to Detroit on a single charge.

Rivian Opens Up Sales of Its Commercial Vans

The EV manufacturer’s exclusive deal with Amazon has come to an end

The conversation was occasionally candid — Tosh is not a fan of Rivian’s existing phone chargers, which he referred to as “garbage.” Scaringe also looked a little shocked when Tosh revealed that he covered up the warning lights inside his Rivian’s cabin. “Those are required by law,” he told the comedian.

Tosh also had a question about another Rivian vehicle, one that might be a little harder for him to get. “Can I get an Amazon truck?” Tosh asked. Scaringe told him he could not, though he then expanded on Rivian’s exclusive arrangement with Amazon.

“We’re selling them to other commercial customers, so if you wanted to run a small logistics service, maybe,” Scaringe said. To Tosh’s stated desire to customize one of them, Scaringe also pointed out that “it’s a great surf van.” Tosh sounded (understandably) intrigued by this. He most certainly wasn’t the only one.","https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rivian-trucks.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-08-15 17:03:46.991605

How the public can comment on possible end to renewable energy mandate There will be three opportunities for the public to speak about the possible repeal of the REST rules.","PHOENIX — Rules that govern how renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are used in Arizona could soon be changing.

The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) voted unanimously Thursday to file a notice to repeal the state’s Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST) rules with the state Secretary of State’s Office.

The notice to repeal must be officially filed by Sept. 19.

The ACC oversees public utilities, such as Arizona Public Service Company (APS) and Tucson Electric Power Company (TEP), sets utility rates and makes sure consumers receive reliable service.

What are the REST rules?

The REST rules, which were enacted in 2006, require utilities to get an increasing portion of their power supplies from renewable sources.

The companies were required to get 15% of their power from environmentally-friendly sources by this year, a mark APS (19%) and TEP (29%) have exceeded, according to the ACC.

Even though commissioners are calling for the REST rules to be repealed, they do not believe that this will be the end of renewable energy in Arizona.

“The idea that the deployment of renewables in Arizona will come to a halt if REST is repealed is doom and gloom fear-mongering at its worst,” ACC Chairman Kevin Thompson said in a press release Thursday.

Commissioner René Lopez said the ACC is still evaluating whether or not to rescind the REST rules.

“We will be treating all forms of power generation equally and renewable sources will be able to stand on their own,” Lopez said in the release. “I continue to believe that even without the REST rules, renewable energy is and will continue to be an integral part of Arizona’s diverse energy portfolio going forward.”

How is ACC justifying ending renewable energy mandate in Arizona?

To justify their case, the ACC highlighted the Solana Generating Station, a solar power plant near Gila Bend. It argued that cases like this have contributed to surcharges totaling over $2 billion on power bills across Arizona over the past 19 years.

The facility began generating power in 2013 and came to an agreement to sell its power to APS for $0.13 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated, the ACC release stated.

However, this is above the norm for APS, which pays an average of $0.02 to $0.03 per kWh generated from other sources, according to the ACC.

Sierra Club calls for renewable energy mandate to remain in place

Advocates for the REST rules staying in effect say the rules have led to $12 billion in investments in renewable energy in Arizona and a 3% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the state.

A press release from the environmental group Sierra Club says Arizona has gained $2 billion in public benefits. These come from using less expensive energy sources instead of coal and natural gas, investing in local businesses, lowering technology costs and reducing air pollution.

“The commission’s misguided and short-sighted efforts to repeal the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules will harm our air, our water, and our health,” Sierra Club Grand Canyon Chapter Director Sandy Bahr said in the release.

“These rules have helped to support significant development of clean, affordable energy sources like solar and wind, which are now among the lowest-cost power sources in Arizona. Clean energy provides thousands of jobs and huge economic and health benefits for our communities,” Bahr added.

How the public can comment on possible end to renewable energy mandate

There will be three opportunities for the public to speak about the possible repeal of the REST rules. The first will be held on Nov. 10 in Tucson, followed by a comment session held over the phone on Nov. 12 and a second in-person meeting in Phoenix on Nov. 13.

Written comments can also be submitted on the ACC website until Nov. 14.",https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 19:01:46.630532

“The energy landscape is evolving rapidly — customer demand is growing, grid operations are becoming more complex, and the orderly transition towards a diversified set of energy resources requires maximizing efficiencies in planning and operation across the entire Carolinas footprint,” Kendal Bowman, North Carolina president for DEC and DEP, said in testimony filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The merger must be approved by the NCUC, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Duke aims to complete the merger on Jan. 1, 2027, with DEC being the remaining utility. DEC and DEP retail rates would be blended over time after the merger is completed, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based utility company said.

Since Duke Energy and Progress Energy merged in 2012, they have dispatched their power plants as if they were a single utility, which, combined with fuel savings and other efficiencies, has saved about $1 billion, according to the company. “But regulations limit further coordination between the two utilities; only a full combination can unlock additional savings,” Duke said.

Combining DEC and DEP enables more efficient resource planning, execution and operations, more balanced investments across a broader customer base, simplified regulatory processes and uniform service offerings, Bowman said.

Those factors could produce about $3.2 billion in cost savings by 2038, Rachel Elliott, director of rates and regulatory planning for DEC, said in testimony filed at the NCUC. About 97% of the estimated cost savings come from the combined utility’s ability to plan, execute and run its system more efficiently, Elliott said. The remaining savings come from corporate administrative savings, she said.

A single utility will be able to more effectively plan and operate new generation and transmission in the Carolinas, partly by locating assets where they make the most sense across a broader footprint, Duke said.

Also, combining the utilities will bolster grid reliability by improving the balancing of distributed generation resources while reducing the need to restrict solar production due to oversupply, grid congestion or lack of demand, Duke said.

Duke expects the merger will cost about $143 million, according to Bowman.

The merger would change cost allocations among customers, so that its costs would outweigh the near-term benefits for Duke’s retail customers in South Carolina, according to Bowman. As a result, Duke proposed a “Share the Benefits” plan that calls for North Carolina retail customers and Duke’s wholesale customers to temporarily contribute a portion of their savings to South Carolina retail customers, she said.

Duke’s wholesale customers have agreed to contribute $55 million a year over five years to South Carolina retail customers and North Carolina retail customers would contribute $25 million annually over six years, Bowman said. Without the contributions, South Carolina regulators would probably reject the merger, she said.

DEC owns 20,800 MW and has 2.9 million customers in North Carolina and South Carolina and DEP owns 13,800 MW and has 1.8 million customers in the two states, according to Duke.

A bit of context and history: The 20-year agreement with Microsoft paved the way to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1, which ""operated at industry-leading levels of safety and reliability for decades before being shut down for economic reasons"" in 2019, according to Constellation. In 1979, there was a partial nuclear meltdown of the Unit 2 reactor at the Three Mile Island facility. ""This was the most serious accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history, although its small radioactive releases had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public,"" according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Unit 2 is permanently shut down.

Constellation also recently agreed to provide 20 years of power from an Illinois nuclear plant to support the data centers of Facebook parent Meta Platforms.

The stock is worth a look

Constellation reported second-quarter results last week and both earnings and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations. Earnings of $1.91 per share were 13% higher than a year ago. Revenue jumped 11.4% to $6.1 billion. The power company also announced a 94% capacity rate for its reactors -- the amount of time they operate at maximum power output -- which is among the highest in the industry.

And management is determined to support the stock. It just repurchased $400 million worth of shares. The stock is up 46% year to date as of market close on Thursday and 75% over the past 52 weeks. Constellation's market cap is about $106 billion and its price-to-earnings ratio is around 34.

Yes, that P/E ratio is a bit high for a power utility. But consider what you're getting as an investor: a power company that has basically transcended its category. Constellation is increasingly viewed not as a boring utility, but instead as an AI-adjacent stock because of its deals to provide clean nuclear energy to AI-centric companies like those in the ""Magnificent Seven.""

Nuclear energy is hotter than ever, and now is the time to own a piece of it. Constellation Energy is worth a look.

Dharna Noor reports for The Guardian.

In short:

Climate scientists, led by Texas A&M’s Andrew Dessler, are organizing a public comment to rebut a Department of Energy report that questions the dangers of fossil fuels and supports ending the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine launched a self-funded, fast-tracked review of greenhouse gas impacts on human health, aiming to deliver its findings before the EPA finalizes its decision.

The Trump administration has deleted climate data from government websites and removed agency officials, prompting watchdog groups to safeguard and repost public science data.

Key quote:

“Attacks on science are dangerous because they erode one of society’s most effective tools for understanding the world and making decisions in the public interest.”

— Andrew Dessler, climate researcher at Texas A&M University

Why this matters:

Climate science is a cornerstone of environmental regulation in the U.S., especially under the Clean Air Act, which allows the EPA to act when pollutants endanger public health. Fossil fuel emissions — particularly carbon dioxide and methane — are deeply tied to climate change, which affects air quality, food systems, extreme weather, and infectious disease risks.

NC Newsline

The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.

As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.

“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”

Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.

“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.

“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”

But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.

“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”

Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.

State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.

But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.

Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”

While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.

“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.

A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.

“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.

Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.

“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”

Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.

“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.

Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.

Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.

“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”

Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.

“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”",https://caro.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pexels-pixabay-356036-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 09:02:12.659917

“A more robust domestic supply chain means more good jobs and more affordable energy for our communities,” said Alisa Petersen, Federal Policy Manager with RMI. “Making the subcomponents we need for solar energy here at home ensures clean energy is more reliable and accessible. This map is a great resource for understanding the gaps, so we know how and where to grow U.S. manufacturing for the solar industry.”

The United States currently has no capacity to produce polysilicon ingots and wafers, and very little capacity to produce solar cells. The country also has limited manufacturing capacity for other solar panel components like flat glass and power optimizers, meeting less than 25% of the demand for projected solar installations.

Effort supports the intent of South Carolina leaders to address growth by continuing to operate proven electricity capacity in the state

GREENVILLE, S.C., Aug. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy has announced its submission of the final license application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Station, located near Salem, S.C. The application, if approved, would extend the plant's operations for an additional 50 years.

A flexible, dynamic, efficient and emission-free way to store and deliver large quantities of energy, pumped storage hydro plants store and generate energy by moving water between two reservoirs at different elevations. Located in Oconee County, S.C., Bad Creek is designed to produce significant amounts of energy when our customers need it most, performing a vital role as the largest ""battery"" on the company's system since 1991.

Why it matters: As part of the company's responsibility to serve nearly 860,000 retail electric customers across South Carolina, Duke Energy needs to not only build large amounts of new generation but also extend the lives of those proven workhorse facilities like Bad Creek and the company's existing nuclear fleet to support the economic success and growth the state is experiencing.

Duke Energy recently completed upgrades to the four units at the Bad Creek pumped storage facility in Salem, S.C. The upgrades add a total of 320 megawatts of carbon-free energy to the company's system, increasing the total capacity of the station to 1,680 megawatts.

This commitment to relicense the Bad Creek facility reflects the investments the company is making to maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

Next steps: The current operating license for the project expires in July 2027 and Duke Energy consulted with more than 70 stakeholders to propose a new license that would run for another 50 years.

Duke Energy expects a decision on our operating license application from FERC in 2027, before the original license expires.

What they're saying:

U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs: ""Bad Creek is a cornerstone of South Carolina's energy infrastructure and a testament to the kind of smart, long-term investment our state needs. I'm proud to support Duke Energy's efforts to extend operations at this critical facility. This project will help power our communities, support economic growth, and ensure a reliable, affordable energy future for families and businesses across the Upstate.""

Duke Energy South Carolina President Tim Pearson: ""Extending the life of this 'marvel in the mountain' has been a significant part of our planning for the future for many years. Our commitment to keep a proven asset like Bad Creek online for decades to come while also bringing a diverse portfolio of new generating resources to the grid reflects the direction our state's leaders have made clear is the right path forward to support a reliable, affordable and resilient energy future for South Carolina.""

Reported earlier in the summer, B.C. Ferries refused to let a tow truck with a damaged EV battery board a vessel, citing a risk with the lithium-ion batteries.

The new policy left plenty of owners, as well as experts and technicians, scratching their heads, as it could leave thousands of vehicles stranded at the Gulf Islands or on the Sunshine Coast.

B.C. Ferries announced the policy in June 2025, but it is still confusing customers nearly two months later.

What EV owners have to deal with from the new policy

The company has been concerned about the potential for a catastrophe if a damaged EV battery gets onboard

B.C. Ferries believes that there could be a risk of combustion in damaged lithium-ion batteries.

The tow truck stopped from boarding one of its vessels had it not been involved in any accident.

To clarify its position, a company spokesperson said in June that ‘EVs can still travel with us.’

But that hasn’t stopped customers from being confused.

Talking to the Vancouver Sun, Squamish EV owner Bod Porter said that the move would ‘make people paranoid.’

Not helping matters is that the policy is a blanket approach, meaning it’s not clear what vehicles are classed as safe or not.

Who will police the new ferry policy?

Electric vehicle owners are now wondering what these battery concerns mean for them.

One question being asked is who determines if their vehicles are safe or not.

Given how so many other systems could go wrong with an EV, it leaves plenty of questions unanswered.

Jonathan Vipond, the owner of Salt Spring Island Towing, recently spoke about what repairs would be involved to make an electric car safe to travel.

He said that simple repairs could be undertaken on the Gulf Islands.

However, more complex repairs will be required sometimes, and they would need to be done at a dealership, a ferry ride away.

It is easy to see why so many have been left confused by the situation.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1200x750-56.webp,N,,2025-08-15 19:04:34.420775

The rates for American Transmission Co. have gone up 43% since 2019 while the consumer price index has increased 27% over that time, according to the Ratepayer Protection Coalition.

“All the state’s investor-owned utilities have announced unprecedented levels of new capital expenditure plans.

That demand for power is leading to both a push for new and reliable energy sources for the future – including a nuclear siting plan – and projections that the average American’s energy bill could increase from 25% to 70% in the next 10 years without intervention from policymakers, according to Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Jack Kemp Foundation.

Badger Institute has pushed for Wisconsin to prioritize and become a national leader in nuclear energy to fulfill the impending energy demand.

Along with Port Washington, the group also highlighted the plans in Mount Pleasant, Beaver Dam, Caledonia and potential projects in Vienna and Janesville, where the city is looking for a data center company to take over the city-owned 240-acre former General Motors Assembly Plant, vacant since 2008.

Meanwhile, state lawmakers have exempted data center construction materials from taxes and are looking to make a statewide exception to its tax increment financing rules, which limit a municipality from having more than 12% of the entity’s property tax value in a TIF.

Amid this backdrop, the merger between Motiv Power and Workhorse Group Inc. stands out as a strategic masterstroke with the potential to redefine the medium-duty EV landscape. By evaluating the synergies, capital structure, and market positioning of the combined entity, investors can assess whether this merger offers a compelling entry point into a high-growth industry.

Strategic Synergies: Building a Category Leader

The merger between Motiv Power and Workhorse is not merely a consolidation of assets but a deliberate effort to create a vertically integrated, scalable platform in the medium-duty EV segment. Motiv's strengths lie in its diverse product portfolio—ranging from Class 4–6 electric trucks—and its established relationships with major fleets, including Amazon and FedEx. Workhorse, on the other hand, brings manufacturing capabilities, a national dealer network, and a proven track record in producing electric delivery vehicles like the W56 step van.

The combined entity will offer a full suite of electric trucks tailored for urban logistics, last-mile delivery, and municipal services—segments projected to grow at a 36.16% CAGR through 2030. By leveraging Motiv's software-defined vehicle architecture and Workhorse's production infrastructure, the merger aims to reduce unit costs by 20% and achieve $20 million in cost synergies by 2026. These efficiencies are critical in an industry where total cost of ownership (TCO) parity with diesel vehicles remains a key selling point.

Capital Structure and Liquidity: A Path to Financial Stability

One of the most compelling aspects of this merger is its focus on simplifying Workhorse's complex capital structure. The company's recent $20 million sale-leaseback of its Indiana manufacturing facility and a $5 million convertible note have significantly improved liquidity, enabling it to pay down debt owed to its senior secured lender. Post-merger, the combined entity will have a cleaner balance sheet, with only a $5 million convertible note outstanding—a fraction of the debt burden that previously constrained growth.

Crucially, the merger is backed by a $20 million debt financing commitment from Motiv's controlling investor, including a $10 million revolving credit facility and an asset-based lending (ABL) facility to fund production. This financing structure provides flexibility to scale manufacturing while minimizing dilution for existing shareholders. For investors, this represents a de-risked path to execution, as the combined company avoids the capital-intensive pitfalls that have plagued many EV startups.

Market Positioning: Competing in a Consolidating Industry

The U.S. electric truck market is highly consolidated, with global giants like BYD, Tesla, and Rivian dominating headlines. However, the medium-duty segment remains underserved, with niche players like Motiv and Workhorse filling a critical gap. The merged entity's focus on Class 4–6 trucks aligns with the sector's fastest-growing applications, including urban delivery and municipal fleets.

Moreover, the merger positions the company to capitalize on the Inflation Reduction Act's $1 billion in EV incentives and California's aggressive zero-emission mandates. With Scott Griffith, Motiv's CEO, at the helm, the combined company is poised to leverage its existing fleet relationships and expand into new markets. Rick Dauch's transition to an advisory role also ensures continuity in navigating the regulatory and operational challenges of the EV sector.

Investment Implications: A High-Conviction Play

For investors seeking early entry into the EV truck sector, the Motiv-Workhorse merger offers a unique combination of strategic alignment, financial discipline, and market timing. The transaction's expected closure in Q4 2025, pending shareholder approval, provides a clear timeline for value realization. Additionally, the $20 million in post-merger debt financing and plans for further equity raises suggest the company is well-positioned to fund its growth without overleveraging.

However, risks remain. The EV truck market is highly competitive, with established players like Ford and GM rapidly scaling production. Execution risks, such as delays in manufacturing or supply chain bottlenecks, could also impact the merger's success. That said, the combined entity's focus on medium-duty trucks—a segment with less direct competition from legacy automakers—mitigates some of these concerns.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future of Freight

The merger between Motiv Power and Workhorse is more than a survival play for two struggling EV startups—it's a calculated move to build a category leader in a sector primed for explosive growth. By combining Motiv's innovation with Workhorse's operational expertise, the new entity is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the $13.92 billion U.S. electric truck market by 2030. For investors willing to bet on the future of freight, this merger represents a rare opportunity to align with a company that's not just riding the EV wave but helping to shape it.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-15 18:05:11.696347

Since mid-June, residents in the Columbine Hills area of Littleton have experienced six outages, two of which lasted more than four hours. Many say they've received little explanation as to why.

At Columbine Wines and Liquors, employee Peggy Welton is doing everything she can to keep the lights on, quite literally.

""We have our handheld flashlights still handy dandy,"" Welton said. ""If you have to go into the cooler or anything, it's dark. We've got our lanterns!""

Welton has also taken on the responsibility of firing up the store's generator whenever the power cuts out.

""If the power completely goes out, I can't take credit cards. I have nothing. Once this system goes down, I can't even get into the cash drawer,"" she said.

Just one street over, Catherine VonMinden works from home. When the power goes out, she loses more than just lights.

""If I'm out, my whole team has to pick up the slack. I lose hours, I lose money,"" she said. ""My partner is on conference calls all day, doing things, so it's a big deal.""

According to Xcel Energy, the Columbine Hills neighborhood has experienced six outages since mid-June, ranging from about one hour to nearly five hours. The causes of the two most recent outages remain undetermined.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the company says in part, ""While most outages are out of our control, such as weather events, animal contact or damage due to lines being struck, we make every effort to investigate and remedy those causes that are related to our equipment. In this case, we are inspecting the lines using drones and other technology and determining next steps for ensuring reliability.""

These recent outages come just months after the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) placed Xcel on an improvement plan.

The move followed an investigation launched last fall into widespread complaints about outages and customer service problems. That investigation revealed a significant spike in outages and major concerns about how customers were being treated.

The chair of the commission, Erick Blank, was shocked by the findings.

""This is a regulated monopoly operating in a legally defined service territory where competition is prohibited,"" the chair said. ""And in return for that privilege of operating as a monopoly, they shouldn't be driving profit increases at the expense of customers. Aren't they obligated to act in the public interest; answer the phone, bill customers properly, and respond to outages?"" he said during an April 30th meeting.

Xcel is now required to submit quarterly updates to the state on both outages and customer service improvements. The first of those reports was submitted in July. According to Xcel, the company has made progress in both areas.

But some customers remain skeptical.

“This is a huge win for Kansas ranchers and energy producers,” Kansas Attorney Kris Kobach, who joined in the lawsuit challenging the designation, said in a statement Friday.

… “I applaud the court’s decision as a major step forward in ending the years-long attack on farmers, ranchers, and energy producers across Texas.","A Biden-era endangered species designation that critics said would hamstring American energy and agricultural production has been struck down by a federal judge.

U.S. District Judge David Counts of Texas this week overturned the Biden U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2022 listing of the lesser prairie chicken under the Endangered Species Act.

“Fish and Wildlife Service,” says one news report, “admitted in the case that it erred in creating two distinct populations of lesser prairie chickens, and it failed to justify the classification of the two distinct population segments — northern and southern, Counts said.”

The ruling is especially good news for Kansas’ vital oil and agriculture industries, as reports estimate some 70% of lesser prairie chickens are in the Sunflower State.

“This is a huge win for Kansas ranchers and energy producers,” Kansas Attorney Kris Kobach, who joined in the lawsuit challenging the designation, said in a statement Friday. “The listing of the species as threatened or endangered would have crippled oil and wind energy production and would have limited where and when Kansas ranchers could graze cattle on their own property.

“And it was based on manipulated numbers dividing the species into subgroups to create the impression the species was threatened—when in fact drought had simply caused populations in some areas to drop, while in other areas the numbers were stable. I’m grateful that the court saw it our way.”

Texas Congressman August Pfluger joined in the delight over the ruling, saying in a statement:

“The Biden Administration’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service weaponized the Endangered Species Act to target American energy production in the Permian Basin, using species like the Lesser Prairie Chicken as one of their tools. These listings were completely misguided, ignoring the vigilant conservation efforts already underway in West Texas. …

“I applaud the court’s decision as a major step forward in ending the years-long attack on farmers, ranchers, and energy producers across Texas. We can – and must – protect important species without sacrificing the livelihoods of our local and rural communities that power our nation.”

“Under the Biden Administration,” Pfluger’s office writes, “the Lesser Prairie Chicken was listed as an endangered species, ignoring the conservation efforts already being made by Texas and Kansas farmers, ranchers, and agricultural and energy producers. The efforts resulted in net acreage conservation gains for the Dunes Sagebrush Lizards’ habitat and increased the Lesser Prairie Chicken population.”

In April, Pfluger and Kansas Rep. Tracey Mann had written a letter asking the Trump administration to lift the endangered species listing for both the the lesser prairie chicken and the dunes sagebrush lizard, the latter of which straddles the Texas/New Mexico border.

“These designations,” their letter reads, “have imposed unnecessary regulatory burdens on our rural communities, threatening the vital work of hardworking farmers, ranchers, and energy producers while disregarding the proven success of the state and privately led conservation efforts.”",https://heartlandernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/lesser-prairie-chicken.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 16:03:56.908060

(Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or the “Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, and Motiv Electric Trucks (“Motiv”), a leading manufacturer of medium-duty electric trucks and buses, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to combine in a transaction that will create a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, following the completion of the all-stock transaction, Motiv’s controlling investor will become the majority owner of the combined company and Workhorse shareholders will maintain a significant equity stake. In connection with the merger agreement, Workhorse has completed a sale leaseback (“SLB”) and obtained convertible note financing. The transactions value the combined company at approximately $105 million.1

The combination brings together two innovators in the medium-duty electric vehicle space to better serve a blue-chip customer base and enhance value for shareholders. Building on the companies’ complementary platforms, the combined business will be a leader in the $23 billion medium-duty truck segment2 with a full range of Class 4-6 trucks. The companies believe that together, they will benefit from increased scale, an expanded product portfolio and enhanced operational efficiencies to support lower unit costs while optimizing total cost of ownership (TCO) for customers.

The combined company is expected to have a strengthened financial profile with a simplified capital structure and the financial resources to capture anticipated demand from the ongoing transition to clean energy and better help customers decarbonize their fleets.

Following the closing of the transaction, Scott Griffith, Motiv CEO, is expected to serve as CEO of the combined company and Rick Dauch, Workhorse CEO, is expected to serve as an advisor to the combined company.

“Bringing together two leading OEMs in the medium-duty space strengthens our ability to reduce the cost of electric trucks and make the total cost of ownership even more compelling,” said Scott Griffith, CEO of Motiv. “We believe this is a coming-of-age moment—not just for Motiv and Workhorse, but for the industry as a whole, and that widespread adoption of medium-duty electric trucks will come from achieving cost parity vs. ICE and diesel trucks and offering compelling long-term value. That’s exactly what we’re focused on delivering with this merger, and with a combined more than 17 million miles under our belt, we believe the transaction will put us in a strong starting position to deliver on this vision. I’m excited by the opportunity to lead the combined company, work closely with the Motiv and Workhorse teams to capture the opportunities ahead, and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which our trucks operate.”

“This transaction represents a significant milestone for Workhorse, our customers, our stakeholders and our shareholders,” said Rick Dauch, CEO of Workhorse. “By combining with Motiv and completing the related transactions, we are creating a broader product offering, strengthening our near- and long-term financial position and providing Workhorse shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the upside of a leader in the medium-duty EV commercial vehicle market. We believe Motiv is the right partner to support the advancement of our combined product roadmap and capture new growth opportunities. Together, we are confident we will be even better positioned to win the commercial EV transition and create value for shareholders.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits

Workhorse and Motiv believe that the investments made into their respective businesses position the combined company to have the sector’s most scalable manufacturing, most advanced and road-tested products, and most wide-reaching go-to-market networks. As a result, the companies believe the transaction will provide significant benefits to customers and shareholders by:

Creating a category leader positioned for rapid innovation and scalable growth. Joining Motiv’s diverse product portfolio and top fleet relationships with Workhorse’s proven vehicles, manufacturing capabilities and national dealer network is expected to create a platform for long-term growth. Workhorse’s Union City facility has the capacity to eventually produce up to 5,000 trucks per year.

Leveraging combined scale and strengths to reduce unit costs. Workhorse and Motiv believe that the combined company will compete more effectively with the industry’s pure-play electric and legacy OEMs. Workhorse and Motiv believe the combined company will capitalize on new opportunities to serve more customers with a more competitively advantaged electric offering than gas/diesel trucks and buses on a TCO basis.

Joining complementary customer bases. Workhorse and Motiv believe the next phase of large-scale adoption of medium-duty electric trucks in North America will be driven by national-scale commercial fleets with tested and piloted multi-depot EV truck operations. Together, Motiv and Workhorse have served 10 of the largest medium-duty fleets in North America3, positioning the combined company to expand adoption through these existing relationships with likely early scalers.

Establishing a strong financial foundation. The companies believe that the transaction strengthens the combined company’s financial position and creates opportunities for margin expansion, enabling greater flexibility to pursue future growth initiatives. With a simplified capital structure, the combined company also expects to be better positioned to raise additional capital post-close.

Presenting significant synergy opportunities. The companies believe there is the potential to achieve at least $20 million of cost synergies, including through R&D, G&A, and facility cost-reductions by the end of 2026. The combined companies also intend to utilize a product and engineering approach to maximize the use of common software, hardware, and IP across its Class 4-6 platforms to pursue additional cost savings, an enhanced technology baseline and a best-in-class customer experience with limited downtime and optimized TCO.

Transaction Details

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Motiv will be merged with a newly created subsidiary of Workhorse in exchange for newly issued shares of Workhorse common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, on a fully diluted basis, Motiv’s controlling investor initially will own approximately 62.5% of the combined company, Workhorse shareholders will own approximately 26.5% and Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender will have rights to receive common stock that represent approximately 11%, all of which are subject to certain potential adjustments and additional future dilution. Pursuant to the transaction, certain stockholders of Motiv, to the extent they are also holders of financial indebtedness of Motiv, agreed to cancel their financial indebtedness to Motiv in exchange for Workhorse common stock. Additional information regarding Workhorse’s agreement with its secured lender and select other parties will be available in the Company’s SEC filings.

In connection with the proposed merger transaction, Workhorse also completed two transactions with entities affiliated with Motiv’s controlling investor: the SLB transaction for Workhorse’s Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility for $20 million and the secured, convertible note financing for $5 million, each of which were consummated at the time of execution with the merger agreement. These transactions are expected to provide near-term liquidity to fund Workhorse’s operations through closing and to provide capital to pay down debt owed to Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender. At closing of the merger, all remaining indebtedness to such lender, including all warrants currently held by the lender, will be repaid and/or cancelled, with the only remaining secured indebtedness of the combined companies being the $5 million secured, convertible note held by Motiv’s controlling investor, which may convert to equity in connection with post-closing financing.

In addition, the merger agreement includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s controlling investor will provide $20 million in debt financing at the completion of the transaction, of which approximately $10 million is expected to be available in a revolving credit facility and an additional $10 million is expected to be available to fund manufacturing costs associated with confirmed purchase orders of the combined company in an ABL facility. The combined company also will seek to raise additional equity financing to fund its go forward strategic execution.

Timing and Approvals

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to Workhorse shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions, including the debt financing commitment noted above.

According to TIPRO’s analysis, direct Texas upstream employment for July totaled 205,200, a decline of 1,400 industry positions from revised June employment numbers. This represented an increase of 200 jobs in oil and gas extraction and a decrease of 1,600 jobs in the services sector. As communicated in previous reports, TIPRO says fluctuations in monthly employment are normal and subject to revisions with CES data, also noting that demand for talent in the Texas upstream sector remains high.

TIPRO’s new workforce data indicated strong job postings for the Texas oil and natural gas industry. According to the association, there were 8,853 active unique jobs postings for the Texas oil and natural gas industry last month, compared to 8,457 postings in June, and 3,840 new postings, compared to 3,533 in the previous month. In comparison, the state of Pennsylvania had 3,089 unique job postings in July, followed by California (2,641), Ohio (2,515), and Illinois (2,035). TIPRO reported a total of 57,472 unique job postings nationwide last month within the oil and natural gas sector, compared to 51,661 in June, including 26,666 new postings, representing an increase of 4,805 in new employment opportunities.

The top four companies ranked by unique job postings in July were Love’s (689), Energy Transfer (348), ExxonMobil (303), and Halliburton (287), according to the association. Of the top ten companies listed by unique job postings last month, four companies were in the services sector, two midstream companies, one in the gasoline stations with convenience stores category, one petroleum refinery company, one in oil and natural gas extraction, and one fully integrated oil and natural gas company.

TIPRO also points to the strong tax contributions made by the state's oil and gas industry that continue to offer critical support of government coffers and provide important sources of funding for public services and programs that include Texas’ public schools and universities, roads, first responders and other essential services. Texas energy producers in July paid $433 million in oil production taxes, according to the Texas comptroller’s office. Last month, producers also paid $178 million to the state in natural gas production taxes, up 8 percent from July 2024.

Additionally, TIPRO highlights recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude oil production in Texas grew to 5.752 million bpd in May, up from 5.751 million bpd pumped in April. Natural gas production in the Lone Star State last month also held steady at 36.75 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), data from the EIA showed, hovering near record levels of output.",https://www.worldoil.com/media/juqjc00m/newsletter-oil-workers-stock.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 16:04:08.398022

China, which seeks to challenge the U.S. in other energy categories such as renewables and battery storage, now claims new heights in its work on virtual power plant (VPP) technology. State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Co. this week has reported a new VPP demand response which achieved 1.163 million kWH of load adjustment during a peak demand with record temperatures in China.

Virtual power plants aggregate tens, hundreds or even thousands of DERs into a single, dispatchable resource that can either reduce load or create supply during times of peak demand, helping the grid to stay in balance. In the State Grid Shanghai case, the utility aggregated resource generation from 47 operators, which included data centers, HVAC and EV charging stations (pictured).

Demand response technology utilizing digitalization not only deploys distributed energy resources into the grid, but also adjusts the load from customers through devices controlling thermostats, lighting, heating and cooling.

The program is called Solar for All and it was supposed to send more than $156 million dollars to Michigan’s Solar for All program. The now canceled program planned to invest in things like rooftop and community solar projects, energy storage and workforce development.

For a look at how the cancellation of the program will affect Michigan residents, we reached out to the director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy Phil Roos. He spoke with Michigan Public’s Caoilinn Goss.

Caoilinn Goss: EGLE had already announced 13 pilot projects across the state and assigned $13.9 million in funding. Could you tell us more about some of those specific projects and what will happen to them now?

Phil Roos: Yeah, so we had projects across the state. Some in urban areas, some in more rural areas. The City of Ann Arbor, in Washtenaw County, there was a grant for the Bryant neighborhood to install solar power and storage at 20 households there. There's Cadillac solar power and storage at the wastewater treatment plant and solar power plant there. In Metro Detroit, we have in Highland Park and Detroit retrofitting homes with rooftops, solar battery storage, weatherization and high efficiency dual-fuel cold-climate heat pumps. And the idea was to scale that ultimately to 100 homes. These are programs that would make a real difference in the lives of the people that can benefit from them most. Save them energy costs, create jobs along the way, and allow people all over the state who need it the most to be able to enjoy the benefits of solar energy.

CG: What's going to happen next to these programs?

PR: What we're hoping to do, we're working with the Attorney General's office to figure out a response to this. There are several possibilities, but we'll be sharing that when we know it.

CG: Are any of these projects in process and half-built or anything like that?

PR: No, early stages on all of them. Much of the work that had been done was the administrative efforts to organize the program, do the planning. And then it was quite a bit of work in working with these communities. We had [Request for Proposals] that they responded to, and then we worked with applicants on their applications. And then we did the awards for a number of those, the $13 million and change that you mentioned. So I don't know if I'd say thankfully, but there hasn't been a lot of funds spent on directly starting the programs. We were about to do that.

CG: So that $13.9 million - some of it, it sounds like has already been spent. Do you as a State Department need to pay that back to the EPA? How does that work?

PR: We have had some of that - I think it's around $1 million or so of the $156 million - we have received reimbursement for. So I think for us right now, there isn't really an issue for work that has already been incurred, getting reimbursed for that. The issue would be if there were further work completed.

CG: As you mentioned, solar energy can improve reliability and help residents save money. The department estimates that the Solar for All program would have saved participants, on average, $400 per year. Is EGLE pursuing other sources of funding to help Michiganders access this cost saving technology.

PR: Well, you know, $156 million is a lot to make up. But we are going to continue with our goals of making solar energy accessible to people around the state, particularly those who need it the most, and creating the ecosystem around that. That can create good quality local jobs. And certainly we will look for and be open to any opportunities to continue funding, but we hope we can get this program reinstated.

CG: To your point that the program would have stimulated the state economy and created jobs and increased Michigan's energy independence, can you talk about some other consequences that we might see now that the EPA has cut the funding?

PR: I'd like to just amplify your last point about energy independence. We are in, last I heard, a declared national energy emergency. And it just seems like cutting a program like this, that actually increases our energy independence while lowering costs for thousands of Michigan households, that should be prioritized, not cut. We all have experienced power outages due to extreme weather or other reasons, and the Solar for All Program is a way to buffer against some of those outages. Make us more independent, not less. Give us more energy, not less. And that's why it's really hard to understand why a program like this would be cut at this point.

CG: Are there other programs in the state to help Michiganders afford solar energy technology?

PR: I believe there may be some IRS related programs, I don't know the details on those, that may give credits or breaks for folks. But that's the only one that comes to mind. I will say that part of this general effort that we, in the state of Michigan, have as part of our MI Healthy Climate Plan implementation, is another program called Home Energy Rebates, which is not specifically targeted to solar, but it's targeted to other kinds of similar benefits that result in people saving money on their energy bills. It's rebates for things like home weatherization, or buying heat pumps to electrify and make more energy efficient homes. So there are other efforts that attack the broader problem, but not specific to solar right now, that I'm aware of.

CG: Part of the reasoning the EPA has given for cutting the program is that there were several different entities that the money moved through before it got to the states, and they were suggesting a good amount of waste or abuse there. Can you speak to that?

PR: I honestly don't know what they're talking about. There's not waste in this program. We submitted a grant that had all the controls and all the steps and the and the strategy for deploying the funds and getting the most benefit from them. That was all laid out in the contract that we had with the EPA. And I just think they're reneging on that.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f91d1d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7360x3864+0+321/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2F4b%2F34b63b394d4abc090564418ee6be%2Fadobestock-177493788.jpeg,N,,2025-08-15 20:03:43.655904

For low solar outfit facilities, which is considered a facility with a maximum net output of not greater than 1.5 megawatt, the 5% safe harbor remains an option.

Following passage of the GOP’s tax law disbanding most of the credits over several years, President Donald Trump ordered Treasury to revise guidance related to construction rules so they’re not circumvented, “including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of the subject facility has been built.”

The order came after House conservative holdouts agreed to back the GOP’s massive tax-and-spending law following negotiations with Trump on the approach to enforcing the end of the credits.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/c195746/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F84%2Fbc%2Fa859a3be45af9cf70f7e7f9d4634%2F392275080.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 16:02:22.819205

At issue was how the Trump administration planned to define whether a project had sufficiently “started construction” to lock in tax credits before the phaseout next year. Under current rules, developers qualified for the projects after spending at least 5% of the planned cost by a certain deadline. After the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last month and dramatically shortened that deadline to next July 4, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Internal Revenue Service to tighten the eligibility rules on wind and solar projects even further.

A leaked proposal, obtained by Latitude Media on Friday, eliminates the 5% spending level and requires that projects start physical construction. But the document shows that the new rules would allow the work to begin offsite, and maintain a four-year “safe harbor” period rather than slashing the window in which construction would need to be completed.

The OBBB’s restrictions on solar panels containing overseas materials still significantly limit developers’ access to cheaper, imported modules. But the law left the 45X tax credit for clean manufacturing largely untouched, signaling Republicans’ support for continuing to reshore solar manufacturing. On Friday, shares in manufacturers such as First Solar and Enphase surged by more than 13% each. Developers such as Sunrun, meanwhile, skyrocketed by more than 30%.

“If this is the final guidance, yes, I would consider this a positive for solar manufacturers,” an industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Latitude Media. “This should allow a substantial number of developers to continue to seed the domestic content incentive and should incentivize them to sign domestic content purchase contracts.” The source said overall they were “cautiously optimistic.”

A note from Citi analysts to investors confirmed that the bullish turn for solar stocks was driven by the Treasury document.

The guidance, which is due out on Monday, could still change over the weekend. Over the past few weeks, the Trump administration has enacted a sweeping series of policy changes disfavoring renewable energy. That included de-designating millions of acres of ocean for offshore wind development, canceling approvals for the Lava Ridge wind farm in Idaho, and launching a review at the Department of the Interior to weed out any policies that boost wind and solar.

In recent weeks, some sources speculated to Latitude Media that the upcoming Treasury guidance could follow a similar trajectory by, for example, requiring developers to spend 51% or more of the cost of the project upfront to qualify for tax credits. But the industry group Advanced Energy United criticized the leaked draft on Friday, saying the proposal would “eliminate long-standing precedent for how companies demonstrate they’ve begun project development.”

“At a time when we need energy abundance, these rules create new federal red tape,” Heather O’Neill, Advanced Energy United’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. “These rules will make it more difficult and expensive to build and finance critical energy projects in the U.S. that are needed to power homes, small businesses, and new manufacturing and industry dependent on reliable and affordable energy.”

Trump’s executive order to restrict access to the tax credits came in response to demands from hardline conservatives in the House of Representatives, who threatened to withhold votes on the OBBB unless the White House tightened the screws on wind and solar development.

But in recent days, top GOP Senate including Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, kicked off a public lobbying campaign urging the president against enacting restrictions that would effectively kill most solar and wind projects at a moment when electricity demand is growing.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-24-1024x683.png,N,,2025-08-15 15:02:16.568983

EWEC will be the sole procurer of the plant’s output under a long-term power purchase agreement.
Under its Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, the country has committed to a 47% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to 2019 levels.
While the Al Nouf IPP will not initially be equipped with carbon capture, its design will allow for the technology to be added in future.","Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC) has issued a request for proposals for the development of the Al Nouf Independent Power Producer (IPP), set to be the UAE’s largest single-site carbon-capture-ready combined cycle gas turbine plant.

Located within the new Al Nouf Complex in coastal Abu Dhabi, the facility will have a generation capacity of up to 3.3 GW and is designed for high efficiency, operational flexibility, and reduced emissions, according to EWEC.

It will also be integrated with seawater-cooled power generation and reverse osmosis desalination, with infrastructure to support future large-scale energy and water projects.

The project will be procured under EWEC’s IPP model, with the successful developer or consortium to hold up to 40% equity, while the remaining stake will be indirectly owned by the Abu Dhabi Government. EWEC will be the sole procurer of the plant’s output under a long-term power purchase agreement.

Commercial operations are targeted for the third quarter of 2029. Proposals are due by the fourth quarter of 2025, and EWEC has already reserved gas turbines to align with the UAE Energy Strategy 2050 and expedite mobilisation.

Ahmed Ali Alshamsi, CEO of EWEC, said, “The development of Al Nouf power plant is a key component of EWEC’s long-term strategy to deliver a flexible, efficient, and decarbonised energy system.”

“As we accelerate the integration of renewable and clean energy into the grid, advanced natural gas-fired capacity will play an essential role in ensuring system reliability and balancing intermittency.”

The UAE remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with around 72% of its electricity generated from oil and gas as of 2023, while 28% came from low-carbon sources including nuclear, solar, and wind.

Per capita energy-related CO2 emissions stood at 7.6 tonnes, more than four times the global average. Under its Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, the country has committed to a 47% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to 2019 levels.

By 2031, 44% of its energy mix is expected to come from alternative sources including renewables and nuclear, alongside 38% from gas, 12% from clean coal, and 6% from nuclear.

While the Al Nouf IPP will not initially be equipped with carbon capture, its design will allow for the technology to be added in future. Combined cycle gas turbine plants fitted with post-combustion carbon capture are designed to capture more than 90% of CO2 emissions, a target reflected in projects such as the planned Net Zero Teesside Power station in the UK.

Although this capture rate has been achieved in pilot and demonstration settings, it has yet to be proven at long-term commercial scale for gas-fired generation. Globally, most new facilities are built to be carbon-capture-ready to enable retrofits as the technology and supporting infrastructure mature.

At gasworld’s MENA Industrial Gases Conference in Abu Dhabi held in November 2024, speakers noted increasing regional activity in decarbonisation technologies, including hydrogen, ammonia, carbon capture, and specialty gases.

Leopold,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/summarizing-newly-issued-executive-order-unleashing-american-energy,"Hours after being inaugurated for his second term, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order entitled Unleashing American Energy.
President Trump withdraws all 12 Executive Orders issued by President Biden related to climate change, environmental justice, EVs, the Inflation Reduction Act, and sustainability as well as terminates the American Climate Corps.
The Executive Order additionally disbands the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases and the guidance documents promulgated thereunder.
The Executive Order also targets funding appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and requires the immediate pause on the disbursement of any additional funds under the Acts.
The Department of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications and approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible.","Hours after being inaugurated for his second term, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order entitled Unleashing American Energy. The Executive Order broadly states that it is the policy of the United States to encourage energy exploration and production on Federal lands and waters, ensure continuous energy supply, as well as establish the country as the leading producer of nonfuel minerals.

The Executive Order aims to increase domestically produced energy supply, while also establishing a number of key policy directions to reform demand side energy policy, including eliminating electric vehicle (“EV”) mandates, including state waivers and subsidy programs for the purchase of EVs, and to ensure and protect consumer choice in goods and products such as appliances and the elimination of efficiency standards It also provides policy goals of ensuring all regulations are grounded in law and should note the distinction between domestic and foreign benefits of the regulation during the rulemaking process.

President Trump withdraws all 12 Executive Orders issued by President Biden related to climate change, environmental justice, EVs, the Inflation Reduction Act, and sustainability as well as terminates the American Climate Corps. And in a significant move, the Executive Order requires any funds or resources allocated to an entity or program abolished under the order to be disposed in accordance with the applicable law and the termination as quickly as possible of any contract between the United States and a third party that was entered into for the purpose carryout projects initiated under the withdrawn Biden Era Executive Orders.

The President directs several actions, including the immediate review of all agency actions affecting the development of domestic energy resources, such as oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy. It also direct agencies, within 30 days of identifying any agency action that unduly burdens the production of domestic energy resources, to develop and begin action plans to rescind or revise the agency actions. Further, the agencies are directed to notify the Attorney General so that appropriate action may be taken in any pending litigation, including the request of a stay, related to the identified agency action.

The Executive Order additionally disbands the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases and the guidance documents promulgated thereunder. Within 60 days, the EPA is directed to issue and new guidance on the “social cost of carbon,” including possibly eliminating it from the calculation of any permitting or regulatory decision. Until the EPA, issues its new guidance on the “social cost of carbon,” the guidance of OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 is reinstated and applies to all rulemaking proceedings. Lastly, the EPA is directed to reconsider and make recommendations on the legality and applicability of “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,” Final Rule, 74 FR 66496 (December 15, 2009), which is the foundational action underpinning all of EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations.

The Executive Order also has a focus on permitting, directing EPA, Department of Interior (“DOI”), and Department of Defense, to eliminate delays or inefficiencies in the permitting process, including through the use of general permits or permits by rule. As to NEPA, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) is directed to propose to rescind its NEPA implementation regulations and issue new implementation guidance within 30 days. Lastly, the National Economic Council and Office of Legislative Affairs must jointly prepare recommendations to Congress to facilitate permitting and development of energy infrastructure projects.

The Executive Order also targets funding appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and requires the immediate pause on the disbursement of any additional funds under the Acts. Agency heads are directed to review their process and policy for issuing grants or funding the appropriated money for consistency with the United States policy to expeditiously and efficiently develop domestic energy resources among the other policy considerations outlined in the Executive Order. The Director of OMB is charged with providing guidance at to how agencies will prioritize such considerations involving federal funding. Agencies are also required to assess whether enforcement discretion can be utilized to advance the domestic development of energy resources and each agency shall submit a report to OMB within 30 days that identifies such instances.

The Department of Energy is directed restart reviews of applications and approvals of liquified natural gas export projects as expeditiously as possible. For liquified natural gas projects that had previously been approved by the Maritime Administration (“MARAD”) pursuant to the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (“DWPA”), MARAD is required to determine whether any modifications to such projects are likely to result in adverse environmental consequences that are substantially different in nature than the potential consequences that were evaluated at the time of the project’s initial approval. There are also a series of expedited timelines for review and reporting to the President and Department of Transportation.

The Executive Order also seeks to facilitate American mining of non-fuel minerals and directs the DOI, Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), EPA, and CEQ to identify any agency actions which pose undue burdens on domestic mining and take steps to undue such agency actions. DOI and USDA are required to reassess public lands that had been withdrawn from mining consideration. Additionally, DOI is required to consider updating the U.S. Geological Survey’s list of critical minerals and must prioritize and accelerate the geologic mapping of the United States with a focus of identifying unknown deposits of critical minerals. Further, relevant agencies are directed to evaluate whether foreign mining projects utilize exploitative practices, have national security implications, or unlawfully or unduly restrict U.S. commerce. Lastly, within 60 days, the Secretary of State and other relevant agencies must submit a report to the President that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-08/White%20House%20Washington%20DC-45209281.jpg.webp?itok=FHQWJTor,N,,2025-08-15 16:04:14.306987

Effort supports the intent of South Carolina leaders to address growth by continuing to operate proven electricity capacity in the state

GREENVILLE, S.C. – Duke Energy has announced its submission of the final license application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for the Bad Creek Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Station, located near Salem, S.C. The application, if approved, would extend the plant’s operations for an additional 50 years.

A flexible, dynamic, efficient and emission-free way to store and deliver large quantities of energy, pumped storage hydro plants store and generate energy by moving water between two reservoirs at different elevations. Located in Oconee County, S.C., Bad Creek is designed to produce significant amounts of energy when our customers need it most, performing a vital role as the largest “battery” on the company’s system since 1991.

Why it matters: As part of the company’s responsibility to serve nearly 860,000 retail electric customers across South Carolina, Duke Energy needs to not only build large amounts of new generation but also extend the lives of those proven workhorse facilities like Bad Creek and the company’s existing nuclear fleet to support the economic success and growth the state is experiencing.

Duke Energy recently completed upgrades to the four units at the Bad Creek pumped storage facility in Salem, S.C. The upgrades add a total of 320 megawatts of carbon-free energy to the company’s system, increasing the total capacity of the station to 1,680 megawatts.

This commitment to relicense the Bad Creek facility reflects the investments the company is making to maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

Next steps: The current operating license for the project expires in July 2027 and Duke Energy consulted with more than 70 stakeholders to propose a new license that would run for another 50 years.

Duke Energy expects a decision on our operating license application from FERC in 2027, before the original license expires.

What they’re saying:

U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs: “Bad Creek is a cornerstone of South Carolina’s energy infrastructure and a testament to the kind of smart, long-term investment our state needs. I’m proud to support Duke Energy’s efforts to extend operations at this critical facility. This project will help power our communities, support economic growth, and ensure a reliable, affordable energy future for families and businesses across the Upstate.”

Duke Energy South Carolina President Tim Pearson: “Extending the life of this ‘marvel in the mountain’ has been a significant part of our planning for the future for many years. Our commitment to keep a proven asset like Bad Creek online for decades to come while also bringing a diverse portfolio of new generating resources to the grid reflects the direction our state’s leaders have made clear is the right path forward to support a reliable, affordable and resilient energy future for South Carolina.”

Under the Big Beautiful Bill, the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund approved under the Inflation Reduction Act was eliminated.","A $61 million federal grant to make New Orleans East service roads safer and more accessible for pedestrians and bicyclists has been nixed after the Trump administration eliminated a program that was supposed to reduce transportation burdens for disadvantaged communities.

Under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law last month, projects funded under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhood Access and Equity Programs have been canceled, throwing a wrench into plans for infrastructure projects that would address an increasing number of traffic crashes in New Orleans East.

The grant, secured by U.S. Rep. Troy Carter and awarded to the city in 2023, would’ve covered three new pedestrian bridges over Interstate 10, shared vehicle and bike lanes along the I-10 Service Road and new lighting.

The project scope also included trail connections at the Crowder Boulevard and Bullard Avenue exits and pedestrian crossing signals at major service road intersections.

A slice of the grant — about $2 million in legally obligated funds — will cover the design phase only, according to New Orleans Department of Public Works, which coordinated the project along with the Office of Resilience and Sustainability. Additional funding is needed to move forward with construction and to obtain permits from the State Department of Transportation and Development.

""Once again, Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda are putting Louisianians last,"" Carter said in a statement. ""...This investment was secured to fix long-standing safety hazards created by poorly planned transportation projects — projects too often forced onto poor neighborhoods and communities of color.""

Carter said the ""transformative"" project would have helped improve access to parks, businesses and essential services. It sought to improve safety conditions in light of a 2023 report commissioned by the New Orleans Regional Planning Commission that looked at service road conditions along the five-mile stretch between Dwyer and Paris roads.

The report found that the East has become increasingly difficult to navigate without a car because of speeding traffic and a lack of sidewalks and lighting.

The issues have led to traffic injuries and fatalities, especially along the service roads, where about 6% of the city’s fatal pedestrian-involved crashes occurred between 2017-21.

During that time period, there were 51 crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists in New Orleans East, the report said.

Between 2019-22, fatal pedestrian crashes increased from 11 to 34, before dipping slightly in 2023. The number of serious injuries rose from 53 in 2019 to 82 in 2023, according to city data.

The cuts come as the state is also set to lose $156 million in federal funding for solar energy that could have helped expand access to renewable energy for low-income and disadvantaged families, U.S Environmental Protection Agency officials announced earlier this month.

On Thursday, the company said it was requesting permission to merge Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), which have operated as two separate entities since Duke Energy merged with Progress Energy in 2012. While Duke Energy says this is legally considered a merger, the company's announcement said the proposed combination is more of a reorganization of two corporate divisions into one that promises to save customers more than $1 billion through 2038.

Duke Energy said this would create a single utility that streamlines operations and reduces costs for customers. It aims to officially combine on Jan. 1, 2027.

“Combining our two utilities reduces customer costs, simplifies operations, supports economic growth and promotes regulatory efficiencies, all of which will create value for customers in both states,” said Kodwo Ghartey-Tagoe, executive vice president and CEO of Duke Energy Carolinas. “There will be no immediate changes to retail customer rates or services. We look forward to sharing more details with our customers on how rates will evolve over time if the combination is approved by regulators.”

The company's announcement claims operating as a single utility would allow it to meet growing energy needs in the region at a lower cost for customers across Duke Energy's 52,000-square-mile service area, allowing it to improve grid reliability while reducing the need to build resources and use less expensive units.

Duke Energy said it will need approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which will oversee and regulate the proposed combined utility.

The company also promises that retail rates won't change immediately, but rather that DEC and DEP rates will start to blend over time in future rate cases and rider filings made after Jan. 1, 2027. Customers in North Carolina and South Carolina will still see rates regulated by their states' regulatory bodies, who will have independent discretion over the pace of retail rate integration.

Duke Energy also said other benefits include new energy generation and transmission, better reliability, less confusion, and more regulatory efficiencies.

In 2024, Duke Energy lowered electric rates in the Carolinas, but did hike up rates in South Carolina. In 2025, North Carolina's Senate passed a bill by overriding Gov. Josh Stein's veto that eliminated the carbon reduction mandate and allowed the company to charge customers for building new power plants before construction is completed.

Sandy Bahr, Sierra Club Grand Canyon (Arizona) Chapter Director, released the following statement:

“The Commission’s misguided and short-sighted efforts to repeal the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff rules will harm our air, our water, and our health. These rules have helped to support significant development of clean, affordable energy sources like solar and wind, which are now among the lowest-cost power sources in Arizona. Clean energy provides thousands of jobs and huge economic and health benefits for our communities. As Arizona Public Service’s recent abandonment of its clean-energy commitments makes clear, we cannot count on monopoly utilities to keep their word and meet their voluntary commitments related to clean energy – we need a Commission that is willing to hold them accountable to ratepayers and Arizona families.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-15 14:04:10.492981

Sunrun Shines with Strong Storage Growth and Record Profitability

Residential solar provider Sunrun delivered a blowout Q2, sending its stock higher as the company crushed Wall Street expectations across the board. Sunrun posted revenue of $569.3 million, beating analyst estimates by 4%, and achieved a non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, far exceeding the expected loss of $0.12 per share.

Management attributed this strength to the soaring adoption of battery storage, with a record 70% attachment rate among new solar customers, up sharply from prior quarters. This growing integration of storage is helping Sunrun unlock new revenue streams through virtual power plant (VPP) programs, which now boast over 71,000 customers and 354 MW of capacity.

Operationally, the company saw meaningful efficiency gains. Creation costs per subscriber fell, leading to a 17-point margin improvement year-over-year. Meanwhile, Sunrun’s annual recurring revenue rose 22.2% to $1.78 billion, a sign of growing long-term value.

CEO Mary Powell emphasized that the quarter’s record profitability was the result of focusing on high-margin offerings and strategic tax planning. “We’re growing storage, cutting costs, and securing multi-year tax benefits to prepare for the 2028 ITC step-down,” she said.

First Solar Sees Tailwinds from Policy and U.S. Demand

First Solar, another major U.S. solar manufacturer, also impressed investors with Q2 revenue of $1.10 billion, up nearly 9% year-over-year and ahead of analyst forecasts. Its GAAP earnings of $3.18 per share came in nearly 20% higher than expectations, driven by strong U.S. demand and favorable policy developments.

CEO Mark Widmar pointed to a tightening regulatory environment around foreign solar imports as a major driver, saying the shift has “solidified First Solar’s competitive position” in the domestic market. The company is also continuing to expand U.S. manufacturing, with a new Alabama plant ramping up operations.

In a nod to sustained demand, First Solar raised its full-year revenue guidance by 6%, now targeting $5.3 billion. Despite some margin compression—operating margin dipped to 33% from 36.9%—investors appear to be prioritizing revenue growth and policy-driven tailwinds.

Boost from U.S. Manufacturing Deal: Corning Partnership Announced

Adding to the bullish sentiment, Corning and a U.S.-based solar firm announced a landmark deal to produce fully American-made solar panels by 2026. The partnership, reported by Reuters, aims to secure a domestic supply chain in response to federal incentives promoting clean energy independence.

The move is widely seen as a strategic win for solar companies trying to qualify for bonus tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content provisions. Analysts view this development as a validation of long-term investment in U.S. solar infrastructure and a potential earnings driver for firms like First Solar.

Investor Takeaway: Policy and Storage Drive Momentum

The strong Q2 earnings from both Sunrun and First Solar—and the continued shift toward domestic solar manufacturing—signal a turning point for the solar sector after a choppy few years. Key themes like battery storage, grid services, tax planning, and U.S. content requirements are now converging to create real financial momentum.

Investors are reacting positively, with both RUN and FSLR stocks trading up today.

The Trump administration is proposing to repeal those standards and revert to the standards as they existed in 2012.
“Weakening clean air protections will force communities living downwind from power plants to breathe mercury and other dangerous pollutants that threaten our health and our environment,” Nessel said.
Mercury emissions from power plants are also a major contributor to mercury contamination in U.S. waterways.","LANSING– Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, as part of a coalition of 17 state attorneys general, Chicago, New York City and the California Air Resources Board, filed comments (PDF) opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to repeal the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Rule and revert to outdated standards that would harm the environment and public health.

The MATS Rule implements nationwide standards that limit emissions of toxic air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants, such as mercury and other toxic metals, acid gases such as hydrogen chloride, and formaldehyde. Given significant developments in the technologies used to control pollution, in 2024 the EPA updated standards for emissions of these hazardous air pollutants from power plants. The Trump administration is proposing to repeal those standards and revert to the standards as they existed in 2012.

“Weakening clean air protections will force communities living downwind from power plants to breathe mercury and other dangerous pollutants that threaten our health and our environment,” Nessel said. “I am proud to stand with my colleagues against unlawfully rolling back standards that protect Michiganders.”

The coalition explained mercury and other hazardous air pollutants disproportionately harm people that live near coal- and oil-fired power plants. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that poses serious dangers to public health, especially for pregnant women and children.

For example, a pregnant person’s consumption of mercury exposes the developing fetus to mercury and can cause lifelong developmental harms and neurological disorders such as seizures, vision and hearing loss, or delayed development. Exposure to mercury also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune dysfunction in adults.

Mercury emissions from power plants are also a major contributor to mercury contamination in U.S. waterways. Mercury pollution in lakes and rivers harms the local commercial and recreation fishing economies, as well as tribal nations and indigenous peoples that rely on fishing for subsistence.

Attorney General Nessel and the coalition also argue that the proposed repeal is unlawful because the EPA has failed to provide a reasoned basis for its proposed repeal and failed to adequately consider developments in practices, processes and control technologies in its proposal to revert to outdated standards. For these reasons, the attorneys general write that repealing the current standards would violate the Administrative Procedure Act.

Joining Attorney General Nessel in submitting the comments are the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, along with Chicago, New York City, and the California Air Resources Board.

Conclusion: Navigating the Rig Count's Signal The U.S. rig count's decline is not a death knell for the energy sector but a catalyst for innovation and efficiency.
Investors who focus on technology-enabled production, natural gas infrastructure, and energy transition plays can capitalize on the sector's structural shifts.","The U.S. Baker Hughes Oil Rig Count, a barometer of drilling activity and a leading indicator for future production trends, has painted a nuanced picture of the energy sector in 2025. As of August 8, 2025, the total active rigs stood at 539, with 412 oil rigs and 122 gas rigs. This marks a -8.02% year-over-year decline from 586 rigs in August 2024, reflecting a broader industry shift toward cost discipline and capital efficiency. However, the flat weekly trend and projected EIA output growth of 13.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 suggest that strategic investments in specific sectors could yield outsized returns.

1. Oil Production Efficiency: The Tech-Driven Resilience Play

The decline in rig counts has forced operators to prioritize productivity over expansion. Companies leveraging AI, automation, and digital twins are outperforming peers. For example, Chevron (CVX) and Schlumberger (SLB) have integrated real-time analytics and predictive maintenance to optimize existing wells, reducing downtime and boosting output per rig. Schlumberger's iCenter™ platform, which uses advanced semiconductors for asset monitoring, exemplifies this trend.

Investors should also consider semiconductor firms with energy exposure, such as Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), which supply components for energy automation systems. The rig count's stagnation has created a secondary demand pool for these technologies, as operators seek to maximize returns from existing infrastructure.

2. Natural Gas Rebound: Midstream and LNG Infrastructure

Natural gas prices surged 65% in 2025, driven by EIA projections of 106.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) production. This has revitalized midstream infrastructure, where fee-based revenue models insulate companies from commodity price volatility. Energy Transfer (ET) and Williams Companies (WMB) are benefiting from increased throughput in the Haynesville and Marcellus basins, while Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) is expanding its NGL processing capacity to meet surging propane and ethane demand.

The LNG export boom further amplifies opportunities. Projects like Louisiana LNG and Commonwealth LNG are set to boost U.S. export capacity by 60% by 2030, creating tailwinds for pipeline operators like Kinder Morgan (KMI) and Plains All American (PAA).

3. Energy Transition and ESG-Driven Innovation

The rig count's decline has accelerated interest in energy transition technologies. Baker Hughes (BKR) is expanding into geothermal energy and carbon capture, leveraging its industrial expertise to align with decarbonization goals. Similarly, Halliburton (HAL) is investing in hydrogen infrastructure and low-carbon drilling fluids.

For investors, ESG-focused ETFs like iShares Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) and individual plays in carbon capture (e.g., Carbon Engineering) offer exposure to this shift. The EIA's projection of a 68% rise in gas prices in 2025 also supports natural gas as a transitional fuel, making midstream and LNG players attractive for long-term portfolios.

4. Capital Efficiency and Sector Rotation

Independent E&P companies are cutting capital expenditures by ~4% in 2025, prioritizing shareholder returns over new drilling. This has created a “buy-the-dip” opportunity for firms with strong balance sheets, such as ConocoPhillips (COP) and Occidental (OXY), which are using lower rig counts to consolidate assets and improve margins.

Meanwhile, the Permian Basin remains a focal point. New midstream projects like the Matterhorn Express Pipeline are addressing takeaway constraints, enabling operators like Parsley Energy (PE) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) to monetize production more effectively.

Conclusion: Navigating the Rig Count's Signal

The U.S. rig count's decline is not a death knell for the energy sector but a catalyst for innovation and efficiency. Investors who focus on technology-enabled production, natural gas infrastructure, and energy transition plays can capitalize on the sector's structural shifts. While the immediate outlook for rig counts remains cautious, the interplay of EIA-driven output growth, LNG demand, and ESG imperatives positions these sectors for resilience and long-term gains.

As the energy landscape evolves, the key to success lies in aligning with companies that are not just surviving the rig count's downturn but redefining the industry's future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-15 14:07:20.644641

WASHINGTON and DALLAS, Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI (""ASPI” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today announced that the Company and its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (“QLE” or “Quantum Leap Energy”), an advanced materials company focused on the development of technology and processes for the production of advanced nuclear fuels, have entered into a Joint Venture Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Fermi LLC (“Fermi America”), regarding a joint venture pursuant to which the parties intend to collaborate on the research, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels on the planned HyperGrid Campus in Carson County, Texas.

The non-binding MOU contemplates QLE and Fermi America entering into definitive agreements pursuant to which the parties will form a new entity in Texas as a joint venture for the research and development, and then the construction, of an advanced nuclear fuel enrichment facility capable of producing large quantities of High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) for small modular reactors. It is anticipated that the advanced nuclear fuel facility will provide for the conversion and deconversion of uranium products, as well as the fabrication of fuel assemblies. In addition, the MOU contemplates ASPI entering into a separate lease for the development and construction of a 100% ASPI-owned enrichment research and commercial production facility for stable isotopes and advanced materials (excluding advanced nuclear fuels), which may include critical materials, such as Silicon-28, Germanium-70, Ytterbium-176, Nickel-64, Xenon-129, Zinc-68 and Chlorine-37.

The property leased by Fermi America from the from the Texas Tech University System for the HyperGrid Campus is strategically located near the DOE-operated Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, offering unique proximity to a federally hardened and environmentally characterized site. The site is pre-qualified for nuclear deployment under DOE and NRC precedent studies and is governed by sovereign institutional control held by Texas Tech University, as lessor. The HyperGrid Campus is expected to be the world’s largest hybrid energy and data infrastructure campus and is anticipated to generate over 11 GW of electricity to supply data centers, as well as other industries. Pantex is the primary United States nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility that aims to maintain the safety, security and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and is home to the site where most U.S. nuclear weapons are constructed and assembled.

Fermi America, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and former Texas Governor Rick Perry, along with Former Quantum Private Equity Co-Founder, Toby Neugebauer, aims to meet the rapidly growing energy demands tied to AI infrastructure. Fermi America has submitted its Combined Operating License Application to build four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors as part of its HyperGrid Project. Fermi America plans to begin construction on the nuclear power complex in 2027 and aims to have the first reactor operational by 2032. Fermi America has also entered into an MOU with Hyundai E&C for the construction and engineering of Nuclear Reactors on the HyperGrid site.

The Joint Venture MOU by and among ASPI, QLE and Fermi America was signed at a signing ceremony that took place in Dallas, Texas on August 14, 2025 and was attended by representatives of all parties, including Mr. Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASPI, Dr. Ryno Pretorius, CEO of Quantum Leap Energy, and Mr. Toby Neugebauer, CEO of Fermi America.

Toby Neugebauer, Co-Founder of Fermi America, said, “Over the last three decades, our country has been asleep at the wheel, forcing reliance on foreign nations for critical technology materials such as next-generation semiconductors and nuclear energy. Fermi is determined to restore America as global leaders in the nuclear space, and our partnership with ASP Isotopes and Quantum Leap Energy is the natural next step.”

Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASP Isotopes and Chairman of Quantum Leap Energy, said “During the last three years, ASP Isotopes has constructed three isotope enrichment facilities in South Africa to produce isotopes to enable faster semiconductors and next-generation cancer therapies. As a U.S. company, our goal has always been to bring these technologies to the United States to ensure that the United States has a domestic supply of these materials and reduce its reliance on imports from other countries. We are excited to enter into this joint venture with Fermi America to accelerate this goal.”

Ryno Pretorius, CEO of Quantum Leap Energy, commented that “QLE is excited to enter the United States domestic production market as a provider of Nuclear Fuel Services to meet the rapidly growing demands of the Fermi America HyperGrid project, as well as existing and future partners in the United States. Our goal is to scale our technologies as quickly as possible to reduce the bottleneck on the nuclear fuel industry and unlock clean American nuclear energy that will provide consistent, base load power, not only for AI but millions of Americans. We believe Fermi America is another key strategic partner to help us develop and scale our nuclear fuel services and solutions in the United States with an initial base in Texas.”

During the next 30 years, global energy consumption will likely double(1). The advanced nuclear fuels required during the next 50 years are expected to differ significantly from those used in the last 50 years. AI demand requires high base load energy which will be partially supplied by large growth in the nuclear industry from Small Modular Reactors. Many small modular and advanced reactors in the future are expected to require HALEU. The Company has received interest from potential customers who collectively require over $37 billion of HALEU between the present day and 2037, at current market prices.

ASPI has previously announced that it has entered into two supply agreements with TerraPower, LLC for HALEU from an initial uranium facility they expect to construct at Pelindaba in South Africa. The initial core supply agreement is intended to support the supply of the required first fuel cores for the initial loading of TerraPower’s Natrium project in Wyoming during the 2027/28 timeframe. The long-term supply agreement is a 10-year supply agreement of up to a total of 150 metric tons of HALEU, commencing in 2028 through end of 2037. The construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility in Texas, USA would become the second facility owned or co-owned by QLE for the production of HALEU. ASPI and QLE are also in discussions with the UK government regarding the construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility in the UK. ASPI has also previously announced its intention to spin out QLE as a separate public company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 4Q25.

The signing of the Joint Venture MOU with Fermi America was facilitated by Ocean Wall Limited, who acted as adviser to both ASP Isotopes and Fermi America in establishing this strategic partnership.

Now, critics say, it is taking the next step: rewriting the science itself, according to a lawsuit filed this week by environmental groups.

As the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the 2009 scientific determination that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, the Department of Energy published a new review of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on U.S. climate that aims to support the EPA's efforts.

The report was developed this spring by the 2025 Climate Working Group, which is composed of five independent climate scientists selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

But environmental groups and independent scientists have criticized the report and how it was written, claiming it was assembled in secret by the five scientists who are recognized by the larger scientific community as climate skeptics.

""The secret report was produced by a set of known climate contrarians who were commissioned to write this report that's full of inaccuracies,"" said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of climate and energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""It's clearly geared towards trying to give the EPA a way to evade its legal responsibility to address the health harms of heat trapping emissions and climate change.""

A ""secret report""

The DOE report, entitled ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,"" was commissioned in March when Wright assembled the group to undertake a massive review of scientific findings in a very short period of time, with no public announcement of this effort.

The five authors delivered their final draft by May 28. In the report's preface, the authors wrote, ""The short timeline and the technical nature of the material meant that we could not comprehensively review all topics.""

Their report argues that carbon-driven warming may be less economically damaging than commonly believed, and that aggressive U.S. climate policies would have little measurable impact on the global climate. It attributes some warming to natural climate cycles or changes in the sun, instead of the burning of fossil fuels, and also claims sea level rise has not been accelerating, contrary to widely accepted scientific evidence. Finally, it highlights the potential benefits of rising carbon dioxide levels for plant growth.

""I would say that it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of how climate change is affecting the United States,"" said Phil Duffy, a climate scientist who previously worked in the Biden and Obama administrations as a science policy expert.

Duffy and other scientists say the DOE report cherry-picks evidence, misrepresents peer-reviewed research, and ignores the overwhelming consensus that human activity is driving dangerous warming. Numerous climate-based groups and researchers have published their own fact-checks on the report, with one listing more than 100 false or misleading claims made by the authors.

CBS News reached out to the Department of Energy about the criticisms of the report, but it did not respond to our repeated requests for comment.

""This DOE report is in service of a political goal, it's not credible science,"" said Ben Santer, a climate researcher and board member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Santer says his own published work was misrepresented in the DOE report and said the authors ""fundamentally twist"" the work of many researchers to reach conclusions that ""will be used for a political purpose.""

Critics in the scientific community have pointed out that the panel's five authors are known for their contrarian views on climate science, which are often at odds with the scientific consensus on the causes of climate change.

""The people that were handpicked by the Trump administration's energy secretary are this very small group of people who are known to disagree with that mountain of [scientific] evidence,"" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. ""Some of them have connections to the fossil fuel industry.""

Accusations of rewriting science

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, has been vocal about his views on climate change, which align with the report's findings. In an op-ed earlier this year, he called climate change ""a by-product of progress,"" and wrote, ""I am willing to take the modest negative trade-off for this legacy of human advancement."" He argues that while climate change is real, it is not the greatest threat, and that expanding access to affordable, reliable energy should remain the priority.

Wright has been transparent about how he views U.S. climate research, telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the administration is reviewing past federal climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment, and may provide ""updates"" later this year, leading many in the scientific community to fear the administration is aiming to edit or censor critical research.

""It's important that science be allowed to speak for itself and I do have concerns that that's not happening,"" Duffy told CBS News.

National Climate Assessments typically take years to write and are authored by hundreds of scientists.

Duffy says that Wright didn't oversee the previous reports and therefore has no authority to review or revise them. ""He can't rewrite the National Climate Assessment any more than I can rewrite 'The Great Gatsby,'"" Duffy says.

The Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the EPA and the Department of Energy, arguing that their actions violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and balanced membership for government advisory panels. The suit alleges that the Climate Working Group was created in secret, its work withheld from the public, and then its report was used extensively by the EPA, cited 22 times, to justify repealing the Endangerment Finding. The organizations are asking a judge to block the government's use of the report to comply with transparency laws.

When asked about the lawsuit, the EPA responded in an email saying, ""As a matter of longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on current or pending litigation,"" and referred CBS News to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy did not respond to any of our requests for comment.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/15/fe735adb-e5ef-4fd7-9d75-26a6346a368e/thumbnail/1200x630g2/28a588debbaa7c3d2d7ddfc48cd92a73/gettyimages-2205309780.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 14:05:24.752650

Meet the Lucid Gravity X adventure-ready EV SUV

Lucid has been hyping the new model as “a bold new concept of electric exploration,” describing it as its most adventurous vehicle to date.

At Monterey Car Week on Friday, we finally got our first look at Lucid’s stunning new Gravity X concept. Based on the Lucid Gravity Grand Touring, which features an impressive up to 450 miles of EPA-estimated range, AWD, and a 0 to 60 mph sprint in just 3.4 secs, the X is designed to take you even further.

As Lucid put it, the X “advances this exceptional foundation, exploring what it would be like to push the limits further.

The concept features a new look, lifted ride height, and added off-road elements for all on and off-road adventures. Lucid fine-tuned the front and rear ends to improve approach and departure angles. It also slapped all-terrain tires, protective skid plates, and tow hooks on it, just in case.

Like we first saw in the teaser, the X concept is equipped with an integrated crossbar with LED lights and a roof box.

Lucid says every detail on the new concept was intentional, from the Astral Drift satin paint to the topographical references to Big Spur and Death Valley on the hood.

The interior features upgrades, including premium leather seats, high-performance floor mats, and a microsuede steering wheel.

According to Lucid, the Gravity X, pronounced Gravity Cross, is “ready to go anywhere. Take on everything. And compromise nothing.”

Although it’s just a concept for now, the X gives us a glimpse into a future off-road Gravity trim. As we mentioned earlier this week, Lucid could be preparing to introduce a rugged new variant to compete with Rivian’s California Dune Edition R1S and R1T models.

What do you think of the rugged Gravity X Concept? Should Lucid bring it to life?

The electrification agency announced the development in a statement on Friday.

The collaboration, formalised at a signing ceremony in Abuja, will be anchored on five key pillars, energising education and innovation, scaling skills development, supporting state-level policy reforms, unlocking innovative financing, and advancing research and public engagement.

Speaking at the event, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of REA, Abba Aliyu, described the partnership as “a game-changer” for Nigeria’s renewable energy ambitions.

He emphasised that, the initiative will build on ongoing Federal Government renewable energy scale-up efforts, unlock opportunities in local content and manufacturing, and drive sustainable investment.

“Our goal is to position Nigeria as a renewable energy hub, reduce governance costs, and catalyse innovation, research and development,” Aliyu said.

He explained that the initiative would build on ongoing Federal Government renewable energy scale-up programmes, expand local content and manufacturing capacity, and attract sustainable investments into the sector.

Aliyu stressed that unlocking opportunities in clean energy would require practical strategies on local content, domestic manufacturing and innovative finance, noting that these measures would cut governance costs while advancing sustainability.

The REA boss added that “the REA-UNDP partnership pillars are specifically targeted at advancing ongoing efforts in the clean energy space in Nigeria, catalysing opportunities across critical ecosystems and unlocking the full potentials in innovation, R&D, local expertise and sustainable investment.”

The UNDP Resident Representative in Nigeria, Ms Elsie G. Attafuah, said the collaboration represented a bold step toward a more sustainable and prosperous Nigeria, adding that it would not only expand access to clean energy but also drive innovation, youth empowerment and job creation.

“This collaboration with the Rural Electrification Agency is a bold step toward a more sustainable and prosperous Nigeria. Our partnership will not only provide access to clean energy but also serve as a powerful engine for innovation, youth empowerment, and job creation. We are moving beyond simply powering communities to igniting their full potential.

“We are moving beyond simply powering communities to igniting their full potential,” she said.

Attafuah also highlighted the importance of processing Nigeria’s natural resources, such as lithium, into value-added renewable energy products like lithium battery systems, while embedding innovation and research into the nation’s learning institutions to catalyse the creation of green jobs.

Under the agreement, UNDP’s University Innovation Pods and Maker Spaces will be integrated into REA’s Energising Education Programme to transform federal universities and teaching hospitals into hubs of practical innovation.

The deal will also scale REA’s NEXTGEN initiative, designed to train a new generation of clean energy professionals, thereby creating a national talent pipeline and addressing youth unemployment in the sector.

At the subnational level, UNDP and REA will provide policy and technical support to help states implement the Electricity Act and harmonise energy policies.

On financing, both organisations will leverage blended finance models to de-risk renewable energy projects, attract private capital, and strengthen the Rural Electrification Fund.

Additionally, they will jointly produce robust data on sustainable energy progress and run public engagement campaigns to drive policy support and consumer adoption of clean energy.

According to the partners, the initiative reflects UNDP’s commitment to locally driven, inclusive and resilient development, as well as REA’s mandate to bring sustainable energy to unserved and underserved communities.

Under the law, the BPU will report the results of the investigation to the Governor and the Legislature within one year.
PJM members, including electric public utility companies, vote on matters at PJM that impact ratepayers in New Jersey and across the regional grid.
“This bill will ensure PJM voters take responsibility for their decisions, increasing the public’s confidence in the decisions being made,” said Assemblyman Robert Karabinchak.
We are telling PJM loud and clear that our residents deserve a pricing system that works for them, not against them.”","Bills Seek to Protect Ratepayers Amid Cost Crisis and Advance New Jersey’s Clean Energy Goals

TRENTON – Governor Phil Murphy today signed into law AJR216/SJR154 and A5463/S4363, two bills designed to increase public accountability and transparency in decision-making by regional grid operator PJM Interconnection, LLC and its members as ratepayers in New Jersey and the region face an electricity cost crisis.

“These bills complement our long-term plan of action to hold PJM responsible for hardworking New Jerseyans’ skyrocketing electricity bills and a lack of new energy generation,” said Governor Murphy. “We are committed to creating a system that is fairer and more transparent for customers and the states that represent them – a necessary change from the opaque practices that have, for too long, defined PJM.”

AJR216/SJR154 cements New Jersey’s role on the forefront of coordinating with other PJM states to ensure PJM is serving ratepayers by utilizing a pricing model that serves the intended purpose of obtaining adequate resources at the lowest possible cost at its annual capacity market auction. Today’s legislation directs the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to examine whether PJM’s Reliability Pricing Model is advancing that goal. BPU is also directed to continue advocating, along with other states, for reforms at PJM that will increase electricity supply, protect ratepayers, and prioritize clean energy generation. Under the law, the BPU will report the results of the investigation to the Governor and the Legislature within one year.

New Jersey, alongside other states, has sent multiple letters to the PJM Board of Managers since PJM’s June 2024 capacity market auction and has made multiple filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on how to improve PJM’s capacity market rules. New Jersey continues the work to vigorously incentivize the development of new generation sources in-state to meet the growing electricity demand, which is influenced by regional grid-wide factors.

“Affordability is always top of mind for us at the NJBPU,"" said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, President, NJBPU. ""While we continue to advocate at the regional level to address PJM's flawed market rules and work to develop key programs and spur investment in new energy resources in-state, PJM must come to the table and demonstrate that the ratepayers of New Jersey, and throughout the region, are a priority. The lack of transparency in their regular business, coupled with more than a thousand clean energy projects stuck in their red-tape cannot continue. The recent, dramatic capacity auction price increases demonstrate that the status quo must change. It's hurting ratepayers and it’s constraining energy jobs. Transparency is the first step toward accountability.”

""People are now learning what an important role PJM plays in setting the price for electricity in New Jersey. For too long, PJM has operated behind the scenes, making significant decisions in various committees with no real understanding of who is actually making those decisions. Our electric companies are all part of larger organizations. It is important to ensure that when our electric companies are voting at PJM, they are doing so to benefit New Jersey customers and not the interests of their parent corporations. This law will allow the public to look behind the curtain, see how the process works, and hopefully ensure that our electric companies are voting in our interests. Likewise, it is always a good idea to look at what PJM is doing and ensure that it is still in the best interests of New Jersey,” said Rate Counsel Director Brian Lipman. “Rate Counsel welcomes this investigation to determine if PJM's base residual auction is still working for New Jersey. Moreover, this is a multistate problem and will require a multistate solution. New Jersey, acting alone, cannot ensure equitable prices for PJM customers – we must continue to work with our neighbors to ensure we are all getting the best prices.""

PJM members, including electric public utility companies, vote on matters at PJM that impact ratepayers in New Jersey and across the regional grid. A5463/S4363 enhances transparency and accountability so that the public can understand how decisions made at PJM may impact electricity reliability, affordability, and sustainability – calling on electric public utilities and their affiliates operating in New Jersey to disclose details on their voting at PJM to the BPU annually. Under the law, those utilities and their affiliates will be required to report their recorded votes and explain how each vote furthers the State’s goals of prioritizing the affordability, reliability, and sustainability of electricity production, consumption, and conservation.

“This bill will ensure PJM voters take responsibility for their decisions, increasing the public’s confidence in the decisions being made,” said Assemblyman Robert Karabinchak. “New Jersey and the 12 other states who depend on PJM should have transparency from the over 500 people who are making these decisions. We should be able to know who made what vote and why without having to jump through hoops.”

“While electric bills skyrocket, PJM’s decision-makers have been setting our regional power grid policy in secret,” said Senator Raj Mukherji. “That ends today. With the enactment of the grid transparency law, consequential votes and decisions impacting what 65 million ratepayers pay and the timeline for approving clean energy projects in the pipeline will become public record. This is about sunlight, accountability, and putting consumers at the center of our energy policy.”

“The energy auction that is the principle cause for the spike in utility bills is clearly broken and in desperate need of reform,” said Senator John Burzichelli. “It failed to make consumer affordability a priority, put a chokehold on the energy supply line, and is susceptible to manipulation. This investigation is needed to identify the specific causes and determine the reforms needed to reduce costs and increase the supply of new energy. It will bring more accountability to the process and better protect ratepayers from unjustified utility bills.”

“We need to reexamine how PJM operates and ensure their priorities reflect the needs of the people they’re supposed to serve,” said Assemblyman Dave Bailey, Jr. “Energy bills affect every household and business, and with this resolution now law, we're making sure New Jersey is fighting for lower costs. We are telling PJM loud and clear that our residents deserve a pricing system that works for them, not against them.”",https://nj.gov/governor/library/facebook_card.png,N,,2025-08-15 14:04:15.815401

The Atlantic’s first named hurricane of the season is here, and it brings with it a reminder of the fragility of Puerto Rico’s storm-ravaged and otherwise neglected power grid. Solar, batteries, and other clean energy strategies have already proven themselves as solutions to the island’s frequent outages, but the Trump administration is making it hard for that progress to continue.

Hurricane Erin is set to sweep by Puerto Rico this weekend, bringing with it high winds and heavy rains. Luckily, it’s not set to make landfall, but the close call could still pose problems for the island’s increasingly fragile power grid.

Even on storm-free days, the island’s grid is hardly a picture of stability, new data from the Energy Information Administration shows. Between 2021 and 2024, utility customers in Puerto Rico have faced an average of 27 hours of outages each year that have nothing to do with major events like hurricanes. Compare that to the mainland U.S., where customers usually face about two hours of interruptions not tied to major events. Puerto Rico’s power disruptions have grown more frequent in recent years, too.

What’s to blame for those outages? Power supply shortages, for one: The island relies on imported fossil fuels to run its power plants, and recently had to idle some of those facilities over a liquefied-natural-gas shipment dispute. Also at fault is the island’s collapsing transmission and distribution infrastructure.

A patchwork of projects around the island has shown that renewable energy can help tackle both of these problems.

In the wake of 2017’s Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans installed tens of thousands of rooftop solar systems with batteries. Those households were among a ​“fortunate few” who still had power after Hurricane Fiona struck five years later and wiped out power lines once again, Canary Media’s Maria Gallucci reported in 2022. And amid the power-generation shortfall over the last few months, the island’s grid operator relied on customers’ batteries to keep the lights on, Canary’s Jeff St. John reports.

Instead of doubling down on distributed, clean energy, the Trump administration has prioritized patching up Puerto Rico’s grid. In May, the U.S. Energy Department decided to redirect $365 million in Biden-era funding for solar and battery storage toward grid-resiliency projects and ensuring an ​“affordable, reliable, and secure power supply.” The DOE also issued two emergency orders in May to expand always-on ​“baseload” power and clear overgrown vegetation that threatens power infrastructure, and on Thursday it extended those orders. Puerto Rico will also lose $156.1 million for solar projects in low-income communities if the Trump administration succeeds in rolling back Solar for All grants.

Grid repairs and upgrades are direly needed, to be sure. But in Trump speak, ​“reliable” and ​“baseload” power translates to fossil fuels — which have been anything but reliable for Puerto Rico in years past.

DOT promises to unfreeze, streamline EV charger funding

The Trump administration issued what seems to be a surprise win for the EV industry and drivers this week. The Transportation Department released revised guidance for states to access National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program funding, after the DOT had blocked them from accessing money for EV charging stations for months.

The new guidance ​“slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. Both Democrats and Republicans had criticized NEVI’s slow rollout: The $5 billion program has so far only built 378 chargers, Atlas Public Policy analyst Daniel Wilkins told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John. But environmental advocates warn that the revised DOT guidance could lead to even more delays, as it requires states to resubmit their plans for the funding.

States prioritize clean energy in the Big, Beautiful Bill’s wake

The U.S. Treasury Department is on the verge of announcing rules that will determine which projects qualify for wind and solar tax credits before they expire in the coming years. Experts predict the guidance will make it even harder to access those incentives, and states are now acting fast to guarantee cheaper clean energy while they can. As Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus reported last month, Maine is moving to quickly procure tons of clean energy with the goal of getting projects under construction before the tax credits expire.

It’s not alone. This month, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) directed state agencies to cut ​“administrative barriers” and prioritize project reviews to speed clean energy deployment, Canary’s Maria Gallucci reports. Those two states and many others are expected to take further action once the Treasury’s new rules are out.

Americans are already suffering from the real-world impacts of climate change including worsening flooding, fires and heat waves and rising insurance costs.

The report at issue was developed in secret by people hand-picked by Trump Secretary of Energy Chris Wright for their distorted views of climate science to provide recommendations on vital government decisions that could make daily life for millions of Americans less safe and less affordable.

Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts last night as part of their lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy and Secretary Christopher Wright in his official capacity as head of that department, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin in his official capacity as head of that agency, and the Climate Working Group.

The group’s lawsuit challenges the secret formation and hidden activities of the Climate Working Group—the group of climate skeptics convened by Secretary Wright. The Group wrote a report that uses scientific data inaccurately, fundamentally misrepresents many of the findings it cites, and has been denounced by scientists whose research it contorts. Trump EPA Administrator Zeldin is relying extensively on that report to support his proposal to overturn the Endangerment Finding, and to destroy common sense limits on climate pollution for the largest U.S. emitters.

“Federal law requires advisory committees to act with transparency, public participation, and consideration of balanced perspectives to ensure government decisions are based in integrity and not improperly influenced by secret interests. This report is a brazen violation of federal law that undermines our government’s role in addressing climate change, putting millions of Americans in harm’s way,” said EDF Senior Attorney Erin Murphy. “Secretary Wright unlawfully formed, in secret, a group of climate skeptics to write a report filled with inaccuracies and misrepresentations about climate change—and EPA Administrator Zeldin is trying to use it to undermine pollution limits. That would make life less safe and less affordable for millions of people all across the country.”

“Secretary Wright's actions in secretly commissioning a sham science report by known climate contrarians fall well short of what people need and deserve. The scientific community and the public were intentionally kept in the dark even as this report, which could have extremely consequential ramifications for our daily lives, was being written,” said Dr. Pallavi Phartiyal, UCS Vice President of Programs, Policy and Advocacy. “Conversely, decades of rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis confirm what people across the country are experiencing: burning fossil fuels is unequivocally contributing to dangerous, deadly and costly climate change impacts. UCS will not stay silent against this attempt to rewrite legitimate and established science.”

In March of this year, shortly after being confirmed as Secretary of Energy, Wright quietly arranged for five hand-picked authors, most of whom have ties to fossil fuel industries, to write a new report that would “cut against the prevailing narrative that climate change is an existential threat.” That report was held secret from the public until after EPA Administrator Zeldin relied on it extensively to support his proposal to overturn the Endangerment Finding, citing it 22 times. However, in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which was passed in the wake of Nixon-era scandals, Congress directed that federal government advisory committees cannot form or operate in secret, that materials they create must be available to the public, and that they must have balanced membership.

Records obtained yesterday by EDF through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) further reveal the questionable actions of Secretary Wright’s secretly convened working group. On February 13, 2025, one member of the group—Dr. Steven Koonin—emailed EPA Administrator Zeldin’s Chief of Staff to “offer technical assistance from me and colleagues in the review of the Endangerment Finding.” The Chief of Staff responded on February 16 and shared that EPA was “moving right along on this topic,” and asked if Dr. Koonin would “be available to jump on a call.”

In their motion, EDF and UCS state that, “This case presents one of the most straightforward—and consequential—violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act … since the law was enacted fifty-three years ago. … [We] file this motion to bring an immediate end to the lawless operation of and reliance on the [Climate Working Group] before it is too late to repair the enormous harm being caused.” (Motion, page 1)

The motion asks the court to preliminarily enjoin the unlawful actions in establishing, operating, and utilizing the “Climate Working Group,” to order the Group to disclose all records as required by law, to enjoin operation by the Group unless and until they comply with federal law, and to stop the Trump administration from using the Group’s unlawfully produced report.",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-08-15 14:04:56.088472

Partisan points have worked their way into the debate, with some Republican public service commissioners voicing their distaste for grid plans that involve renewable energy.

On July 30, the North Dakota Public Service Commission filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding the issue of who benefits more when major power line projects are built and whether the calculations to determine those benefits are fair.

An organization called the Midcontinent Independent System Operator manages a regional electric grid that services 15 states and parts of Manitoba, Canada. In December, MISO revealed 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion. The projects are part of an annual plan MISO develops every year to identify maintenance and upgrades for its infrastructure. All of the projects are in the MISO-North subregion, and the costs will be allocated to those states.

North Dakota regulators argue the benefit calculations used for the projects are “unjust and unreasonable” for customers in the state, according to a news release they issued on Aug. 7. They have garnered support for their stance from other MISO network members, even though the southern states won’t have to pay for any of the projects.

While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, said.

Although the complaint is already technically filed, Louisiana still has to ratify it, and partisan lines have already been drawn. Republicans hold a 3-2 advantage on the state Public Service Commission, which meets next on Aug. 20.

Lewis said he plans to vote against ratification and rejects the premise of arguments Republican commissioners are making.

“This has nothing to do with Louisiana paying for things up in the north,” Lewis said.

The federal complaint relies on a hypothetical situation that the cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.

Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, a Republican, said he believes it’s a real concern.

“We are not allocated the costs of the transmission projects now, but the precedent and the possibility of a future cost re-allocation that could impact us were factors that prompted us, Mississippi and Arkansas to join in,” Coussan said, adding that he’s closely considering the idea of Louisiana leaving MISO altogether.

Commissioner Mike Francis, also a Republican, said there’s “a lot of windmill projects” up north that only benefit the local area up there.

Although the complaint is an argument against transmission costs, it specifically mentions that some of the proposed power lines would hook up to renewable energy generation.

Lewis said North Dakota and Montana regulators are underscoring the presence of wind turbines in MISO-North in an attempt to turn their complaint into a partisan issue that can drum up support from other states.

“That’s exactly what they are doing,” Lewis said.

During its meeting Thursday, North Dakota Public Service Commissioner Jill Kringstad, a Republican, said the slate of 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.

She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota.

Kringstad and her colleagues estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades.

Commission Chair Randy Christmann, also a Republican, said there could be additional costs for increased power generation on top of the transmission projects.

They said MISO has changed the way it evaluates the cost-benefit of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.

MISO spokesman Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South.

“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The [proposed] portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”

Rather than heading to a food pantry, he was making our first drop-off at Green Era in Auburn Gresham – marking the beginning of a partnership that transforms food waste into sustainable energy and economic opportunity.

The Food Depository recently signed a contract with environmental and biofuels organization Green Era to handle most of our food waste (canned goods and food in glass containers are excluded). This includes produce that doesn't meet our strict quality standards, expired items and the small amount of kitchen waste we produce.

A sustainable solution takes root

While we've made tremendous progress reducing waste, some is inevitable when you're meticulous about food quality and over a third of our inventory is fresh, perishable produce. This year, we anticipate sending approximately 600,000 pounds of food waste to Green Era – approximately 0.375%, or less than one half of one percent, of the food we distribute to the community.

Previously, managing this waste was complicated and time-consuming, requiring three different vendors – including two different compost companies – and hours of staff time removing packaging by hand each week.

Green Era changes everything. They accept our food waste packaging and all. Their advanced equipment automatically separates packaging from food, freeing our Facilities team to focus on more strategic projects.

Because Green Era is a small operation without pickup resources, unusable food is collected and stored throughout the week, then delivered by one of our drivers weekly – or more frequently during busy seasons.

Powerful transformations

At Green Era's nine-acre campus, a state-of-the-art anaerobic digester transforms food waste into renewable natural gas and nutrient-rich fertilizer. Some biogas flows directly into the local People's Gas grid, potentially powering stoves in neighborhood homes. Organic compost nourishes several community gardens and urban farms, growing fresh, nutritious food in the local community.

Green Era's evolution shows what committed local citizens can accomplish. What was once a contaminated city impound lot filled with illegally dumped trash is now a sustainable energy hub supporting approximately 30 permanent jobs. Green Era is an outgrowth of Urban Grower's Collective, a network of eight urban farms on 11 acres, predominantly on Chicago's South Side, focused on community healing through urban agriculture.

The Food Depository has a longstanding relationship with Erika Allen, co-chair of Chicago’s Food Equity Council alongside Kate Maehr and co-founder of both the Urban Grower’s Collective and Green Era. She has worked with the Food Depository on our hyperlocal sourcing strategy, which has partnered with the Urban Grower’s Collective.

When Green Era began operations in 2023, Erika reached out to our Procurement and Facilities teams to explore moving all of the Food Depository food waste to their facility. Our counterparts at Northern Illinois Food Bank, an early Green Era customer, also helped pave the way by sharing their experience with Green Era and providing tips on safely storing compostable food waste until transport.

Full-circle impact

This partnership exemplifies the Food Depository's Impact Sourcing strategy – investing in local businesses that support our communities. Auburn Gresham has endured decades of disinvestment and faces food insecurity rates more than twice Chicago's average.

By choosing Green Era, we're not just disposing of waste responsibly, we're creating jobs, generating clean energy and producing compost that helps grow food in the high-priority communities we serve. Plans for a vertical garden and community education center at Green Era, targeted for 2027, promise even more opportunities for growth.

""We are excited for this collaboration,"" said Javaun Price, the Food Depository’s vice president of Operations and Supply Chain. ""When we invest back into the community, more dollars stay in that community and help create thriving wages. It's the right thing to do.""

Our inaugural delivery marked the beginning of what we expect to be a long-term partnership.

AMARILLO, Texas, Aug. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, developer of the 11 GW private grid campus for next-generation hyperscale AI in collaboration with the Texas Tech University System, today announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ASP Isotopes Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPI) and its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE) to explore the development of a High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) enrichment facility at Fermi America's site in Carson County, Texas.

The planned facility would use advanced laser-based isotope separation technology to produce HALEU — a specialized nuclear fuel essential for many Generation IV and small modular reactor (SMR) designs. With very few commercial HALEU suppliers currently operating in the Western world, the project is intended to strengthen U.S. and allied supply chains, reduce reliance on Russian enrichment, and accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

Fermi America's private grid campus will be anchored by four AP1000® nuclear units using conventional fuel, with the potential to integrate advanced reactor technologies in future phases. The addition of domestic HALEU production capability would position the private grid as both a significant clean energy generator and a strategic nuclear fuel hub. ""Our nation's ability to lead in advanced nuclear energy is directly tied to our capacity to fuel it here at home,"" said Toby Neugebauer, Co-Founder and CEO, Fermi America. ""This decision helps ensure that America's next generation of nuclear reactors will be powered by American innovation, technology, and resolve.""

""This collaboration represents a decisive step toward securing the nuclear fuel needed for the next wave of advanced reactors,"" said Mesut Uzman, Chief Nuclear Construction Officer, Fermi America. ""It reinforces our mission to build the most advanced, resilient, and secure private grid in the world.""

""Advanced reactors cannot be built without HALEU, and our Quantum Enrichment™ technology is designed to deliver it with speed, precision, and environmental responsibility,"" said Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO, ASP Isotopes Inc. ""Partnering with Fermi America gives us the platform and location to play a central role in the emerging Western HALEU market.""

""Energy security is national security,"" said Rick Perry, Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy. ""This project will help America control its own destiny in nuclear power, create jobs here in Texas, and send a clear message that the United States intends to lead – not follow – in the race for advanced, carbon-free energy.""

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. HALEU demand could exceed 50 metric tons annually by 2035, with similar needs emerging in Europe and Asia. The proposed project would help meet this demand, supporting the clean energy transition while enhancing energy security.

WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that the agency will relaunch its Guidance Portal, a website that serves as a resource for all guidance documents managed across EPA's headquarters environmental programs. This website was launched in the first Trump Administration in an effort to promote transparency within the federal government, but was then shuttered under the Biden-Harris Administration. This week, EPA Deputy Administrator David Fotouhi sat down with Sean Moran from Breitbart News to discuss this effort and the ongoing overall review to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens placed on small business owners, farmers, and everyday Americans.

Read Breitbart’s exclusive article here:

“The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday announced the relaunch of the agency’s Guidance Portal, a website to allow Americans a one-stop shop for regulatory guidance documents as part of the Trump administration’s mission to increase transparency, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.

“President Donald Trump, during his first administration, signed an executive order to establish Guidance Portals to increase transparency; however, the Biden administration swiftly moved to shutter the portal.

“The portal aims to serve as a resource for all guidance documents managed across the EPA headquarters’ environmental programs. It is also designed to be a one-stop shop for users and small businesses to locate compliance documents of interest rather than hire expensive lawyers to help them comply with agency regulations.

“David Fotouhi, whom the Senate confirmed in June to be the agency’s deputy administrator, spoke to Breitbart News about how the Guidance Portal will boost government transparency. Prior to his current role, he served as the EPA’s Acting General Counsel and Principal Deputy General Counsel under the first Trump administration. Before that, he practiced environmental law on a variety of issues.

“He told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview, ‘We have endeavored to compile all of those in one searchable, publicly accessible database, so that if you’re a small business owner, if you’re a farmer or rancher, if you’re in any way subject to one of our regulatory requirements or statutory obligations, you can go on there and conduct a search and see very clearly what the agency’s interpretation of that requirement and how it applies to your situation. It’s in the vein of improving transparency, making sure that folks understand sort of what the agency is responsible for and what obligations they are required to meet in sort of a clear and transparent way.’

“Guidance documents are agency statements of general applicability and are intended to help Americans ‘understand what’s required of them. They’re not supposed to be new requirements.’

“Noting that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has stressed transparency, he said that the Guidance Portal works to ensure that Americans can ‘avoid the situation where someone, a small business owner or whoever, needs to go out and hire a high priced lawyer or a consultant just to help them understand what they need to do to comply with a particular Clean Air Act requirement, or Clean Water Act requirement.’

“Fotouhi added that the database could even help find areas that the agency could streamline EPA guidance.

“He explained, ‘That is part of the goal here is that opening this all up to the public puts them in the driver’s seat of identifying for us where there are areas where more or streamline guidance is needed, and where there may be areas that additional rulemaking or other action is necessary to provide that clarity or regulatory certainty that folks are looking for.’

“Fotouhi said, ‘The president kicked this off in the first term with an executive order to all agencies, and we just view this as sort of keeping the flame burning and trying to carry that out here in the second term because it was a fantastic idea then, and it’s even more necessary right now.’

“He said that the regulation can ensure companies can make business decisions and investments with more regulatory clarity.

“The deputy administrator remarked, ‘They can then go about making decisions on investments and other development here that helps our economic growth without the kind of ambiguity that might be in place if there’s confusion about what’s required.’

“Fotouhi teased that the agency will continue to improve the Guidance Portal to make the search feature even more robust.

“He said, ‘We view this very much as an ongoing process, and that’s just a critical component of making sure the public has notice of what we’re doing.’”",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 14:05:29.896175

Oil industry warns of higher fuel costs, questions proposal's legality

Proposal impacts bio-based diesel reliant on imports

A top U.S. oil trade group on Thursday joined a chorus of complaints against a new government proposal to slash incentives for biofuel imports, testing the Trump administration's resolve to keep the policy in the upcoming months.

The mounting criticism puts the White House in the position of having to side with either farmers looking to prioritize domestic supply, or refiners seeking cheaper feedstock - both groups loyal to President Donald Trump.

At issue is a proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in June that would allocate only half as many tradable renewable fuel credits to imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks as to domestic ones.

The shift, which could be finalized before the year's end, has significant implications for bio-based diesel, which relies on imports to meet federal mandates.

The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires refiners to blend billions of gallons of biofuels into the fuel market, or buy credits known as renewable identification numbers (RINs) from those that do to demonstrate compliance with the program.

The Farm Belt, specifically soybean farmers, hailed the proposed shift as a victory, arguing the RFS was always intended to boost domestic production and that countries like China were flooding the market with cheap supply.

But the oil industry argues the U.S. lacks enough feedstock to meet the federal quotas without imports, tightening an already stretched domestic market and driving prices higher.

""As proposed, it is unworkable and would have significant harmful effects on the overall RFS program and could place upward pressure on fuel costs,"" the American Petroleum Institute said in a letter to the EPA on Thursday, urging the complete removal of the import proposal.

The API also questioned the legality of the proposal in separate comments, signaling the deep-pocketed trade group could be prepared to go to court to challenge the administration.

Refiners and farm groups were unified earlier this year on bio-based diesel, with both arguing that federal quotas needed to be higher. However, the shift on imports caught both industries by surprise.

Even within trade groups, sentiment around the imports proposal is divided.

""There is no consensus among our members on the proposal to reduce the RIN value for fuels produced domestically from foreign feedstock,"" Clean Fuels Alliance America, a biodiesel group, said in comments submitted to the EPA.

Audi A4

Audi’s A4 sedan is on its way out, as previously reported by USA TODAY.

The sedan will be replaced by the new A5 Sportback as part of Audi’s efforts to shift all combustion-engine cars to odd-numbered model names and all even-numbered cars to electric models, said spokesperson Mark Dahncke.

The new A5 Sportback went on sale in June, and a RS 5 high-performance model is expected ""in the near future,"" Dahncke said.

Cadillac XT6, XT4

Cadillac is ending production of the XT6, a three-row SUV, toward the end of 2025. The XT6’s target demographic was households with an annual income of at least $200,000, according to the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.

Production of the gas-powered SUV at parent company General Motors’ Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee is set to be replaced by the Vistiq, a new all-electric SUV, according to the Free Press.

As for the XT4, production of the small SUV at GM's Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas, ended in January.

BMW XM base

BMW is axing half of its XM portfolio. The automaker in June said it would offer just one XM SUV model, the XM Label, and scrap the XM base design for model year 2026.

The XM Label is the most powerful road vehicle produced by BMW M, a subsidiary of BMW focused on high-performance vehicles, with a total system output of 738 horsepower. The XM base, by comparison, offers up to 644 horsepower.

Chevrolet Malibu

General Motors wrapped up production of the Chevrolet Malibu, a midsize sedan, in late 2024, making 2025 the last model year for the nameplate.

The discontinuation comes as GM prepares its Fairfax assembly plant to produce Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles and the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox. In June, the company said the plant is on track to begin building the Bolt by the end of 2025 and the Equinox beginning in mid-2027.

Infiniti QX50, QX55

The QX50 compact luxury SUV and QX55 luxury crossover coupe will no longer be available in the Americas after the 2025 model year, spokesperson Ashli Bobo said.

Bobo noted that the brand offers a “refreshed” QX60 luxury crossover SUV and recently introduced the QX80 Sport, another luxury SUV. Infiniti is also set to unveil two new nameplates: the QX65 crossover coupe and Vision QXe electric SUV.

Lexus LC Hybrid Coupe, RC and RC F

Lexus earlier this year announced that the brand would say goodbye to the RC and RC F sports cars after the 2025 model year. The decision comes after a decade on the market and more than 90,000 units sold, according to a January news release.

Lexus is also dropping the LC Hybrid Coupe in the U.S. market for the 2026 model year. Parent company Toyota’s June sales report shows just 7 LC Hybrids were sold in the first six months of 2025, compared to 790 gas LCs.

Mercedes-Benz EQB

The EQB, an all-electric compact SUV, will not be offered in the United States or Canada after model year 2025. The company remains “fully committed to electrification,"" said spokesperson Andrew Brudnicki, who noted the new all-electric CLA sedan is set to arrive at U.S. dealerships later this year.

Porsche 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman

Porsche confirmed the two 718 sports cars will end production this year. The gas-powered Macan, a compact SUV, is set to end sometime in 2026.

Subaru Legacy

Production of the Subaru Legacy wrapped up this spring, according to a news release from Subaru. The automaker sold more than 1.3 million units spanning six generations in the United States since the sedan's 1989 debut.

In an April statement, Subaru said the discontinuation “reflects market shifts from passenger cars to SUVs and crossovers and Subaru’s transition to electrified and fully electric vehicles."" The company previously announced plans to produce eight electric vehicle models by 2028.

Volvo S60, S90, EC40

Sales of the S60, a midsize luxury sedan, and the S90, a large luxury sedan, ended in the United States with the conclusion of the 2025 model year.

Volvo spokesperson Thomas Schultz said the brand is axing the models as it continues to evaluate its portfolio “to align with customer needs as well as sales demand,” noting that the market for sedans has been waning. Tariffs also played a role in the decision to end S90 sales in the United States, Schultz said.

Volvo ended production of the S60 at its South Carolina plant in 2024 after five years of production, turning its attention to building the EX90 electric SUV and XC60 SUV.

Do you have a question about power outages?","From Winter Storm Blair to Hurricane Beryl in Texas and the more recent Connecticut thunderstorms, power outages from severe weather events have become an increasingly common reality across the United States in recent years.

A nationwide study from the Urban Resilience AI Lab at Texas A&M University has produced the first-ever Power System Vulnerability Index (PSVI)—a classification of each county identifying those most at risk of frequent and prolonged blackouts.

""Using data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we studied the effect of weather events on the frequency and duration of nationwide power outages over the past 10 years,"" explained paper author and civil engineer Junwei Ma in a statement.

""The dataset included over 179 million data points sorted by time and location, allowing us to create the PSVI.""

Where US Power Outages Hit Hardest

The researchers' analysis examined outages between 2014 and 2023 across 3,022 U.S. counties, covering 96 percent of the contiguous United States.

Results showed a steady nationwide rise in power system vulnerability, with 318 counties across 45 states now considered ""hotspots"" for high risk.

Regions Most Vulnerable to Blackouts

According to the PSVI data, the most vulnerable U.S. regions include:

The West Coast, particularly California and Washington

The East Coast, including Florida and the Northeast megalopolis

The Great Lakes corridor (Chicago–Detroit)

Gulf Coast areas of Texas

The average county experienced outages lasting 7.3 days per year—roughly 2 percent of the year without power—with an outage occurring about once a week.

Since 2019, outage duration, frequency, and scale have increased by around 20 percent annually.

Why Vulnerability Is Rising

Researchers linked many spikes in vulnerability to extreme weather disasters such as wildfires in California, hurricanes in Florida, and the 2021 Texas winter storm.

However, non-weather factors, including aging electrical grids, rising energy demand, and urban development density, also play a major role.

Urban counties, with dense populations and infrastructure, showed significantly higher vulnerability than rural areas.

""Dense street trees, heavy electricity demand, and concentrated infrastructure mean cities are hit harder and recover more slowly from outages,"" Ma explained.

How the Power System Vulnerability Index Works

The PSVI was built using explainable A.I., a machine learning method that weighs outage frequency, intensity, and duration to produce a county-by-county score.

This publicly available tool allows users to explore vulnerability trends over the past decade and compare risks nationwide.

""We're turning 179 million messy outage logs into a roadmap for prevention—showing each county whether its biggest pain point is too many outages, too long, or too large,"" paper author and civil engineer professor Ali Mostafavi told Newsweek.

Why It Matters

The team also warned that many A.I. data centers and critical facilities are located in high-risk zones, underscoring the need for targeted investment in resilient infrastructure as severe weather events are expected to become more frequent.

""The data show a clear pattern: U.S. power outages are becoming more frequent, longer, and clustered in hotspot counties,"" Mostafavi said.

""By turning high-frequency outage logs into a county-level Power-System Vulnerability Index, we see not only where the grid struggles, but why—whether the main issue is too many events, too many customers affected, or restorations that take too long.

""Without targeted upgrades, today's chronic pockets will intensify during climate extremes.""

The index represents the first transparent, nationwide, county-level view of grid vulnerability built from high-frequency, utility-reported outages, Mostafavi continued.

""It moves the conversation from anecdotes to comparable metrics every policymaker can understand.""

He concluded: ""With climate extremes intensifying and electrification accelerating, leaders need clear, data-driven targets for hardening the grid and protecting residents.""

RELATED: Donald Trump Uses Emergency Powers to Boost U.S. Critical Mineral (and Coal?)","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has announced a nearly $1 billion program to strengthen America’s supply of critical minerals and materials. The funding will support mining, processing, and manufacturing within the country. These materials power clean energy technologies and are vital for national security.

This funding builds on President Trump’s Executive Order to Unleash American Energy. It also supports the DOE’s wider Critical Minerals and Materials Program, which focuses on boosting U.S. production, expanding recycling, and strengthening supply chain security.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright remarked:

“For too long, the United States has relied on foreign actors to supply and process the critical materials that are essential to modern life and our national security. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department will play a leading role in reshoring the processing of critical materials and expanding our domestic supply of these indispensable resources.”

From Mines to Magnets: Where the $1B Goes

The DOE’s $1 billion plan targets key minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements. These are essential for electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and advanced electronics used in defense systems.

The funding is split across several areas:

$500 million to the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) for battery material processing, manufacturing, and recycling projects.

$250 million to the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management to support facilities producing mineral byproducts from coal and other sources.

$135 million to boost rare earth element production by extracting them from mining waste streams.

$50 million to refine materials like gallium, germanium, and silicon carbide, which are crucial for semiconductors and high-performance electronics.

$40 million through ARPA-E’s RECOVER program to extract minerals from industrial wastewater and other waste streams.

By investing from extraction to refining, the DOE aims to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, especially those in politically unstable regions. The plan also encourages public–private partnerships to scale production faster.

Why Critical Minerals Matter for America’s Future

Critical minerals lie at the heart of America’s economic transformation and defense strategy. In recent years, demand for lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements has grown. This rise comes as clean energy technologies become more important.

The U.S. imports more than 80% of its rare earth elements, and most of this comes from one country – China. This heavy reliance creates risks during trade or geopolitical tensions.

The Trump administration has placed strong emphasis on closing this vulnerability. In March 2025, an executive order highlighted critical minerals as vital for national defense. It also set timelines to boost U.S. production and processing capacity. This aligns with broader economic priorities, including clean energy jobs, green infrastructure, and domestic manufacturing.

RELATED: Donald Trump Uses Emergency Powers to Boost U.S. Critical Mineral (and Coal?) Production

The Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure programs have unlocked billions in grants and tax credits. These funds support electric vehicle manufacturing, battery plants, and renewable energy projects.

The DOE’s $1 billion critical mineral fund supports programs by focusing on materials essential for the clean energy economy. Also, by reusing existing industrial facilities to recover minerals instead of building entirely new ones, the DOE can speed up progress and reduce costs.

EV production is expected to grow faster than any other sector, with demand for minerals likely to be more than 10x higher by 2050. This surge will transform the global supply chain and is critical for the global Net Zero aspirations.

The combined impact of industrial strategy, financial incentives, and supply chain investments shows a clear push to:

Move production back onshore,

Boost innovation in materials recycling,

Support the energy transition, and

Cut down on foreign imports.

Building on Early Wins

The DOE’s new $1 billion investment boosts earlier funding for critical minerals. This aims to strengthen U.S. industrial capacity.

In 2023, the Department gave $150 million to various clean mineral projects. These include direct lithium extraction in Nevada and early-stage nickel processing partnerships in Oregon.

Since 2021, DOE has invested more than $58 million in research. This work focuses on recovering critical minerals from industrial waste or tailings. They are turning by-products into valuable feedstock.

These R&D projects created pilot facilities. They show how to recover lithium from geothermal brines and rare earths from coal ash. This approach models resource use without needing new mining.

Built on these early successes, the new $1 billion fund signals a shift from pilot programs to scaling proven technologies. It allows U.S. manufacturers to pivot from lab-scale experiments to full commercial operations.

For example, lithium recovery projects are moving from test sites to large extraction facilities. This shift is supported by the technical help from DOE’s national labs.

Likewise, battery recycling pilots are set to grow. More recycling centers are being planned in the Midwest and Southwest.

This funding approach provides continuity. It supports U.S. firms from basic research to commercialization. This helps them quickly move from proof-of-concept to production-ready operations. It also reassures private investors that government backing is strategic and sustained.

McKinsey projects that developing new copper and nickel projects will require between $250 billion and $350 billion by 2030. By 2050, the broader critical minerals sector could grow into a trillion-dollar market to support the net-zero or low-carbon transition.

Washington’s Backing, Industry’s Buy-In

Political backing for the domestic minerals strategy is strong. A recent executive order aims to speed up mining permits and provide federal support.

The Defense Department has also invested $400 million in MP Materials, the largest stakeholder in the only U.S. rare earth mine. This deal includes a new plant to produce magnets for electronics and defense applications.

Industry players are moving in the same direction. Battery maker Clarios is exploring sites for a $1 billion processing and recovery plant in the country. These moves show a shared goal between government and industry to rebuild America’s mineral supply chains.

Opportunities—and the Roadblocks Ahead

The DOE’s program offers major opportunities:

Less reliance on foreign countries for essential materials.

Creation of high-quality U.S. jobs.

Growth in recycling and recovery technologies.

However, challenges remain. Mining and processing must be done without harming the environment. Technology costs need to stay competitive. And benefits must be shared fairly with local and Indigenous communities.

Amid all this, the global race for critical minerals is intensifying. Many countries are already securing their own supplies. The U.S. wants to close its supply gap and become a leader in clean energy manufacturing.

The DOE’s nearly $1 billion plan is a key step toward reshoring America’s critical minerals industry. It builds on earlier successes and aligns with private investments and new policies. If successful, it could make U.S. supply chains more secure, support the clean energy transition, and strengthen national security.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2603773617.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 13:04:42.478535

Grid Strategies noted that DOE also ordered the retention of the two-unit Eddystone oil and gas power plant in Pennsylvania, even though its owner had planned to retire the aging plant.
“DOE mandates are overriding cost-minimizing retirement decisions that have been made by state utility regulators and merchant power plant owners based on extensive information regarding the cost, performance, condition and need for each plant,” Grid Strategies said.
In the high estimate scenario, applying a conservative 60-year plant age screen, DOE mandates could result in annual ratepayer costs exceeding $5.9 billion by the end of 2028, the analysis suggests.
We have reached out to DOE for comment and will update this story when we have the latest.","Mandates by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to override aging fossil-fired plant retirements could exceed $3 billion annually, according to an analysis by Grid Strategies, conducted on behalf of Earthjustice and other environmental groups.

To date, DOE has issued two orders mandating the retention of two plants.

Consumers Energy had planned to close the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power station by May 31 until DOE intervened days earlier, saying the plant must remain open at least until late August, because of possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S. Eight utility commissions challenged DOE’s emergency order.

Keeping the J.H. Campbell coal-fired plant online under a federal emergency order cost Consumers $29 million between May and June 2025, according to the utility’s latest quarterly filings.

Grid Strategies noted that DOE also ordered the retention of the two-unit Eddystone oil and gas power plant in Pennsylvania, even though its owner had planned to retire the aging plant.

“DOE mandates are overriding cost-minimizing retirement decisions that have been made by state utility regulators and merchant power plant owners based on extensive information regarding the cost, performance, condition and need for each plant,” Grid Strategies said.

Based on current trends and outreach to plant owners, DOE may attempt to require nearly all large fossil plants scheduled to retire before the end of 2028 to remain in service, the power sector consultant said. The low estimate here is 34,948 megawatts (MW) of capacity, and the high estimate is 66,337 MW.

Grid Strategies’ analysis uses the cost of recent Reliability Must Run (RMR) contracts as a proxy, estimating an average of $89,315/MW-year, though actual costs from recent DOE orders—such as Campbell’s—suggest this may be a conservative figure.

Under the low estimate, annualized ratepayer costs could exceed $3.1 billion by January 2029 as more plants are forced to stay online past their planned retirement dates.

In the high estimate scenario, applying a conservative 60-year plant age screen, DOE mandates could result in annual ratepayer costs exceeding $5.9 billion by the end of 2028, the analysis suggests.

While exact retirement dates for these age-based units are unknown, Grid Strategies says their geographic distribution is expected to mirror that of scheduled retirements, with state-level costs roughly double those in the low estimate.

But could it actually happen in 2025?

While Republican Sen. Josh Hawley quickly jumped on board and introduced legislation, the idea has fallen flat among his colleagues.

Will there be a 2025 stimulus check?

While Republicans control the White House, the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, Hawley's plan immediately faced heavy criticism from within his own party.

Several Republican senators shot down the tariff rebate check plan publicly, calling the proposal everything from ""a bad idea"" to ""insane."" Most conservatives instead want to use any tariff revenue to pay down the national debt.

Financial experts tend to agree that while tariffs are formally imposed on foreign exporters, the actual cost is shouldered by U.S. companies importing goods. These additional costs are then usually passed on to American consumers as higher prices.

What is the American Worker Rebate Act?

Hawley introduced legislation to provide tariff rebate checks of at least $600 per adult and child, similar to the stimulus checks the government provided during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The program would work as a refundable tax credit, with the government sending out checks if the legislation gets through Congress and if Trump signs it.

Trump has teased sending other rebate checks

In February, Trump said that he liked the idea of giving some of the savings from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency back to U.S. citizens as a kind of dividend.

He said at an investment conference in Miami that the administration was considering a concept in which 20% of the savings produced by DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts goes to American citizens and another 20% goes to paying down the national debt.",https://media.krem.com/assets/CCT/images/de14d697-824a-4960-81a4-a0345a2150d9/20250815T160829/de14d697-824a-4960-81a4-a0345a2150d9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 15:02:41.909174

Fast chargers are typically defined as infrastructure that can deliver an 80% charge to an electric vehicle within 45 minutes.
That’s a lot of money, but Gartner said the incentive program is a good use of state dollars.
Gavin Newsom in 2020 issued an executive order banning the sale of new gasoline-powered cars, SUVs and light trucks by 2035 — although President Donald Trump recently signed congressional resolutions rescinding California EV mandates.
Since 2017, CALeVIP has help support the development of nearly 10,000 EV chargers across the state.","The California Energy Commission recently launched a $55 million incentive program to expand the construction of fast chargers for electric vehicles in public and business sites across the state.

“One of the common concerns from surveys we’ve done is motorists say, ‘Hey, there’s not enough chargers close to me for me to consider buying an EV,’ ” said John Gartner, senior director of transportation programs at the Center for Sustainable Energy, the San Diego-based nonprofit that administers the initiative.

“So this is an important program to help fill the gaps in charging infrastructure and give people who may be new to EVs more confidence that they will be able to find a convenient place to charge nearby.”

Called the Fast Charge California Project, the program is part of the California Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Project (CALeVIP), the largest EV charging incentive initiative in the country.

The $55 million project aims to attract proprietors of places such as convenience stores, gas stations, shopping areas, parking lots and other high-traffic destinations to build fast-charging infrastructure.

Up to $100,000 in incentives are offered, depending on the output of each charging port. To qualify, sites must be accessible to the public. Priority will be given to locations in tribal areas and disadvantaged and low-income communities.

Fast chargers are typically defined as infrastructure that can deliver an 80% charge to an electric vehicle within 45 minutes.

The projects must be ready to build and have final utility service design and all required permits in hand.

Details on the eligibility requirements and instructions on how to apply can be found at the calevip.org/fast-charge-california-project webpage. Applications will be accepted through Oct. 29.

The money for the CALeVIP comes from the energy commission’s Clean Transportation Program, which was created by a bill passed by the California Legislature in 2016 and then extended in 2024. The program is funded through an increase in the smog abatement fee that Golden State drivers of newer cars pay.

CALeVIP also gets money from the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that receives revenue generated by the state’s cap and trade program, which requires power plants, natural gas providers and large industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy permits on the carbon pollution they produce.

Late last year, the energy commission touted that California policymakers have earmarked more than $10 billion to boost the adoption of zero-emission vehicles and their corresponding infrastructure.

That’s a lot of money, but Gartner said the incentive program is a good use of state dollars.

“Electricity costs a lot less to fuel a vehicle than petroleum products,” Gartner said. “And then of course, also there are the health benefits from vehicle electrification as well — having people pull up to a charging station with zero emissions at that location is advantageous to going to a fuel pump and having all the emissions associated with petroleum products.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 issued an executive order banning the sale of new gasoline-powered cars, SUVs and light trucks by 2035 — although President Donald Trump recently signed congressional resolutions rescinding California EV mandates.

Newsom, along with 10 other governors, responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress.

Another key point the administration wants to uphold, Mr. Agostinho said, is the veto that preserved the federal government’s authority over environmental licensing and blocked states from expanding their role.","The bill, which was submitted to amend parts of the legislation vetoed by Mr. Lula, has constitutional urgency status, meaning it must be approved by both the lower and upper houses of Congress within 45 days. The MP, which accelerates the implementation of a Special Environmental License (LAE), takes immediate effect but must be voted on within 120 days or it will expire.

Mr. Agostinho also said he will personally engage lawmakers to prevent the vetoes from being overturned. “I’ll speak with all the congressional leaders I know. The idea is to start a dialogue and express our concerns,” he said.

During the vote on the licensing bill in July, the Lula administration faced criticism for being politically isolated and failing to mobilize its congressional base, according to legislative sources. Now, the plan is to mount a stronger lobbying effort to stop the push to reverse the vetoes.

Mr. Agostinho said the government intends to argue that environmental licensing is “not something that holds the country back,” countering claims from the business sector that licensing procedures hinder economic development. “Projects are not being stopped,” he noted. “Companies come to IBAMA every day to discuss the progress of their licensing processes.”

The IBAMA chief called the law signed by Mr. Lula “reasonable” and said the vetoes were welcomed by the agency. He emphasized the importance of key provisions in the bill and the MP that were sent to Congress in recent days and should be preserved.

One of those is the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), a self-declared license that, under the version proposed by the government, would apply only to projects with low environmental impact. “Allowing LACs for medium-impact projects is a legal aberration and an unnecessary risk, 90% of projects in Brazil fall under this category,” Mr. Agostinho warned.

The version passed by Congress had extended the LAC to medium-impact projects as well, which the Supreme Federal Court (STF) has already ruled unconstitutional in similar state-level legislation.

Another key point the administration wants to uphold, Mr. Agostinho said, is the veto that preserved the federal government’s authority over environmental licensing and blocked states from expanding their role. “We can’t have each state handling licensing on its own. It would be very problematic to let every entity decide.”

Mr. Agostinho also defended the Special Environmental License (LAE), which the government retained and reformulated through the MP sent to Congress. He rejected claims that the instrument would benefit oil exploration at the mouth of the Amazon River. That area is the political stronghold of Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (Brazil Union Party – Amapá), who sponsored the LAE in Congress’s original bill.

“We’ll talk to lawmakers, the House and Senate leadership, and all congressional caucuses open to dialogue. The path the government chose is the best for everyone,” the minister said during the “Bom Dia, Ministra” program on public broadcaster EBC.

Ms. Silva explained that the vetoes aimed to speed up the licensing process “but not at the expense of environmental protection,” and without undermining the legal certainty of infrastructure projects.

Brazil’s Congress sees U.S. tariff relief with caution

The economic team is also seeking progress this month on the bill to reduce corporate tax benefits. Negotiations are ongoing with Congressman Aguinaldo Ribeiro of the Progressive Party (PP) representing Paraíba, who was appointed rapporteur of Complementary Bill 41/2019, which addresses the review of tax incentives.

The bill itself sets minimum criteria for granting tax, financial, or credit-related benefits and outlines a policy for periodic assessments of their economic and social impact. The economic team plans to use the bill to reduce non-constitutional tax benefits for companies, aiming to save at least R$20 billion in 2026.

Another item in the queue is the bill on the Selective Tax, which will apply to products considered harmful to health and the environment, such as cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. The consumption tax reform passed last year created this tax, which will come into effect in 2027, but the tax rates will be defined in a separate bill. A draft with several rate scenarios is ready and awaits Mr. Haddad’s green light.

It will be up to the minister and the president’s office to decide when to send the proposal to Congress. The technical team behind the draft is pushing for it to be submitted as soon as possible, arguing that this year is ideal for passage, especially with general elections coming up next year.

""One thing to note in the report is that the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has experienced the most advisory or alert days for PM2.5 with 21 days issued compared to 15 in the Detroit area,"" said meteorology specialist Stephanie Hengesbach of the Air Quality Division.

The Upper Peninsula saw more advisories because it is closer in proximity to the wildfires and saw episodes where the smoke lingered, not drifting northward, Hengesbach said.

As of Aug. 14, the 31 calendar days of unhealthy air in Michigan did not surprise officals writing the forecasts.

""This has been an active fire season in Canada and while the number of wildfires so far this season is just below the 10-year average, the number of hectares burned is well above the 10-year average,"" Henegsbach said. ""The current year of 2025 so far ranks the second highest fire season, second to the 2023 fire season.""

In Canada, as of Aug. 13, there are 713 active wildfires with 155 out of control from British Columbia to Newfoundland and Labrador according to Canada's National Fire Situation Report.

In addition, 26 new wildfires were reported in seven provinces on Aug. 13.

Here's more on the air quality so far in Michigan 2025:

How many air quality advisories have been issued in Michigan 2025?

From May 30 to Aug. 12, 27 air quality advisories were issued with nine advisories reaching statewide concern.

In addition, from July 30 through Aug. 5, there were seven statewide advisories issued consecutively.

How many air quality alerts have been issued in Michigan?

In total, four air quality alerts have been issued — two were on a statewide level and the other two were for the Upper Peninsula.

From May 30 to Aug. 6, the western and eastern Upper Peninsula saw 19 advisories and alerts for high PM2.5 levels; Detroit saw 15; Traverse City, 15; Lansing, 13; and Grand Rapids, 13.

How does Michigan's 2025 air quality report compare to others?

As of Aug. 14, the 31 total air quality alerts and advisories issued in 2025 match the 31 total pollution days reported in 2023, Hengesbach said.

Canadian wildfire map: Where are the wildfires?

As of Aug. 13, here are the Candian provinces with new wildfires, per the National Fire Situation Report:

British Columbia: 3

Alberta: 2

Northwest Territories: 2

Saskatchewan: 2

Quebec: 4

New Brunswick: 7

Nova Scotia: 7

What is the difference between an air quality alert and advisory?

According to the AQD, air quality advisories are issued when pollution is unhealthy for sensitive groups with PM 2.5 levels of 101-150.

Air quality alerts are issued when PM 2.5 levels are 151-300, which are unhealthy to very healthy for the entire population.

What does PM2.5 mean on the air quality index?

This unit is used to measure the fine particulate matter in the air, such as smoke, dust, soot or dirt.

The ""2.5"" figure means particles are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, according to the EPA — that is 30 times smaller than the average human hair, which is about 70 micrometers in diameter.

The group’s lawsuit challenges the secret formation and hidden activities of the Climate Working Group – the group of climate skeptics convened by Secretary Wright.

“Secretary Wright's actions in secretly commissioning a sham science report by known climate contrarians fall well short of what people need and deserve.
“Conversely, decades of rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis confirm what people across the country are experiencing: burning fossil fuels is unequivocally contributing to dangerous, deadly and costly climate change impacts.","(August 15, 2025) Two leading science and environment groups are asking a federal district court to swiftly block the use of an inaccurate “science” report, developed in violation of federal law, at the center of the Trump administration’s attempt to undo EPA’s Endangerment Finding – the determination, based on mountains of scientific evidence, that climate pollution harms people’s health and well-being. Americans are already suffering from the real-world impacts of climate change including worsening flooding, fires and heat waves and rising insurance costs.

The report at issue was developed in secret by people hand-picked by Trump Secretary of Energy Chris Wright for their distorted views of climate science to provide recommendations on vital government decisions that could make daily life for millions of Americans less safe and less affordable.

Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts last night as part of their lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Energy and Secretary Christopher Wright in his official capacity as head of that department, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin in his official capacity as head of that agency, and the Climate Working Group.

The group’s lawsuit challenges the secret formation and hidden activities of the Climate Working Group – the group of climate skeptics convened by Secretary Wright. The Group wrote a report that uses scientific data inaccurately, fundamentally misrepresents many of the findings it cites, and has been denounced by scientists whose research it contorts. Trump EPA Administrator Zeldin is relying extensively on that report to support his proposal to overturn the Endangerment Finding, and to destroy common sense limits on climate pollution for the largest U.S. emitters.

“Federal law requires advisory committees to act with transparency, public participation, and consideration of balanced perspectives to ensure government decisions are based in integrity and not improperly influenced by secret interests. This report is a brazen violation of federal law that undermines our government’s role in addressing climate change, putting millions of Americans in harm’s way,” said EDF Senior Attorney Erin Murphy. “Secretary Wright unlawfully formed, in secret, a group of climate skeptics to write a report filled with inaccuracies and misrepresentations about climate change — and EPA Administrator Zeldin is trying to use it to undermine pollution limits. That would make life less safe and less affordable for millions of people all across the country.""

“Secretary Wright's actions in secretly commissioning a sham science report by known climate contrarians fall well short of what people need and deserve. The scientific community and the public were intentionally kept in the dark even as this report, which could have extremely consequential ramifications for our daily lives, was being written,” said Dr. Pallavi Phartiyal, UCS Vice President of Programs, Policy and Advocacy. “Conversely, decades of rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific analysis confirm what people across the country are experiencing: burning fossil fuels is unequivocally contributing to dangerous, deadly and costly climate change impacts. UCS will not stay silent against this attempt to rewrite legitimate and established science.”

In March of this year, shortly after being confirmed as Secretary of Energy, Wright quietly arranged for five hand-picked authors, most of whom have ties to fossil fuel industries, to write a new report that would “cut against the prevailing narrative that climate change is an existential threat.” That report was held secret from the public until after EPA Administrator Zeldin relied on it extensively to support his proposal to overturn the Endangerment Finding, citing it 22 times. However, in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which was passed in the wake of Nixon-era scandals, Congress directed that federal government advisory committees cannot form or operate in secret, that materials they create must be available to the public, and that they must have balanced membership.

Records obtained yesterday by EDF through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) further reveal the questionable actions of Secretary Wright’s secretly convened working group. On February 13, 2025, one member of the group – Dr. Steven Koonin – emailed EPA Administrator Zeldin’s Chief of Staff to “offer technical assistance from me and colleagues in the review of the Endangerment Finding.” The Chief of Staff responded on February 16 and shared that EPA was “moving right along on this topic,” and asked if Dr. Koonin would “be available to jump on a call.”

In their motion, EDF and UCS state that, “This case presents one of the most straightforward — and consequential — violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act … since the law was enacted fifty-three years ago. … [We] file this motion to bring an immediate end to the lawless operation of and reliance on the [Climate Working Group] before it is too late to repair the enormous harm being caused.” (Motion, page 1)

The motion asks the court to preliminarily enjoin the unlawful actions in establishing, operating, and utilizing the “Climate Working Group,” to order the Group to disclose all records as required by law, to enjoin operation by the Group unless and until they comply with federal law, and to stop the Trump administration from using the Group’s unlawfully produced report.",https://www.edf.org/themes/edf2020/favicons/favicon-96x96.png,N,,2025-08-15 13:06:27.228785

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Cody Two Bear, who is Standing Rock Sioux, served on his tribal council during the Dakota Access pipeline protests in 2017. Growing up in a community powered by coal, the experience was transformative. “I’ve seen the energy extraction that has placed a toll significantly on tribal nations when it comes to land, animals, water, and sacred sites,” said Two Bear. “Understanding more about that energy, I started to look into my own tribe as a whole.”

In 2018, Two Bear founded Indigenize Energy, a nonprofit organization that works with tribes to pursue energy sovereignty and economic development by kickstarting clean energy projects. Last year, with nearly $136 million in federal funding through Solar for All, a program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the nonprofit launched the Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition, which aims to build solar projects with 14 tribal nations in the Northern Plains.

But when President Donald Trump took office in January, those projects hit a wall: The Trump administration froze Solar for All’s funding. That temporarily left the coalition and its members earlier this year without access to their entitled grant (it was later released in March). However, the EPA is considering ending the program entirely.

The coalition is back on track with its solar plans, but now tribes and organizations, like the ones Two Bear works with, are bracing for new changes.

When President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, or OBBB, became law last month, incentives for clean energy projects like wind and solar tax credits and clean energy grants were cut—a blow to the renewable energy sector and a major setback to tribal nations. Moves from federal agencies to end programs have shifted the project landscape as well. The current number of impacted projects run by tribes is unknown. According to the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, at least 100 tribes they have worked with have received funds from federal agencies and the Inflation Reduction Act; however, those figures could be higher. “Without that support, most of, if not all of those projects are now at risk for being killed by the new unclear federal approval process,” said John Lewis, the Native American Energy managing director for Avant Energy, a consulting company.

The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, for instance, has planned solar projects reliant on federal tax cuts. The projects were designed to power a community health clinic, schools, and a radio station that broadcasts emergency notices during winter storms. However, with the passage of the OBBB, the tribe must now begin construction by July of next year or lose credits, a feat that doesn’t account for the time it takes to secure capital in various stages, seek a complete environmental review, and navigate long permitting timelines through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

“Some of these projects, at a minimum, have stalled, or they’re having to be reworked in some way to fit within the current parameters that have been laid down by the administration,” said Verrin Kewenvoyouma, who is Hopi and Navajo, and a managing partner at Kewenvoyouma Law, a firm that assists tribes with environmental permitting, cultural resources, and energy development. “We have clients that are looking at creative solutions, trying to keep them alive.”

In June, the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, a joint organization representing 12 federally recognized tribes in the state, joined a class action lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency, alongside a tribe in Alaska, arguing that the agency illegally froze access to promised project funds from the Environmental and Climate Justice block grant program. The now-defunct program promised $3 billion to 350 recipients to fund projects addressing pollution and high energy costs. Plaintiffs hope the program will be reinstated so that pending projects can be restarted.

Tribes are now seeking philanthropy, short-term funding, and conventional financing to cover delays and gaps in project costs. After the Guidiville Band of Pomo Indians in California lost access to a $3.55 million BIA award to the tribe for solar microgrid development in March, the BQuest Foundation, which specializes in covering expenses needed to continue housing or climate-related projects, gave the tribe $1 million to resume the project’s timeline.

Currently, the self-funded Alliance is covering tribal projects that have experienced a sudden loss in tax credits, rescission of federal funds, and uncertainty of direct pay. “We’re helping try to navigate this challenging period and continue on their self-determined paths, whatever it looks like for them—to energy sovereignty,” said Shéri Smith, CEO of the organization. At the moment, the Alliance is offering a mix of grants from $50 to $500,000 and loans up to $1 million, which will be converted to grants should a tribe default.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/UtilityIndigenous.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-15 13:07:11.616807

The Justice Department this week filed two complaints in federal courts against the California Air Resources Board (CARB) regarding the State’s enforcement of preempted emissions standards through its so-called “Clean Truck Partnership” with heavy-duty truck and engine manufacturers. A parallel filing in the court of appeals addresses CARB’s rules for light-duty vehicles, which are also preempted. These actions advance President Donald J. Trump’s commitment to end the electric vehicle (EV) mandate, level the regulatory playing field, and promote consumer choice in motor vehicles.

The Clean Air Act preempts state regulation of vehicle emissions unless the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grants California a preemption waiver. Under the Biden administration, EPA granted preemption waivers for two CARB regulations imposing stringent emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks. The goal of CARB’s regulations is to implement an EV mandate in California and in other states that adopt California’s rules.

In June 2025, President Trump signed into law congressional resolutions under the Congressional Review Act, invalidating EPA’s preemption waivers for CARB’s heavy-duty truck regulations. Without these waivers, the Clean Air Act prohibits CARB from attempting to enforce those regulations. Yet, in an affront to the rule of law, CARB seeks to circumvent that prohibition by enforcing the preempted emissions standards through the Clean Truck Partnership. The Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) filed the complaints with motions to intervene in pending cases in the Eastern District of California and Northern District of Illinois.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of ENRD. “President Donald Trump and Congress have invalidated the Clean Air Act waivers that were the basis for California’s actions. CARB must respect the democratic process and stop enforcing unlawful standards.”

In related actions, ENRD moved to dismiss as moot two sets of cases in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit where industry groups had challenged EPA’s preemption waivers for cars. Those cases are now moot because Congress’s joint resolutions nullified the controversial preemption waivers.

ENRD is responsible for bringing cases against those who violate the nation’s environmental laws, as well as defending the federal government in litigation arising under a broad range of environmental statutes. The division is the nation’s environmental lawyer, and the largest environmental law firm in the country.

Chief of Staff and Senior General Counsel John Adams and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert Stander of ENRD filed the complaints, and attorneys with ENRD’s Appellate section are handling the cases in the Ninth Circuit.

Fermi America is developing an 11 GW private grid campus in collaboration with the Texas Tech University System. The campus will initially include four AP1000 nuclear units using conventional fuel, with potential to add advanced reactor technologies later.

""Our nation’s ability to lead in advanced nuclear energy is directly tied to our capacity to fuel it here at home,"" said Toby Neugebauer, Co-Founder and CEO of Fermi America, according to the company’s press release.

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates domestic HALEU demand could exceed 50 metric tons annually by 2035, with similar requirements expected in Europe and Asia.

Rick Perry, Fermi America Co-Founder and former U.S. Energy Secretary, called the project important for American energy security and job creation in Texas.

ASP Isotopes, through its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy, will provide its Quantum Enrichment technology for the facility. Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASP Isotopes, said the partnership gives the company a platform to play a central role in the emerging Western HALEU market.

Currently, few commercial HALEU suppliers operate in Western countries, making this development potentially significant for advanced nuclear deployment in the United States. Investors should note ASPI’s high beta of 3.39 indicates significant stock volatility, though the company expects substantial growth with analysts forecasting 501% revenue expansion this year, according to InvestingPro data.

In other recent news, ASP Isotopes Inc. has announced several significant developments. The company priced a $60 million offering of common stock, selling 7.5 million shares at $8.00 each to a single institutional investor, with the transaction expected to close soon. Additionally, ASP Isotopes has formed a joint venture with Fermi America to develop advanced nuclear fuel production facilities in Texas, focusing on High Assay Low Enriched Uranium for small modular reactors. In another strategic move, ASP Isotopes partnered with Isotopia Molecular Imaging to enhance the production of Terbium-161, a promising isotope for cancer treatment. This partnership aims to ensure a steady supply of Gadolinium-160, crucial for Terbium-161 production.

Moreover, ASP Isotopes has invested $5 million in seed funding for IsoBio, a company developing antibody-isotope conjugates for cancer therapy. The company also appointed Dr. Ryno Pretorius as the CEO of its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, which focuses on advanced nuclear fuels. These recent activities highlight ASP Isotopes’ ongoing efforts to expand its footprint in nuclear fuel and medical isotope production.

“We’re accelerating the ramp of our advanced manufacturing capabilities to support a resilient U.S. solar supply chain.","The tenuous but in-place American solar supply chain just got considerably stronger. It’s about time renewable energy advocates got some good news heading into the weekend!

On Friday, T1 Energy and Corning announced a partnership that will establish a fully domestic solar supply chain, including polysilicon, wafers, cells, and panels manufactured in the United States.

T1 will source hyper-pure polysilicon and solar wafers produced by Corning at its Michigan campus as part of the strategic commercial agreement. Starting in the second half of 2026, Corning wafers will be delivered to T1’s G2_Austin solar cell facility, which is currently under development. These cells will then be used to manufacture solar modules at T1’s operational G1_Dallas site.

The deal between T1 and Corning delivers a more stable and predictable supply of domestically sourced solar components at a time when supply chain (and cost) certainty is as important as ever. By connecting American-made polysilicon, wafers, cells, and modules, Corning and T1 believe their vertically integrated model supports long-term planning, regulatory compliance, and energy resilience.

“This landmark supply chain agreement with Corning will help invigorate America with scalable, reliable, low-cost energy,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security. The U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial know-how. Together with Corning, we intend to accelerate America’s ability to manufacture leading-edge solar solutions, support a total of nearly 6,000 American jobs, and promote American energy independence.”

“Corning is proud to help meet the growing need for solar products made in the United States,” stated AB Ghosh, Corning Vice President and General Manager of Solar and Chairman and CEO of Hemlock Semiconductor. “We’re accelerating the ramp of our advanced manufacturing capabilities to support a resilient U.S. solar supply chain. Our agreement with T1 underscores the strong demand for high-quality, American-made solar technologies. By building foundational infrastructure in Michigan, we’re adding good-paying manufacturing jobs, strengthening the U.S. solar industry, and advancing a more energy-independent future for the country.”

The first fully domestic solar module supply chain came together in March of this year, a combination of efforts between Suniva, Heliene, and Corning. The landmark module contains a solar cell with up to 66% domestic content, the highest percentage on the market, a significant advantage for developers via the IRA’s Investment Tax Credit (ITC) domestic content bonus. Suniva and Heliene teamed up to produce the first domestic content-eligible PV modules available in the U.S. last year.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-15-2025-11_25_38-AM.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 12:10:10.930254

AMARILLO, Texas, Aug. 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, developer of the 11 GW private grid campus for next-generation hyperscale AI in collaboration with the Texas Tech University System, today announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ASP Isotopes Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPI) and its subsidiary Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE) to explore the development of a High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) enrichment facility at Fermi America's site in Carson County, Texas.

The planned facility would use advanced laser-based isotope separation technology to produce HALEU — a specialized nuclear fuel essential for many Generation IV and small modular reactor (SMR) designs. With very few commercial HALEU suppliers currently operating in the Western world, the project is intended to strengthen U.S. and allied supply chains, reduce reliance on Russian enrichment, and accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.

Fermi America's private grid campus will be anchored by four AP1000® nuclear units using conventional fuel, with the potential to integrate advanced reactor technologies in future phases. The addition of domestic HALEU production capability would position the private grid as both a significant clean energy generator and a strategic nuclear fuel hub. ""Our nation's ability to lead in advanced nuclear energy is directly tied to our capacity to fuel it here at home,"" said Toby Neugebauer, Co-Founder and CEO, Fermi America. ""This decision helps ensure that America's next generation of nuclear reactors will be powered by American innovation, technology, and resolve.""

""This collaboration represents a decisive step toward securing the nuclear fuel needed for the next wave of advanced reactors,"" said Mesut Uzman, Chief Nuclear Construction Officer, Fermi America. ""It reinforces our mission to build the most advanced, resilient, and secure private grid in the world.""

""Advanced reactors cannot be built without HALEU, and our Quantum Enrichment™ technology is designed to deliver it with speed, precision, and environmental responsibility,"" said Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO, ASP Isotopes Inc. ""Partnering with Fermi America gives us the platform and location to play a central role in the emerging Western HALEU market.""

""Energy security is national security,"" said Rick Perry, Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy. ""This project will help America control its own destiny in nuclear power, create jobs here in Texas, and send a clear message that the United States intends to lead – not follow – in the race for advanced, carbon-free energy.""

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. HALEU demand could exceed 50 metric tons annually by 2035, with similar needs emerging in Europe and Asia. The proposed project would help meet this demand, supporting the clean energy transition while enhancing energy security.

But in 2015 the business shut down due to insurance challenges.

Now, the Buffalo born car share company is relaunching, with a new piloting service featuring all electric cars. One of the first EV hubs to open to car share members will be located at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.

This time, the insurance issues have been solved thanks to support from then Senators Sean Ryan and Tim Kennedy, who helped to pass a bill in the NYS Senate, That effort, in 2023, ultimately provided insurance protections for non-profit carsharing. The new effort – Mobility Development Operations (or MDO) – is under the direction of Buffalo Carshare’s co-founder and first Executive Director, Creighton Randall.

Mobility Development Operations (or MDO), helmed by Buffalo Carshare’s co-founder and first Executive Director, Creighton Randall, was established in 2018 to support cities, transit agencies, and non-profits to grow similar community-controlled models.

Buffalo is one of a number of communities that will soon have access to MDO services. MDO currently operates in 10 states, with over 100 cars in operation.

“We’ve built partnerships across the country based on what we learned in Buffalo many years ago. Having access to Carshare had a huge impact on people’s lives across the City,” said Randall, who noted that the Buffalo Carshare model inspired significant equity investments (over $150 Million nationally) and eventually led to the founding of MDO to sustain programs in hard to serve small and mid-sized cities. “I saw that personally and it inspired a career for me – so to bring the program back and pilot it in a way that ensures it can thrive, that’s personal too.”

What’s New

MDO’s fleet is 100% electric. This means our cars look a little different than before and do require charging and if you’ve never been behind the wheel of an EV, it might take a little adjusting, but you’ll love it! The fleet in Buffalo starts with Chevy Bolts.

MDO has a 24/7 bilingual customer service hotline so that we can support you any time you need us. Buffalo Carshare will relaunch as part of a national MDO Carshare network that stretches from coast to coast.

The service runs entirely from your smartphone (lock, unlock, starting and ending a trip), and cars have cameras installed for safety.

What Hasn’t Changed

MDO’s commitment to social equity, customer service, affordability and accessibility.

The program will be as affordable as possible for everyone. MDO is piloting the service at $7 per hour.

MDO staff will provide regular maintenance and cleaning of the vehicles so that all members can enjoy a clean and safe drive.

MDO’s first hub is available at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus for carsharing the week of August 18th. MDO is exploring options for additional sites throughout the City. They are looking for individuals to help pilot the program – the process is easy. Sign up, take a quick orientation, and drive!

Application fees (normally $20) will be waived for the first 50 people that sign up. Anyone interested in membership can download the app here:

Background on MDO:

The plan for Buffalo will be to pull from two of MDO’s standout models:

Drive CDTA in the capital region, which MDO runs in partnership with the Capital District Transportation Authority with support from NYSERDA. Drive CDTA has been in operation for just over two years. 470 members have used the program and have taken nearly 6,000 trips. The program recently expanded to 12 cars, and will see further growth this fall with NYSERDA’s support. CDTA invests in this program, along with Bikeshare, as part of a vision for integrated mobility throughout NY’s Capital Region.

DART GR in Grand Rapids, which MDO runs as part of the statewide Michigan Carshare program. DART, which launched in October 2024 is sponsored by the City of Grand Rapids, features 9 cars in the fleet, and thanks to forthcoming investment from the State of Michigan will grow significantly in the next year. Despite being a newer program, over 200 residents have used DART – the cars are booked over 12 hours per day on average.

According to Randall,, MDO will apply the lessons learned from these programs, and others in cities like Detroit, Rochester, and Charlotte North Carolina as Buffalo Carshare pilots operations this month.

Several partners contributed to get Buffalo Carshare to this point: the New York State Legislature and Governor worked with us to pass new legislation to preserve non-profit carsharing, GObike Buffalo and the Department of Environmental Conservation are seeding some of the first locations in the Lower West Side. Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, which has the largest concentration of EV Chargers in WNY, has graciously provided space for the first hub.

Q2 2025 Financial Highlights

●Net sales were $2.7 million, compared to $4.6 million in the same period in 2024, a 42% decline●Gross profit decreased to $930,000, compared to $1.8 million in the same period in 2024, a 49% decline●Operating expenses declined 24% to $1.0 million, compared to $1.4 million in the same period in 2024●Net loss was $271,000, or $(0.11) per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $501,000, or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, in the same period in 2024●Cash used in operating activities in the second quarter of 2025 was $404,000, compared to $1,179,000 provided by operating activities in the same period last year

Arthur Sams, Chairman and CEO of Polar Power, commented, “The telecom market continues to dominate our customer base for our DC power systems. During the second quarter of 2025, sales to our telecom customers represented 92% of total net sales, compared to 95%, in the same period in 2024. Sales to military customers represented 6% of total net sales, compared to 3% in the same period in 2024. Sales to customers in other markets represented 2% in the second quarter of 2025, and 2% in the same period in 2024. Sales to customers outside of the U.S. represented 3% of total net sales in the second quarter of 2025, compared to 25% in the same period in 2024. While sales of our gensets continued to be sluggish during the second quarter of 2025, we experienced increased sales in aftermarket parts and services of roughly 288%, compared to the same period in 2024. We believe that restructuring our US sales to include distribution through domestic resellers will be the fastest direction in rebuilding sales to pre-pandemic levels.”

“From January 1, 2025, we have been restructuring our sales staff in the Middle East and Africa by adding new personnel along with establishing resellers overseas. With our new staff we have recently increased the number of field trials for our DC generators into South East Asia and Africa telecoms. One field trial in Sudan that was suspended due to civil war years back was restarted last week with favorable results.”

“We are experiencing active participation from LPG fuel distributors in assisting Polar Power with marketing of our microgrids (as installed for the UNHCR in Nigeria) to their customer base. We added heat recovery to our microgrid systems to further increase fuel to useful energy conversion.”

“After 1 year of testing, we plan to release our 30 kW mobile EV charger during the fourth quarter.”

“We plan to continue to improve our sales and marketing proficiency, further diversifying our customer base,” concluded Mr. Sams.

Simon Jack & Lucy Hooker

Business editor & Business reporter

The UK's largest bioethanol plant will begin closing down operations on Monday, after the government decided not to offer the sector a rescue package.

Hull-based Vivergo Fuels, owned by Associated British Foods, told the BBC the first redundancies would take effect on Tuesday.

AB Foods and Ensus, which owns the UK's second large bioethanol plant in Redcar on Teesside, had both previously warned that without government support they would be forced to close, after a deal to allow US ethanol to be imported tariff-free.

The government said it had worked closely with the companies since June, but had decided it was not ""in the national interest"" to provide them with taxpayer funds.

The US-UK trade pact, agreed in May, removed a 19% tariff on ethanol imported from the US up to a quota of 1.4bn litres. That is approximately equivalent to the current size of the UK market and the firms claim the trade agreement had made their businesses ""commercially unviable"".

AB Foods said it had been in talks with the government over the last few months and had presented a plan to return the firm to profitability.

""In making this decision, the government has thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber, a sovereign capability in clean fuels that had the chance to lead the world.""

It said jobs in clean energy would now move overseas.

""This plant should always have been profitable under the right regulatory environment, as similar plants in western Europe demonstrate,"" the firm said.

German-owned Ensus has also been approached for comment.

The two plants employ 270 people, but their closure could affect thousands more in the supply chain.

A government spokesperson said after working with the companies over weeks to understand ""the financial challenges they have faced over the past decade"", the government had taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding ""as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces"".

The government said it recognised this was a ""difficult time for the workers and their families"" and said it would work with trade unions, local partners and the companies to support those affected.

GMB union national officer Charlotte Brumpton-Childs said the trade deal was costing working people their livelihoods.

""They're not numbers in a spreadsheet. These are lives put on hold and communities potentially devastated,"" she said.

The government was also falling short on building a green energy strategy, she said.

""A clean energy industrial strategy means nothing if we cannot protects plants long enough to deliver clean energy jobs here in the UK.""

Bioethanol is a fuel made from wheat, other grains or sugar beet. The US has provided subsidies and tax credits to corn farmers in midwestern states such as Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska, helping to hold down the price of its ethanol.

In the UK bioethanol is added to fuels such as E10 petrol. But sources within the sector said that government delays over the migration to petrol with higher bioethanol content had hurt the industry.

The government has previously said that by 2030 it wants 10% of all fuel used in planes to come from sustainable sources, one of which is bioethanol.

The bioethanol industry buys thousands of tonnes of wheat from UK farms, and Ensus also produces 30% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide – used in soft drinks, medical and nuclear industries.

Duke Energy on Thursday asked state and federal regulators to approve a plan to combine its two electric utilities in the Carolinas — Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress — a move the company said would produce $3.2 billion in cost savings through 2038.

“The energy landscape is evolving rapidly — customer demand is growing, grid operations are becoming more complex, and the orderly transition towards a diversified set of energy resources requires maximizing efficiencies in planning and operation across the entire Carolinas footprint,” Kendal Bowman, North Carolina president for DEC and DEP, said in testimony filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The merger must be approved by the NCUC, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Duke aims to complete the merger on Jan. 1, 2027, with DEC being the remaining utility. DEC and DEP retail rates would be blended over time after the merger is completed, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based utility company said.

Since Duke Energy and Progress Energy merged in 2012, they have dispatched their power plants as if they were a single utility, which, combined with fuel savings and other efficiencies, has saved about $1 billion, according to the company. “But regulations limit further coordination between the two utilities; only a full combination can unlock additional savings,” Duke said.

Combining DEC and DEP enables more efficient resource planning, execution and operations, more balanced investments across a broader customer base, simplified regulatory processes and uniform service offerings, Bowman said.

Those factors could produce about $3.2 billion in cost savings by 2038, Rachel Elliott, director of rates and regulatory planning for DEC, said in testimony filed at the NCUC. About 97% of the estimated cost savings come from the combined utility’s ability to plan, execute and run its system more efficiently, Elliott said. The remaining savings come from corporate administrative savings, she said.

A single utility will be able to more effectively plan and operate new generation and transmission in the Carolinas, partly by locating assets where they make the most sense across a broader footprint, Duke said.

Also, combining the utilities will bolster grid reliability by improving the balancing of distributed generation resources while reducing the need to restrict solar production due to oversupply, grid congestion or lack of demand, Duke said.

Duke expects the merger will cost about $143 million, according to Bowman.

The merger would change cost allocations among customers, so that its costs would outweigh the near-term benefits for Duke’s retail customers in South Carolina, according to Bowman. As a result, Duke proposed a “Share the Benefits” plan that calls for North Carolina retail customers and Duke’s wholesale customers to temporarily contribute a portion of their savings to South Carolina retail customers, she said.

Duke’s wholesale customers have agreed to contribute $55 million a year over five years to South Carolina retail customers and North Carolina retail customers would contribute $25 million annually over six years, Bowman said.

The adoption of this new State aid framework will support the objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal by making it easier for Member States to grant aid compatible with its objectives.

Previous Framework

The Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (“CISAF”) replaces the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework 2023 (“TCTF”), which was initially established to enable Member States to use the flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy in the context of Russia’s war against Ukraine. The TCTF was subsequently amended to allow Member States to, amongst other things, grant State aid to foster the transition to a net-zero economy. Aid was granted to:

accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy, storage and renewable heat;

decarbonise industrial production processes; and

accelerate investments in key sectors for the transition towards a net-zero economy.

The TCTF was adopted in March 2022 and by the end of 2023 a total of €164.08 billion in State aid was approved under the TCTF by the European Commission. Some significant examples of State aid schemes approved under the TCTF include a €10.82 billion French State aid scheme to support offshore wind energy and a €1 billion Portuguese State aid scheme to support investments in strategic sectors, both necessary to foster the transition to a net-zero economy. Ireland runs onshore and offshore renewable energy auctions but, according to the State aid scoreboard 2024, Ireland spent less than 25% of its approved budget by the end of 2023.

Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework

The TCTF was replaced on 25 June 2025 with the commencement of the CISAF, which will remain in place until 31 December 2030. The CISAF simplifies State aid rules by establishing parameters under which Member States can grant support for certain investments and objectives, while ensuring any State aid granted is necessary, suitable and fair.

The CISAF supports the Clean Industrial Deal (and, in so doing, energy intensive and clean-tech industries) by simplifying State aid rules in a variety of ways:

It allows Member States to grant aid that supports investment in renewable energy development, thereby accelerating its rollout. Such aid will facilitate industry decarbonisation by supporting various eco-friendly technologies, including electrification, hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage.

It allows for temporary electricity price support for energy-intensive users. Such aid can be provided for a maximum of three years and, in return, beneficiaries will be required to invest in decarbonisation.

It provides for aid to ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity in clean technologies recognised in the Net-Zero Industry Act, including for critical raw materials.

It allows Member States to grant aid to incentivise private investment in clean energy, decarbonisation, clean tech manufacturing, energy infrastructure and the circular economy. Such aid will take the form of equity, loans (including subordinated loans) and/or guarantees provided to a dedicated fund or special purpose vehicle (“SPV”) that will hold the portfolio of eligible projects and aims to achieve return incentives and reduce the risk of investment for private investors to invest in that fund or SPV.

The overall aim is to facilitate faster adoption of innovations, increase access to clean energy and reduce bureaucratic hurdles for businesses, including SMEs.

Tax Incentives: Accelerated Depreciation and Tax Credits

The CISAF recognises the key strategic role Member States’ fiscal policy can play in driving private green investment. The Commission recommends[1] leveraging tax incentives such as accelerated depreciation and tax credits to support further decarbonisation. The aim of these measures is to increase cash flow for companies and reduce tax liabilities in a given tax year in order to free up funds for investment.

Accelerated Depreciation

The CISAF allows for State aid in the form of accelerated depreciation to be granted to incentivise acquisition or lease of clean technology equipment. Accelerated depreciation may take the form of ‘immediate expensing’, whereby the taxpayer is entitled to deduct the whole depreciable amount in the tax year in which the investment is made, or ‘flexible’ depreciation, which allows companies to depreciate the assets at a time that is convenient to them. The CISAF specifies conditions that must be met in order for accelerated depreciation to be permitted, such as the asset being new, depreciable and retained for at least five years.

Tax Credits

The Commission further recommends that Member States provide tax relief in the form of tax credits for investment projects related to decarbonisation. Such projects should be focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving the energy efficiency of industrial activities, and creating additional manufacturing capacity in clean technologies.

The credits should be designed to operate primarily in the corporate income tax system with the amount of the credit calculated in relation to the expenditure actually incurred in making the relevant investment. In order to allow companies to take full advantage of these credits, Member States are encouraged to allow companies to carry forward losses and unused tax credits for four years.

Additional Measures

Other State aid rules that exist will continue to apply in parallel to the CISAF and can be used to advance the Clean Industrial Deal for different and more complex support measures. Such rules include the General Block Exemption Regulation, the Climate, Energy, and Environmental Aid Guidelines and the Regional Aid Guidelines.

Next Steps

The CISAF affords Ireland a valuable opportunity to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy and make clean energy production more accessible and attractive for industrial users through the simplified State aid rules. The full potential of the CISAF should be used to contribute to Ireland’s competitiveness at a global level.

Aug 14 (Reuters) – The U.S. is poised to see supply shortages of 30% and 10%, respectively, of power and distribution transformers this year, as surging electricity consumption drives demand for power infrastructure, Wood Mackenzie said on Thursday.

Demand for certain kinds of transformers – pieces of equipment that step up or down the voltage of electricity to transfer it from power plants to end users – has more than doubled since 2019, as the industry grapples with a growing pipeline of clean energy projects and the need to replace old infrastructure, according to the energy research firm’s report.With domestic manufacturing capacity falling behind, utilities are turning to imports of electrical equipment to bring their power projects online.

“This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand,” said Ben Boucher, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

The U.S. power sector has seen electricity consumption increase 7% in the last five years, after a decade of mild declines. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects commercial electricity demand to grow 3.1% in 2025 and 4.9% next year, primarily driven by demand from data centers.

Rising power demand, also driven by more frequent extreme weather, has left grid operators and utilities scrambling to get more power on to the system as quickly as they can.

CONTEXT

Utilities have been stockpiling transformers to ensure they have adequate supply, but are seeing long lead times for some equipment, sometimes forced to place orders three or four years ahead of time, Boucher said.

Meanwhile, new tariffs from the Trump administration are likely to further exacerbate the shortage domestically, he said, given the growing dependence on imports.

Roughly 80% of power transformers and half of the distribution transformers supplied in the U.S. this year will have been imported, per the report.

On the flip side, the passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which cut support for renewable energy projects, could reduce demand for certain kinds of transformers, “although demand will still be well above the 2024 levels so additional capacity will still be required,” Boucher said.

At least 10 states passed legislation in 2025 requiring, at minimum, the consideration of advanced transmission technologies.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Rich Glick and Neil Chatterjee served as commissioners with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Glick chaired FERC between 2021 and 2023. Chatterjee chaired the agency in 2017 and again from 2018 to 2020. Glick is now a principal at GQS New Energy Strategies, and Chatterjee is the chief government affairs officer at Palmetto.

The American economy needs more low-cost, reliable power to grow. Demand for electricity in the United States is expected to increase at a historic pace as new data centers and manufacturing plants continue to come online. By 2029, nationwide electricity demand is projected to increase by 15.8%, according to Grid Strategies. Growth in data centers alone could require anywhere from 65 GW to more than 90 GW of power.

To meet this increased demand, we are going to need to build more power plants, but we also must build out the electric grid by adding new electric transmission capacity.

However, transmission is not being built in sufficient amounts during the time frame necessary to meet demand. In addition, it can take ten years, sometimes even longer, to plan, site and construct high-voltage regional and interregional transmission lines.

Luckily, there are things we can do now to help address more immediate system needs. Grid-Enhancing Technologies (GETs) and High-Performance Conductors (HPCs) provide an opportunity for grid planners to squeeze more out of existing transmission lines and rights-of-way. GETs include hardware and software that increase a line’s capacity, reliability and safety, using dynamic line ratings, advanced power flow control and topology optimization.

Similarly, replacing wires with HPCs can double existing infrastructure capacity at about half the cost of a new line. These technologies also improve line efficiency: HPCs with carbon cores can reduce energy losses by at least 20%, while deploying superconductors can reduce line losses by upwards of 80%.

While GETs and HPCs alone cannot meet near-term demand growth needs, they are low-cost tools which can bypass many of the regulatory challenges that slow the buildout of new lines.

Additional transmission capacity will also help alleviate congestion on the system, which occurs when there is not enough capacity to transport the lowest-cost generation to consumers. Grid congestion cost Americans an estimated $11.5 billion on their power bills in 2023 alone. The potential cost savings from deploying these solutions are considerable. For instance, PPL Electric Utilities has deployed dynamic line ratings to avoid more than $20 million in annual grid congestion costs.

GETs and HPCs also enhance grid reliability. Increased transmission capacity allows regional grid operators and utilities to access new sources of energy when weather conditions or other events increase electric demand to levels that localized generating capacity cannot adequately handle. Moreover, the new transmission capacity also enables utilities and grid operators to meet growing energy demand more reliably on a daily basis. GETs also facilitate improved grid monitoring that is affordable and scalable to help improve vegetation management, address external threats to the grid such as wildfires and other extreme weather incidents, and monitor the operations of an increasingly aging set of transmission assets.

Advanced transmission technologies will provide numerous benefits, but misaligned economic incentives often keep utilities from integrating them into their transmission planning processes.

Fortunately, there have been several noteworthy policy developments and supportive statements for these technologies in recent years. During our tenures at FERC, the commission held several technical conferences to consider the benefits of GETs and examine opportunities for incentivizing utility investments in these technologies.

More recently, FERC required that GETs and reconductoring be considered in regional transmission planning and grid interconnection processes. And the commission launched a proceeding to consider possible requirements for dynamic line ratings under some circumstances.

Although progress has been made at FERC, it is up to the states to take the next step on GETs and HPCs. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners passed a resolution in late 2024 calling on Congress to “appropriate sufficient funds” to support utilities, grid operators and states with the deployment of these technologies. At least 10 states passed legislation in 2025 requiring, at minimum, the consideration of advanced transmission technologies.

Many state regulators will now have an opportunity to work with their utilities to fully evaluate these technologies when considering local upgrades as well as in longer-term regional planning.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IqVREC4ab4AVWueqwj-DMjskXsKGyKJwRfbZkZ-obsQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS90cmFuc21pc3Npb25fc3Vuc2V0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-15 12:06:56.832758

Alfred State Grant Part of $2.6 Million Green Workforce Development Grant Program to Help Students Pursue Jobs in Clean Energy and Sustainability

Alfred, NY – State University of New York Chancellor John B. King Jr. today visited Alfred State and celebrated the $284,910 grant to the campus from SUNY's Green Workforce Grant program, funded by Governor Kathy Hochul's SUNY Transformation Fund. Alfred State is part of a $2.6 million statewide initiative to help more students pursue clean energy jobs through academic programs and state-of-the art training. The grant is part of SUNY's ongoing efforts to help develop a skilled green workforce, one of its goals within its Climate and Sustainability Action Plan as New York State moves to use more clean energy sources.

As more consumers buy electric vehicles (EVs), New York will need technicians who understand that technology and can install supporting infrastructure such as EV chargers. Alfred State will be using grant funding to prepare the EV workforce of tomorrow as the college invests more in equipment, training programs, and curricular review. Alfred State will use the grant funds to further enhance and expand hands-on opportunities to provide students with in-depth training for the growing electric vehicle industry.

""SUNY is at the forefront of helping New York State mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change and grow our clean energy economy,"" said SUNY Chancellor King. ""The investments made by Governor Hochul and state leaders in the SUNY Transformation Fund mean that Alfred State will be well-positioned to serve as leader in this rapidly growing clean energy economy, all while advancing upward mobility in this region and all of New York State.""

The SUNY Board of Trustees said, ""SUNY's Green Workforce Development Grants will help ensure Alfred State is equipped to provide more SUNY students with the education, skills, and training they will need to join the green workforce and secure clean energy jobs. We thank Governor Hochul for her long-term vision on how to build a cleaner, greener state economy, and are proud that SUNY is leading the way to make that ambitious goal into reality.""

Alfred State President Steven Mauro said, ""We are extremely grateful for Governor Hochul's SUNY Transformation Fund in its support of our Green Workforce Grant that will allow us to add more equipment and provide the industry with more of our career-ready graduates. There is high workforce demand for technicians with EV expertise, and both current and prospective students have shown a peaked interest in our cutaway electric vehicle that strips away the car's body to show them what is driving automotive innovation.""

State Senator Tom O'Mara said, ""These state investments are timely and important to offer students at Alfred State and at colleges and universities throughout New York opportunities to pursue these quality jobs and promising careers. The focus on education and technical training is vital to the development and growth of the highly skilled and trained workforce that will continue to strengthen New York State's position as a leader in the clean energy economy.""

State Assemblymember Joe Sempolinski said, ""As a member of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, I am very excited that Chancellor King made time in his busy schedule to visit the Alfred State campus. I also want to thank Chancellor King and his team at SUNY for investing in Alfred State as the college prepares SUNY Alfred students to join the workforce of tomorrow in emerging technology fields.""

Phil Murphy announced the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program, which aims to create a new $500 million tax credit program that incentivizes manufacturing investment and job creation.

The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) will administer the program.

Under the program, eligible businesses in manufacturing industries, including advanced manufacturing, non-retail food and beverage, defense, clean energy and life sciences, can receive a tax credit award. The credit equals the lesser of 0.1% of the eligible business’s total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time jobs, or 25% of the eligible business’ total qualified investment, with a maximum of $150 million per project.

The NJEDA will reserve $100 million in tax credits in the first two years for clean energy product manufacturers in industries such as solar, geothermal and green hydrogen. After the first two years of the program, any unused proceeds will roll over into the general manufacturing allocation.

“The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program will encourage manufacturers to establish and grow successful operations in New Jersey, producing impactful economic benefits for the state and its residents for generations to come,"" NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan said.

The program will offer stackable bonuses to companies holding New Jersey Business Certifications, including Minority and Women Business Enterprises, businesses located in Opportunity Zones or companies that have collective bargaining agreements or labor harmony agreements in place.

The program also looks to impact the medical industry.

“As the 'Medicine Chest of the World,’ New Jersey relies on a strong manufacturing ecosystem to produce highly advanced, technologically sophisticated and life-saving biopharma and medical device products,” HealthCare Institute of New Jersey CEO Chrissy Buteas said. ""These products, from cell and gene manufacturing to complex metallurgic bone mesh implants to radioligand therapeutic products, are made in New Jersey.""

Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework.
Removing hurdles for plug-in solar Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar.
It appears to be the only state that’s passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.","When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.

“We thought absolutely, let’s do this right away,” said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.

These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven’t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.

The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer’s backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.

“We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” Dwyer said.

Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.

Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility’s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home’s circuit breaker.

Removing hurdles for plug-in solar

Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.

“The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. “It is clear that we are hitting a nerve — many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.”

Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they’re allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.

Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn’t understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.

Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility’s policy.

During the early days of plug-in solar’s growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“Utilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,” Cudd said.

This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that’s passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.

“Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here in the United States,” Ward said.

Bright Saver says they are lobbying other states for similar legislation.

Alexis Abramson, dean of the University of Columbia Climate School, also applauded Utah’s move.

“We actually need more localities, more states putting in allowances for this type of equipment,” she said.

Plug-in solar availability and savings potential

Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.

Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.

“I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,” he said.

He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.

Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.

“I think anyone can install this,” he said. “It’s not complicated. It doesn’t require a technical degree.”

Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company’s basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.

Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom’s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.

The company advises customers to notify their power company before installation, but it has “never had any pushback from any utility,” said Michael Scherer, one of the founders of Craftstrom.

China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.

“This is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,” Oliver said, adding: “As this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.”

The solar cells produced at the Austin site will then be assembled as completed solar modules at T1’s Dallas site.
A fully domestic vertical-integration of the solar manufacturing supply chain is relatively rare, as bottlenecks in manufacturing capacity in certain stages of the chain persist.
“The U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial knowhow,” said Daniel Barcelo, chief executive officer and board chair, T1 Energy.
T1 Energy launched as a rebrand of Freyr Battery, acquiring solar manufacturing assets from major global supplier Trina Solar for $340 million in late 2024.","T1 Energy signed a deal to purchase Corning’s purified polysilicon and solar wafers produced at its Michigan manufacturing campus.

Starting in the second half of 2026, Corning wafers are expected to be delivered to T1’s solar cell facility in Austin, Texas. The solar cells produced at the Austin site will then be assembled as completed solar modules at T1’s Dallas site.

A fully domestic vertical-integration of the solar manufacturing supply chain is relatively rare, as bottlenecks in manufacturing capacity in certain stages of the chain persist. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports the United States has 25 GW of active polysilicon refinement capacity, 2 GW of cell capacity and 57.5 GW of module assembly capacity, and no polysilicon ingot capacity or wafer capacity.

However, some of the critically underserved legs of the supply chain are expected to ramp up capacity, with SEIA reporting 8.3 GW of ingot and wafer capacity under construction as well as 19.3 GW of cells and a further 15.3 GW of modules.

“The U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial knowhow,” said Daniel Barcelo, chief executive officer and board chair, T1 Energy. “Together with Corning, we intend to accelerate America’s ability to manufacture leading-edge solar solutions, support a total of nearly 6,000 American jobs, and promote American energy independence.”

Corning is investing $1.5 billion in its Saginaw County, Mich. polysilicon and wafer facility, adding an estimated 1,500 jobs.

T1 Energy announced an $850 million investment in its solar cell manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas. The G2 Austin factory is expected to begin producing solar cells in the second half of 2026 and is planned to reach an annual output of 5 GW of cells per year. T1 Energy said the facility is expected to create up to 1,800 full-time jobs. T1 Energy said the site will produce advanced TOPCon solar cells.

T1 Energy launched as a rebrand of Freyr Battery, acquiring solar manufacturing assets from major global supplier Trina Solar for $340 million in late 2024. In early 2025, Freyr Battery scrapped plans for a $2.6 billion battery energy storage system factory in the state of Georgia, pivoted to solar manufacturing, and rebranded as T1 Energy.

The acquisition from Trina Solar included a 5 GW, 1.35 million-square-foot automated solar module manufacturing facility in Wilmer, Texas. In Q1, 2025, T1 Energy reported production of 443 MW of solar modules at the site, called G1 Dallas.

""The electric vehicle mandate that the Liberals are imposing on Canadians is a complete and utter disaster,"" Poilievre said during a news conference in Corman Park, Sask.
Poilievre has been calling on the Liberals to walk back the mandate for months.
The Liberals haven't indicated whether they intend to keep or scrap the mandate following July's meeting.
Even though he lost his seat in the spring election, it is unlikely Poilievre will miss much time in the House this fall.","Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Thursday that his party will focus on pushing the Liberals to repeal the electric vehicle sales mandate during the coming parliamentary sitting.

Poilievre said the Conservatives plan to introduce motions, petitions and other ""pressure campaigns"" to repeal the policy that is set to come into force next year.

""The electric vehicle mandate that the Liberals are imposing on Canadians is a complete and utter disaster,"" Poilievre said during a news conference in Corman Park, Sask.

""Conservatives are launching a nationwide campaign, including in the House of Commons, to force the Liberals to back down … on the gas vehicle ban.""

The mandate requires the number of new zero-emission vehicles sold in Canada to hit 20 per cent by next year, 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035 in order to help the country hit its emission-reduction targets.

Poilievre has been calling on the Liberals to walk back the mandate for months.

""It's time to put Canadians back in the driver's seat so they can decide what life they want to live,"" he said Thursday.

The auto industry has also been calling for an end to the mandate. The CEOs of Canada's big three automakers met with Prime Minister Mark Carney last month to lobby for its removal, arguing that the sales mandate would cripple their companies and put thousands of jobs at risk as the industry faces American tariffs and EV demand is sagging.

The Liberals haven't indicated whether they intend to keep or scrap the mandate following July's meeting.

Carney has repealed other policies introduced under former prime minister Justin Trudeau — most notably the consumer carbon tax.

Manufacturers have said there is just not enough demand to hit the 20 per cent target next year, in part due to the ending of the federal EV rebate program.

The rebate offered up to $5,000 toward the purchase of a new electric car and up to $2,500 on the purchase of a new plug-in hybrid.

While it was supposed to stay in place until March, it was paused in January when it ran out of funding. Environment Minister Julie Dabrusin told The Canadian Press in June that another rebate program could be in the works.

Even though he lost his seat in the spring election, it is unlikely Poilievre will miss much time in the House this fall. He is expected to win what is considered one of the safest Conservative seats in the country in a byelection on Monday and the House of Commons isn't set to return until mid-September.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7608994.1755191287!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/pierre-poilievre-aug-14-2025.jpeg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-15 12:09:55.349354

If so, that means nearly 35,000 megawatts of dirty power — at a cost of $3.121 billion, spread out to ratepayers.
In total that would yield 90 power plants, creakily belching death into the sky, propped up by an administration happily breathing the clean air upwind of them.
If the DOE mandates extended to all of those, that total cost would be just shy of $6 billion.
Still, the Grid Strategies report lays out the potential, and the clear hypocrisy at its root.","On Friday, the power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies released a report guessing just how high the costs of this sort of move could get, if the Trump administration keeps shoving its foot in each retiring plant’s closing door. “Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” the report states. If so, that means nearly 35,000 megawatts of dirty power — at a cost of $3.121 billion, spread out to ratepayers. Us.

And that’s the low estimate. It could get much higher, for a very grim reason: the DOE mandates basically create a perverse incentive for aging, uneconomical power plants to move their retirement dates forward, in order to then be told to stay open, and then be allowed to get paid by consumers to produce power that wouldn’t make financial sense to produce otherwise.

The Grid Strategies report, prepared on behalf of the environmental non-profits Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sierra Club, estimates that another 31,000 or so megawatts of fossil-fired power without pre-2028 retirement dates, but that are 60 or more years old. In total that would yield 90 power plants, creakily belching death into the sky, propped up by an administration happily breathing the clean air upwind of them. If the DOE mandates extended to all of those, that total cost would be just shy of $6 billion.

There is no guarantee, of course, that such mandates do cover all those plants, or that they stand up to pushback. The Michigan coal plant forced to remain open faced a challenge from utility regulators arguing that the DOE failed to demonstrate the “emergency” justifying the move. Michigan’s attorney general has also fought the move, as have many residents breathing in its fumes. It isn’t hard to imagine such challenges to basically any dirty behemoth expected to finally die an ignominious death but forced to live on, with one imagines wide variance in success.

The trade association Energy Marketers of America (“EMA”) (formerly, Petroleum Association of America) submitted August 6 comments to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) addressing:

Establishment of Public Docket and Listening Sessions on Implementation Challenges Associated with Clean Water Act Section 401.

See Docket No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0272.

EMA describes itself as a federation of 48 state and regional trade associations representing family-owned and operated small business energy marketers throughout the United States. The members are stated to supply 80% of all finished motor and heating fuel products sold nationwide including renewable hydrocarbon biofuels, gasoline, diesel fuel, biofuels, heating fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, racing fuel, and lubricating oils.

Especially relevant to these comments is the fact that EMA states that it supplies heating fuel to more than 500 million homes and businesses.

The Arkansas Oil Marketers Association is a state chapter of EMA.

The EPA docket was open to solicit public feedback on the implementation challenges under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act prohibits federal agencies from issuing permits or licenses that result in exceedance of water quality standards, or applicable authorities, of the state. This provision of the Clean Water Act requires an applicant for a federal license or permit to provide a certification that any discharges from the facility will comply with applicable water quality standards. If not provided, the federal permit or license may not be granted. Further, the states can impose certain conditions upon federal permits or licenses as a prerequisite to granting the permit or license.

If a state fails or refuses to act on a request for certification in a timely manner, the certification requirements are waived with respect to such federal applications.

Examples of federal licenses and permits that may require a Section 401 water quality certification include (but or not limited to):

Clean Water Act Section 404 Dredge and Fill Permits.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hydroelectric Licenses.

Clean Water Act Section 402 Pollutant Discharge Permits.

Natural Gas Pipeline Certificates issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The expanse and/or scope of Section 401 has been a subject of debate for many years. The Biden Administration arguably expanded the scope of 401 while the Trump Administration has argued that it should used only for its statutory purpose – to protect water quality – and not as a weapon to shut down projects for reasons with no basis in the statute or applicable regulations.

Various states and environmental organizations have countered that such constraints would limit its ability to protect state water quality standards.

EMA’s August 6 comments urge EPA to:

…consider how permitting decisions may impact energy diversity, small business viability, environmental innovation, and consumer choice––particularly in regions like the Northeast where modern liquid fuels remain essential. Preserving a diverse energy mix that includes liquid heating fuels is critical to achieving energy independence and dominance, while also advancing clean air and water stewardship.

The comments request that EPA, as it considers ways to improve the 401 certification process, also evaluate “the unintended financial burdens that could arise from fast-tracking major infrastructure projects by circumventing established safeguards.” Concern is expressed regarding policies that it argues promote natural gas pipeline expansion based on the presumption that doing so displaces “dirty” heating oil. The trade association states:

…This assumption is both outdated and misleading. Indeed, modern liquid heating fuels––including ultra-low sulfur heating oil (ULSHO) and renewable BioHeat® blends––have undergone dramatic improvements, achieving environmental profiles on par with natural gas in many respects.

EMA specifically recommends that EPA:

Promote energy diversity by preserving access to ultra-low sulfur heating oil (ULSHO) and its renewable blends––reliable and increasingly clean heating options that offer consumers alternatives beyond utility-supplied natural gas.

Acknowledge the environmental progress of modern liquid fuels, which have achieved dramatic reductions in particulate and sulfur emissions and continue to advance through renewable blending.

Support continued innovation in renewable fuel development to further reduce emissions from existing heating infrastructure without requiring costly system overhauls.

Encourage adoption of high-efficiency heating technologies through voluntary, performance incentives that improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions in both residential and commercial settings.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:05:14.078286

We’re committed to supporting our customers on their journeys towards net zero to help achieve the UK government’s clean energy goals and creating better places and thriving communities.”

Rasmus Friis, CEO at Elements Green, added: “Our relationship with Mitie combines leading technical expertise with a shared commitment to biodiversity, education, local jobs and supporting the community – creating a project that works for both people and planet.

“Staythorpe BESS is about more than storing clean energy – it’s about working hand in hand with our neighbours to deliver lasting value. Through our new Community Relations Programme, we’re creating a direct line for conversation, ideas, and collaboration, ensuring the benefits of this project are shaped with the people who live here.”

Minister for Energy Consumers, Miatta Fahnbulleh, concluded:?“Battery storage facilities like this will help protect homes and businesses from energy price shocks by unlocking our renewable power potential, while creating good jobs here in the East Midlands.

“Our mission to deliver clean power by 2030 will scale up battery storage across Great Britain, so excess renewable energy can be stored to use later, instead of wasted.”

This marks another setback for the state’s progress in clean energy investments.
Early investments in solar energy have paid off: Arizona now ranks 4th in the country for total solar capacity.
However, new restrictions on federal tax credits and persistent inflation make building renewable energy projects more difficult.
The ACC’s actions send the message that Arizona is closed for business when it comes to renewable energy,” said Vote Solar’s Regional Director for the Interior West, Itzel Rios-Vega.","The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) voted to initiate the formal steps required to repeal Arizona’s Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST). This marks another setback for the state’s progress in clean energy investments.

The REST rules were passed by a majority Republican Commission in 2006 and require utilities to source at least 15% of their electricity from renewable energy resources by 2025. This requirement has been key to Arizona’s advancement toward a clean and modernized grid. Today’s (5-0) vote to initiate the repeal of the REST rules puts the state’s continued progress at risk. Arizonans have the opportunity to submit comments to the commission before November 14.

“In 2006 the ACC had the foresight to recognize the value of promoting investments in Arizona’s most plentiful resource, sunshine, and set a target to achieve 15% renewable energy by 2025. The REST created a stable, pro-business environment for renewable energy that has directly benefited the people of Arizona,” said Vote Solar’s Interior West Regulatory Director, Kate Bowman. “Today, solar energy has become the cheapest source of power. Repealing the REST standard would deter continued investment in solar energy and negatively impact many ratepayers who are already struggling to manage rising utility bills.”

The REST has been crucial for increasing investment and job opportunities in the state. Since 2006, the REST has led to an estimated $2 billion in benefits for consumers of Arizona Public Service (APS) and Tuscon Electric Power (TEP) while also reducing climate pollution. Early investments in solar energy have paid off: Arizona now ranks 4th in the country for total solar capacity. Roughly 1 in 5 Arizonans uses rooftop solar to help lower their electricity bill, and the solar industry provides more than 9,700 jobs and invested $2.6 billion in the state last year alone. Unlike coal and methane gas plants, renewable energy technologies and investments like wind and solar do not require water for cooling, saving the state significant water. Less than a third of the fossil fuel plants report their water usage, but those that do use enough water to supply the needs of 28% of Arizona’s homes.

Arizona utilities expect energy usage to increase by as much as 70% over the next 15 years, and solar energy is currently the least expensive form of electricity. However, new restrictions on federal tax credits and persistent inflation make building renewable energy projects more difficult. A recent study forecasts that the federal tax credit phase-out will cause Arizona electricity prices to rise 15% to 20% by 2029. Any additional barriers to clean energy investment will only compound the impact on consumers.

“It is naive to think that repealing the REST will not have direct impacts on Arizona families. The ACC’s actions send the message that Arizona is closed for business when it comes to renewable energy,” said Vote Solar’s Regional Director for the Interior West, Itzel Rios-Vega. “We urge the commission not to surrender its responsibility to guide Arizona’s energy future. Now is the time to expand opportunities for families and businesses to access affordable solar solutions.”

It's August 16, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift — your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, we're looking at how the loss of fuel economy credits is hitting Rivian, as well as Stellantis' plans for EVs in China. We'll also look at Toyota's goal to bring EVs to South Africa, and Ford's latest recall.

It's open season for fuel economy in the United States, with automakers now allowed to build whatever makes them the most money with zero regard for its impact on the planet. This is bad for anyone who plans on continuing to live on this planet, but it's particularly bad for automakers like Rivian that rely on selling fuel economy credits to less-efficient automakers. From the Wall Street Journal:

Electric truck maker Rivian says the rollback of fuel economy rules in the U.S. is holding up $100 million of revenue, a sign of how changes to automotive policy under the Trump administration are starting to hurt the electric-vehicle industry.

Rivian and its rivals have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue selling credits tied to the nation's fuel economy rules. But after the Trump administration removed penalties for violating those standards, the nation's top automotive regulator stopped issuing paperwork necessary to finalize those credits, leaving EV makers in the lurch.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the change was part of moves to overturn Biden-era EV rules and address Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, known as CAFE. ""NHTSA is focusing on fixing CAFE standards to make cars more affordable again,"" a NHTSA spokesperson said. ""When that process is complete, we will return to issuing compliance letters to manufacturers.""

Most of us are probably familiar with these credits from the days when Tesla made its money on them. It took years for that company to actually see a fiscal quarter in the black without the assistance of those credits, and now Rivian's in the same place — only, suddenly, without the credits.

Newly minted Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa is making the global rounds, shaking hands and kissing babies to ensure all of the company's important contacts can place his face to his name. This included a trip to China recently, where a local official asked Filosa to please get Stellantis' ass in gear around electrification in the country. From Automotive News:

A top government official in central China's Hubei province is urging Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa to speed up the company's transition to electrified vehicles in China.

Filosa, who was named CEO of Stellantis June 23, visited Hubei's provincial capital of Wuhan in late July, according to a release from the Hubei provincial government.

In a July 31 meeting in Wuhan with Filosa, Wang Zhonglin, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party for Hubei, expressed hope that Stellantis can invest more in Hubei to accelerate its shift to intelligent and connected electrified vehicles, the Hubei government said in the release on its website.

Stellantis operates a joint venture with Chinese automaker Dongfeng, as all automakers that entered the country before 2022 had to, but that joint venture only sells a single EV. That's simply not enough in China's electrification-hungry market.

Toyota's been slow on the EV uptake, having been lapped by everyone from EV upstarts like Rivian to lumbering, traditional behemoths like General Motors on actually getting electric cars into consumer hands. It seems the company has learned its lesson with the U.S. market, though, because it seems loath to repeat the same mistake in South Africa. From Reuters:

Toyota plans to introduce three fully-electric models in South Africa in 2026, a senior executive said on Thursday, entering a nascent EV market where Chinese rivals such as BYD are already competing with European carmakers.

Volvo currently dominates EV sales in South Africa, followed by BMW and Mercedes-Benz, but Chinese EV makers are starting to flood the market too as they seek new markets amid restrictions on exports to the United States and Europe.

...

""We're launching battery electric vehicles at the beginning of 2026, so we will have three new battery electric vehicles,"" Toyota South Africa CEO Andrew Kirby told Reuters on the sidelines of an auto components conference, without providing further details.

Those ""three new battery electric vehicles"" could simply be new to the South African market, but perhaps they'll be entirely clean-sheet vehicles added to Toyota's global lineup. It remains to be seen whether we'll ever see them, though — this entire South Africa push is meant to circumvent U.S. tariffs by simply looking at other markets. If only someone had predicted that this would happen.

I'm not sure what's happening over at Ford, but the company just issued its 102nd recall so far in 2025. The company makes up 40% of all NHTSA recalls in the United States for the year, and it's well ahead of the total recalls from second-place automaker Stellantis (sitting at 21). This latest recall concerns 21,000 Mustangs, Mustang Mach-Es, and Lincoln Nautiluses, which may have issues with their head or tail lights. From USA Today:

Ford has issued a recall for over 21,000 vehicles due to an issue that may cause headlights to malfunction, increasing the risk of a crash.

Impacted vehicle models include the 2025 Lincoln Nautilus, 2025 Mustang Mach E and 2025 Mustang vehicles, Ford said in an announcement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.

According to Ford, which owns Lincoln, the LED Driver Modules may contain a device that can cause the low-beam and high-beam headlights, daytime running lights, front position lights and front turn signals to malfunction.

If you're playing the Ford Recall Drinking Game, something I presume exists, I'm now concerned for two reasons. The first is that there have to be more interesting things to do drinking games about, but the second is simple concern for your physical health. I certainly haven't had 102 drinks this year.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/lax-fuel-economy-rules-are-hurting-rivian/l-intro-1755266266.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 13:06:42.561698

The senator explained that Liberty Energy, Secretary Wright’s former company, played a role in helping North Dakota strengthen its position in the energy sector by bringing new hydraulic fracturing technologies to market.
That means more affordable energy and a more reliable grid, which is a recipe for true U.S. energy dominance,” Sen. Hoeven said.
“North Dakota’s leadership in developing the energy technologies our nation needs was on full display today.","U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND), U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-ND), and North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong welcomed U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to North Dakota this week to discuss the state’s efforts to expand energy production, including through enhanced oil recovery.

The visit at the University of North Dakota’s Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) included a tour of the facility and a roundtable discussion titled “Cracking the Code 2.0” with leaders of the state’s oil, gas, coal, and power industries. The events highlighted the EERC’s partnership with the Department of Energy (DOE) and its work in carbon capture, oil recovery, and other technologies critical to powering the United States with reliable, affordable energy from the Bakken.

The discussions focused on policies secured in the One Big Beautiful Bill that align incentives to encourage partnerships between coal and oil producers to double the oil recovery rate in the Bakken and double the life of coal-fired electric power plants.

“In North Dakota, we originally cracked the code in the Bakken by advancing a legal, tax and regulatory environment that enabled the deployment of the latest greatest technologies to access previously unavailable oil reserves. This empowered innovative companies to come into the state and develop oil and gas from shale formations on a commercially viable basis,” Sen. Hoeven said.

The senator explained that Liberty Energy, Secretary Wright’s former company, played a role in helping North Dakota strengthen its position in the energy sector by bringing new hydraulic fracturing technologies to market.

“Now we have him in the state once again in his new role as Secretary of Energy as we crack the code on the Bakken for the second time, bringing together our oil and coal industries to not only double our recovery rate in the Bakken, but also double the life of our coal plants. That means more affordable energy and a more reliable grid, which is a recipe for true U.S. energy dominance,” Sen. Hoeven said.

During the tour, participants saw EERC’s latest projects, including recovering rare earth elements from lignite coal, front-end testing and design for injection wells.

“North Dakota’s leadership in developing the energy technologies our nation needs was on full display today. From carbon capture that boosts oil recovery to extending the life of reliable coal plants, the innovation happening here is second to none—thanks in large part to the researchers, engineers, and partners at the EERC,” Rep. Fedorchak said. “Having Secretary Wright here to see this work firsthand and discuss ways the DOE can further enhance this work is vital.”",,N,,2025-08-15 15:02:35.828548

Health threats of climate change aside, basic economic facts pour cold water on the Trump administration's contention that regulating planet-warming gases is too expensive.
Polling consistently shows that about two-thirds of Americans believe the government is doing too little to protect us from climate change.","This summer is a testament to the growing menace of climate change. Dangerous flash floods, heat waves, and wildfire smoke have assailed the U.S. for months, with no end in sight. Despite this -- and adding to a long list of assaults on public health -- President Trump is now using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to aim its sledgehammer at the ""endangerment finding,"" which gives the EPA the authority to regulate air-polluting, climate-warming gases.

If President Trump succeeds, Americans will be sicker and poorer for generations to come. Now is the time to use our voices to protect this critically important rule.

The Role of the Endangerment Finding

The endangerment finding was established by the EPA in 2009 to protect the public from six planet-warming greenhouse gases by regulating them as pollutants. The rule rests on a 2007 Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to make a science-based determination on the effects of these pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The endangerment finding underpins longstanding health and environmental protections, including vehicle and power plant emissions standards.

Seemingly unaware of the EPA's mission to protect human health and the environment, President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the EPA to review the endangerment finding, arguing that regulating planet-warming fossil fuel emissions is too expensive for the industries causing the pollution. On July 29, the EPA fulfilled the president's order, and the rule is now under review.

Healthcare professionals should be alarmed by this reckless proposal to place financial considerations above the interests of our patients, communities, and future generations.

The Costs of Ignoring Climate Science

The health consequences of fossil fuel-driven air pollution and climate change are not theoretical. Air pollution from fossil fuel burning is estimated to cause 5 to 10 million deaths per year globally, with some of the highest rates in the northeastern U.S. Year after year, unquenchable wildfires cast massive plumes of smoke over North America, carrying toxic particulate matter and other compounds linked to severe health consequences. Attribution science has shown that climate change has made these fires more probable and more severe.

Severe heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S.; as extremely hot days continue to become more common and intense, heat-related mortality is expected to increase. Massive inland floods due to sudden torrential rains are becoming commonplace but no less devastating to the communities they destroy. Warmer, more humid weather is creating a vast utopia for dangerous, vector-borne illnesses, while simultaneously lengthening and intensifying the allergy season. Poorer mental health is at the nexus of all these climate impacts.

Health threats of climate change aside, basic economic facts pour cold water on the Trump administration's contention that regulating planet-warming gases is too expensive. The inflation-adjusted economic costs of climate-related events are staggering, totaling nearly $462 billion in the U.S. from 2022-2024.

The American Lung Association estimates that by switching away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, the U.S. would generate $1.2 trillion in health benefits by 2050, while avoiding 13 million lost workdays, averting 110,000 premature deaths, and preventing 3 million asthma attacks. In addition, moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources would lead to job growth and the opportunity to position the U.S. as a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and deploying renewable energy technologies, according to the Department of Energy.

The Public Wants Stronger Protections

President Trump's proposal to gut the EPA's pollution-regulating authority is also wildly out of step with public opinion. People are increasingly aware that they sit in the crosshairs of weak public policy on climate change. Polling consistently shows that about two-thirds of Americans believe the government is doing too little to protect us from climate change. Three-quarters want stricter limits on air pollution. Meanwhile, ""climate denialists"" are dwindling in number, with only about 15% of Americans falling into this category.

Despite broad-based public support for regulating health-damaging climate-warming gases and air pollution, and the rapidly mounting costs of climate-related disasters, the Trump administration is ignoring climate impacts while boldly proceeding with its attack on the endangerment finding and attempting to undo decades of scientific consensus.

How Health Professionals Can Take Action

Fortunately, there is time to act. The EPA public comment period is open through September 15, 2025. Anyone can comment, no matter what your expertise. This toolkit can be used to craft a public comment, but authentic personal stories are the most powerful.

For those who wish to provide oral testimony, a public hearing will occur from August 19-20, and possibly longer depending on the number of registrants. Anyone can provide oral testimony remotely by signing up at this link.

Every public comment and testimonial must be considered in the EPA's decision. And, if the EPA rescinds the endangerment finding, public comments and oral testimony will serve as evidence in legal challenges to the EPA's decision.

Use your voice to protect this vitally important rule, which stands as a bulwark between public health and dangerous, unregulated fossil fuel pollution.

The transformation of the Phipps Bend site reflects a broader trend of innovation in the U.S. energy sector.","An abandoned nuclear plant in Tennessee is undergoing a remarkable transformation. The former Phipps Bend Nuclear Plant site, which once symbolized unfulfilled potential and financial waste, is now poised to become a beacon of innovation and sustainability. A new polysilicon manufacturing facility is set to rise on these grounds, promising not just economic rejuvenation but also significant advancements in energy efficiency. This development, spearheaded by Highland Materials, highlights a pivotal shift in the U.S. energy landscape, emphasizing a move toward cleaner and more sustainable manufacturing processes. As this site transitions from nuclear ambitions to cutting-edge solar technology, it represents broader trends in energy policy and industrial innovation.

The Rise of the Highland Energy Hub

The transformation of the former Phipps Bend Nuclear Plant into a state-of-the-art polysilicon manufacturing hub marks a significant milestone in renewable energy development. Spanning 140 acres in Hawkins County, Tennessee, this project revives a site that was once a financial albatross. The plant, which was only 40 percent completed before being abandoned, left behind a staggering $2.6 billion debt. Now, this site will host a 16,000 metric ton polysilicon production facility led by Highland Materials.

Highland Materials has secured a long-term ground lease and aims to produce solar-grade polysilicon at “less than standard cost.” This project, supported by $255.6 million in Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, is expected to reach an annual production capacity of 20,000 metric tons within four years. This will be enough to supply the equivalent of 11 gigawatts of solar cells, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

The Highland energy hub is a testament to the potential of reimagining abandoned industrial sites as centers for innovation. The existing infrastructure, including a high-voltage regional transmission interconnect, provides a unique advantage for accommodating large-scale industrial development. Richard Rast, CEO of Highland Materials, expressed enthusiasm about the market opportunities, job creation, and community support that this project brings to the region.

Pioneering Energy-efficient Silicon Production

Highland Materials is set to redefine polysilicon manufacturing with its energy-efficient production process at the new Tennessee facility. The company plans to implement a cutting-edge aluminum–silicon alloy smelting system, which reduces energy consumption significantly. By combining impure raw silicon with pure aluminum, the smelting process lowers the melting temperature, thereby reducing energy use to just 20–40 kWh per kilogram of silicon. This is well below industry standards while maintaining ultra-high product quality.

Polysilicon plays a crucial role in the solar industry as over 90 percent of the world’s solar panels rely on this ultra-pure silicon. The production process begins with refining quartz into metallurgical-grade silicon, which is then purified through a series of steps to achieve over 99.9 percent purity. This innovative approach not only enhances energy efficiency but also minimizes environmental impact, making it a model for sustainable manufacturing.

“The introduction of energy-efficient polysilicon production at the Highland facility represents a critical step toward reducing the environmental footprint of solar panel manufacturing,” reports Construction Review Online.

Strengthening U.S. Energy Independence

Polysilicon production is currently dominated by China, which poses strategic challenges for U.S. energy independence. By establishing a facility capable of producing high-quality polysilicon domestically, Highland Materials is contributing to a more secure and resilient energy supply chain. This development is critical for reducing reliance on imports and bolstering the U.S. solar industry.

The Tennessee facility is expected to support various upcoming solar projects, including a planned $200 million solar panel factory in Ohio. By sourcing polysilicon domestically, these projects can ensure a steady supply of essential materials, thereby reducing vulnerabilities associated with international supply chains. Furthermore, this initiative aligns with broader national goals of achieving energy independence and promoting renewable energy adoption.

The Highland project exemplifies how strategic investments in advanced manufacturing can enhance national security and drive economic growth. By leveraging existing infrastructure and fostering innovation, the U.S. is taking significant steps toward a more sustainable energy future.

Revitalizing Communities Through Innovation

Beyond its environmental and strategic benefits, the redevelopment of the former Phipps Bend Nuclear Plant site represents a broader opportunity for community revitalization. The project promises to create jobs and stimulate economic activity in Hawkins County, transforming a once-stagnant area into a hub of innovation and progress. The support from local communities and state-level stakeholders has been instrumental in advancing this initiative.

As the new polysilicon facility takes shape, it serves as a reminder of the potential for reinvention in communities across the United States. By turning abandoned industrial sites into centers for renewable energy manufacturing, regions can reclaim their economic vitality and contribute to national energy goals. This project not only exemplifies the power of innovation but also highlights the importance of collaboration between private enterprises and public entities in driving sustainable development.

The transformation of the Phipps Bend site reflects a broader trend of innovation in the U.S. energy sector. As the nation continues to invest in renewable technologies and sustainable manufacturing, how can other regions replicate this success and contribute to a more sustainable future?

Rather than let that capacity wither, the automaker will deploy both new and repurposed EV batteries for stationary energy storage, starting with a Nevada microgrid powering Crusoe’s modular AI data center.
The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM.
To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home.
GM batteries can play an integral role.","It's no secret that demand for electric vehicles is moving much slower than anticipated, so GM is partnering with Redwood Materials to supply battery energy storage systems for artificial intelligence data centers, a sector with an insatiable appetite for power.

The move allows the automaker to ramp up its existing battery production capacity—much of which is currently underutilized. The partnership will use both new and second-life Ultium batteries to create localized “microgrids” capable of supplying clean, reliable electricity. AI data centers are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028.

GM’s Ultium Cell plants in Tennessee and Ohio, along with a joint venture with Samsung in Indiana, could produce enough batteries to power up to one million EVs annually. But so far in 2025, GM has sold just 78,000 electric vehicles — 105,000 when including Honda-built models.

Rather than let that capacity wither, the automaker will deploy both new and repurposed EV batteries for stationary energy storage, starting with a Nevada microgrid powering Crusoe’s modular AI data center. The system can deliver 12 megawatts instantly and store up to 63 megawatt-hours of energy.

The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars - we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

Some advocates say using batteries — even second-life packs from retired EVs — could help make AI operations cleaner, though purpose-built storage batteries may offer better long-term performance. With global demand for stationary energy storage projected to reach 297 GWh by 2025, GM’s creative pivot to a non-traditional revenue stream should prove attractive to the stock market.

Dominique qualified for the subsidy program from clean energy provider MCE. Like many customers, he sees their service included as part of his monthly PG &E statement. He says since the upgrades, his bills have gone down.

""My bill was $500 a month and now it is down to 30 something. The last bill I paid was $98,"" Dominique said.

Beyond the home improvements, Dominique believes his power source is getting an upgrade as well, including sources like solar and biogas -- and, as of this summer, an expanding supply of geothermal energy, produced at a field known as the Geysers. It's a massive complex of geothermal plants stretching across Sonoma and several other counties.

Owner-operator Calpine recently completed a 25-megawatt expansion of its system. It taps the naturally heated steam and turns it into turbine-powered electricity.

Recycled water from the City of Santa Rosa and regional partners is also delivered to the Geysers where Calpine injects it to replenish the geothermal reservoir. MCE's Dawn Weisz says the utility is one of the first clean energy providers to receive electricity from Calpine's new expansion.

""The great thing about geothermal energy is that it produces renewables around the clock 24/7. A lot of renewable energy that we have in our portfolio, like solar and wind, only produces part of the time. So having this geothermal energy is a great way to enhance reliability for our customers,"" Weisz said.

Launched more than a decade ago, MCE was California's first Community Choice Aggregator. It's a public nonprofit that buy clean energy and deliver it as an alternative through existing utilities. Weisz says nearly 40 communities across its coverage area now chose MCE as their preferred provider.

""Often folks choose MCE because we are the public option with more stable rates. We also supply more renewable energy and greenhouse gas energy, greenhouse gas free energy to our customers. And that's what folks are interested in, both residential customers and business customers are looking for the cleaner energy alternative,"" Weisz said.

She said the additional geothermal power is enough to cover 15,000 Bay Area residents and businesses. MCE is also busy adding other new sources of clean energy as well, including a recently completed solar installation in Richmond. The agency also gets power from dozens of other sources around the state, including wind, biogas and hydropower.

For clean energy customer Dominique, it comes down to choice and convenience.

In a study published August 14 in the Journal of Environmental Management, researchers at Edith Cowan University (ECU) in Australia argue that tapping into the leftover lithium in used batteries could fuel a pragmatic, sustainable alternative to lithium mining. Shockingly, the lithium batteries that end up in landfills retain nearly 80% of their lithium capacity—still very much usable. Aside from the clear environmental advantage, recycling lithium batteries could also bring a wide array of socioeconomic benefits, the paper states.

The paper, a comprehensive review of the global lithium supply chain, evaluates the efficacy of lithium extraction from mining and recycling. Mining remains the dominant method for lithium recovery, but its environmental impact alone should be reason enough to eventually move away from it, the researchers explained in a statement. Recycling, by contrast, could offer far more bang for our buck. First, recycling processes produce around 61% less carbon than mining while using 83% less energy and 79% less water.

“By recycling these batteries, you can access not only the remaining lithium—which is already purified to near 99 percent—but you can also retrieve the nickel and the cobalt from these batteries,” added Asad Ali, study lead author and a postdoctoral student at ECU, in the statement. Ideally, such recycling facilities wouldn’t be as demanding on the natural environment as mining, he said.

Again, we have too many idle batteries lying around, the researchers noted—and that supply is only expected to grow. The global lithium-ion battery market is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 13%, and we’re projected to consume roughly 1,600 kilotons of lithium by 2026. In Australia alone—where the researchers are based—a government report estimates that lithium battery waste could amount to 137,000 tons each year.

With the right investments in infrastructure, tapping into this resource could create a new, profitable niche in the energy sector, said study co-author Sadia Afrin, also a postdoctoral student at ECU.

The decision aims to promote an ""all-of-the-above"" energy approach, with regulators arguing the mandate inflates prices and is no longer needed.

Environmental groups and clean energy advocates oppose the repeal, citing the potential for higher bills, health impacts, economic harms and job losses in the renewable energy sector.

The repeal process will include public comment sessions and a final vote.

Arizona utility regulators voted to initiate a repeal of the state's renewable energy standard, a move that could have long-term ramifications for the power grid and customers' bills.

The decision starts a rulemaking process that would strike requirements for electric utilities to get 15% of their power from renewable sources like solar and wind — and 30% of that from so-called ""distributed generation,"" such as rooftop solar.

It comes as the nation grapples with what its transition to cleaner energy sources should look like, or if it should migrate to renewables at all. The news arrives on the heels of a federal spending bill that sharply rolled back tax credits for renewables, a move by several electric utilities to back a new natural gas pipeline, and a decision from Arizona Public Service Co. to walk back its clean energy commitments.

Regulators unanimously said the mandate — officially known as the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, or REST — conflicts with free-market principles. They expressed concerns that it could be artificially inflating energy prices in the state, and framed a repeal of the rules as a key step toward an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy generation.

They also said the rules are no longer necessary. Most of the state's utilities have met or exceeded the standard, which was established in 2006.

Yessica Del Rincón, a spokesperson for APS, said it got 19% of its total energy last year from renewables. That number was nearly 23% for Tucson Electric Power Co. Salt River Project is not overseen by the Corporation Commission and does not file annual reports with it on its renewable energy mix. The state's electric cooperatives, not-for-profit utilities that largely serve rural communities, all reported compliance with the standard.

""I think people want to act like the choice is between renewables and fossil fuel generation, and it's not — it's both,"" said Corporation Commission Chairman Kevin Thompson, adding that utilities could continue to pursue clean energy projects and that he did not believe repealing the standard would harm the renewables industry in Arizona. ""I think the sooner all forms of generation learn to live in harmony, the better off we're all going to be.""

A number of environmental organizations, clean energy industry advocates and business trade groups opposed the move. They questioned regulators' assertion that the mandate drove up electric prices, pointing to studies suggesting renewables are overall cheaper forms of power generation than fossil fuels.

They also said striking the rules will create uncertainty in the state's clean energy sector and lead to economic harm.

""They have benefitted Arizona immensely,"" Cepand Alizadeh of the Arizona Technology Council said of the rules. ""It's promoted a lot of job creation in the tech sector.""

If the standard were ultimately set aside, Arizona would be one of only a few Western states without a renewable energy mandate.

California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington all have such standards, and Utah has a voluntary target on its books, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Idaho, Montana and Wyoming have no clean energy portfolio requirements.

'Plenty of sunshine': Repeal looms as energy demand grows

The debate over the renewables standard comes as power demand skyrockets.

The trend is a national one, but is being driven locally by continued population growth, hotter summers, power-hungry data centers and the rise of advanced manufacturing.

""We need to look at a diverse array of energy sources to power Arizona for years to come,"" Alizadeh said. ""Demand is growing daily, weekly, monthly.""

Utilities project they will need to generate thousands more megawatts of power to keep up with future demand. That's led most to invest heavily in new infrastructure. But there's a question around exactly what types of energy generation they should be prioritizing.

Some believe solar and wind power have a pivotal role to play in meeting growth. Michael Barrio of Advanced Energy United, a trade association representing the broader clean energy industry, said in a statement that policies like the renewables standard reduce costs from increased demand, support jobs and keep the state's economy ticking.

Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon Chapter, noted that Arizona ""has plenty of sunshine.""

""Solar power is an abundant and low-cost resource,"" she said. ""We should be taking advantage of the incredible solar resource we already have here and encouraging our utilities to do better.""

Utilities have invested in renewables — and regulators noted that they expect power providers will continue to do so, even without the mandate. But those technologies are considered intermittent, meaning they don't provide a steady supply of power. Solar panels can't generate new energy at night, and wind turbines don't move without a breeze.

That challenge can be mitigated with battery storage infrastructure. Still, utilities have a need for so-called ""baseload"" power options that can provide constant electricity.

APS, SRP and TEP have discussed bringing new nuclear power options to the grid — but details are vague and any project appears far off. In the interim, they are increasingly looking to natural gas to offset weaknesses of renewable energy sources.

That's drawn alarm from environmental and clean energy groups. Autumn Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, said the growing power demand heightens the need for the renewables mandate.

""Percentages vary as a system grows,"" she said, adding that there's ""absolutely no certainty"" that utilities will remain above the current 15% renewable threshold in coming years.

Will striking the mandate raise electric bills, impact economy?

Fossil fuels are generally considered more affordable forms of energy production than renewables — at least, in terms of upfront infrastructure costs.

But many factors play into how expensive or affordable various forms of power generation ultimately prove. Arizona produces almost no coal, oil or natural gas, meaning that it must be imported from other states. That creates transmission costs.

Similarly, renewable generation often requires battery storage or other backup power sources to meet energy demand. Even in the desert, the sun isn't always out — and accounting for energy storage can prove costly.

Clean energy advocates have long argued that renewables pay off in the long term. Lazard, an investment banking firm, releases an annual report examining the cost of energy. Its most recent analysis found that wind, solar and other renewable power options are generally the most cost-competitive form of energy generation in the country, even without federal subsidies.

Proponents of solar and wind also often note that utilities typically have to pay market price for such fossil fuels. Oil and gas markets can be volatile, so overreliance on fossil fuels can lead to sudden cost spikes.

Regulators said if renewables are cost-effective, then the repeal of the mandate shouldn't matter.

""Time and time again, everybody said solar is the cheapest,"" said Commissioner René Lopez, adding that it was time for the technology to ""stand on its own two feet.""

An economic analysis looking at the repeal of the renewables standard found ""limited"" impact on ratepayers statewide. The study, from Elliott D. Pollack & Company, was procured by staffers at the Corporation Commission. The analysis noted that utilities could still pursue clean energy projects to keep power affordable and that the general public would benefit from the elimination of a surcharge currently paid by customers.

But supporters of the mandate said the analysis should have looked at the broader economic impacts of striking the standard. Arizona was home to about 65,000 clean energy jobs last year, per the U.S. Department of Energy. Plus, dollars spent on solar and wind projects tend to stay in the state.

Bahr called regulators' vote ""misguided and shortsighted.""

""Instead of deleting the REST, we should be looking at how to upgrade and strengthen it,"" she said, adding that the mandate has been ""a huge success"" and has catalyzed economic growth.

What's next for the repeal process?

The recent vote starts a lengthy rulemaking process to repeal the renewable standard.

Regulators will be required to hold public comment sessions and hearings on the proposal. Ultimately, they will take a final vote on whether to strike the rules. Nicole Garcia, a spokesperson for the Corporation Commission, said that is tentatively expected by mid-2026.

Attorney General Kris Mayes will have to review the rulemaking process after that final vote takes place. Mayes, a former utility regulator, was among the commissioners who crafted the renewables mandate in 2006. She said in filings that she opposed its repeal.

But Garcia said Mayes can't reject the rule change off of her preferences alone. She can send it back only if there is a mistake in the proceedings.

Richie Taylor, a spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office, confirmed that Mayes' review focuses solely on required rulemaking procedures. He would not say whether Mayes could sue over the repeal of the rules.

""We're evaluating all legal options, but we haven't made any determination yet,"" he said.","https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/-mm-/56e643818ec8ddc71449fdaf1eda4e8bc51e0b9c/c=0-38-725-447/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/08/05/1407250267000-478926805.jpg?crop=725,409,x0,y74&width=725&height=409&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-15 11:03:40.584605

Who pays for grid expansion?","A new report into the seismic demands of AI data centers on the power grid claims that electricity rates for individuals and small businesses could increase vastly in the face of data center expansion from the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The New York Times reports that AI data centers could see their demand on the country's electricity could increase to as much as 12% by 2028, up from just 4% a couple of years ago. Furthermore, high-tech giants are building their own power plants, becoming consumers and producers of electricity in a way that is fundamentally reshaping the U.S. electricity market. According to the report, small businesses and households could see their bills go up disproportionately as a result.

AI data centers need more power and power grid investments

According to the report, in 2023, data centers run by such companies as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft accounted for 4% of the nation's electricity use, and federal projections indicate that share could climb to 12% by 2028. Since AI processing is far more energy-intensive than streaming or standard cloud workloads, Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, has openly said that power availability is the main bottleneck limiting new data center capacity.

Significant power demand not only creates unprecedented strain on the grid but is even forcing high-tech giants to generate their own power. For now, they use various renewable energy sources, gas turbines, or diesel generators, but going forward, some even plan to run their own nuclear power plants. Already, some sell surplus energy on the wholesale market. Over the past decade, these sales have totaled $2.7 billion, with most revenue generated since 2022. In some regions, their operations match or surpass the scale of established utilities, allowing them to influence both supply and pricing.

Keep in mind that the power usage of AI data centers is also highly volatile, shifting from peak demand to minimal load in seconds with training workloads as they reach checkpoints. Such swings can destabilize the grid, as even a 10% change in voltage or frequency can damage electronics or trip protection systems. If a major facility, such as a Microsoft Azure installation, suddenly reduces consumption, it can trigger cascading shutdowns across the network. For now, this problem has been solved through dummy workloads, but this does not solve the wider power grid expansion challenges.

Who pays for grid expansion?

However, whether hyperscale CSPs generate their own power or buy it from partners, their power requirements necessitate an expansion of the grid. The question is, who will pay for this expansion? If upgrades cannot keep pace, the result could be blackouts, with industrial customers losing access to limited capacity.

The utilities industry warns that tech firms could reserve far more capacity than they ultimately use, leaving ratepayers to cover the cost of unused infrastructure. For example, Unicorn Interests planned to launch a large data center in Virginia in 2013, but delayed opening for four years. Regulators had approved $42 million in substation and transmission upgrades, much of which went unused during the delay, costing nearby customers millions. While another project later offset part of the expense, the incident illustrates the financial risks of overestimated demand.

In Ohio, American Electric Power (AEP) proposed a separate rate category for data centers and cryptocurrency mines, requiring them to pay for at least 85% of their requested capacity whether used or not. Tech companies countered with a 75% take-or-pay commitment, arguing for flexibility and equal treatment with other large industrial users. However, early this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio unanimously backed the utility's proposal. Nonetheless, CSPs have since appealed the decision, calling it both unlawful and unreasonable.

Small businesses and households suffer

The rapid growth in electricity use from AI data centers is set to push power bills higher for households and small businesses, as utilities invest heavily in expanding the grid. This has prompted consumer advocates and lawmakers to question whether ordinary ratepayers should be footing the bill for corporate growth in the AI sector.

Since 2020, average residential electricity prices across the U.S. have climbed more than 30%, according to NYT. They could rise another 8% nationwide by 2030, a study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University estimates. Meanwhile, in states like Virginia, an increase could be up to 25%, NYT claims.

In fact, the impact is already being felt in Ohio, where typical households began paying at least $15 more per month starting in June, a jump linked to the added demand from new data centers, according to the report. There is also an unused 500 MW power substation that belongs to AEP, which was supposed to power Intel's Silicon Heartland campus, whose schedule has been pushed back to the next decade, but which could be pulled in if the U.S. government takes a stake in Intel.

In the end, U.S. consumers could end up paying twice for services like ChatGPT — first for the OpenAI subscription, and again for the power grid that keeps Microsoft Azure’s servers running OpenAI's machines behind it.

This proposal represents a significant change in EPA policy and the potential future of numerous CAA regulatory schemes.

The Endangerment Finding was a final rule published in 2009 by the Obama administration in which EPA concluded that a combination of six key GHGs “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” It was intended to provide a basis for EPA’s regulation of motor vehicles and engines pursuant to Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA, which authorizes EPA to regulate emissions or air pollutants from motor vehicles and engines that cause or contribute to “air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” By rescinding the Endangerment Finding, EPA will eliminate this regulatory foundation, clearing the way for a repeal of the GHG emission standards.

In support of its proposal, EPA makes numerous legal and scientific arguments. Notably, EPA argues that global climate change concerns (as opposed to solely local or regional concerns) cannot be used to meet the criteria of CAA Section 202(a) and that the Endangerment Finding was not adequately supported by scientific evidence. EPA also argues that, regardless of whether the Endangerment Finding is repealed, GHG vehicle and engine emission standards should still be repealed because there is no emission control technology that would “measurably impact GHG concentrations in the atmosphere or the rate of global climate change” and because the emission standards “may harm, rather than advance, public welfare as defined in the CAA by reducing fleet turnover that improves air quality, safety, consumer choice, and economic opportunity.”

If adopted, the EPA’s proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding may not only lead to the repeal of the GHG emission standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines at issue, but may also undermine numerous other CAA regulations, leading to their proposed repeal. Comments on the proposed rule are currently due on or before Sept. 15, though it remains to be seen whether this deadline will be extended. While environmental organizations have generally criticized the proposal, the initial reaction from industry groups has been mixed, with some welcoming the change and others raising concerns that the repeal may affect federal preemption of state-level GHG emission programs or other state-level actions addressing climate change. There will undoubtedly be a significant number of comments submitted in response to the proposal and lawsuits challenging whatever final rule comes out of the rulemaking process.

Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP) have operated as separate utilities since the 2012 merger of Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

Although legally considered a merger, the proposed combination is more in line with reorganizing two corporate divisions into one, the investor-owned utility said.

Subject to approval, the targeted effective date of the combination is Jan. 1, 2027.

Duke Energy said it is modernizing its infrastructure to meet the Carolinas’ growing energy needs, while ensuring customers continue to have reliable service at the lowest reasonable cost.

It said operating as a single utility would allow DEC and DEP to meet the growing needs of the Carolinas at a much lower cost. “Combining the two utilities would result in more efficient planning across the utilities’ combined 52,000-square-mile service area in the Carolinas, avoid redundant investments, improve grid reliability and more.”

Duke Energy also said a combination allows Duke Energy to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continued as separate utilities. And spreading infrastructure investments over a larger customer base helps moderate the impact on rates, it said.

“The combined companies will also be able to operate existing resources more cost-effectively by running fewer and less expensive units, using less fuel, and reducing unit cycling on and off, saving maintenance costs,” the company said.

Approvals are required from the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which will continue to oversee and regulate the combined utility.

Duke Energy said it evaluated the customer benefits of operating as a single, combined utility versus continuing to operate as two separate utilities. Duke Energy projects retail customer savings of more than $1 billion through 2038, after any expenses. The savings are projected to occur between Jan. 1, 2027 – the proposed effective date of the combined utility – and 2038, the close of the planning horizon for the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan. Additional customer savings would continue to be generated beyond 2038, it said.

As part of the 2012 merger of their holding companies, Duke Energy and Progress Energy received regulatory permission to jointly dispatch power generation resources in the Carolinas.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., steel producers are backing away from earlier commitments to produce green steel.

(DRI using green hydrogen paired with EAFs is the highest – but nearly nonexistent – standard for producing green steel.)
But the emergence of overseas buyers willing to pay more for steel made with green hydrogen could drive the market, she said.","While China leads the world in both the production and adoption of clean energy tech like solar and EVs, the country has been slower to tackle decarbonizing heavy industry. That is starting to change.

In July, the Chinese state-owned steelmaker HBIS Group agreed to sell more than 10,000 metric tons of green steel to a buyer in Italy. The agreement set a deadline for delivery by the end of August. That same week, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited China and pledged to work together to build out the green steel industry.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., steel producers are backing away from earlier commitments to produce green steel. Just before President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the Swedish steelmaker SSAB pulled out of negotiations for $500 million in federal funding to back a project to make iron with green hydrogen. In June, Cleveland-Cliffs abandoned its own green steel effort in Middletown, Ohio, after the Trump administration pressed the steelmaker to use a $500 million Biden-era grant to ramp up coal-fired iron production. Nippon Steel pledged to modernize U.S. Steel after securing Trump’s support for a $15 billion acquisition of its American rival in June, but the Japanese giant’s reputation as a ​“coal company that also makes steel” suggests the merger could extend the life of blast furnaces in Indiana and Pennsylvania.

“A lot of the rhetoric around competitiveness with China makes it seem like we think we must not fall behind. Stories like this make clear we already are behind,” said Marcela Mulholland, a former official at the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations who now leads advocacy at the nonpartisan climate group Clean Tomorrow. ​“It is happening. The green steel example is just one of many.”

What kind of green steel is China making – and how much?

China produces a staggering amount of steel each year — more than 1 billion metric tons. About 90% is made with a two-stop process that relies on coal at both stages. First, iron is smelted from ore in a coal-fired blast furnace. Then the iron is transformed into steel in a coal-fired basic oxygen furnace. About 10% of the country’s steel is made with an electric arc furnace, a process that – if powered by green electricity – is much cleaner, but depends on a steady supply of scrap metal as a feedstock. (The U.S. has a decided advantage with this particular technology since most of the steel that the nation produces uses scrap metal in EAFs.)

China has yet to widely implement the technology known as direct reduction of iron, or DRI, which typically relies on natural gas to produce iron but which can also use hydrogen. The country’s supplies of the former fuel are limited, spurring it to experiment with ways to conduct DRI using the latter.

China has many small-scale pilot projects manufacturing steel with hydrogen, but most involve minimal volumes of the material. For example, the country’s No. 2 steelmaker, Angang Steel Co., is producing just 10,000 metric tons of iron from green-hydrogen-fueled DRI per year. HBIS is shipping that volume of steel to Italy this month alone. Only HBIS and another major producer, China Baowu Steel Group, are producing green steel with hydrogen in significant quantities, according to research published last month by the Helsinki-based nonprofit Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

How clean the hydrogen is that China uses to make steel is a complicated question.

Hydrogen – the smallest molecule – is already widely used in industrial processes and offers a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels since it produces no carbon dioxide when burned. Yet the vast majority of the global supply of hydrogen is made through methods that use fossil fuels and generate planet-heating emissions. When made with electrolyzers powered by renewable energy, hydrogen produces almost no emissions at all, but production of this form – green hydrogen – is nascent and comes at a high premium. (DRI using green hydrogen paired with EAFs is the highest – but nearly nonexistent – standard for producing green steel.)

Headquartered in Hebei province, HBIS started experimenting with lower-carbon steel in part by using hydrogen captured from its coking plants, where coal is roasted at more than 1,110 degrees Fahrenheit to cook off contaminants and produce an industrial-grade fuel. Roughly 60% of the gas emitted during the process is hydrogen.

It’s unclear how much of the steel HBIS is shipping to Italy is made with iron that employs hydrogen produced from industrial waste processes rather than the green stuff made from electricity generated by nearby renewables. HBIS did not respond to a request for comment.

But David Fishman, a principal at the Shanghai-based energy consultancy The Lantau Group, said ​“there are quite a few” sources of hydrogen made with renewable power near HBIS’s facility in northern China. He noted that HBIS has a strategic partnership with the China National Petroleum Corp., which launched its first large-scale demonstration project to make green hydrogen in 2023.

The export deal may be a sign of China raising its ambitions for cleaner steel. The national government had set a target for 15% of steel coming from EAFs by the end of this year. But that steelmaking capacity has remained at 10% for more than a decade.

Part of the problem is that provincial steel targets are at odds with the policies set in Beijing. Though the national government opened China to imported scrap steel that could be used in EAFs, imports halved in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis. Ten provinces, meanwhile, ramped up production of coal-made steel in the first half of this year, bringing down prices and disincentivizing more costly green investments, said Xinyi Shen, the China team lead for the Finnish nonprofit, who authored the report.

But if China can deepen its stockpiles of scrap steel, the country could more quickly build out a lower-carbon steel industry using EAFs while it waits to improve technology on green hydrogen that can bring down costs of fully decarbonized steel, Shen said.

“This is a more promising way to produce low-carbon steel,” she said. ​“For hydrogen steelmaking, it depends on the progress of green power.”

The bottleneck, she said, is ​“always the feedstock for DRI.”

But two recent policy changes on renewable power could incentivize Chinese companies to use more of the nation’s vast solar and wind resources to generate green hydrogen.

The first, called the 430 policy, took effect on May 1 and requires that new distributed solar arrays — like those on buildings’ rooftops — first power the facility they are sited on before selling any surplus electricity onto the grid. The second, dubbed the 531 policy, eliminates the guaranteed ​“feed-in tariffs” that renewables projects long benefited from in China, and requires new solar and wind farms to sell electricity on the spot market.

Whether policies that direct renewable power away from the grid benefit hydrogen producers by making that power more available to them depends on the provincial-level strategies for the fuel, which vary, Shen said. But the emergence of overseas buyers willing to pay more for steel made with green hydrogen could drive the market, she said.

A ​‘significant’ attempt to ​‘seize commercial opportunities’ in Europe’s steel market

Starting next year, the European Union, of which Italy is a founding member, is set to fully implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The carbon tariff essentially levies an extra cost on imports made with more planet-heating pollution. That means China’s coal-fired steel is about to become less competitive. While China could ramp up scrap-based EAF steel, Shen said the quality of that product tends to be very low, making it unappealing for export. The Italy deal, according to the Boston Consulting Group, shows the levies are creating a market for truly green material.

“This development holds significant implications,” Nicole Voigt, the Boston Consulting Group’s global lead of metals, told Canary Media. ​“China’s commitment clearly highlights its intent to seize commercial opportunities in the green steel market, especially in Europe.”

It’ll take time for the cost to come down. But China ​“overall has a long-term direction for carbon neutrality,” Shen said. ​“This gives companies and investors confidence and certainty to invest into newer technologies.”

Under the previous administration, the U.S. pumped billions of dollars into green hydrogen and clean industrial projects, and made tax credits for renewables available into the 2030s. Even then, America hardly employed all the policy mechanisms at play in China. The federal clean-industry program where Mulholland worked supported a few dozen projects, almost all of which saw their funding yanked away by the Trump administration this spring. Last year alone, China had nearly twice the number of low-carbon industrial demonstration projects. This year, Beijing funded a second set of more than 100 new projects.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2225567365_2025-08-13-213010_htnx.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=aa760603cb71fe252c37d2d8b7e90af8,N,,2025-08-15 13:05:40.587854

NASDAQ: ASPI (""ASPI” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, today announced that the Company and its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (“QLE” or “Quantum Leap Energy”), an advanced materials company focused on the development of technology and processes for the production of advanced nuclear fuels, have entered into a Joint Venture Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Fermi LLC (“Fermi America”), regarding a joint venture pursuant to which the parties intend to collaborate on the research, development and ultimately the commercial production of advanced nuclear fuels on the planned HyperGrid Campus in Carson County, Texas.

The non-binding MOU contemplates QLE and Fermi America entering into definitive agreements pursuant to which the parties will form a new entity in Texas as a joint venture for the research and development, and then the construction, of an advanced nuclear fuel enrichment facility capable of producing large quantities of High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU) for small modular reactors. It is anticipated that the advanced nuclear fuel facility will provide for the conversion and deconversion of uranium products, as well as the fabrication of fuel assemblies. In addition, the MOU contemplates ASPI entering into a separate lease for the development and construction of a 100% ASPI-owned enrichment research and commercial production facility for stable isotopes and advanced materials (excluding advanced nuclear fuels), which may include critical materials, such as Silicon-28, Germanium-70, Ytterbium-176, Nickel-64, Xenon-129, Zinc-68 and Chlorine-37.

The property leased by Fermi America from the from the Texas Tech University System for the HyperGrid Campus is strategically located near the DOE-operated Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, offering unique proximity to a federally hardened and environmentally characterized site. The site is pre-qualified for nuclear deployment under DOE and NRC precedent studies and is governed by sovereign institutional control held by Texas Tech University, as lessor. The HyperGrid Campus is expected to be the world’s largest hybrid energy and data infrastructure campus and is anticipated to generate over 11 GW of electricity to supply data centers, as well as other industries. Pantex is the primary United States nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility that aims to maintain the safety, security and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and is home to the site where most U.S. nuclear weapons are constructed and assembled.

Fermi America, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and former Texas Governor Rick Perry, along with Former Quantum Private Equity Co-Founder, Toby Neugebauer, aims to meet the rapidly growing energy demands tied to AI infrastructure. Fermi America has submitted its Combined Operating License Application to build four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors as part of its HyperGrid Project. Fermi America plans to begin construction on the nuclear power complex in 2027 and aims to have the first reactor operational by 2032. Fermi America has also entered into an MOU with Hyundai E&C for the construction and engineering of Nuclear Reactors on the HyperGrid site.

The Joint Venture MOU by and among ASPI, QLE and Fermi America was signed at a signing ceremony that took place in Dallas, Texas on August 14, 2025 and was attended by representatives of all parties, including Mr. Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASPI, Dr. Ryno Pretorius, CEO of Quantum Leap Energy, and Mr. Toby Neugebauer, CEO of Fermi America.

Toby Neugebauer, Co-Founder of Fermi America, said, “Over the last three decades, our country has been asleep at the wheel, forcing reliance on foreign nations for critical technology materials such as next-generation semiconductors and nuclear energy. Fermi is determined to restore America as global leaders in the nuclear space, and our partnership with ASP Isotopes and Quantum Leap Energy is the natural next step.”

Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASP Isotopes and Chairman of Quantum Leap Energy, said “During the last three years, ASP Isotopes has constructed three isotope enrichment facilities in South Africa to produce isotopes to enable faster semiconductors and next-generation cancer therapies. As a U.S. company, our goal has always been to bring these technologies to the United States to ensure that the United States has a domestic supply of these materials and reduce its reliance on imports from other countries. We are excited to enter into this joint venture with Fermi America to accelerate this goal.”

Ryno Pretorius, CEO of Quantum Leap Energy, commented that “QLE is excited to enter the United States domestic production market as a provider of Nuclear Fuel Services to meet the rapidly growing demands of the Fermi America HyperGrid project, as well as existing and future partners in the United States. Our goal is to scale our technologies as quickly as possible to reduce the bottleneck on the nuclear fuel industry and unlock clean American nuclear energy that will provide consistent, base load power, not only for AI but millions of Americans. We believe Fermi America is another key strategic partner to help us develop and scale our nuclear fuel services and solutions in the United States with an initial base in Texas.”

During the next 30 years, global energy consumption will likely double(1). The advanced nuclear fuels required during the next 50 years are expected to differ significantly from those used in the last 50 years. AI demand requires high base load energy which will be partially supplied by large growth in the nuclear industry from Small Modular Reactors. Many small modular and advanced reactors in the future are expected to require HALEU. The Company has received interest from potential customers who collectively require over $37 billion of HALEU between the present day and 2037, at current market prices.

ASPI has previously announced that it has entered into two supply agreements with TerraPower, LLC for HALEU from an initial uranium facility they expect to construct at Pelindaba in South Africa. The initial core supply agreement is intended to support the supply of the required first fuel cores for the initial loading of TerraPower’s Natrium project in Wyoming during the 2027/28 timeframe. The long-term supply agreement is a 10-year supply agreement of up to a total of 150 metric tons of HALEU, commencing in 2028 through end of 2037. The construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility in Texas, USA would become the second facility owned or co-owned by QLE for the production of HALEU. ASPI and QLE are also in discussions with the UK government regarding the construction of an advanced nuclear fuel facility in the UK. ASPI has also previously announced its intention to spin out QLE as a separate public company listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 4Q25.

""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" said Ben Boucher, Senior Analyst, Supply Chain Data & Analytics at Wood Mackenzie.
In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply.
According to the report, policy shifts further complicate transformer supply chains, as the rapidly evolving trade landscape in the US will exacerbate recent price increases for transformers.
""The convergence of accelerating electricity demand, aging infrastructure and supply chain vulnerabilities has created constraints that will persist well into the 2030s.""","As electricity consumption continues to surge in the US, pressure on power infrastructure such as transformers has intensified, with a supply shortage for power and distribution transformers to hit 30% and 10%, respectively, in 2025, according to a recent report from Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consultancy firm.

According to the report ""Untangling the US transformer supply chain crisis,"" since 2019, Wood Mackenzie estimates that US power and distribution transformers have seen demand surge by 116% and 41%, respectively.

This has been due to a confluence of new demand drivers, including a rise in electricity consumption, which has increased 7% since 2020, reversing a 1% decline from 2010 to 2020, the growing pipeline for clean energy projects and aging infrastructure.

""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" said Ben Boucher, Senior Analyst, Supply Chain Data & Analytics at Wood Mackenzie.

""Utilities are routinely turning to the import market to meet project timelines. In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply. This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand.""

Supply has not kept pace with demand, resulting in a growing market deficit across all transformer specifications and escalating lead times and prices.

According to the report, policy shifts further complicate transformer supply chains, as the rapidly evolving trade landscape in the US will exacerbate recent price increases for transformers.

""The passage of Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' (OBBBA) will change the demand outlook for step-up transformers due to cuts in clean energy support,"" said Boucher. ""Transformer costs are expected to increase due to new tariffs, as both imported and domestically produced units will be subject to higher unit costs due to the wide array of new tariffs, with more, including 50% on copper, set to come into effect in August, further intensifying the cost increases.""

To meet demand, many of the largest Original Equipment Manufacturers have announced investment into capacity expansions totaling $1.8 billion since 2023, specifically targeting the North American market. While this will alleviate some pressure, the demand growth rate will necessitate further expenditure to rebalance the market, according to the report.

""The US transformer market stands at a critical juncture, with supply constraints threatening to undermine the nation's energy transition and grid reliability goals,"" said Boucher.

“The US needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial know-how.” If the supply deal is realised, it could represent a significant moment in the US solar manufacturing industry.

Corning’s subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor, will produce polysilicon which will be made into wafers by Corning, then shipped to T1 Energy’s under-construction solar cell manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas. The cells will then be made into modules at T1’s module production facility in Dallas, Texas.

The shipments are scheduled to start in the “second half of 2026”.

“This is American companies building in America and protecting American energy security,” said Daniel Barcelo, CEO of T1 Energy. “The US needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial know-how.”

If the supply deal is realised, it could represent a significant moment in the US solar manufacturing industry.

The country has successfully built over 50GW of solar module production capacity, but upstream components—cells, wafers and polysilicon—have yet to materialise in comparable numbers. This is partly due to the complexity of the processes and partly due to China’s global dominance of the solar supply chain, which has driven down prices.

AB Ghosh, Corning VP and CEO of Hemlock Semiconductor, said the deal with T1 “underscores the strong demand for high-quality, American-made solar technologies.”

The US government has changed the policy landscape for domestic solar manufacturing, introducing potentially damaging “Foreign Entity of Concern” restrictions for tax credit eligibility, and layers of trade and tariff complexity for solar products entering the US.

Given the disparity between US module capacity and upstream manufacturing, many companies rely heavily on imports. But last month, T1 Energy said it expected potential tariffs on polysilicon imports and the antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) tariffs on solar cells and modules from certain countries to “boost” the US industry.

The long-term impact of the tariffs remains to be seen, but a successful supply deal with Corning would be a meaningful step for the industry.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/t1-energy.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:05:52.620808

What is the Production Tax Credit (PTC)?
Created a Two-Tiered Credit Structure: The Act established a “base” credit amount and a “bonus” or full credit amount.
This gave the solar industry a critical choice between an upfront credit (ITC) or a long-term, performance-based credit (PTC).","What is the Investment Tax Credit (ITC)?

The ITC is a one-time federal tax credit equal to a percentage of a project’s “qualified investment” when it’s placed in service. Today it’s a 6% base or 30% if you meet prevailing-wage & apprenticeship (PWA) rules (or qualify for the small-project exception), with potential +10 pts bonuses for domestic content and energy-community siting. Standalone storage also qualifies.

Simple example: If you build a $1 million solar project, you get $300,000 off your federal taxes.

What is the Production Tax Credit (PTC)?

A per-kWh credit for electricity produced and sold from a qualified facility during its first 10 years of operation. It’s 0.3¢/kWh base, multiplied by 5× (to ~1.5¢/kWh) if prevailing-wage & apprenticeship rules apply, inflation-adjusted, with additional 10% boosts for domestic content and energy-community status. You generally elect either ITC or PTC for a given facility.

Simple example: If your wind facility generates 100,000 MWh per year, you get about $275,000 in tax credits annually for 10 years. (With MW onshore wind turbines and a 35% capacity factor, 100,000 MWh per year is generated by about 11 turbines.)

A Short History of the ITC and PTC

ITC:

1978–1985: First modern “energy investment credit” enacted in the Energy Tax Act of 1978 at 10% (initially refundable), later increased and broadened before expiring mid-1980s.

2005: The Energy Policy Act of 2005 creates the 30% ITC for commercial (§48) and introduces a parallel 30% residential credit (§25D, initially capped at $2,000).

2008: The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act extends the ITC eight years and removes the $2,000 residential cap (effective 2009).

2009–2011: During the financial crisis, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) §1603 cash grants allowed many projects to take a grant in lieu of the ITC/PTC.

2015-2021: Extensions and phasedowns (PATH Act, later year-end bills) keep the ITC available with step-downs; short-term extensions continue through 2021.

2022 (Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)): Restores 30% through at least 2032, adds standalone storage, and creates the base/bonus structure plus domestic-content and energy-community adders; sets a transition to tech-neutral §48E for facilities placed in service after 12/31/2024.

2025: Treasury/IRS finalize rules for the new §48E Clean Electricity ITC.

2025 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)): Law narrows windows for wind and solar under §48E, requiring placement in service by Dec. 31, 2027, with a begin-construction safe harbor by July 4, 2026. (Other techs treated differently.)

PTC:

1992: §45 PTC created in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 at 1.5¢/kWh (1993 dollars), for 10 years of output (initially wind & closed-loop biomass) and authorized through 7/1/1999.

1999–2004: Credit lapses and revives multiple times (1999, 2001, 2003), then is repeatedly extended and expanded to more resources.

2013: IRS issues “begin construction” guidance (e.g., Notices 2013-29/-60), creating safe harbors widely used by developers.

2015–2021: Extensions plus a phasedown for wind; Congress continues short-term renewals into 2021.

2022 (IRA): Restores a full-value PTC and re-opens it to solar; establishes transition to tech-neutral §45Y for facilities placed in service after 12/31/2024.

2025: Treasury/IRS finalize rules for §45Y Clean Electricity PTC.

2025 (OBBBA): Law compresses eligibility for wind and solar under §45Y (e.g., placed in service by 12/31/2027 with begin-construction by 7/4/2026).

How did the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expand or redesign these credits?

The IRA fundamentally redesigned the ITC and the PTC, making it the most significant energy tax legislation in U.S. history.

Restored and Extended Full Credit Values: The IRA reversed a planned phase-down of the credits. It restored the ITC to a headline rate of 30% and the PTC to its full inflation-adjusted value for at least a decade, providing long-term market certainty.

Created a Two-Tiered Credit Structure: The Act established a “base” credit amount and a “bonus” or full credit amount. To receive the full 30% ITC or the full PTC rate, projects larger than one megawatt (MW) must now meet specific prevailing wage and apprenticeship labor requirements. Projects that don’t meet these standards receive a much smaller base credit (a 6% ITC or 0.55 cents/kWh PTC).

Introduced New “Bonus” Adders: On top of the full credit rate, projects can earn additional bonus credits, potentially stacking the ITC to 50% or even higher in some cases. These 10% bonus adders are for projects that:

Use a required percentage of U.S.-made steel, iron, and manufactured products (Domestic Content).

Are located in an “Energy Community” (e.g., a brownfield site or a community with a historical dependence on fossil fuel jobs).

For the ITC, additional bonuses are available for projects serving low-income communities.

Expanded Technology Eligibility: Most notably, the IRA made solar projects eligible to choose the PTC for the first time. This gave the solar industry a critical choice between an upfront credit (ITC) or a long-term, performance-based credit (PTC). The ITC was also expanded to explicitly include standalone energy storage, microgrid controllers, and other clean energy technologies.

Created New Monetization Mechanisms: The IRA introduced two new ways for entities to get cash from the credits, even if they don’t have enough tax liability to use them directly:

Transferability: Allows project developers to sell their tax credits to an unrelated third party for cash.

Direct Pay (or Elective Pay): Allows tax-exempt entities — like municipalities, public schools, rural electric cooperatives, and non-profits — to receive the credit’s value as a direct cash refund from the IRS.

How did the One Big Beautiful Bill Act further change these credits?

The OBBBA, signed into law in July 2025, significantly rolled back and redesigned the clean energy tax credits that were established by the IRA. The changes were particularly targeted at wind and solar projects.

Here are the key ways the OBBBA changed the ITC and PTC:

1. Accelerated Phase-Out for Wind and Solar: This is the most significant change. The Act terminates the tech-neutral ITC (Sec. 48E) and PTC (Sec. 45Y) for wind and solar projects on a much faster timeline. To qualify, wind and solar projects must now:

Begin construction by July 4, 2026,

Be placed in service by December 31, 2027.

This replaced the IRA’s original, more gradual phase-out that was tied to national emissions reduction targets and was expected to last into the 2030s.

Also, some have interpreted the two requirements (begin construction and placed in service) to be disjunctive — only one would have to be met. This is an incorrect reading of the law. There is no “or” in the law. The OBBBA has two requirements: begin construction by July 4, 2026, AND be placed in service by December 31, 2027.

2. Introduced Strict Foreign Entity Restrictions: The OBBBA added complex rules to limit the involvement of “Prohibited Foreign Entities” (PFEs), which include entities with ties to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. These restrictions apply to:

Ownership and control of a project.

“Material assistance,” which limits the sourcing of components and equipment from these entities.

3. Maintained Credits for Other Technologies: In contrast to wind and solar, other clean energy technologies like battery storage, geothermal, hydropower, and nuclear were largely spared from the accelerated phase-out. They retain the original, longer runway established by the IRA, with credits available until at least 2032.

What does “begin construction” mean?

The term “begin construction” is not defined in the statute (i.e., the Internal Revenue Code) for the ITC and PTC. Instead, the statute uses the phrase as a deadline (e.g., “for any facility the construction of which begins before January 1, 2025…”).

The detailed, operational definition that has been used for the past 10+ years — the two tests of “Physical Work of a Significant Nature” and the “Five Percent Safe Harbor” — was created by the Internal Revenue Service during the Obama administration in a series of official guidance documents beginning with IRS Notice 2013-29. This means the term “begin construction” can be re-interpreted by the Trump administration.

What does “placed in service” mean?

Like the term “begin construction,” the phrase “placed in service” is not defined in the statute itself (the Internal Revenue Code). The statute mandates that the credit is claimed in the year a project is “placed in service,” but it doesn’t define what that means.

The IRS and courts have mostly used a Five-Factor test to define “placed in service.” (See Ampersand Chowchilla Biomass, LLC. V. United States, 26 F.4th 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2022).) Because there isn’t a single, rigid definition, the IRS has historically used a “facts and circumstances” analysis based on five key factors to determine the placed-in-service date for a power plant:

Required Licenses and Permits: Have all necessary legal and regulatory approvals to operate been obtained?

Control of the Facility: Has control of the facility passed to the taxpayer who will operate it (i.e., it’s no longer under the sole control of the construction contractor)?

Completion of Critical Tests: Have the essential tests to ensure the facility can operate safely and reliably been completed?

Commencement of Regular Operations: Has the facility begun its regular, daily operations?

Synchronization to the Grid: Has the power plant been synchronized with the electrical grid to generate income?

No single factor is decisive, but the synchronization to the grid is often considered the most critical milestone for a power generation facility. However, not all courts have followed the test strictly and have been more lenient in this definition of “placed in service.” (See Sealy Power Ltd. V Commissioner, 46 F.3d 382 (5th Cir. 1995).)",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bigstock-WASHINGTON-D-C-USA-JULY-402255092.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 15:03:14.638366

Workhorse closed today on $20M sale leaseback of Union City plant and $5M convertible note

CINCINNATI, Ohio and FOSTER CITY, Calif., Aug. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Workhorse Group Inc. (Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or the “Company”), an American technology company focused on pioneering the transition to zero-emission commercial vehicles, and Motiv Electric Trucks (“Motiv”), a leading manufacturer of medium-duty electric trucks and buses, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to combine in a transaction that will create a leading North American medium-duty electric truck OEM.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, following the completion of the all-stock transaction, Motiv’s controlling investor will become the majority owner of the combined company and Workhorse shareholders will maintain a significant equity stake. In connection with the merger agreement, Workhorse has completed a sale leaseback (“SLB”) and obtained convertible note financing. The transactions value the combined company at approximately $105 million.1

The combination brings together two innovators in the medium-duty electric vehicle space to better serve a blue-chip customer base and enhance value for shareholders. Building on the companies’ complementary platforms, the combined business will be a leader in the $23 billion medium-duty truck segment2 with a full range of Class 4-6 trucks. The companies believe that together, they will benefit from increased scale, an expanded product portfolio and enhanced operational efficiencies to support lower unit costs while optimizing total cost of ownership (TCO) for customers.

The combined company is expected to have a strengthened financial profile with a simplified capital structure and the financial resources to capture anticipated demand from the ongoing transition to clean energy and better help customers decarbonize their fleets.

Following the closing of the transaction, Scott Griffith, Motiv CEO, is expected to serve as CEO of the combined company and Rick Dauch, Workhorse CEO, is expected to serve as an advisor to the combined company.

“Bringing together two leading OEMs in the medium-duty space strengthens our ability to reduce the cost of electric trucks and make the total cost of ownership even more compelling,” said Scott Griffith, CEO of Motiv. “We believe this is a coming-of-age moment—not just for Motiv and Workhorse, but for the industry as a whole, and that widespread adoption of medium-duty electric trucks will come from achieving cost parity vs. ICE and diesel trucks and offering compelling long-term value. That’s exactly what we’re focused on delivering with this merger, and with a combined more than 17 million miles under our belt, we believe the transaction will put us in a strong starting position to deliver on this vision. I’m excited by the opportunity to lead the combined company, work closely with the Motiv and Workhorse teams to capture the opportunities ahead, and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and the communities in which our trucks operate.”

“This transaction represents a significant milestone for Workhorse, our customers, our stakeholders and our shareholders,” said Rick Dauch, CEO of Workhorse. “By combining with Motiv and completing the related transactions, we are creating a broader product offering, strengthening our near- and long-term financial position and providing Workhorse shareholders with the opportunity to participate in the upside of a leader in the medium-duty EV commercial vehicle market. We believe Motiv is the right partner to support the advancement of our combined product roadmap and capture new growth opportunities. Together, we are confident we will be even better positioned to win the commercial EV transition and create value for shareholders.”

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits

Workhorse and Motiv believe that the investments made into their respective businesses position the combined company to have the sector’s most scalable manufacturing, most advanced and road-tested products, and most wide-reaching go-to-market networks. As a result, the companies believe the transaction will provide significant benefits to customers and shareholders by:

Creating a category leader positioned for rapid innovation and scalable growth. Joining Motiv’s diverse product portfolio and top fleet relationships with Workhorse’s proven vehicles, manufacturing capabilities and national dealer network is expected to create a platform for long-term growth. Workhorse’s Union City facility has the capacity to eventually produce up to 5,000 trucks per year.

Leveraging combined scale and strengths to reduce unit costs. Workhorse and Motiv believe that the combined company will compete more effectively with the industry’s pure-play electric and legacy OEMs. Workhorse and Motiv believe the combined company will capitalize on new opportunities to serve more customers with a more competitively advantaged electric offering than gas/diesel trucks and buses on a TCO basis.

Joining complementary customer bases. Workhorse and Motiv believe the next phase of large-scale adoption of medium-duty electric trucks in North America will be driven by national-scale commercial fleets with tested and piloted multi-depot EV truck operations. Together, Motiv and Workhorse have served 10 of the largest medium-duty fleets in North America3, positioning the combined company to expand adoption through these existing relationships with likely early scalers.

Establishing a strong financial foundation. The companies believe that the transaction strengthens the combined company’s financial position and creates opportunities for margin expansion, enabling greater flexibility to pursue future growth initiatives. With a simplified capital structure, the combined company also expects to be better positioned to raise additional capital post-close.

Presenting significant synergy opportunities. The companies believe there is the potential to achieve at least $20 million of cost synergies, including through R&D, G&A, and facility cost-reductions by the end of 2026. The combined companies also intend to utilize a product and engineering approach to maximize the use of common software, hardware, and IP across its Class 4-6 platforms to pursue additional cost savings, an enhanced technology baseline and a best-in-class customer experience with limited downtime and optimized TCO.

Transaction Details

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Motiv will be merged with a newly created subsidiary of Workhorse in exchange for newly issued shares of Workhorse common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, on a fully diluted basis, Motiv’s controlling investor initially will own approximately 62.5% of the combined company, Workhorse shareholders will own approximately 26.5% and Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender will have rights to receive common stock that represent approximately 11%, all of which are subject to certain potential adjustments and additional future dilution. Pursuant to the transaction, certain stockholders of Motiv, to the extent they are also holders of financial indebtedness of Motiv, agreed to cancel their financial indebtedness to Motiv in exchange for Workhorse common stock. Additional information regarding Workhorse’s agreement with its secured lender and select other parties will be available in the Company’s SEC filings.

In connection with the proposed merger transaction, Workhorse also completed two transactions with entities affiliated with Motiv’s controlling investor: the SLB transaction for Workhorse’s Union City, Indiana manufacturing facility for $20 million and the secured, convertible note financing for $5 million, each of which were consummated at the time of execution with the merger agreement. These transactions are expected to provide near-term liquidity to fund Workhorse’s operations through closing and to provide capital to pay down debt owed to Workhorse’s existing senior secured lender. At closing of the merger, all remaining indebtedness to such lender, including all warrants currently held by the lender, will be repaid and/or cancelled, with the only remaining secured indebtedness of the combined companies being the $5 million secured, convertible note held by Motiv’s controlling investor, which may convert to equity in connection with post-closing financing.

In addition, the merger agreement includes a condition to closing that entities affiliated with Motiv’s controlling investor will provide $20 million in debt financing at the completion of the transaction, of which approximately $10 million is expected to be available in a revolving credit facility and an additional $10 million is expected to be available to fund manufacturing costs associated with confirmed purchase orders of the combined company in an ABL facility. The combined company also will seek to raise additional equity financing to fund its go forward strategic execution.

Timing and Approvals

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to Workhorse shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions, including the debt financing commitment noted above.

Volkswagen EV owners will need to pay extra for power

Volkswagen has put performance behind a paywall, at least for ID.3 drivers in the UK. The Volkswagen ID.3 Pro and Pro S are now listed with 201 hp on the UK website.

To unlock the vehicle’s full performance of 228 hp, drivers will now need to pay extra. You can choose from a monthly subscription, starting at £16.50 ($22) per month, or you can opt for a one-time lifetime fee of £649 ($880).

However, the one-time fee is attached to the vehicle, not the buyer. So if it’s sold, the upgrade goes with it. As Auto Express pointed out, the monthly payment is nearly three times that of a standard Netflix membership.

Although the performance upgrade locks the extra power behind a paywall, Volkswagen said it doesn’t affect range.

Volkswagen isn’t the first, and likely not the last, to make drivers pay for their vehicles’ full potential. Remember when BMW tried to charge $18 a month for heated seats and other features in 2022?

Yeah, that didn’t go over so well. BMW has since dropped the subscription. Other brands, including Polestar, offer similar performance upgrades.

Will Volkswagen try to charge EV drivers in the US or other parts of Europe extra for performance? Given the backlash from BMW, it’s not likely.

All but two GOP House members voted to support the budget bill, as did all but three GOP senators.
“These Republicans in Congress are caught red-handed taking massive donations from the oil and gas industry, and voting to give them billions and to destroy their competition from their own state’s clean energy industries,” the analysis says.
All 15 backed the mega-bill, and together, they accepted more than $3m in donations from the fossil fuel industry, the authors found.
The industry also poured more than $19m into Trump’s inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, a report found last month.","The Republican lawmakers who voted for Donald Trump’s anti-environment tax and spending bill have accepted more than $105m in political donations from the fossil fuel industry, a new analysis has found, raising concerns about their relationship with big oil.

Signed into law last month, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes billions of dollars in giveaways to oil and gas companies and their executives, alongside provisions to scale back credits for clean vehicles, wind and solar which were enshrined by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

All but two GOP House members voted to support the budget bill, as did all but three GOP senators. That includes many Republicans from districts who benefited most from the IRA’s green credits, and those who spent months attempting to defend renewable energy tax credits from the budget bill’s provisions, such as Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York and Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Curtis of Utah.

The new report from the environmental advocacy group Climate Power totalled up the funds the bill’s backers have accepted from the fossil fuel industry over the course of their political careers, finding that House members accepted $54.4m and senators accepted $51.5m.

“These Republicans in Congress are caught red-handed taking massive donations from the oil and gas industry, and voting to give them billions and to destroy their competition from their own state’s clean energy industries,” the analysis says.

With House midterm elections scheduled for next year, Climate Power also looked at fossil fuel donations to the 15 House Republicans deemed most vulnerable to an electoral challenge, according to the Cook Political Report, which independently analyzes the political viability of elections and campaigns. All 15 backed the mega-bill, and together, they accepted more than $3m in donations from the fossil fuel industry, the authors found.

Hailing from Colorado, Iowa, Arizona, New Jersey, California, Michigan and New York, the lawmakers on the list are from regions that have seen benefits from the IRA’s credits for wind and solar energy, as well as battery manufacturing. The mega-bill puts more than 110,000 jobs from the three sectors at risk in the 15 lawmakers’ districts, and is also expected to raise consumers’ energy bills by up to $200 annually by 2030, according to the climate policy thinktank Energy Innovation.

Some on the list had previously critiqued the bill: Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, who has accepted $229,179 in oil and gas contributions, pledged to support clean energy tax credits but backed the legislation anyway, while Colorado’s Jeff Hurd, pledged to oppose the bill due to its cuts to Medicaid but ended up supporting it.

“These Republican members of Congress all represent moderate swing districts with close elections, where voters of both parties expect their representatives to look out for them, not to kill their jobs and raise their utility bills for the sake of out-of-state special interests,” said Pete Jones, a director at Climate Power. “These members chose who to stand up for, and they picked their billionaire donors.”

Big oil spent a stunning $445m throughout the last election cycle to influence Trump and Congress, Climate Power found in January. The industry also poured more than $19m into Trump’s inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, a report found last month.

“We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it,” Trump said in his inaugural address.

Since re-entering the White House, Trump has passed not only the anti-environmental One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but has also signed a slew of executive orders and policies aimed at cracking down on clean energy and boosting already-booming oil and gas.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb2ee8cf841f66622cc72642fa9161b74b5821fa/1218_0_6142_4912/master/6142.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c6e6c56b0f7982bcf937a50f7d6c03c",N,,2025-08-15 09:59:23.470747

According to the Trust, the Harbor Charger required a $33 million investment.
Once it becomes functional, the Harbor Charger will be able to reach fully electric operations.
New York's first hybrid-electric ferry will comfortably carry not just regular passengers to Governors Island, but also scientists.
Governors Island will soon become home to a state-of-the-art Climate Exchange campus for research and study.","On August 13, Governors Island celebrated the christening of the newest addition to its ferry fleet. The Harbor Charger is not only a new vessel, but the first one in New York with a hybrid-electric propulsion system, which will be able to carry more than 1,000 passengers and 30 cars.

More specifically, it's the BlueDrive Eco diesel-electric propulsion system developed by Siemens Energy, which has also supplied the ship's advanced battery solution (the BlueVault) and an energy monitoring technology platform (the EcoMAIN).

The Harbor Charger will have three different operation modes: battery-assisted hybrid with diesel backup (which will allow CO2 emission cuts by up to 600 tons every year), battery-only, and zero-emissions. The ship was also equipped with Schottel azimuthing thrusters for 360-degree steering, which translates to smoother maneuvering.

This new ferry will not only boast cleaner operations but will also be considerably faster. At 10 to 12 knots, the Harbor Charger is 66% faster than the old Lt. Samuel S. Coursen, which is still carrying passengers and cars to and from Governors Island. This veteran ferry, which was commissioned by the US Army in 1956, will retire from service by the end of this year, allowing the new, greener, and faster Harbor Charger to take its place.

It took just two weeks and more than 465 tons of steel to build the Harbor Charger at the Conrad Shipyard in Louisiana. Construction was completed earlier this spring, after which the new ship left Morgan City for its final destination.

It was designed by Elliot Bay Design Group (EBDG), the same company that designed GOVERNORS 1, the Trust's passenger-only ferry that entered service in 2019.

According to the Trust, the Harbor Charger required a $33 million investment. In addition to that, the Trust has secured $7.5 million in federal infrastructure funding from the US Federal Transit Administration for shoreside charging facilities.

This fast charging infrastructure is currently in the design phase. Once it becomes functional, the Harbor Charger will be able to reach fully electric operations. According to the Trust, this would translate to an additional CO2 emissions cut of 800 tons annually.

New York's first hybrid-electric ferry will comfortably carry not just regular passengers to Governors Island, but also scientists. Governors Island will soon become home to a state-of-the-art Climate Exchange campus for research and study. Construction of this new campus is due to begin next year, and it will help turn Governors Island into a leading (and beautiful) destination for climate research.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/say-hello-to-the-harbor-charger-new-yorks-33m-first-hybrid-electric-ferry-255944_1.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 14:07:24.566330

Of the $1 billion potentially to be allocated, $500 million will be available through the federal Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing and Recycling Grant program.

The department says its Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) will be funded to issue notices of funding opportunities (NOFOs) of up to $500 million “to expand U.S. critical mineral and materials processing and derivative battery manufacturing and recycling.”

Adds the DOE, “The proposed funding opportunity supports demonstration and/or commercial facilities processing, recycling or utilizing for manufacturing critical materials which may include traditional battery minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel, copper [and] aluminum, as well as other minerals that are contained within commercially available batteries, such as rare earth elements (REEs).”

Those awarded a grant will do so understanding there is a cost share requirement of at least 50 percent to be borne by the recipient, says the DOE.

The MESC also has been assigned to issue a NOFO of up to $135 million “to enhance domestic supply chains for REEs,” says the department, “by demonstrating the commercial viability of methods for domestically refining and recovering REEs from mine tailings, deleterious material and waste streams.”

Those grants require an academic partner and also carry a cost share requirement of at least 50 percent, says the DOE.

The federal department says the funding will be issued in accordance with President Donald J. Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order.

Updated 57 minutes ago

The UK's bioethanol industry faces collapse, after a government decision not to offer the sector a rescue package.

The country's two major producers, Hull-based Vivergo Fuels and the Ensus plant in Redcar on Teesside, had both previously warned that without government support they would be forced to close, after a deal to allow US ethanol to be imported tariff-free.

Associated British Foods, which owns Vivergo, said on Friday the government's decision to not support a ""key national asset"" was ""deeply regrettable"".

The government said it had worked closely with the companies since June, but had decided it was not ""in the national interest"" to provide them with taxpayer funds.

The US-UK trade pact, agreed in May, removed a 19% tariff on ethanol imported from the US up to a quota of 1.4bn litres. That is approximately equivalent to the current size of the UK market and the firms claim the trade agreement had made their businesses ""commercially unviable"".

AB Foods said it had been in talks with the government over the last few months and had presented a plan to return the firm to profitability.

""In making this decision, the government has thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber, a sovereign capability in clean fuels that had the chance to lead the world.""

It said jobs in clean energy would now move overseas.

""This plant should always have been profitable under the right regulatory environment, as similar plants in western Europe demonstrate,"" the firm said.

German-owned Ensus has also been approached for comment.

The two plants employ 270 people, but their closure could affect thousands more in the supply chain.

A government spokesperson said after working with the companies over weeks to understand ""the financial challenges they have faced over the past decade"", the government had taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding ""as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces"".

The government said it recognised this was a ""difficult time for the workers and their families"" and said it would work with trade unions, local partners and the companies to support those affected.

Bioethanol is a fuel made from wheat, other grains or sugar beet. The US has provided subsidies and tax credits to corn farmers in midwestern states such as Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska, helping to hold down the price of its ethanol.

In the UK bioethanol is added to fuels such as E10 petrol. But sources within the sector said that government delays over the migration to petrol with higher bioethanol content had hurt the industry.

The government has previously said that by 2030 it wants 10% of all fuel used in planes to come from sustainable sources, one of which is bioethanol.

COURSEN, which will be retired from service at the end of 2025.

HARBOR CHARGER is operated by New York Waterways on behalf of the Trust for Governors Island and brings a faster and quieter service from the Battery Maritime Building slipway across to the 172-acre island situated in New York Harbour. The new ferry is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 70 per cent compared to the operator's diesel-powered vessels.

HARBOR CHARGER will also slash New York Waterways' typical USD 417,000 in annual fuel and electricity costs for the diesel-powered vessels.

At present the new hybrid-electric ferry will operate on both diesel and battery power for the next two years while a shore rapid power charging system is built and installed on Governors Island.

Siemens Energy has been responsible for HARBOR CHARGER'S BlueDrive Eco hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system; BlueVault advanced battery-based solution, comprising 122 lithium-ion batteries, and EcoMAIN real-time control platform, a technology platform that enables the operator to constantly monitor this state-of-the-art equipment.

Actual propulsion comes from Schottel 360 degree azimuthing thrusters.

The hybrid propulsion system will reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 600 tonnes annually, allowing the Trust to make groundbreaking progress on its net-zero emissions goals.

Once shore power charging is available, HARBOR CHARGER will reduce emissions by an additional 800 tonnes annually.

More: EV Crash Claims Jump 38%, And Repairs Are Pricier Than Ever

According to the German Insurance Association (GDV), comprehensive insurance claims for electric vehicles were 20-25% higher than those for comparable combustion models last year. However, the average claim has now dropped to 15-20% higher than ICE-powered models.

The Deputy General Director for the GDV said, “The more electric cars there are on the road, the less their claims differ from comparable cars with combustion engines.” Anja Käfer-Rohrbach went on to explain, “A broader model range reaches a larger customer base, and workshops, towing companies, fire departments, and appraisers now have more experience with damaged electric cars.”

She said these developments are helping to drive down repair costs as EVs are becoming the “new normal.” It’s also worth noting the latest study period was from 2021-2023, so EVs are far more common today.

On that note, the GDV said there were approximately 1.65 million electric vehicles registered in Germany at the beginning of the year.

The International Renewable Energy Agency found that solar power is significantly cheaper than that generated from fossil fuels — in some cases, less than half the cost.
The downfall occurred, they will observe, because the US failed to transition to inexpensive energy sources such as solar and wind.","Economic history abounds with examples of companies that failed by ignoring innovations that would make their products or services obsolete and poach their customers. Eastman Kodak died because its executives refused to embrace digital photography, even though the company had pioneered the process and held many important digital photography patents. AT&T and the Regional Bell Operating Companies disappeared because they ignored the cellular phone transformation, even though their researchers were among the first to perfect the technology. Baldwin Locomotive went out of business almost a century ago because it ignored the advantages and growing popularity of diesel locomotives, believing its clients would always embrace steam power. Rarely, if ever, in recent history, however, has a nation harmed itself by rejecting a new low-cost technology in favor of a much more costly one, although many countries have sacrificed growth by delaying the introduction of innovative technologies through regulations or actions that protected established enterprises.

More than 100 years ago, France lagged behind the UK in embracing the Industrial Revolution. The country’s slowness was not deliberate but due to scarce resources and an economic structure based on small family firms. More recently, some nations have frustrated programs that would have accelerated growth to protect vested interests. Portugal under Oliveira Salazar and Spain under Francisco Franco recorded years of low growth because they blocked market liberalization. Such nations foundered not by rejecting innovation but by being slow to adopt it.

The US is now following in the steps of Salazar and Franco by rejecting low-cost sources of renewable electricity in favor of expensive and polluting generating facilities. The tax incentives for wind and solar power generation provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 have been reduced or eliminated. Support for building long-distance transmission lines to move power from windmills in Kansas to consumers in Indiana and Illinois has been withdrawn. New regulations require the Secretary of the Interior to approve individually any renewable project or transmission facility for renewables crossing federal lands because, to quote one Interior official, “American energy dominance is driven by US-based production of reliable base load energy, not regulatory favoritism toward unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.”

In With the Old

This “new” US policy emphasizes the old, established and out-of-date. Operators of coal-fired plants were ordered to cancel retirement plans after President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency. Long-standing regulations limiting emissions have been repealed to allow plants to operate at higher rates. New programs and regulations have been adopted to speed the development of natural gas to supply generating plants.

Meanwhile, growth in US electricity consumption has bloomed after years of dormancy, propelled by the expansion of artificial intelligence data centers and the electrification of transportation. The US Energy Information Administration projects electricity use to increase by almost 2% in the next year after 20 years of stagnation. The consulting firm ICF International projects a 25% increase by 2030, primarily driven by greater data center demand.

The 25% hike will come at a high cost given the Trump administration’s energy strategy and assuming suppliers can produce the needed power. Meanwhile, firms that have reshored manufacturing capacity to the US due to the administration’s onerous trade policies may have trouble obtaining affordable electricity. In effect, the US is burdening industries with an energy “ball and chain” by imposing barrier after barrier to solar and wind technology development and expansion as it pursues “energy dominance” focused on high-cost fossil fuels. In doing so, it will unintentionally cede global supremacy to nations such as China that have embraced significantly cheaper means of producing electricity. Ultimately, the Trump Administration’s decisions regarding electricity generation, if not reversed, could doom the US to a path of economic decline.

A feasible alternative, the so-called “all of the above” energy policy, existed once and, to an extent, still does. By leaving energy-sector development to market dictates, this policy would have accelerated the adoption of a generating mix dominated by wind, solar and batteries, not the hydrocarbons promoted by Trump.

Bill McKibben’s Perspective

Activist and author Bill McKibben emphasizes the critical economic and environmental importance of solar power in Here Comes the Sun, published this summer by Norton. Here Comes the Sun is a chatty, rather personal chronicle of the author’s global wanderings in search of details on the energy revolution. Much of his discussion will provide useful fodder for cocktail party conversations. The reader learns, for example, of his visits to Chinese factories producing solar panels and of the technology’s rapid evolution.

Buried in the book, though, is one critical fact: The costs of producing energy through sun or wind power decline sharply as the cumulative output grows, while the costs of producing energy from fossil fuels rise with cumulative output. In a sentence that should be emblazoned on the book’s jacket, McKibben declared, “If we’re ever going to get to the 1950s dream of electricity ‘too cheap to meter,’ it will come from that nuclear reactor parked high in the sky.”

The phrase “too cheap to meter” originated in a speech to science writers by Lewis Strauss in 1954. Strauss was then chair of the Atomic Energy Commission. In his remarks, he stated, “It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter.” The belief at the time was that nuclear power would make electricity “dirt cheap” in the future.

And 76 years later, electricity is still far from free. Residential rates have increased by 4% per year since 1960, a number only modestly lower than the GDP deflator’s rise of 4.7% per year. More recently, electricity prices have matched the rate of inflation.

Going forward, electricity prices will likely climb faster than inflation. Rather than dirt-cheap energy, the nuclear plants that just came on line in South Carolina and Georgia have resulted in dramatic price increases to cover cost overruns. All consumers could see significant electricity bill hikes in the coming years as the utilities and other suppliers rush to build new capacity, much of it not produced by wind or the sun but by fossil fuels, as energy providers bow to the Trump administration’s wishes.

McKibben reckons that such increases would not be necessary if power came from a well-developed grid that relied on solar, wind and batteries. He reports that, in India, it is less expensive to install a new solar plant than to pay for an existing coal-fired power plant. The International Renewable Energy Agency found that solar power is significantly cheaper than that generated from fossil fuels — in some cases, less than half the cost.

History’s Unfolding

McKibben is an activist, not an economist or businessperson. Thus, he focuses a large part of his book on his efforts to persuade others that a solar, wind and battery-centered electricity supply system can function as well as one reliant on fossil fuels. He devotes far too many pages to his coffeehouse discussions and participation in protests. Nevertheless, even though he gave it much less emphasis than it deserves, he does make an incredibly important point regarding the viability and affordability of renewable energy.

Nations such as China that now rely heavily on solar power have gained an advantage over those like the US that persist in using fossil fuels. McKibben captured this alarming fact in a quote from investor Rob Carlson: “Continuing to burn fossil fuel is a self-imposed financial penalty” that will “ultimately degrade America’s long-term competitiveness.”

Historians such as Vaclav Smil have touted the economic successes of nations that embraced fossil fuels. After reading McKibbon’s book, I came to the concerning conclusion that in 25-50 years, historians will note how the nations that embraced solar power achieved economic superiority over those that shunned it. Given the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill and other actions taken by the Trump administration, I worry that future historians will be describing the collapse of the US in the first half of the 21st century, much like they once chronicled the fall of the Roman Empire 1,800 or so years earlier. The downfall occurred, they will observe, because the US failed to transition to inexpensive energy sources such as solar and wind.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2741788/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6016x3158+0+858/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F93%2F5d%2F7bf939fb47ea8f90b3a4d4fe9920%2Fss-443300479-solar-power-plant-mountains-india.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 09:01:07.393088

""In taking this action, the EPA would prevent 16,000 Georgians with low incomes from saving hundreds of dollars per year on their utility bills at a time of soaring energy costs, and they are putting at risk hundreds of good-paying, local jobs just as unemployment has begun to rise.""

First rolled out in 2022 under president Biden, the Solar for All (SFA) program was part of green energy provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act, which dedicated $370 billion in federal funding towards items such as clean energy.

The Solar for All grant program awarded 60 non-profit, state-wide and multi-state initiatives to ""create new or expand existing low-income solar programs"".

""There's less money for intentional design around renewable energy""

New York-based renewable energy educator Alex Nathanson said that the SFA cancellation means that there's ""less money "" in the renewable industry across the board.

""There's less money for intentional design around renewable energy [and] for accessibility,"" Nathanson told Dezeen. ""We're in a climate crisis, and the people who are most affected are also the people who historically have not had access to the ways to address the crisis.""

""The Trump regime has many draconian anti-poor, racist policies. And this is yet another example of that.""

Other programs that may face a lack of funding are the Massachusetts SFA state program, which promotes education on solar power and workforce training for the industry.

Hope Enterprise Corporation, which was awarded SFA grants to service statewide programs for Arkansas and Mississippi, said it is ""now working to understand its obligations moving forward"" following the termination.

EPA calls SFA a ""grift""

According to a statement from Zeldin provided by the EPA press office, the program was a ""grift"".

""One of the more shocking features of Solar for All was with regards to the massive dilution of the money, as many grants go through pass-through after pass-through after pass-through after pass-through, with all of the middlemen taking their own cut – at least 15 per cent by conservative estimates. What a grift!"" said Zeldin.

""Furthermore, the Biden-Harris Administration exempted this program from the Build America, Buy America law that requires federal agencies to use American workers, American products, and American infrastructure for projects using American taxpayer dollars. That's great news for China, not so much for the USA.""

Awards were granted in April 2024, and many of the planned programs had not yet gone into effect. The funding cancellation was announced via letter to the grantees, according to the New York Times, which also stated that only around $53 million from the program had been spent.

The EPA confirmed that much of the money allotted under the program had not been spent.

""While this program was stood up in 2024, very little money has actually been spent. Recipients are still very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process,"" said Zeldin.

National trade association for solar energy industries SEIA noted that while solar installations have steadily grown, residential installations were down in 2024 – the lowest levels since 2021. While SEIA predicted continued growth in the sector, it is unclear how the federal mandate will affect residential solar power installation in general.

""State-level initiatives and corporate demand will gain more relevance and drive solar development, potentially mitigating the impact of federal mandates,"" said SEIA in its 2025 projections released earlier this year.

The program cancellation comes with other recent rollbacks and restrictions on clean energy infrastructure by the Trump Administration, such as heightened review of ""unreliable, subsidy-dependent"" wind and solar energy facilities.

More trouble for renewables The looming Treasury guidance is just part of a full-court Trump administration press to boost fossil fuels and disrupt renewable energy.
Some tax lawyers say that a Treasury move to substantially change how projects qualify for tax credits could be legally vulnerable in court.
AEU’s Paolino said the group is communicating with governors of both parties to share strategies for how they can grow clean energy in their states.
“You can’t just replace the tax credits, there’s not going to be a one-for-one swap with HR1,” Paolino said.","An upcoming decision from the Treasury Department has clean energy boosters and industry allies preparing for a potential disruption in the nation’s electricity supply.

Just days after signing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, President Donald Trump announced an executive order to end “market distorting subsidies for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources.”

The order says wind and solar energy crowds out “affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.” It calls on Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to issue new guidance to restrict the “use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

The guidance, which is expected as soon as Monday, is sparking a lobbying rush from a range of concerned stakeholders, including Republicans on Capitol Hill, utilities, data center developers and major Wall Street firms that want to underwrite big, new infrastructure investments.

Those groups are worried that the new Treasury guidance will make it more challenging to qualify for tax credits based on a “beginning of construction” metric that has been practiced for years. Under current rules, projects qualify for credits if developers start on-site physical work or purchase equipment that is at least 5 percent of the total price tag of the project.

Joey Paolino, a senior policy principal with Advanced Energy United, said the clean energy group is working to spread the message that if stringent new rules are put in place, power is going to get more expensive and states could lose economic investment.

“When you cut off supply, and it seems like the guidance is moving in that direction for wind and solar, the effect is that prices will go up,” Paolino said.

A separate clean energy executive, who was granted anonymity to speak freely about the lobbying push, said there could be an “economy-wide impact.”

“I think that’s something that banks are keen to avoid,” the executive said. “Private financial firms are standing up. The utilities are flagging concerns with the administration, saying that there are problems with projects that they have [power purchase agreements] for.”

Power purchase agreements, or PPAs, are long contracts for electricity supply. Current rules on qualification were spelled out by the Internal Revenue Service in 2013.

The coming revisions do not have a public comment period. That means industry groups are working directly with the administration and with allies in Congress to relay their message.

The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, said that it had worked with lawmakers and the administration on the megalaw and that all parties have been “very public about the need to build out energy infrastructure for data centers and AI — and to keeping costs as low as possible for customers.”

Through a spokesperson, the group said that it expects gas to be “dominant” in the power sector, but that renewables will be “critical to meeting energy dominance goals, particularly at the lowest cost to customers.”

“Our concern is that our member companies, which are operating under a normal regulatory framework and have already made substantial investments in these projects, could potentially no longer qualify for tax credits if updated Treasury guidance sets a significantly different threshold for defining the beginning of construction,” the spokesperson said in an email.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech hyperscalers and companies building data centers, is also urging the administration to enact a rule “consistent with the intent of OBBB,” an official with the group said. That includes a “unified, technology-neutral approach” that does not subject wind and solar power to “more restrictive or ambiguous eligibility frameworks” than other clean sources like nuclear or geothermal.

The coalition is also emphasizing to the Treasury Department that in order to grow the country’s AI capability, it needs technology to meet electricity demand quickly. “Any regulatory friction that slows down deployment of new generation today directly impacts our ability to meet AI-era electricity demands tomorrow,” the official said.

A letter dated Thursday from the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents technology hardware and software companies, similarly said that meeting the energy needs of the country’s “significant industrial resurgence” will require “the rapid deployment of energy projects already in development.”

“Delays or regulatory uncertainty could undermine efforts to power high-growth sectors such as advanced manufacturing and AI, and strain regional grid reliability,” wrote Lara Muldoon, ITIC’s vice president of government affairs.

The administration has made the AI buildout a priority. An action plan released last month included a call for a “comprehensive strategy to enhance and expand the power grid” and was paired with an executive order reducing permitting requirements for data centers and associated power generation. The White House, however, has prioritized fossil fuels and more ambitious power sources like nuclear power for AI, even as tech firms lean on wind and solar to get facilities on the grid quickly.

The American Investment Council, an association representing Goldman Sachs and other investment firms, did not respond for comment. The Clean Energy Buyers Association, a group that represents Amazon, Google, General Motors and other major U.S. companies, and the National Association of Manufacturers, which has previously said clean energy can support factories and economic development, both declined to comment.

More trouble for renewables

The looming Treasury guidance is just part of a full-court Trump administration press to boost fossil fuels and disrupt renewable energy. Last week, EPA canceled $7 billion in solar grants, just after proposing to scrap the legal foundation for regulation of greenhouse gases as pollutants. The Department of Interior is also complicating wind and solar projects with strict new permitting rules.

The lobbying push is also coming from Senate Republicans who negotiated the OBBB. Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and John Curtis of Utah are holding up confirmation processes for Treasury Department nominees. The executive order has also rankled Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and other Republicans. That Senate pressure is getting its own blowback from House Freedom Caucus members like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas).

Some tax lawyers say that a Treasury move to substantially change how projects qualify for tax credits could be legally vulnerable in court.

“The on-site physical work test for ‘beginning of construction’ has been around for a long time, even preceding renewable energy projects, and it most likely could not be modified in a substantial way for general renewable energy credit qualification purposes in a way that is legal,” said Aaron Mitchell, a Houston-based energy tax lawyer, in an interview.

He added: “The ‘beginning of construction’ is a very important concept in project finance that is meant to bring predictability to project financing — it serves to ‘lock in’ the tax credit rules that a project will be analyzed under.”

The clean energy executive said that “it’s harder for Treasury to legislate” new rules around credit qualification following the Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo Supreme Court decision last year that overturned the long-standing legal doctrine that gave agencies authority to interpret laws passed by Congress.

Meanwhile, an Aug. 8 report from the consultancy Capstone says “an array of legal and political risks will lead the Treasury Department to take a restrained approach” on the credits.

“We believe revised guidance from the Treasury Department will not be a worst-case scenario for wind and solar and will result in a modest modification of the beginning of construction rules,” the report said.

Some nonrenewable players also reached out to Treasury.

In a letter, the Carbon Capture Coalition wrote to Bessent and said any changes to “underlying harbor rules may have significant and immediate implications” for the 45Q credit: a key incentive for carbon capture and storage. The group backs policies that support greater deployment of the technology.

Changes to wind and solar guidance could have repercussions for other tax credits depending on what Treasury does, said Jessie Stolark, the coalition’s executive director.

Agencies can’t “take actions that are ‘arbitrary and capricious,’ and so making changes and differentiations between tax credits that have similar guidance would have to be justified,” Stolark continued.

To meet the stipulations of the executive order and also be legally compliant, whatever changes Treasury would make to “beginning of construction would have to be, essentially, harmonized across various tax credits.”

The uncertainty has left some in the clean energy industry looking to the state level for more opportunities. AEU’s Paolino said the group is communicating with governors of both parties to share strategies for how they can grow clean energy in their states.

“You can’t just replace the tax credits, there’s not going to be a one-for-one swap with HR1,” Paolino said. “But we can get creative on technology on the supply side or policies on the demand side that can expand clean energy and help keep homeowners’ rates down.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/31/e1/2e8589574dce8bfa8eab355bf07f/u-s-congress-01863.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 12:08:16.401146

According to Cox Automotive’s vAuto Live Market View data, days’ supply stood at 73, down seven days from July, reflecting stronger sales activity.

The average listing price at the end of July fell 0.3% month over month, down $154 to $48,480, the lowest since late April. This price stability comes despite tariff-related cost pressures on automakers, signaling disciplined production and targeted incentive strategies to maintain buyer interest.

Inventory declined by 1% in July, or 25,840 vehicles, compared to the prior month. The U.S. market also recorded an 8.7% increase in new-vehicle sales month over month and a 10.1% increase year over year. Inventory remains 4.7% lower than a year ago, showing that consumer demand continues to outpace replenishment rates in many segments.

Brand-level dynamics vary across the industry. Kia, Hyundai and Mercedes are seeing higher EV sales but have been slower to restock, while Mazda and Mitsubishi are leveraging stronger incentives on key models. Nissan’s refreshed Armada and redesigned Murano have gained traction with added promotional support. Popular vehicle types such as subcompact to mid-size crossovers, SUVs and pickups, including the Toyota Tacoma and Tundra, remain key growth drivers.

Incentives in July averaged 7.3% of the average transaction price, the highest year-to-date, according to Kelley Blue Book. The average transaction price of $48,841 decreased slightly by $59 month over month, leaving pricing relatively unchanged. Year over year, most brands have kept price increases within 2%, although some have seen gains exceeding 10%.

Through the first seven months of 2025, the average days’ supply was six days lower than the same period in 2024. Analysts attribute the fluctuation to tariff announcements, measured production output and evolving EV purchase patterns as buyers look to secure federal tax credits before the September 30 expiration date.

With Model Year 2026 launches on the horizon, particularly all-new models rather than mid-cycle refreshes, analysts expect pricing to edge upward while the market remains competitive and demand-driven.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08152025-New-vehicle-inventory-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:03:12.471298

860MW+ of BESS capacity withdrawn from ERCOT In related news, recent data published by ERCOT shows a large volume of BESS capacity being withdrawn from the interconnection’s process.
According to the most recent ERCOT interconnection queue, seven BESS projects were withdrawn from the interconnection process during the month of July representing a cumulative storage capacity of 864.3MW.
Some industry commentators have recently highlighted a concerning trend of large volumes of BESS capacity being withdrawn from the ERCOT’s interconnection queue.
The below graph illustrates the BESS capacity withdrawn from the ERCOT queue this year by month, which shows a large peak occurring during April which has then slowly decreased each month until now.","“We got feedback [on our initial proposal] from the City which we took back to the drawing board and found a site that addressed all the concerns – we’re confident that we did a solid job of finding a remote location that meet all your needs,” said Spearmint’s VP of development, Nick Coil, at the recent Commissioners meeting.

Following on from several widely-reported fires of battery storage systems, some jurisdictions of authority across North America have grown wary of siting BESS in residential areas, with some introducing bans and restrictions.

During July, Energy-Storage.news reported on the Town of Southampton in Suffolk County, NY, which effectively banned utility-scale storage facilities destined for residential zones.

At the recent Texas City Commissioners meeting, Mayor Dedrick Johnson addressed this matter by pointing out that the City “doesn’t have any battery storage systems in any neighbourhoods, nor [does it] plan on having any.”

Spearmint’s Red Egret BESS project is slated for a 38-acre site located on the northwestern outskirts of Texas City in an area zoned for heavy industrial use. The developer states that it chose this location due to the “high energy use and projected growth in the area.”

According to planning documents filed with its application, Spearmint has modelled the project using Sungrow’s Powertitan 2.0 BESS units. As part of a battery supply agreement announced last August, Sungrow is supplying over 1GWh of its BESS technology for Spearmint’s portfolio of Texan projects.

Ringing endorsement for Spearmint BESS

During the public hearing aspect of the recent meeting, long-term resident of Texas City Barabra White urged the Commissioners to approve the project after what she had witnessed in previous years.

“I’ve lived through hurricane after hurricane in Texas City, sitting in the dark after days and weeks when it was too hot to breathe, watching my food spoil and making life miserable and costly for working families,” explained White.

“The Red Egret project would give us something we desperately need – reliable back-up power when extreme weather hits our community [during] summer and winter.”

Spearmint’s Red Egret project will be connected to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)-controlled grid, which has historically struggled to cope in times of extreme weather.

“Spearmint Energy has been completely open about the project and their safety protocols, they’ve answered every tough question thrown at them at community meetings, plus this will bring in needed tax revenue for our schools and our city,” said White.

With many similar recent public hearings in the US being filled with mostly anti-BESS sentiment, such a ringing endorsement highlighting the endorsements of the technology is refreshing to see.

Following the hearing, the board unanimously approved Spearmint’s rezoning request for its Red Egret project, which is scheduled for commercial operations during the final quarter of 2026 at the earliest.

860MW+ of BESS capacity withdrawn from ERCOT

In related news, recent data published by ERCOT shows a large volume of BESS capacity being withdrawn from the interconnection’s process.

According to the most recent ERCOT interconnection queue, seven BESS projects were withdrawn from the interconnection process during the month of July representing a cumulative storage capacity of 864.3MW.

Some industry commentators have recently highlighted a concerning trend of large volumes of BESS capacity being withdrawn from the ERCOT’s interconnection queue.

Many have blamed this phenomenon on the implementation of the Trump Administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” and increasing tariffs on foreign-made imports, which has increased the risk for BESS development, possibly leading to increasing numbers of project cancellations.

Texas is seeing massive growth with AI data centers. There has been attention on their incredible energy demands; however, little attention has been paid to their equally incredible water consumption. But it’s becoming clear that if left unchecked, AI water use could impact the availability of water in drought-stricken Texas.

Outside of Abilene, construction is underway on the world’s largest AI data center— which is part of the five hundred billion dollar endeavor called Stargate.

When complete, Project Stargate One will sit on 940 acres, an area larger than Central Park in New York City. The planned power demand is up to 1.2 Gigawatts for the full campus. That would be enough to power a million average homes.

And there’s a concern about water use. Data centers for AI and cryptocurrency mining use a lot of water.

“If you ask ChatGPT 10 to 50 questions, then it consumes about 50 milliliters of water,“ said Yi Ding, professor at Purdue University’s School of Electrical and Computer Engineering specializing in developing sustainable AI. 50 milliliters of water is about a quarter of a cup. Ding said all those cups of water quickly add up as more and more people are using AI.

Ding recently published the paper ""Not All Water Consumption Is Equal: A Water Stress Weighted Metric for Sustainable Computing"" which was published in HotCarbon 2025. She found that since 2022, two-thirds of new U.S. data centers are located in water scarce regions, including Texas and Arizona.

“Open AI and some bitcoin mining companies, they are all investing heavily in Texas to build data centers. Texas is actually a relatively high water stress region. It's very intensive because people also need water to live,” she said.

The average, midsized data center uses 300,000 gallons of water a day, roughly the use of a thousand homes. According to a policy brief from the Houston Advanced Research Center and University Houston Energy, data centers in Texas will consume 46 billion gallons of water in 2025. They project that by 2030, that number could rise up to 399 billion gallons or about 7% of the total water use in Texas.

“That's a lot of water, and quite frankly, it's a bit alarming because we are already a state struggling with our water supplies,” said Robert Mace, the executive director at The Meadows Center for Water and the Environment in San Marcos.

“You’ve got to have the water to have water for cooling,” he said.

Heat is the enemy of data operations, reducing their efficiency or even making them inoperable. What creates the heat? The multitude of servers burning vast amounts of electricity. “And I think a lot of these data centers are going to find out that it's going to be hard to get that water and it may simply not be available, which is probably going to force them towards the closed loop cooling,” Mace said.

Closed loop systems for data center cooling conserves water because it doesn’t allow the evaporative cooling vaper to escape into the atmosphere. The steam is captured and used over and over.

“That'll be far more water efficient. That does still require water, but it's substantially less water than an open loop cooling system,” Mace said.

According to documents supplied by Caruso Energy —the builder of Abilene’s Stargate — they will be using a closed loop system to conserve water. Caruso made the choice to use less water, but not all data centers will make that choice.

Julie Nahrgang, the executive director of the Water Environment Association of Texas, said water saving steps should be taken now as these data centers are being planned. She said there's no Texas miracle without available water.

“If Texas is looking at this as a business growth opportunity and a chance to lead the nation in this innovative growth place, then water should be one of the paramount considerations. And to that end, Texas should consider incentivizing, requiring or requiring data centers to look at strategies to reduce water demands,” she said.

But Nahrgang said the Texas water plan isn’t taking into account Big Tech’s big thirst. “All of these compounding pressures on our water supply mean that that better planning is needed before we find ourselves in a water supply deficit that we can't innovate out of,” she said.

More gargantuan data centers are coming to some of the driest parts of Texas.

Near Amarillo, Texas Tech University and former Secretary of Energy and Governor Rick Perry is leading the plan for an AI data center that will be five times larger than Abilene’s Stargate.

It will be powered partly by nuclear energy and it has not disclosed how much water it will need. This project is expected to be named the ""Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31d8d44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/836x439+0+55/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2F65%2Fe8e412614c2eb46ec36aed5151f4%2Fai-water-pic.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 09:59:34.686688

With its vertically integrated cadmium telluride (CdTe) technology, aggressive U.S. manufacturing expansion, and strategic monetization of IRA tax credits, First Solar is not just surviving in the energy transition—it is leading it. For investors seeking a long-term, policy-fueled play in the domestic clean energy sector, the case for First Solar is compelling.

Vertical Integration: The Foundation of Resilience

First Solar's vertically integrated model—from semiconductor cell production to module assembly and recycling—sets it apart in an industry still reliant on global supply chains. This control over the entire value chain has allowed the company to mitigate risks from volatile material costs and geopolitical tensions. For instance, its CuRe program, which replaces silver with copper in module manufacturing, has slashed costs while maintaining performance. Meanwhile, its AI-driven supply chain optimization is reducing lead times and enhancing responsiveness in a market where agility is paramount.

The company's R&D investments, totaling $2 billion since its inception, have also driven innovations like bifacial modules, which capture sunlight on both sides, and CdTe technology that outperforms crystalline silicon in high-temperature environments. These advantages translate into lower levelized costs of energy for customers and a durable moat against competitors.

IRA Tax Credits: A Tailwind for Growth

The IRA's 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (MPTC) is a game-changer for First Solar. By generating per-unit credits for domestic production of solar modules, inverters, and other components, the company has unlocked a new revenue stream. In 2025 alone, First Solar has sold over $1.5 billion in 45X credits, with recent transactions fetching $0.95 per $1 of tax credits. These proceeds are funding its 10 GW U.S. manufacturing expansion by 2025, including new facilities in Alabama and Louisiana.

The 45X MPTC is particularly potent for First Solar because its CdTe modules qualify for credits at $0.07 per watt of capacity, a rate that scales with production volume. By shifting manufacturing from Malaysia and Vietnam to the U.S., the company is not only avoiding excise taxes on foreign materials but also qualifying for 100% depreciation deductions. This strategic pivot aligns perfectly with the IRA's goal of reducing reliance on foreign supply chains—a policy tailwind that becomes stronger as global trade tensions persist.

Policy Resilience in a Shifting Political Climate

While the IRA's tax credits are a boon, First Solar's strategy is designed to withstand potential policy headwinds. The company's U.S.-based production model insulates it from the Trump administration's proposed 65% domestic content threshold for tax credits, which would penalize firms reliant on foreign materials. Moreover, its ability to monetize tax credits through third-party transfers provides flexibility in a regulatory environment where future administrations might seek to roll back incentives.

First Solar's balance sheet further reinforces its resilience. With $1.2 billion in cash reserves and $8.5 billion in stockholders' equity, the company has the financial firepower to fund expansions and reward shareholders. Its Q2 2025 results—$1.1 billion in revenue, 45.6% gross margin, and $341.8 million in net income—demonstrate how the IRA's incentives are translating into real-world profitability.

A Must-Owning Play in the Energy Transition

The U.S. solar manufacturing sector is on a trajectory to meet 55% of annual demand by 2035, and First Solar is positioned to dominate this growth. Its 16 GW of planned capacity by 2026, combined with its IRA-driven cost advantages, creates a virtuous cycle: lower costs drive higher adoption, which in turn fuels further production and scale.

For investors, the key question is not whether the energy transition will accelerate, but who will lead it. First Solar's combination of technological innovation, policy alignment, and financial strength makes it a standout. While peers like JinkoSolar and SunPower rely on global supply chains and face higher trade risks, First Solar's domestic focus and IRA tailwinds offer a clearer path to long-term outperformance.

Investment Thesis

First Solar is a must-own for investors betting on the U.S. clean energy transition. Its vertically integrated technology, IRA tax credit monetization, and strategic shift to domestic manufacturing create a durable competitive advantage. While short-term risks like policy uncertainty exist, the company's balance sheet and operational flexibility position it to navigate these challenges. With the U.S. solar market set to expand rapidly, First Solar is not just a beneficiary of the IRA—it is a catalyst for the next phase of domestic clean energy leadership.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-15 17:04:10.323852

To meet that goal, California currently has five projects in development in the Humboldt Wind Energy and the Morro Bay Wind Energy areas.
We can apply knowledge gained from offshore wind projects that began in 1991 in Europe and more recent lessons from projects in the Atlantic Ocean.
Audubon's research shows that ""by taking meaningful action on climate change now, 76% of bird species threatened by climate change will fare better overall under a stabilized climate.""
The birds are telling us that the responsible development of renewable energy, including offshore wind, can’t wait.","Climate change poses an existential threat to birds and people. It is occurring 20 times faster than it has in the past 2 million years, and Audubon’s climate report estimates that nearly two-thirds of North American birds are at a great risk of extinction due to climate change. But if we act to reduce carbon emissions and work to mitigate the impacts from climate change, we know that climate-vulnerable bird species will be better off, and nearly 150 species would likely be saved from the threat of extinction driven by global temperature rise.

Stabilizing the climate means developing renewable energy like offshore wind and connecting it to California’s grid. California needs approximately 25 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind to meet our 2045 goal of relying 100% on renewable energy, according to the California Energy Commission. To meet that goal, California currently has five projects in development in the Humboldt Wind Energy and the Morro Bay Wind Energy areas. These projects aim to bring approximately 5 GW of power to shore—enough to power about 5 million homes.

Planning with Birds in Mind

As with all energy sources, there are upfront costs and resources required for offshore wind, and there will be challenges along the way. Thankfully, this is not an entirely new industry. We can apply knowledge gained from offshore wind projects that began in 1991 in Europe and more recent lessons from projects in the Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, we can apply our local knowledge by involving Tribal communities and other local parties like Audubon community chapters early in the planning process, and utilize data from migratory bird and marine life monitoring. This can help ensure offshore wind locations are chosen responsibly, with environmental and cultural considerations.

Audubon knows that introducing large structures like offshore wind turbines and transmission lines into the marine environment can affect birds and other marine life. But we are confident that well-sited and appropriately mitigated projects will produce outcomes that will benefit people and birds by reducing emissions and addressing the worst impacts of climate change.

Following thorough research, Audubon experts are confident that these unintended consequences can be avoided through proper siting and planning. Recent research by the Schatz Energy Research Center studied 44 seabird species off the California coast and found that 8% fly at a height that may conflict with turbine blades. Understanding this, studies can narrow in on mitigation efforts for specific impacted species—such as California Gull, Western Gull, Herring Gull, Glaucous-winged Gull, Heermann's Gull, Short-billed Gull, Black-legged Kittiwake, Bonaparte's Gull, and Sabine's Gull—which are among some of the most common birds flying above 10 meters. The study also showed that “seabirds can actively avoid wind facilities,” and in the Atlantic Ocean, “nearly all birds present at rotor-swept heights in the vicinity of operating turbines are likely to avoid being struck by the blades under typical conditions.”

There have been ongoing efforts to understand additional techniques to support safe flight paths for seabirds, such as painting turbine blades or shutting turbines down during migration. Ongoing research and monitoring are essential and will increase our understanding of marine life and birds. Some scientists are optimistic that monitoring from wind farms, including improved technologies on turbines, may provide more data on seabird and marine activity than we have ever had.

Siting of turbines and management once they’re installed requires a robust and consistent investment in science and monitoring. Audubon supports the establishment of an independent scientific collaborative that can assess populations and impacts, and make recommendations to adaptively manage offshore wind sites.

Powering a Brighter Future, Together

As Californians who recognize and treasure our unique biodiversity, we know new technology like offshore wind can raise important questions and concerns. Birds already face many challenges to their survival, but with careful planning and collaboration, renewable energy can help us meet our climate goals while safeguarding birds and communities against the growing threats of climate change.

The transition to renewable energy can seem daunting, but the reality is that we’ve already made incredible progress, with 18 countries operating offshore wind projects around the globe. Offshore wind can play a key role in meeting California’s renewable energy goals, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and providing reliable energy for millions of Californians. To ensure offshore wind is responsibly sited and managed, we must engage at the local, state, and federal levels and ensure communities directly affected by new projects are part of the planning process. This is why Audubon California proudly supports legislation such as AB 1417 and SB 787, which help ensure communities benefit from offshore wind development and that agencies work together to develop equitable clean energy supply chains and industrial policy in California.

Audubon's research shows that ""by taking meaningful action on climate change now, 76% of bird species threatened by climate change will fare better overall under a stabilized climate."" The birds are telling us that the responsible development of renewable energy, including offshore wind, can’t wait. Reaching our renewable energy goals could mean a future where incredible birds like the Marbled Murrelet still journey from the rich marine waters along our coast to nest high on the mossy branches of old-growth trees—and where California’s remarkable biodiversity thrives alongside safe, healthy, and resilient communities for generations to come.

You'll have until Sept. 30, 2025 to receive a federal tax credit for buying an electric vehicle. Until then, you can receive a tax credit of $7,500 for a new electric vehicle or $4,000 for a used electric car.With a tax credit, your tax bill is reduced dollar-for-dollar by a certain amount.

The Trump administration's recent tax legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, is phasing out the tax credits, which had been set to run until 2032.

“Car prices are set by supply and demand. Look for dealerships with a large supply of EVs on the lot, and keep in mind that incentives will likely improve as September 30 gets closer,” said Sean Tucker, lead editor for Kelley Blue Book. “Shoppers shouldn’t wait until the absolute last day—the paperwork on the EV tax incentive can take a few days to process. But waiting until September will probably benefit many shoppers.""

Here's what to know about the EV credit and how to take advantage of it before it goes away.

Tax Credits for New Electric Vehicles

In order to be eligible for the tax credit, the vehicle you purchase needs to meet certain requirements. For example, the new car must have undergone final assembly in North America.

You'll want to read the fine print on the government's website to make sure your meet all of the qualifications.

There are two other important requirements to keep in mind: the 'critical mineral' and 'battery component' requirements. If a vehicle only fulfills one of these requirements, you'll only receive a $3,750 credit, but if it meets both, you can get the full $7,500 credit.

The 'critical mineral' requirement asserts that a specific percentage of a car’s battery minerals must come from the United States or from a nation that has a free trade agreement with the U.S.—or be recycled in North America.

The 'battery component' requirement specifies that a certain percentage of battery parts must be made or assembled in the U.S.

Additionally, you'll want to check out the price tag on the vehicle, as vehicles that are too expensive won't qualify for the credit.

For new cars, the vehicle must be $55,000 or less. For vans, trucks, and sport utility vehicles, it must cost $80,000 or less. And if you don't want to do the work of manually checking which cars are eligible, Edmunds has created a list of new electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits, which it's compiled from U.S. Department of Energy data.

And most importantly, you may not be eligible if you earn too much money.

Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must be $300,000 or less for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 or less for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers, according to the IRS.

Also, if you opt to lease an electric vehicle, rather than buy a new one. You won't receive the tax credit. This is because leased vehicles are considered commercial vehicles by the IRS, so the full $7,500 tax credit goes to the company doing the leasing.

However, a customer is still free to ask for a discount on the lease of an electric vehicle, but it's up to the company to determine or whether or not to provide one.

Tax Credits for Used Electric Vehicles

The requirements for a used vehicle are a little bit different.

To qualify for the $4,000 tax credit, the vehicles must be at least two years old and cost no more than $25,000. You also need to buy the used electric vehicle from a dealer, as you won’t qualify for the tax credit if you buy a used electric vehicle from a private party.

And finally, you must make $150,000 or less when filing a joint tax return, $112,500 or less when filing as head of household, and $75,000 for all other filers.

The Bottom Line

To nab a nifty tax credit for an electric vehicle, you’ll need to act before September ends. Dealers and auto companies want electric vehicles to sell before September ends, and they are willing to offer incentives to buyers.

“We anticipate that both automakers and dealers will look to win over as many customers as they can before the tax credit expires. We may see improving incentives throughout the rest of summer,” Tucker said.

Rather than waiting to receive a tax credit on your 2025 taxes, you may also be able to transfer the tax credit to the dealership by requesting a discount on the price of a new or used electric vehicle.

“It will lower your payment, and you see it upfront,” said Ronald Montoya, senior consumer advice editor for Edmunds.

When you receive the discount instead of getting the tax credit, you'll also need to take note of it when you file your taxes the next year—you'll need to complete Form 8936 and attach it to your tax return.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/wM_GK5iozTv7KsPRHEcoXhZVQYM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1461175128-composed-dea8a9fbc40d414b8ea4b2cad6aec1ae.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 07:59:52.755489

TexAmericas Center Bolsters Rail Service

TexAmericas Center, one of the largest mixed-use industrial parks in the U.S., expands its logistics and infrastructure capabilities with the arrival of two new locomotives. The additions are a part of a $3.15 million-dollar investment into strengthening its fleet and bolstering rail services across the east Texas industrial park.

As one of just a few Union Pacific Focus Sites across the country, TexAmericas Center is uniquely positioned to support tenant connectivity and logistics operations. The new locomotives further strengthen the Center’s ability to provide in-house rail movement and support a wider range of tenant operations.

“This investment gives us the horsepower to meet our tenants’ needs today and scale for what’s next,” said Scott Norton, CEO and Executive Director of TexAmericas Center. “We’re eliminating barriers and enabling businesses to adjust and expand their logistics strategies right here on our footprint — all while supporting safer, more efficient operations.”

The project was funded in part through a $1.5 million Defense Economic Adjustment Assistance Grant (DEAAG) from the Texas Military Preparedness Commission (TMPC). The need for upgraded locomotives emerged after TexAmericas Center acquired a railcar storage business in 2021, inheriting two aging locomotives and a growing demand for its rail system. With rail use expanding, leadership identified a clear opportunity to support tenants, attract new business, and strengthen logistics capabilities for the nearby Red River Army Depot and its contractors.

These new locomotives directly support industries that rely on heavy commodities or long-distance shipping and position TexAmericas Center as a unique rail-served location in the mid-south region.

TexAmericas Center is also moving forward with broader rail expansions, including new track on the south end of East Campus, additional spurs, and the development of sit yards, all aimed at increasing capacity and flexibility for tenants. With the arrival and service of these new locomotives, the nearly 12,000-acre TexAmericas Center strengthens its reputation as a high-performance industrial park serving the four-state region of Texarkana (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas).

$500M Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program Launches

Governor Phil Murphy has signed A5687/S4407, creating a new $500 million tax credit program that incentivizes manufacturing investment and job creation. The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program, which will be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), will encourage growth in the state’s manufacturing sector by offering long-term benefits to manufacturing companies.

Under the program, eligible businesses in industries including advanced manufacturing, non-retail food and beverage, defense, clean energy, and life sciences can receive a tax credit award equal to the lesser of 0.1% of the eligible business’s total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time jobs or 25% of the eligible business’s total qualified investment, subject to a total cap of $150 million per project. $100 million in tax credits in the first two years will be reserved for clean energy product manufacturers in industries such as solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen, to further New Jersey clean energy goals and support clean manufacturing. After the first two years of the program, any unused proceeds will roll over into the general manufacturing allocation.

In line with Governor Murphy’s vision to create the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem in the nation, the program will offer stackable bonuses to companies holding New Jersey Business Certifications, like Minority and Women Business Enterprises, businesses located in Opportunity Zones, or companies that have collective bargaining agreements or labor harmony agreements in place.

“We are honored to host Governor Murphy at MAC Products, Inc. for the signing of A-5687. This legislation aligns with our decades-long commitment to strengthening New Jersey’s manufacturing backbone,” said Eddie Russnow, President, MAC Products, Inc. “As a family-owned business that lives by the motto ‘We Don’t Do Easy,’ we understand the importance of resilient, in-state manufacturing capacity. The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program will propel local investment, fuel job creation, and reinforce the innovation and integrity at the heart of our operations—and the operations of manufacturers across the state.”

Nevada WINN Funds To Grow Mining, Manufacturing

The Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) Board has approved $2.67 million from the Workforce Innovations for a New Nevada (WINN) fund to support three industry-led workforce training programs that will bolster training in mining, advanced manufacturing, logistics, and more. This latest round of WINN funding will help operate three programs at Great Basin College, The College of Southern Nevada, and Western Nevada College:

Great Basin College has been awarded $502,500 for the Great Basin College-NORCAT Mine Skills Training program. This funding will allow the program to continue providing mine skills and health and safety training. The program will assist with building a workforce for 1,240 open jobs in the sector. Employer partners include KG Mining, Nevada Gold Mines, Lithium Americas and Orla Mining.

The College of Southern Nevada has been awarded $1,571,934 for its Westside Education & Training Center in Las Vegas. The new training center will provide entry-level, workforce-ready training in key sectors to complement incumbent worker training, allowing for multiple career pathways into various in-demand sectors. The center will assist with building a workforce for 333 open jobs across the manufacturing and construction sectors. Employer partners include Haas Automation, Penta Building Group and Sunshine Minting.

Western Nevada College has been awarded $599,706 to establish a satellite campus at the Victory Logistics District in Fernley to offer workforce, technical and career education programming in the advanced and general manufacturing industries. The program will assist with building a workforce for 10 open jobs in the sector. Lilac Solutions, Redwood Materials and Panasonic are employer partners for the program.

“What unites all three of these proposals is a dual focus: meeting urgent workforce demands today and building long-term career mobility for tomorrow,” said Natalie Brown, assistant vice chancellor for workforce development and community colleges with the Nevada System of Higher Education. “These programs prepare individuals for high-demand technical roles in just weeks or months, providing rapid solutions for employers who cannot afford to wait.”

Denver Airport Explores Nuclear Energy

Denver International Airport (DEN) has issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to study the feasibility of building a small modular (nuclear) reactor (SMR) on the DEN campus. The study is part of DEN’s overall efforts to meet future clean energy demands.

“Denver leads with bold ideas, and our vision for the future of our airport is no exception,” said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston. “As we work to make DEN the greenest airport in the world, we must explore every innovative solution available to meet the demands of a growing city and a changing climate. Studying the potential of small modular nuclear reactors is a forward-looking step in understanding how we can deliver reliable, clean energy at scale. This is about thoughtful planning, long-term sustainability, and our commitment to a healthier planet for generations to come.”

DEN is planning for a future when 120+ million passengers are expected to transit this Colorado airport annually, anticipated by 2045.

“We will need a sustainable power supply to meet the demands of airport assets, as well as our safety and customer experience goals. DEN has already invested in renewable energy sources, including building solar arrays across 100 acres of DEN land, constructing the state’s largest Energy Performance Contract that is saving electricity, natural gas, and water, increasing our electric vehicle fleet, achieving LEED Gold and Platinum certification for new construction projects, and more. But we must plan now and explore all possible options so that we are prepared for the future,” said DEN CEO Phil Washington.

“We recognize that the technology is still relatively new and there is much to learn, which is why DEN will conduct a feasibility study to gather facts and information about whether SMRs could potentially help the airport meet its energy demand and clean energy goals in the future, as well as potential challenges. We know that anything we would do would require significant investment and that SMRs are complex. So, we are keeping an open mind, learning more and continuing to responsibly plan for the airport’s future.”

The study will cost up to $1.25 million and is expected to take between six to 12 months to complete.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/incentives-infrastructure-update_icon.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:04:24.903069

State of play: AES filed a regulatory rate review with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission in June to increase rates by 13.5% over the next year and a half.

If approved as is, the rate hike would roll out in two phases with the first being a 7.5% increase in April and the second a 6% increase in January 2027.

In addition, AES Indiana customers will see a 6% bill increase next year because of approved projects like the Pike County Battery Energy Storage System, the Petersburg Energy Center and grid improvements to be completed throughout 2026.

Zoom in: AES said the increase is needed to cover rising costs as the company makes investments in areas like vegetation management, storm restoration and technology to improve service reliability.

""The rate review process ensures transparency around the investments we're making to build a more resilient energy future and demonstrates our commitment to delivering long-term value to our 532,000 customers,"" AES Indiana president Brandi Davis-Handy said in a statement.

""We understand that any change in rates can create hardships for our customers, and we are committed to working diligently to manage costs responsibly.""

Yes, but: CAC and frustrated customers at a recent town hall held by the nonprofit said the service they're already paying for isn't cutting it, and attempts to add efficiency have only led to more problems.

A common topic at the town hall was ongoing billing issues, caused by a system upgrade AES rolled out in late 2023, that resulted in customers being charged up to 10 times for the same monthly bill.

Attendees said they are also experiencing sticker shock as summer energy bills come in two or three times higher than what they paid in 2024, and are upset with slow restoration times after major storms.

What's next: Customers will have multiple opportunities to voice their opinions over the next few weeks.

The first of four public field hearings organized by the IURC to discuss the proposal starts at 6pm Monday at the Indianapolis Public Library's West Perry Branch.

The remaining hearings will take place 6pm Thursday at Southeast Community Services, 6pm Aug. 25 at New Augusta North Public Academy and 6pm Aug. 27 at The Fort Event Center at Fort Harrison State Park.

The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor is accepting written comments online through Sept. 2.

Summary

First Solar is a buy due to its strong U.S. manufacturing base, national security benefits, and limited reliance on Chinese inputs.

FSLR's valuation is attractive, with low PE ratios and a conservative DCF model indicating undervaluation despite sector headwinds.

Domestic policy, including tariffs and incentives benefits First Solar, though political uncertainty and China's dominance remain risks. Some domestic policies may disfavor First Solar as well, however.

Solar energy's role in grid resilience and manufacturing revival supports FSLR's long-term prospects, making it a moderate-risk, high-upside investment.

I find it rather odd how climate change, environmental protection, and all of that dominate the discussion around solar panels. I believe humanity contributes to climate change, and I do believe in safeguarding the environment. Still, when I look at solar panels, the first thing I think

Markets rise and fall, booms come and go, and the world keeps ticking. Ultimately, I believe observing megatrends, as difficult as they can be to spot, let alone fully comprehend, can yield insights into the advance of human society, which in turn could pave the way for many useful investment insights. As society and technologies evolve, companies and other stakeholders will seize advantages. Figuring out which companies will take the best advantage of any given opportunities is not easy. I am especially interested in macrotrends, futurism, and increasingly, emerging technologies. However, as far as investing is concerned, it’s crucial to pay attention to the fundamentals, quality of leadership, product pipeline, and all the other details. In recent years, I have focused on marketing and business strategy, primarily for medium sized companies and startups. I have worked in international development, including overseas for a foreign Prime Minister’s office, as well as non-profit work in the United States. Among other tasks, I evaluated startups and emerging industries/technologies. I have also moonlighted as a technology and economic news journalist. Now I’m looking to tie everything together. While my personal interests will always keep megatrends and technological developments in mind, I do believe fundamentals and technicals are vital to uncovering opportunities.

Proximity to emitters — major industrial hubs in Texas and Louisiana are just miles from offshore storage potential, reducing transport costs and complexity.
In September 2024, Viridien completed Phase 2 of its GeoVerse Carbon Storage Screening Study for Texas state waters.

Finalizing the offshore carbon storage rules is the key to unlocking that future.","The United States has everything it needs to lead in offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS), except the rules to make it happen.

Nearly four years ago, Congress gave the Department of the Interior authority to oversee offshore carbon sequestration. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021 amended the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to authorize competitive leasing and regulation of carbon dioxide injection into subsea formations on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The law required Interior to issue implementing regulations by November 2022.

That deadline has come and gone. Today, there’s still no proposed rule, and each month without action makes it harder for U.S. companies to compete with early movers overseas.

Around the world, offshore CCS is shifting from concept to commercial reality. In the North Sea, Southeast Asia, and Australia, full-scale projects are being licensed, built, and prepared for decades of safe operation. BloombergNEF projects global carbon capture capacity will increase sixfold by 2030. DNV forecasts $80 billion in cumulative CCS investment over the coming decade.

The U.S. should be leading this charge. Instead, we’re watching competitors move forward while we remain stuck in neutral. Every year of regulatory delay is a year of lost investment, lost technology leadership, and lost opportunity for Gulf Coast communities that are ready to work.

Few regions can match the Gulf of America’s advantages for offshore CCS:

World-class geology — vast deep saline formations with the capacity to store billions of tons of CO₂ securely.

Proximity to emitters — major industrial hubs in Texas and Louisiana are just miles from offshore storage potential, reducing transport costs and complexity.

A seasoned workforce — thousands of engineers, geoscientists, vessel crews, and offshore safety professionals who already operate in this environment daily.

Proven infrastructure — ports, fabrication yards, and shipyards that can pivot from traditional oil and gas to CCS support.

Gulf Coast CCS momentum is building, even without federal rules in place. In April 2025, TGS released the final segment of its comprehensive

Mega Gulf Coast Assessment, mapping carbon sequestration potential across coastal Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. In September 2024, Viridien completed Phase 2 of its GeoVerse Carbon Storage Screening Study for Texas state waters. Meanwhile, the Offshore Gulf of Mexico Partnership for Carbon Storage (GoMCarb) is actively evaluating offshore storage potential, with final results expected by mid-2026. GoMCarb brings together academic researchers, government agencies, and industry to close knowledge gaps, address regulatory and infrastructure needs, and solve the geologic and engineering challenges of storing CO₂ safely and permanently.

The Gulf’s existing offshore energy expertise is unmatched. The same capabilities that built deepwater platforms and subsea systems can now be deployed to develop the next frontier in decarbonization.

We’re already seeing early private-sector investment. But like all capital-intensive projects, CCS needs regulatory certainty. Without a clear leasing process and permitting pathway from the Department of the Interior, developers and investors are forced to delay or look elsewhere.

Interior’s offshore CCS framework must be:

Durable — providing long-term certainty for investors and operators.

Transparent — with clear leasing criteria, timelines, and responsibilities.

Flexible — adaptable to new technologies, evolving best practices, and scale-up needs.

Grounded in safety and environmental stewardship — leveraging decades of offshore operational experience.

Just as importantly, the process for developing the rules must be open and collaborative, engaging industry, states, and stakeholders to ensure the final regulations are workable and future-proof.

Offshore CCS isn’t just an environmental solution, it’s an economic driver. For Gulf Coast states, it means new contracts for shipyards, fabrication yards, and offshore service providers. For U.S. manufacturers, it means orders for compressors, pipelines, and monitoring systems. For port authorities, it means investments in terminals, dredging, and logistics infrastructure.

It also strengthens America’s energy security. By reducing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement, and refining, industries critical to our economy, offshore CCS helps preserve domestic industrial capacity instead of forcing production offshore.

The offshore energy sector has not been waiting idly. NOIA members have spent the past several years working through trade associations and technical groups to provide detailed recommendations to BOEM and BSEE. These inputs cover everything from site characterization and reservoir integrity to long-term monitoring and liability frameworks.

We appreciate recent signs of federal support, including comments from Interior leadership acknowledging the importance of this issue. We encourage that momentum to continue, because without regulatory clarity, the U.S. risks ceding ground in a critical emerging market.

The U.S. has a unique opportunity to turn one of its most important strategic resources, the Gulf of America, into a world-class hub for carbon management and more broadly a global energy and technology leader for vast activities in the blue economy.

Installing solar panels in high-rise apartment buildings or commercial buildings often faces more challenges compared to those in detached houses.
That is not worth the investment,” said Kent Fung, the owner of a solar power system installation company and a Fairview Park resident.","This story was first published by The Xylom. Subscribe to The Xylom’s newsletter here.

Hong Kong is full of contradictions: As the city with the most skyscrapers in the world, it has 40% of its land designated as country parks. It is the city with the second-highest concentration of billionaires in the world, yet its local government has seen a budget deficit for five of the past six financial years. The average Hong Kong resident uses less than half the energy of the average American and one-fifth that of the average Singaporean. However, over 60% of Hong Kong’s carbon footprint can be attributed to electricity generation by fossil fuels.

Rooftop solar promises to thread the needle, taking advantage of Hong Kong’s dense, vertical landscape to provide clean, reliable, affordable energy.

“Solar energy is a green source of electricity, and I can earn income from it,” said Yintung Cheung.

A former elementary school teacher, Cheung is now a fundraising consultant who counts Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund among his former clients. He is a resident of Fairview Park, a suburban gated neighborhood in the northwestern New Territories, just a stone’s throw away from the Shenzhen border. Of the 5,000 semi-detached houses in the sprawling development, a rarity in the city, roughly one-tenth of them are equipped with solar power systems.

Residents, schools and non-government entities have been actively installing rooftop solar systems since the government introduced 15-year financial incentives via the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Scheme in 2018. Those living in detached houses, like Cheung, have been especially keen: The solar panels reduce air-conditioning use by insulating rooftops, cooling room temperatures by up to 5˚C (9˚F) if properly installed. It took Cheung less than four years to recoup the cost of his own 20kW solar power system. Had the FiT Scheme not existed, it would have taken him three decades.

Yet, according to the most recent data released by the Hong Kong government, less than 0.5% of the city’s electricity came from solar energy. At the halfway point of the FiT program, Hong Kong’s solar energy production still lags behind most developed countries or regions, clocking in at a quarter of the levels of Singapore, a region of comparable population density and solar irradiation.

“I’m sometimes disappointed that the government is not being intentional about increasing renewable energy use. They only take the low-hanging fruit of importing electricity from Mainland China,” said Cheung.

How does the scheme work?

Under the Scheme, from 2018 to 2033, individuals or non-governmental bodies can sell solar or wind-generated electricity to utility companies at rates higher than what utility companies charge customers, with the highest FiT rates being granted in small, household-scale systems (≤10 kW) to compensate for economies of scale. This means that those who install solar on their rooftops can use it as a source of income, paying only the prevailing rates for their electricity consumption (around $0.13/kWh).

Unlike similar Biden administration-funded rooftop solar programs in the United States, the program is not means-tested, and there is no annual quota. Because the electricity generated from solar panels goes directly into the grid, Cheung also doesn’t need to install batteries and replace them every few years.

The Hong Kong government has signed decade-long agreements with two shareholder-owned utility companies, CLP Power and HK Electric, with options to extend the agreements for an additional five years. The recent agreements have included the FiT Scheme and reduced the companies’ profit margins from 9.99% to 8%, far below the average of 10.62% requested by American power companies.

To offset part of the cost, the utility companies can sell renewable energy certificates to buyers (such as banks) who wish to claim their businesses or activities are carbon-free. The utility companies are also allowed an extra profit margin for renewable energy produced by them or their customers.

In the 10 years before 2018, only 200 non-governmental renewable energy systems were connected to the grid. Since then, as of March 2025, around 26,800 FiT applications have been approved, and around 25,000 systems have been connected to the grid. Most applications are for solar energy systems, and more than 80% of applications are for small-scale systems — mainly in detached houses.

Installing solar panels in high-rise apartment buildings or commercial buildings often faces more challenges compared to those in detached houses. For one, high-rise rooftops often have practical functionality.

“In Hong Kong, most rooftops have already been occupied by facilities such as equipment rooms, pipelines, outdoor air-conditioning units, suspended platforms, landscaping, recreation spaces, and fire refuge areas,” a spokesperson of the government’s Electrical and Mechanical Services Department told The Xylom.

The other challenge is shade: Tall buildings cast long shadows that block sunlight from reaching solar panels of nearby buildings. Integrating solar panels into the facade and external walls of a building, known as building-integrated photovoltaics, has not been widely applied either, due to cost and administrative concerns.

That said, data obtained from the government’s Environment and Ecology Bureau by The Xylom shows that although nonresidential entities completed less than a fifth of total FiT applications, they have installed half the capacity of solar power under the scheme. In 2024, the government launched a pilot scheme on transparent building-integrated photovoltaics at its Electrical and Mechanical Services Department offices to explore the relevant applications.

Schools and non-profits also benefit from the FiT Scheme. By installing solar panels on roofs, these organizations can earn income to cover part of the electricity fees or enhance environmental education.

“We are a Catholic school; by default, we should be an environmentally-friendly school and be good stewards of this planet. We touch on environmental issues in our science and religious classes. We thought it would be great to promote climate education through installing solar panels,” said Sammy Shum, principal of Aberdeen Technical School.

The school has installed a 44 kW solar PV system on its historic campus, which meets the annual average electricity demand of 11 households. FiT earnings are used for education, such as training students to introduce guests to the school’s solar power system and the power generation mechanisms behind it.

Technical challenges and additional costs

Despite its benefits, the FiT Scheme is no silver bullet. Residents, experts and organizations interviewed for the story told The Xylom that the first barrier to widespread solar power adoption is the technical, financial and administrative challenges during the installation process.

The first major concern is to determine whether a building is structurally sound enough to support solar panels. The main building of Aberdeen Technical School just turned 90 years old this year.

“Some members of our management committee were alumni, who became very concerned about our campus’s Grade III historical building designation. Would [the solar panels] affect its appearance? Would there be liability issues?” Shum said. The Aberdeen Technical School had to test the loading on the roof before making the decision.

The second major concern is potential roof leaks. At first, fixing the solar panels on the roof required drilling directly through the roof, which would result in leaks if the holes were not properly sealed. Some installation companies later improved their installation methods, but Cheung, the fundraising consultant and homeowner, still recommends waterproofing before installing solar PVs, especially in aging buildings. (Cheung himself spent nearly $8,000 on waterproofing, amounting to nearly a fifth of the total installation costs.)

Shum said Aberdeen Technical School spent between $500,000 and $640,000 on waterproofing — more than twice what the school receives from the government for building upkeep and maintenance.

“We were thinking, should we spend three years on waterproofing before installing solar panels?” Shum said. Fortunately, the Education Bureau helped the school advance a few years of its repair and maintenance funds to cover the waterproofing cost. After two years of preparation and communications with the government’s Antiquities and Monuments Office, the solar panels were finally installed.

Residents in particular face challenges in upgrading their power systems and finding reliable installation contractors. Most households in Hong Kong, as well as light commercial customers, receive electricity through a single-phase system using one live wire and one neutral wire. However, to make 10 kW or larger solar power systems viable, customers must upgrade to a three-phase system that uses three live wires and allows for a more efficient and consistent delivery of electrical power.

“If you only have single-phase power, you can only install a 2-3 kW system. That is not worth the investment,” said Kent Fung, the owner of a solar power system installation company and a Fairview Park resident. Not only would a smaller 2-3 kW system not cover the whole roof or provide heat insulation, but there would be minimal installation savings in terms of prevailing wages.

With the latest technology, Fung said the work of changing to three-phase power could be done mainly outside the house and would cause little nuisance indoors. However, the additional six to nine months, as well as the high cost of up to $6,000, could become a source of dispute between customers and contractors.

Compared to residential consumers, schools and NGOs receive more governmental and expert support in handling technical issues.

“I do not feel burdened as we received help from [CarbonCare InnoLab staff]. If I have to do it myself, I will find it difficult and my teaching time reduced,” said Tsang Chi Yeung, a teacher of Aberdeen Technical School.

CarbonCare InnoLab is one of the nonprofits that helps schools and other NGOs install solar PV systems. The organization not only helps with the application process and maintenance, but also holds climate education activities for the school.

“We place a great emphasis on [our multi-pronged strategy] on educating the public and young people on climate,” said Ivy Leung, Executive Director of CarbonCare InnoLab. “We have a lot of solar system tours. We hope schools and members of the public can understand the mechanisms of solar PVs and how they can help with Hong Kong’s 2050 carbon-neutral goal.”

What happens when the scheme weakens?

Publicly-available data from utility companies revealed that the number of new applications has cratered since 2022, when the Hong Kong government lowered FiT rates as previously planned. It further declined when the Hong Kong government concluded the Solar Harvest Scheme, which provided one-stop services for solar installations in schools and NGOs, in 2024.

Cheung thought at the time these lowered rates were reasonable, as the original intent of the scheme was to allow residents to recover their costs within seven to ten years of installation, while solar technology became cheaper as the technology matured. In reality, Fung, the solar panel installer, found that the price of a 10 kW system installation has remained stable over the years, at around $19,000.

“The price of solar panels has dropped slightly, but that of other components, such as inverters, has gone up. Wages have gone up, too,” he said.

“Even if you had a highly efficient system [like mine] that could recover the cost in three to four years, the real amount of time you could earn income if you installed now is at most another three to four years, and that doesn’t factor into the risks of system breakdown,” Cheung said.

In response to The Xylom’s enquiry, the Environment and Ecology Bureau countered that Hong Kong’s FiT rate “was still one of the most attractive in the world” when compared to local power rates.

“As renewable energy technologies are maturing, the trends in China and the world are to gradually reduce and cease subsidies for renewable energy,” said a spokesperson from the Environment and Ecology Bureau. They added that Hong Kong’s FiT Scheme would “unlikely” be extended beyond 2033. If that were to happen, owners of renewable systems could use the electricity generated for their own consumption.

Cheung and Fung agree that as the FiT program nears its halfway point, the lack of clarity about what happens after 2033 is a big factor that prevents people from installing solar PVs.

“No one knows what the plan is after 2033,” Cheung said. “Will the utility companies buy electricity from me at prevailing rates? Or should I buy storage batteries? That’d be wasteful.”

Cheung points to the United States’ regulatory and policy uncertainty as a cautionary tale. “[Democrats] are supportive of solar energy, so a lot of these facilities were built. The moment [Republicans] replace them and support oil and gas development, all these solar panel investments […] go down the drain,” he lamented.

On August 5, The New York Times reported that the Trump EPA announced plans to claw back $7 billion in grants for solar energy, including the “Solar for All” program in Georgia, where The Xylom is based, and one of six states Trump flipped in the 2024 Presidential election. (500 households registered for a randomized drawing in the 24 hours since its application portal opened on August 4th.)

The path ahead

At present, Hong Kong’s electricity mix consists mainly of natural gas (55.5%), nuclear energy (less than 24.5%), and coal (20%). Renewable energy only accounted for 0.8% of the electricity mix as of 2022.

Although a government-commissioned study in 2019 estimated that Hong Kong’s rooftop solar energy can at most account for 1.1-2% of its electricity use at 2016 levels, experts at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University estimated that rooftop solar PVs alone could account for more than 10% of Hong Kong’s electricity use, meeting the Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050’s goal of increasing the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix to 7.5% to 10% by 2035, the first step to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.

Fung, who has been running his small solar installation business since 2018, said that as solar panels can insulate rooftops from the sun and act as canopies for the roofs of detached houses, some residents are still interested in installing panels despite lower financial returns. But hesitance remains in the market, and customers are dwindling: his company lost money last year after turning a profit in the previous two.

With the trend of decreasing FiT installations, even the most optimistic projections won’t see Hong Kong reaching the modest target of generating up to 2% of electricity from solar power by 2035.

“We really hope the government can look at the pace of renewable energy development in Hong Kong before deciding when to stop the Feed-in Tariff Scheme,” Leung of CarbonCare InnoLab said. She urged the government to provide more flexibility in the Feed-in Tariff Scheme, such as offering longer-term contracts for new installers, instead of setting a hard sunset provision in 2033.

In Fairview Park, Cheung has actively promoted solar PVs to his neighbours. He said residents share information on company pricing, new technologies, and maintenance, and help ease one another’s concerns. In the street where his house is located, 13 out of 30 houses have installed solar panels. However, he is not holding out hope for a meaningful energy transition in Hong Kong.

“If the government doesn’t have policies that go hand-in-hand [with residents and businesses], and it chooses to sunset the FiT program instead,” Cheung said, “Hong Kong won’t have a shot at meeting renewable energy goals.”

The report, entitled ""Strong Signals in the Noise"", highlights growing momentum in the global clean economy, driven by energy security concerns, trade realignments and technological breakthroughs.

In 2024 alone, clean energy investments outpaced global oil and gas spending two-to-one, the report states. And Canada, with its vast critical minerals, emissions-free electricity and skilled workforce, could become a clean energy superpower.

According to the report, the clean energy transition is no longer a niche sector, with worldwide investment in clean power, electrification and low-carbon materials growing 22% annually. That shift is being amplified by mounting global concerns over energy security and supply chain resilience, with countries seeking to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

“Canada has the resources, the talent and the trade routes to boost the energy transition around the world while creating stable jobs and driving innovation here at home,” Smith noted.

With 80% of its electricity already emissions-free and critical minerals exploration at a global high, Canada’s clean energy sector has quietly built a strong base. And provinces are starting to take advantage: BC Hydro’s 2024 power call alone will result in $5–6 billion in capital investment, while Ontario has secured major EV and battery deals from multinational firms.

Headwinds to overcome

Despite these strengths, the report suggests that Canada risks losing out in the global energy economy unless a more coordinated approach to policy and investment is defined.

“We need to scale our efforts by ensuring a strong foundation and building market confidence now, to mobilize the capital required to take advantage of this growth potential in Canada,” said Andrea Moffat of Addenda Capital, in a statement.

According to New Economy Canada, U.S. tariff wars, Chinese dominance in clean tech and recent U.S. policy reversals are all part of the challenge that the Canadian government must overcome to maximize this potential.

But industry leaders from sectors like cement, hydrogen and renewables all echoed the sentiment that Canada is facing a huge economic opportunity. “Canada is not just ready to compete globally — we’re ready to lead the clean‑energy transition,” said Matt Harper, president of Invinity Energy Systems, in a statement.",https://media1.money.ca/a/116071/clean-energy-jobs-canada-investment-report_facebook_thumb_1200x628_v20250730154421.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:04:31.763160

This growth occurred despite an initial slowdown linked to political decisions made in Washington.

According to EV research firm Rho Motion, 10.7 million units were sold between January and the end of July. China once again dominated the market with 6.5 million sales, followed by Europe with 2.3 million, North America with one million, and roughly 900,000 spread across other regions.

Sales momentum was robust in China and Europe, both of which posted year-on-year gains of around 30 per cent. Emerging markets delivered even more impressive growth, up 42 per cent collectively. BloombergNEF has singled out Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil as standout performers in the global EV push.

Consumer preferences, however, vary sharply by region. In China, pure battery electric vehicles are outpacing hybrids at an increasingly rapid pace. In Europe’s two largest markets, Germany and the United Kingdom, drivers remain slightly more inclined towards hybrid models.

The Months Ahead: Tariffs and Tax Credit Changes

In contrast to the rapid expansion elsewhere, North American sales between January and July grew by just 2 per cent compared to last year.

Several factors have slowed momentum. The pandemic years dampened investor confidence in building new manufacturing plants and charging infrastructure, and political uncertainty in the run-up to national elections added another layer of hesitation.

Rho Motion notes that the full impact of President Donald Trump’s policy agenda has yet to be felt in the EV market. The federal government has rolled out sweeping tariffs on imported cars, batteries, and components, with the rates and timelines shifting repeatedly in recent months. Legal challenges are ongoing. Agreements with South Korea, Japan, and the European Union have fixed a 15 per cent tariff on imported cars from those markets.

On the consumer side, a significant change is looming. The tax credits offered under the Inflation Reduction Act will no longer be available after 30 September 2025. These credits currently provide up to $7,500 off the purchase of a new EV and up to $4,000 for a used one.

Rho Motion expects a short burst of buying in the US ahead of the deadline, followed by a likely slowdown in demand.

The Global Picture

In July alone, 1.6 million electric vehicles were sold worldwide, representing a 21% increase from the previous year.

China continued to post substantial numbers, with July sales up 12 per cent despite an overall decline in passenger car sales. Half of all vehicles sold to individuals and families during the month were electric.

One driver of demand has been the government’s car trade-in scheme, introduced last year. The programme makes it easier for drivers to scrap or resell their old cars. In late July, Beijing allocated the third-quarter round of funding, with the final 2025 allocation expected in October. Since its launch, 5.2 million passenger cars have gone through the scheme, with roughly half scrapped and the rest resold and replaced.

In Europe, Germany and the UK continue to lead the way. Both countries experienced significant year-on-year growth in July, with Germany increasing by 43 per cent and the UK by 32 per cent. Sales in Italy are also rising.

France presents a more mixed picture. July sales rose 9 per cent year-on-year, but overall numbers for the year remain down 11 per cent. To counter this, the government will relaunch its EV leasing programme for low-income households on 30 September.

The scheme will enable drivers to lease new or used electric cars and vans for monthly payments starting from as little as € 100. The government will provide guarantees to sellers to make such offers viable, with a target of 50,000 leases lasting at least three years each.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_cc1f14e87ded495782f52bf1c6e8d25b~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/becc64_cc1f14e87ded495782f52bf1c6e8d25b~mv2.webp",N,,2025-08-15 08:00:14.425113

This innovation is central to a series of studies on power outage vulnerability from the Urban Resilience AI Lab.
Establishing nationwide power system vulnerability index across US counties using interpretable machine learning.","Hurricane Beryl, Winter Storm Uri and other severe weather events have increased long-term power outages for Texas residents in recent years. But this issue does not just affect Texans.

Researchers from the Urban Resilience AI Lab at Texas A&M University have used machine learning to create a nationwide Power System Vulnerability Index (PSVI) that identifies areas at increased risk of power outages.

“Using data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we were able to study the effect of weather events on the frequency and duration of nationwide power outages over the past 10 years,” said Dr. Junwei Ma, a postdoctoral researcher in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “The dataset included over 179 million data points sorted by time and location, allowing us to create the PSVI.”

The study’s results show an increase in the extent of weather-induced power outages. Trends show an increase in the length and frequency of power outages, with more customers being affected annually.

Authors of this paper – including Ma, his fellow postdoctoral researcher Dr. Bo Li, Dr. Olufemi A. Omitaomu from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Dr. Ali Mostafavi, a professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering – identified several regions they would consider hot spots, facing the highest levels of power system vulnerability. Hot spots include the East and West Coasts and the Great Lakes and Gulf regions, indicating areas of dense development face higher vulnerability for power outages.

“We knew that the state of power system vulnerability nationwide is exacerbating. But the magnitude of that was shocking, and greater than we hypothesized,” Dr. Ali Mostafavi, Professor of Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

The research team identified the hot spots and annual increase rate trends thanks to their novel and publicly available PSVI map.

“This is an interactive tool that can showcase the overall PSVI ratings and scores of individual US counties over the past decade, and how vulnerability shifts year by year,” said Ma.

Researchers also observed that many AI data centers – like the ones used to store this study’s data – are located in the hot spots, showing the need for increased investments in infrastructure to protect these resources.

By using a type of machine learning called explainable AI, this software goes beyond just sorting data. It can identify trends. This innovation is central to a series of studies on power outage vulnerability from the Urban Resilience AI Lab. Previous studies have revealed growing and disparate vulnerability in the US power system.

“We knew that the state of power system vulnerability nationwide is exacerbating. But the magnitude of that was shocking, and greater than we hypothesized,” said Mostafavi, who also serves as the director of the Urban Resilience AI Lab. “After 2019, we see a 20% annual increase in outage duration, frequency and magnitude.”

Knowing an area is at risk allows policymakers to prioritize preparation for long and frequent power outages, reducing associated socioeconomic impacts, such as limited access to food and inability to travel to work. Understanding power system vulnerability is key for stakeholders making decisions that impact community resilience.

Another setback for electric vehicles If you have an electric car in the US, you’ve got a little more than twelve months left to keep using the HOV lane on your own.","Oh, oh… We have bad news for those driving electric, hybrid, or hydrogen cars in our country. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said it has no intention of continuing to approve the programs that allow the use of HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) lanes even if you’re driving alone. The program, still active in over a dozen states, ends in September 2025, and no extension is in sight.

The decision directly affects states like California, Arizona, New York, Florida, and Virginia, among others. And even though these programs are managed by the states themselves, they need the federal government’s green light to continue. The EPA has said it will not grant it.

California already has an expiration date

Yep. California is one of the most affected states. It has more than half a million active stickers. The last day to request a new one will be August 29, and it will be valid until September 30, 2025. After that date, if you’re driving alone in your EV in the HOV lane and get caught, you’ll have to pay a toll or get a fine, be careful.

That sticker, which costs 27 dollars, has been a strong local incentive for years to promote low-emission vehicles. But it seems it no longer fits with the federal government’s new plans, which, by the way, will also end tax credits for EVs that same month…

How does this change things?

It’s hard to know to what extent this measure will slow down the adoption of electric or hybrid vehicles, but it certainly doesn’t help. The EV market is showing signs of stagnation, and taking away benefits doesn’t seem like the best fix… Or at least is what we think about it.

The change also puts on hold the extension that California Governor Gavin Newsom had approved, which aimed to extend the program until 2027. But without the EPA’s approval, that’s now meaningless.

This also affects half a dozen more states

It’s not just California. This decision directly impacts similar programs in 12 other states, including Colorado, Hawaii, Georgia, North Carolina, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Utah. In all of them, drivers with clean vehicles could enjoy fast lanes without carpooling!

The EPA insists that the HOV lane was created to promote carpooling, not to let certain vehicles bypass the rule just for being cleaner! And while it’s true that some states have good EV adoption rates without this incentive, California has been a leader partly thanks to these advantages.

Is that going to change now? Probably not. But forcing half a million cars back into regular lanes won’t improve traffic in cities like Los Angeles, not a good idea to be honest.

Hybrids to the rescue

This federal shift comes with other decisions that have also slowed the momentum of fully electric cars. The US government has even tried to stop California’s rule requiring all cars sold after 2035 to be zero-emissions. Add to that new tariffs and a less enthusiastic tone toward electric vehicles, and you’ll understand why manufacturers are now highlighting hybrids again.

The industry has already started to move, announcing more hybrid models and fewer electric ones. But all of this could change again in a few years, depending on how things play out in Washington.

Another setback for electric vehicles

If you have an electric car in the US, you’ve got a little more than twelve months left to keep using the HOV lane on your own. After that, it’ll be time to adapt, as always. And while this change won’t kill the EV market, it does add another barrier at a delicate moment.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Carril_VAO.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 07:00:37.923571

He first came to Civic Works in 2020, after being laid off during the pandemic.

“Things wasn’t going how they was supposed,” he says, “so I found Civic Works, and they had opportunities that just weren’t opening up for people.”

The center trains people for careers in construction and clean energy. These are stable, well-paying jobs for people who don’t have college degrees.

Timothy has completed two programs: utility infrastructure and electric vehicle service equipment technician.

“I would like to be a heavy equipment operator, the ones who go out and dig up the ground,” he says.

Timothy doesn’t have to look far to find the next opportunity.

Civic Works brings local employers to its center quarterly for a job fair. So new graduates from its workforce development program can connect with those ready to hire.

“I actually got a very positive response, and I like how everyone went here at the job fair,” he says after Thursday’s job fair, “because, like I said, still opportunities that are opening up further, opening up constantly. Helping everyone and everybody. Like, if you can get here, you have an opportunity to better yourself.”

Civic Works' job training program doesn't just connect people to jobs.

The nonprofit provides ongoing support to set participants up for long-term success. That makes employers eager to hire qualified candidates coming through the program.

“We like to work with programs that kind of have that step up,” says Yasmeen Espinal, human resources manager for Allan Myers, “and help those communities to kind of get people on the right track, get people back into the workforce.”

Fewer Surprises (But, Still Plenty Ahead) As noted above, the good news in this year’s EVX Public Charging Study is that “non-charging visits” significantly improve.","The state of public charging infrastructure is still a major reason why consumers reject electric vehicles, even though in actual practice most charging happens at home, and even though fewer owners experience “non-charging visits” – read, non-working public chargers – according to the 2025 J.D. Power U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience Public Charging Study, or EVX Public Charging for short.

“You’re right that public charging isn’t as critical as home charging is. But it is necessary,” Brent Gruber, executive director of the EV practice at J.D. Power, tells WardsAuto.

In this year’s study, customer satisfaction with public charging is down overall, for both categories of public chargers: direct-current, 300V-plus fast chargers, and slower, but more common, 240V Level 2 chargers. Respondents give DC fast chargers a score of 654 on a 1,000-point scale, down 10 points vs. a year ago. Level 2 public chargers are rated at 607, down 7 points from the 2024 study.

That’s not going to help dealers sell more EVs or plug-in hybrids.

Areas that got worse in the current survey include cost and ease of payment, according to the survey. Respondents were 7,428 owners of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The study was fielded from January through June 2025.

Everyone Needs It – Sometimes

More than 80% of charging for BEVs and PHEVs happens at home, but all BEV and plug-in customers rely on public charging sometimes, Gruber says.

Obviously, customers who can’t charge at home conveniently, such as apartment dwellers, rely more heavily on public charging, he says.

But even customers with home chargers engage in what Gruber calls “convenience” charging, topping off their batteries when they find available chargers at stores or work. Those on long-distance road trips are among those who generally rely on public chargers for “purposeful” charging.

Home, Sweet Home Charging

In a separate study, the 2025 EVX Home Charging Study, J.D. Power reports respondents rate their experience with home chargers much higher than public chargers.

Overall satisfaction among owners of Level 2, portable home-charging stations is 714; or 733 for Level 2 permanently mounted home chargers. Owner satisfaction with Level 1 portable chargers is low, at 581.

Whether portable or permanently mounted, Level 2 chargers use a 240V electrical outlet, which is standard in European households but found sporadically in the U.S., where one may or may not be required to power some large appliances such as clothes dryers and ovens. Level 1 chargers – a much slower option that may take overnight to charge a vehicle fully – use a standard, 120V electrical outlet.

Fewer Surprises (But, Still Plenty Ahead)

As noted above, the good news in this year’s EVX Public Charging Study is that “non-charging visits” significantly improve.

The 2025 study reports that 14% of all EV owners say they visited a charger without successfully charging their vehicle. That’s down from 19% a year ago, and the lowest level in four years of the survey, J.D. Power says.

Still, that’s a substantial number of failures, compared with gas pumps inspected regularly by state departments of agriculture or state weights and measures departments. There is no centralized data for gas pump failures in the U.S. but research firms estimate the total is between 6-8%.

And those visiting gas stations can choose from among 1 million-plus individual fuel dispensers across about 145,000 fueling stations. The U.S., as of Aug. 14, has 75,480 Level 2 and DC-fast public charging stations and 223,785 Level 2 and DC-fast charging ports nationwide, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fueling Station Locator.

Take A Number

The unfavorable EV charging numbers are also higher than average in some of the busiest EV markets, the survey says – in Seattle, 25% of EV drivers report a higher rate of non-charging events, and 24% in Los Angeles.

Waiting in line for a charger is also more common in the heavier EV markets. “Where utilization is high, you see a higher percentage having to wait to be able to charge,” Gruber says. “Another element of it is aging infrastructure. On the West Coast, EVs were introduced earlier, and have become much more prolific,” equaling more charger demand and taxing older chargers that haven’t been updated.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt7121b6ec5c11097b/blt810e4b41e74a6751/689e3a7071b5d50bc6f57ed4/0814jhEVX.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-15 07:00:41.104114

Schweitzer,,,,,https://www.thenewstribune.com/opinion/article311702863.html,"In 2023, we invested $100 million of company profits and built a state-of-the-art printed circuit board factory in Moscow, Idaho.
Today we pay huge taxes to buy foreign parts, due to Trump’s tariffs.
We had been projecting to pay $100 million of tariffs this year.
On top of other taxes, Trump’s tariffs alone could amount to a 50% income tax.
Tariffs disincentivize manufacturing and create uncertainty, the opposite of the purported purpose of Trump’s tariffs.","Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL) has designed and manufactured equipment and systems for critical infrastructure for over 40 years. Made in America is in our genes. We work to keep the lights on at home and around the world.

Idaho exemplifies an environment where American businesses of all sorts thrive. Governor Little and the Idaho congressional delegation understand economic freedom. That freedom empowers us to invest and grow in Idaho.

In 2023, we invested $100 million of company profits and built a state-of-the-art printed circuit board factory in Moscow, Idaho. This plant strengthens our domestic supply chain. We used our own money. Profits fuel our growth, not government subsidies.

SEL is committed to “Made in America.” However, today, the solid foundation we’ve built — and our aspirations to continue to invest in America — are under threat. Ironically, it’s not foreign competition that poses the greatest risk — it’s taxation without representation, in the form of executive-ordered tariffs.

When I started SEL in 1984, every component was made in U.S. Over time, most electronic manufacturing moved offshore, and we now rely on foreign suppliers for many components. Today we pay huge taxes to buy foreign parts, due to Trump’s tariffs.

The Peterson Institute for International Economics analyzes tariff impact. Example: tariffs on consumer goods jumped from 3.6% to 13.5% between January and June — nearly quadrupling this tax.

Tariffs are especially regressive taxes, landing hardest on folks least able to pay. As the Institute explains, inventories of pre-tariff products have temporarily muted some sticker shock. Soon, the burden will inevitably roll downhill to consumers.

This is taxation without representation.

We fought a revolution over that nearly 250 years ago. Our Constitution clearly assigns Congress — not the executive branch — the authority to set tariffs.

White House tariff-making is an executive end-run around Congress, by misusing the IEEPA emergency powers act. Though courts will likely enforce the Constitution on the White House, we must not wait for years of litigation to restore order.

Let’s start today.

Presidents from both parties — including John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan — championed competitive enterprise, open markets and American leadership in the global economy. Kennedy said we need a vibrant free economy to produce the tax revenues the government needs to operate. He understood Congress writes tax law, not the White House. We all benefited.

Trump’s trade war makes America less competitive while raising prices for everyone. SEL and other US manufacturers are being punished, as are all customers and consumers.

For SEL, Trump’s proposed 100% tariff on semiconductors would impose an additional $50 million per year in new taxes.

We had been projecting to pay $100 million of tariffs this year. The proposed 100% tariff pushes the total tax burden up to $150 million, or about half our income.

As a 100% employee-owned company, this amounts to over $20,000 per employee-owner. A significant amount that could be used for increased pay, hiring more employee-owners, developing new products, building more facilities and our profit-sharing extra pay days.

On top of other taxes, Trump’s tariffs alone could amount to a 50% income tax.

Tariffs disincentivize manufacturing and create uncertainty, the opposite of the purported purpose of Trump’s tariffs.

We are delaying new buildings, reducing R&D and prices will rise — handing an advantage to foreign competitors who are eager to take our place.

America faces a fiscal challenge. We should tackle root causes — excessive spending and regulation — rather than papering them over with hidden taxes on families’ grocery carts, utility bills, cars and consumer goods. Tariffs punish producers and consumers, doing little to solve underlying issues.

We ask for the chance to work hard, earn a fair return, and keep building on a fair, level playing field. No special treatment wanted!

Congress should reassert its constitutional authority over tariffs, end taxation without representation, and establish a durable, predictable trade policy that rewards making things in America.

Do that, and companies like SEL and countless others will keep hiring, inventing, investing and manufacturing in the places we call home.

But wider opposition could stymie additional solar developments in rural areas, slowing growth in the U.S. energy supply.
In rural areas, solar development occurring on prime farmland has had an outsized negative influence from the community perspective.
“Regardless of the pace of solar development ahead, future installations will inevitably affect local communities so more engagement from the solar industry is needed,” said Viswanath.
CoBank is a member of the Farm Credit System, a nationwide network of banks and retail lending associations chartered to support the borrowing needs of U.S. agriculture, rural infrastructure and rural communities.","Local opposition to utility-scale solar installations in rural areas is growing following the rapid pace of new solar developments in recent years. Concerns about land use in areas largely dominated by agricultural production are fueling much of the community-level resistance. With crop production revenue currently under intense pressure and subject to annual volatility, some landowners are welcoming the more consistent revenue advantages of solar land-lease payments. But wider opposition could stymie additional solar developments in rural areas, slowing growth in the U.S. energy supply.

According to a new report from CoBank’s Knowledge Exchange, solar expansion could deliver the fastest, most affordable means for increasing the nation’s razor-thin energy reserves while driving new revenue streams for rural communities. However, success will be dependent on regional policy and site planning guidelines that ensure the local communities’ needs and interests are prioritized. The report is the first in a series of upcoming research articles and part of The New Golden Age of Electricity digital hub about rising energy scarcity and securing future power supply for rural America.

“Concerns surrounding the pace of solar developments in rural areas and the implications for land use in agricultural regions are warranted,” said Teri Viswanath, lead power, energy and water economist with CoBank. “But there are guardrails to reduce the risk of land use tensions and other conflicts that would enable landowners and rural communities to capture the financial benefits of solar projects without displacing or disturbing agriculture farmland.”

Growing resistance to solar installations in rural communities is likely in response to the speedy development that has already taken place and concerns about what future construction might look like. More than one-half of all U.S. solar installations have materialized since 2020, with 25% of that development occurring since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Solar energy generation can be installed at a rate five times faster than all other new electricity sources combined and remains the lowest cost solution to expanding energy supplies, even without government subsidies. While federal policy has recently become much less supportive of renewable energy and tax credits are now limited, the costs of solar development remain favorable. The biggest headwind for expanding solar energy production is local opposition.

A recent analysis by USA TODAY found that around 15% of counties in the U.S. have some form of restriction on building new utility-scale solar energy projects. This includes outright bans, zoning restrictions, specialized land-use rules or political stonewalls. At least 395 local restrictions across 41 states, in addition to 19 state-level restrictions, are so severe that they effectively block renewable development in these areas.

In rural areas, solar development occurring on prime farmland has had an outsized negative influence from the community perspective. To rectify that trend, American Farmland Trust and the American Farm Bureau Federation have recommended a set of guardrails that would prevent the solar industry from siting developments on prime agricultural land. Those recommendations include prioritizing solar power on shared agricultural land or marginal and brownfield sites, offering a more acceptable pathway for rural communities and landowners to capture the benefits of tax revenue and lease payments. The report also notes that economies of scale and high costs are major reasons why simply installing solar on existing rooftops is not a feasible answer.

Successful efforts to balance local community interests with solar development have the potential to pay off handsomely. According to data collected by the American Clean Power Association, a recurring $739 million came back to communities last year in the form of state and local taxes and land-lease payments.

“Regardless of the pace of solar development ahead, future installations will inevitably affect local communities so more engagement from the solar industry is needed,” said Viswanath. “Strengthening partnerships with agricultural stakeholders and implementing effective land management strategies will be critical to mitigating challenges and gaining acceptance. Solar power is essential for meeting near-term demand growth, and rural America can play a key role in this while diversifying farm income and benefiting local communities through additional tax revenue.”

Proximity to emitters — major industrial hubs in Texas and Louisiana are just miles from offshore storage potential, reducing transport costs and complexity.
In September 2024, Viridien completed Phase 2 of its GeoVerse Carbon Storage Screening Study for Texas state waters.
Meanwhile, the Offshore Gulf of Mexico Partnership for Carbon Storage (GoMCarb) is actively evaluating offshore storage potential, with final results expected by mid-2026.
Finalizing the offshore carbon storage rules is the key to unlocking that future.","The United States has everything it needs to lead in offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS), except the rules to make it happen.

Nearly four years ago, Congress gave the Department of the Interior authority to oversee offshore carbon sequestration. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021 amended the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to authorize competitive leasing and regulation of carbon dioxide injection into subsea formations on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The law required Interior to issue implementing regulations by November 2022.

That deadline has come and gone. Today, there’s still no proposed rule, and each month without action makes it harder for U.S. companies to compete with early movers overseas.

Around the world, offshore CCS is shifting from concept to commercial reality. In the North Sea, Southeast Asia, and Australia, full-scale projects are being licensed, built, and prepared for decades of safe operation. BloombergNEF projects global carbon capture capacity will increase sixfold by 2030. DNV forecasts $80 billion in cumulative CCS investment over the coming decade.

The U.S. should be leading this charge. Instead, we’re watching competitors move forward while we remain stuck in neutral. Every year of regulatory delay is a year of lost investment, lost technology leadership, and lost opportunity for Gulf Coast communities that are ready to work.

Few regions can match the Gulf of America’s advantages for offshore CCS:

World-class geology — vast deep saline formations with the capacity to store billions of tons of CO₂ securely.

Proximity to emitters — major industrial hubs in Texas and Louisiana are just miles from offshore storage potential, reducing transport costs and complexity.

A seasoned workforce — thousands of engineers, geoscientists, vessel crews, and offshore safety professionals who already operate in this environment daily.

Proven infrastructure — ports, fabrication yards, and shipyards that can pivot from traditional oil and gas to CCS support.

Gulf Coast CCS momentum is building, even without federal rules in place. In April 2025, TGS released the final segment of its comprehensive

Mega Gulf Coast Assessment, mapping carbon sequestration potential across coastal Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. In September 2024, Viridien completed Phase 2 of its GeoVerse Carbon Storage Screening Study for Texas state waters. Meanwhile, the Offshore Gulf of Mexico Partnership for Carbon Storage (GoMCarb) is actively evaluating offshore storage potential, with final results expected by mid-2026. GoMCarb brings together academic researchers, government agencies, and industry to close knowledge gaps, address regulatory and infrastructure needs, and solve the geologic and engineering challenges of storing CO₂ safely and permanently.

The Gulf’s existing offshore energy expertise is unmatched. The same capabilities that built deepwater platforms and subsea systems can now be deployed to develop the next frontier in decarbonization.

We’re already seeing early private-sector investment. But like all capital-intensive projects, CCS needs regulatory certainty. Without a clear leasing process and permitting pathway from the Department of the Interior, developers and investors are forced to delay or look elsewhere.

Interior’s offshore CCS framework must be:

Durable — providing long-term certainty for investors and operators.

Transparent — with clear leasing criteria, timelines, and responsibilities.

Flexible — adaptable to new technologies, evolving best practices, and scale-up needs.

Grounded in safety and environmental stewardship — leveraging decades of offshore operational experience.

Just as importantly, the process for developing the rules must be open and collaborative, engaging industry, states, and stakeholders to ensure the final regulations are workable and future-proof.

Offshore CCS isn’t just an environmental solution, it’s an economic driver. For Gulf Coast states, it means new contracts for shipyards, fabrication yards, and offshore service providers. For U.S. manufacturers, it means orders for compressors, pipelines, and monitoring systems. For port authorities, it means investments in terminals, dredging, and logistics infrastructure.

It also strengthens America’s energy security. By reducing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement, and refining, industries critical to our economy, offshore CCS helps preserve domestic industrial capacity instead of forcing production offshore.

The offshore energy sector has not been waiting idly. NOIA members have spent the past several years working through trade associations and technical groups to provide detailed recommendations to BOEM and BSEE. These inputs cover everything from site characterization and reservoir integrity to long-term monitoring and liability frameworks.

We appreciate recent signs of federal support, including comments from Interior leadership acknowledging the importance of this issue. We encourage that momentum to continue, because without regulatory clarity, the U.S. risks ceding ground in a critical emerging market.

The U.S. has a unique opportunity to turn one of its most important strategic resources, the Gulf of America, into a world-class hub for carbon management and more broadly a global energy and technology leader for vast activities in the blue economy. Finalizing the offshore carbon storage rules is the key to unlocking that future.",https://images.oedigital.com/images/maritime/w800/copyright-marharytaadobestock-162780.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 07:02:28.573897

The build-out of the plant’s structure is complete, with major mechanical, electrical and piping work well underway.

State-of-the-art LFP battery cell production equipment is already operational off-site, where it is being used to produce C-sample cells, the final prototype stage before production readiness.

This parallel work allows Ford to accelerate training and commissioning, ensuring that once the equipment arrives in Michigan, US, the transition to full-scale production will be seamless.

Building domestic capacity

The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan facility spans almost a mile, with its cell plant running 0.6 miles along the site’s spine.

Once equipment is installed, areas of the facility will be sealed and gradually transitioned into clean room status under strict protocols.

Polished floors and a tightly controlled environment will ensure that battery cells meet the highest quality standards.

For the first time, an American company is manufacturing LFP cells and packs domestically, without a foreign joint venture.

“We remain on track to start production of these batteries next year,” says Lisa Drake, Vice President, Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems at Ford.

The company says that achieving affordability for EV customers requires both innovation and scale.

By establishing a wholly owned facility with world-class LFP production technology, Ford is ensuring expertise and control remain in-house.

This approach, the company argues, will allow the US to finally build LFP batteries at scale and compete in the global energy storage market.

“Our industry is experiencing change at a remarkable rate and magnitude and Ford is seizing this opportunity to lead and help build a better world,” says Bill Ford, Executive Chair of Ford, in Ford’s 2025 Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report.

Economic and social impact

Beyond technological innovation, the project carries a strong economic and social dimension.

The US$3bn investment will create approximately 1,700 jobs in Michigan, supporting American workers in a rapidly expanding clean energy industry.

Green energy advocates said Indiana lost $117 million to fund solar programs.
Alison Becker of Solar Opportunities Indiana received a termination letter from the EPA.
Becker said the solar organizations are resilient.
“Folks around the state are already having a hard time affording rising energy bills they’re having to make hard decisions.","INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has pulled $7 billion of grant money that was supposed to go to solar projects around the country.

Advocates said it’s a big blow to lower-income households, including ones in Indiana. The EPA’s Biden-era program Solar for All was approved in 2024.

Green energy advocates said Indiana lost $117 million to fund solar programs. Zach Schalk, Indiana program director for Solar United Neighbors, called it “a huge gut punch.”

He added, “It was devastating for organizations like Solar United Neighbors, but also for all the thousands of Hoosiers households that were going to benefit from affordable local clean energy in the state.”

The program was meant to give low-income and disadvantaged communities a chance to tap into Solar Energy by providing solar panels and other equipment, or linking communities to nearby solar sites. Advocates said the program would have helped 70,000 Indiana homes save 20% in electric bills, and lead to job opportunities in the state.

Lee Zeldin, EPA administrator, spoke about the cancellation of government funds. “Recipients are still very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process. But the bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

Zeldin said the money cut will help save taxpayers.

Alison Becker of Solar Opportunities Indiana received a termination letter from the EPA. The letter said the program has 120 calendar days to decide what they want to do. Becker said they can either appeal EPA’s decision in court, call off the program, or keep parts of it running through fundraising efforts.

Becker said the solar organizations are resilient. “The organizations who are on the coalition are so committed to environmental justice and so committed to providing solar opportunities that we’ll continue to look for grants if this grant is effectively terminated.”

Zach Schalk personally funded 24 solar panels for his two-story home. He said his electric bills on average are $8 a month. While the average cost of solar equipment can be expensive, he said, the program helps bridge that gap so others can afford it. “Folks around the state are already having a hard time affording rising energy bills they’re having to make hard decisions. Are we going to pay to keep the lights on or pay for medicine or put food on the table?”",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15/SOLAR-PANEL-PROGRAM-FUNDING-10-PKG.transfer_frame_3057.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:06:34.719143

Get the Wind and Solar Discounts Before It's Too Late! - The New York Times,"Bill Ritter, Mike O’Boyle, www.nytimes.com, bill-ritter",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/opinion/clean-energy-tax-credits-discounts.html,"This is a limited time offer to deliver low-cost clean power.
New wind and solar energy projects can qualify for federal incentives if they start construction by Jul.
Jared Polis began directing state agencies on Aug. 1 to accelerate clean energy deployment by cutting red tape for administrative approval, expediting project permitting review and pursuing faster connection for solar energy projects.
In Minnesota, the state public utilities commission is pushing companies that provide electric service to move up construction start time for planned clean energy projects.
It is also considering its own tax incentives to make up for lost federal clean energy support.","When Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” it made a choice to destroy economic opportunities and create uncertainty for every American. The bill raises prices across the economy, cedes U.S. competitiveness to other countries, especially China, and harms the climate. This will prove to be one of the biggest policy mistakes in our nation’s history.

Tax credits for large clean energy projects are now set to abruptly end after 2027, while similar credits for smaller projects on households and businesses disappear at the end of 2025. The bill also guts federal programs that support innovative grid technologies.

Here’s what states need to do: buy renewables now while the discount is still available. And hurry. This is a limited time offer to deliver low-cost clean power.

New wind and solar energy projects can qualify for federal incentives if they start construction by Jul. 4, 2026, or complete construction before the end of 2027. That likely means contracts need to be signed by the end of 2025. The timeline is short, but the rewards will be significant: States can save 30 to 50 percent now compared to what those projects will cost after the credits expire.

Developer interest is strong, and companies have filed an abundance of requests with grid operators across the country to plug new wind, solar and battery projects into the power system. But connecting a new project currently takes anywhere from two to six years — too late to hit that narrow credit window. That means state governments must act — within the next couple of months.

The first priority should be helping wind and solar construction projects move faster. In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis began directing state agencies on Aug. 1 to accelerate clean energy deployment by cutting red tape for administrative approval, expediting project permitting review and pursuing faster connection for solar energy projects.

Maine’s public utility commission issued a call in July for accelerated renewable energy project development, with a two-week submission deadline. In Oregon, Portland General Electric plans to speed up the contract process for adding more renewable energy to the grid. In Minnesota, the state public utilities commission is pushing companies that provide electric service to move up construction start time for planned clean energy projects. It is also considering its own tax incentives to make up for lost federal clean energy support.

All states should follow suit if they want to avoid electricity rate increases. Energy Innovation, a think tank where one of us works, estimates that the destruction of the tax credits will add $70 billion to the nation’s utility bills over the next decade, but taking advantage of the credits before they expire will help to soften the blow.

Another thing states can do is focus on something called “surplus interconnection.” Rather than waiting for new grid infrastructure such as transmission lines and substations, wind and solar projects can achieve much faster approval if they can find existing power plants and share their grid interconnections. A University of California-Berkeley analysis found that building clean energy at power plants that burn fossil fuels could save money immediately and solve the timing problem.

Why would gas or coal power plants agree to this? Many coal-fired plants seldom run because they’re close to retirement or too expensive to operate. And many natural gas plants are designed to run only during peak hours, which means their grid connection goes unused about 90 percent of the time. Adding solar panels nearby is a way to increase the electricity supply at a lower cost, and use the poles and wires to get the cleaner electricity onto the grid.

All levels of government can help stimulate the market for these opportunities. For instance, California’s Legislature is already debating a bill that would direct state agencies to examine and integrate this approach. Passing the bill by September would empower those agencies and California’s grid operator, the California Independent System Operator, to accelerate clean energy purchases and save money.

Surplus interconnection could add enough solar and wind to meet California’s renewable energy targets for 2035, or power more than 60 large data centers. And if California becomes a model for this method of adding huge amounts of clean energy to its grid, other states could follow, to cut costs and keep the lights on.

Sure, it would be better if both political parties were working together to shield consumers from price spikes and to modernize our power grid, but if the federal government is picking winners and losers, state officials should ensure their communities are on the winning side.

For individuals and businesses who want to reap the clean energy and vehicle federal tax credits, there are still savings to be had, too, but the clock is ticking. Electric vehicle incentives are gone Sept. 30. Discounts for new heat pumps or rooftop solar disappear at the end of the year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/14/multimedia/14ritter-oboyle-tgjb/14ritter-oboyle-tgjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 07:00:44.591559

“I want to preserve the nuclear tax credit,” Graham said this week in Anderson.
I think the nuclear tax credit is good for the environment and good for the grid.
For nuclear energy, developers can still claim a 30% federal tax credit tax for investments through 2032.
Allred said opening more nuclear plants would mean more nuclear waste.","AIKEN — South Carolina’s senior senator is doubling down on his support for a potential reboot of a failed nuclear power plant expansion in the state.

“We don’t have enough power in this country already,” Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters in Aiken last week to cut the ribbon on a new, $66 million nuclear research center.

“Wake up call; America needs to get back into the nuclear business,” he continued. “We need to build nuclear power plants and get them up and operating.”

His stance has only strengthened since January, when Graham told SC Public Radio he was “open to trying to revitalize” the completion of partially built nuclear reactors in Fairfield County.

State-owned utility Santee Cooper and now-defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas were partners on the V.C. Summer expansion, which was a first-of-its-kind design and marked the first new nuclear construction in the country in 40 years. When the companies abandoned the effort in 2017 — after jointly spending $9 billion — Graham unsuccessfully sought federal help to keep it going during President Donald Trump’s first term.

$66M manufacturing and research center opens at USC Aiken

Last week, Graham pointed to the fraud and abuse that plagued the V.C. Summer project as the reason behind its failure.

The debacle left customers of Virginia-based Dominion Energy, which bought out SCE&G’s parent company SCANA in the aftermath, on the hook for more than $2 billion for reactors that never generated power.

Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion.

Unlike South Carolina, Georgia pushed forward with its own, nearly-identical reactor, finishing it seven years late and $17 billion over budget.

Then, in October 2024, members of a state nuclear advisory group started batting around the idea of restarting the project.

In late January, Santee Cooper put out a call for a potential buyer.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, speaking to reporters alongside Graham in Aiken last week, said he met with Gov. Henry McMaster in Washington, D.C., about the effort.

“These are plants that have got a lot of the construction already done — a lot of the engineering has already been done,” Wright said. “Can these be up and running faster and cheaper than starting from scratch? Absolutely. I think it’s a tremendous idea.”

Proponents have also pointed to revitalization efforts at other nuclear plants across the country.

A unit at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar nuclear plant came online in 2016, 43 years after construction began. The timeline included a 22-year gap: Work halted in 1985, then resumed in 2007.

And developers struck a deal last year to restart the remaining unit at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, where a second unit suffered its notorious partial meltdown in 1979, to power a Microsoft data center.

Santee Cooper announced in May it had received some 50 proposals.

Now, those applicants are partnering off and submitting joint bids for a second round of vetting. Utility officials expect to continue the bidding process at least through February and possibly until November 2026.

“My goal is to make sure they are up and operating. We cannot lose the nuclear energy race,” Graham said. “We’ve let this atrophy. We let the whole nuclear energy footprint kind of go into the dark. We’re going to finish these reactors. Too much money has been spent, and we need the power.”

Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

Graham took credit for negotiations that continued Biden administration tax incentives for nuclear construction.

The GOP megalaw signed by President Donald Trump last month ends tax credits for wind and solar projects years earlier than planned under Biden’s hallmark clean energy package of 2022. Under changes in the “big, beautiful” law, those projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify.

U.S. House Republicans sought to strip the credits for nuclear too. But senators, including Graham, insisted on keeping those incentives.

“I want to preserve the nuclear tax credit,” Graham said this week in Anderson. “They tried to eliminate it, do away with all the green energy. I think the nuclear tax credit is good for the environment and good for the grid. I’m hopeful by the end of the year we’ll have a new owner for those plants.”

Graham chairs the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, but he suggested the credits offer enough aid to get the project done, making taxpayer dollars through a budget earmark unnecessary.

“The tax credits make all the difference,” he said.

For nuclear energy, developers can still claim a 30% federal tax credit tax for investments through 2032. V.C. Summer would likely qualify for an additional 10% credit in the new law for “nuclear energy communities,” or sites with a history of employees in the nuclear sector.

As for the timetable, an executive order signed by Trump in May aims to speed up the licensing process.

Critics have raised concerns this could undermine safety measure. But Wright suggested safety will increase because regulators have fewer factors to consider.

“The regulations are so cumbersome and so bureaucratic, nothing gets built. And when you try to get people to focus on 200 things, you don’t get focus on anything,” he said.

‘The power is on in SC’ legislators proclaim in celebrating massive energy law

Wright and Graham also touted nuclear, which does not emit greenhouse gases, as a clean source of power.

Taylor Allred, of the Coastal Conservation League, said while it’s true nuclear does not pollute the air the way fossil fuels do, it comes with other environmental risks.

The state has already experienced radioactive waste leaks, both at the federal Savannah River Site near Aiken, and at Chem Nuclear in Barnwell County, a privately owned landfill for low-level radioactive waste. The landfill has been closed to most of the nation since 2008.

Allred said opening more nuclear plants would mean more nuclear waste.

“That raises some concerns that things could get missed, and there isn’t a lot of room for error when it comes to nuclear power and radioactive waste,” he told Fox 24 News in Charleston, in a clip shared by the Coastal Conservation League. “It would be potentially devastating to our communities to start having that accelerate.”

This federal initiative aims to demonstrate criticality in at least three test reactors before America’s 250th birthday on July 4, 2026. Oklo secured two projects while Atomic Alchemy obtained one, positioning the company at the heart of American nuclear strategy. These selections are part of an accelerated modernization context for the nuclear sector, made possible by executive orders signed in May 2025.

Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo, was present in the Oval Office of the White House during the signing of these orders by President Donald Trump, alongside Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Scott Nolan, CEO of General Matter. This presence underscores the strategic importance given to advanced nuclear actors in American energy policy. The program aims to accelerate deployment timelines while providing essential operational data to support long-term commercial licensing.

Strategic collaboration with Lightbridge Corporation

Parallel to these government selections, Oklo announced on August 11, 2025, a collaboration with Lightbridge Corporation (NASDAQ: LTBR) to explore the co-location of a fuel fabrication facility. This initiative is part of a memorandum of understanding signed earlier this year. Both companies are jointly assessing the feasibility of commercial-scale fuel fabrication within Oklo’s planned advanced fuel manufacturing infrastructure. The objective is to accelerate the commercialization of advanced nuclear fuels through joint fabrication and research and development activities.

The proposed co-located facility would support the production of advanced fuels for both fast reactors and light water reactors. This collaboration reinforces both companies’ commitment to U.S. leadership in advanced nuclear fuel manufacturing and recycling. Seth Grae, President and CEO of Lightbridge Corporation, emphasized that this joint effort reflects a shared vision for a modern nuclear fuel cycle, supporting both existing and advanced reactors while strengthening America’s energy resilience.

Financial results and development perspectives

Oklo published its second quarter 2025 financial results on August 11, accompanied by an updated investor presentation available on its investor relations website. The company held a conference call the same day with Jacob DeWitte and Craig Bealmear, Chief Financial Officer, to discuss these results. The company is currently developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale, while establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes.

The company was the first to receive a site use permit from the DOE for a commercial advanced fission plant. It also obtained fuel from Idaho National Laboratory and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the DOE and national laboratories, including for manufacturing fuel using repurposed plutonium from legacy materials, in accordance with May 2025 executive directives calling for the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to process surplus plutonium.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/en_114014082025540-1.webp,N,,2025-08-15 11:04:50.877404

To optimise fuel consumption and reduce air pollution, the ferry can operate in three modes: zero-emissions, battery-only power, and battery-assisted hybrid with diesel backup.
The arrival of Harbor Charger coincides with the 20-year anniversary of Governors Island opening to the public.
The hybrid-electric ferry will replace diesel-powered Lt. Samuel S. Coursen – the Trust’s current vehicle and passenger ferry that was commissioned by the US Army in 1956 and has been in continuous use ever since.","Harbor Charger, a first-of-a-kind diesel-electric hybrid vehicle ferry in New York State, made its maiden voyage on 12 August, embarking on its first trip between lower Manhattan and Governors Island in New York Harbor.

“Harbor Charger joining our fleet of passenger ferries is a momentous day for the Trust and for the thousands of visitors who enjoy what Governors Island has to offer every single day,” said Trust for Governors Island, president and chief executive, Clare Newman. “We are excited to provide a cleaner, greener mode of transportation to the island for the nearly one million individuals that travel here each year.”

Designed by Seattle naval architectural firm Elliott Bay Design Group, the 1,200-passenger, 30-vehicle ferry was built by Conrad Shipyards, Morgan City, Louisiana. To lower CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions, the US$33M vessel is equipped with diesel-electric hybrid propulsion technology supplied by Siemens Energy. The technology includes Siemens BlueDrive Eco diesel-electric propulsion system, BlueVault advanced battery-based solution, and EcoMAIN. To optimise fuel consumption and reduce air pollution, the ferry can operate in three modes: zero-emissions, battery-only power, and battery-assisted hybrid with diesel backup.

Initially, the ferry will use the diesel to charge its battery. In battery-assisted hybrid mode, the Trust projects it can reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 600 tonnes annually. Once shoreside charging facilities are installed, the vessel will be capable of full electric operation, reducing emissions by an additional 800 tonnes annually. A US$7.5M grant was received from the US Federal Transit Administration to support the shoreside rapid charging infrastructure, which is currently in the design phase.

The arrival of Harbor Charger coincides with the 20-year anniversary of Governors Island opening to the public. Just 10 minutes by ferry from the Battery in lower Manhattan, the island is home to historic Fort Jay and Castle Williams, as well as numerous bike paths, food and drink vendors, art exhibits and music events.

California has for years led the nation in adopting stringent fuel economy standards, setting aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets and enforcing strict environmental regulations.

In California, survey data shows that demand for gasoline has dropped by roughly 15 percent since 2017.
Their bottom line,” he said of oil companies, which have seen record profits in recent years.","Within the past year, two major California oil refineries have announced plans to shutter — moves that will pull about one quarter of a million barrels from the state’s daily supply of gasoline. For a state that has been a standard-bearer in the push to get off fossil fuels, this might seem like a win. Instead, it’s caught political leaders off guard, unprepared, and scrambling to keep open the very facilities they once villainized.

The Phillips 66 refinery south of Los Angeles is slated to close by the end of this year, an announcement the company made last fall, two days after Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation giving the state more authority to regulate such operations. This spring, Valero said it will close its Bay Area facility in 2026, citing in part a record $82 million fine for air pollution that was more than 360 times the legal limit.

Valero did not respond to a request for comment. Phillips 66 spokesperson Al Ortiz told Grist, “Our focus right now is on safely idling our facilities. We are proud of the work we have done and continue to do with the state to ensure we will be able to meet future market demand.”

Between the two closures, California is slated to lose 17 percent of its refining capacity, which could cause gas prices to surge past the already nation-leading price of $4.50 per gallon. It’s unclear what the closures might mean for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as the state will likely import gasoline to cover a portion of the shortfall and people tend not to drastically decrease consumption even when prices go up.

Lawmakers don’t appear to have planned for this scenario.

“The state is largely without a system-wide transition plan,” Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who represents portions of Orange County in the state assembly, said at a recent hearing. Creating such a roadmap, she noted, “is one of the most complicated, and I believe important, challenges that policymakers will need to face in the decade ahead.”

Without a plan in place, environmental advocates worry the state will shove aside its progress combating climate change to keep gasoline flowing. California has for years led the nation in adopting stringent fuel economy standards, setting aggressive greenhouse gas reduction targets and enforcing strict environmental regulations. But, in their attempts to keep the refineries online, even Democrats are proposing measures such as fast-tracking drilling permits and pausing a profit cap on refineries, a step the state took in 2023 to control gas prices and combat price gouging.

“What we’re seeing right now from lawmakers in California is an attempt to appease Big Oil,” said Faraz Rizvi, policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, an environmental justice organization. “The crisis of affordability in California and the results of the last election have really shaken California Democrats and they are really embracing a drill-baby-drill approach.”

Rizvi pointed out that, while oil companies have done a good job pinning blame for the closures on California regulations, market forces were already pushing in that direction. The consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that nearly a quarter of all oil refineries worldwide are set to go dormant by 2035. One recently began shutting down in Texas, which is among the most favorable business environments for fossil fuel companies. In California, survey data shows that demand for gasoline has dropped by roughly 15 percent since 2017. Ortiz nodded toward those trends when he told Grist in an email, “Phillips 66 announced the idling of its Los Angeles-area refinery as part of its focus on the long-term value of its asset portfolio.”

Rizvi was much more direct. “This is all about their profit margin. Their bottom line,” he said of oil companies, which have seen record profits in recent years. “They had the opportunity to hold California consumers hostage and they took it.”

Proponents of a fuel-agnostic free market disagree, saying that policymakers’ attempts to pressure oil and gas companies amounted to the state putting its thumb on the scale and contributed to the current crunch. “All of these politically creative costs make it more and more difficult to operate,” said Wayne Winegarden, who oversees environmental work at the libertarian Pacific Research Institute. “We as Californians have gone a little bit too far by not accounting for the costs we’re imposing by accelerating a transition that it is clear we’re not ready for,” he said. “We put ourselves in this very difficult situation.”

Despite a split on why the refineries decided to shut down, all sides generally agree that the state wasn’t ready for the moves. Rizvi said that this “middle” phase of an energy transition can be especially difficult to navigate as older technologies sunset and newer ones come on line. “California should have recognized that we are in a perilous moment,” he said.

While California leads the country in electric vehicle adoption, such cars still account for less than a quarter of all vehicles sold statewide. Federal EV tax credits are set to end this fall, and President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to freeze funding for charging station infrastructure (though recently reopened it). “You’re trying to force people into using technology that isn’t ready to take on that burden,” said Winegarden.

Exactly how California gets out of this conundrum is up for debate. Winegarden said that it’s important to be open to the role that all fuels, including oil, can play in the state’s energy future. Rizvi sees this as an opportunity to bolster investments in alternatives to fossil fuels and commit to a green transition.

Regardless, they said, lawmakers need to chart a course — and quickly. “A piecemeal approach to the transition is not the answer,” Petrie-Norris said at the hearing. “We need a real plan.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/California-refineries-closing-phillips-66-valero-gasoline-climate.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-08-15 06:00:24.593899

President Donald Trump’s crusade against wind energy is intensifying — and it could come with some serious costs.

As much as $317 billion in lost investment, to be exact, per new analysis from research firm Cleanview. That figure is based on the 790 projects totaling 213 gigawatts that developers plan to build in the years to come — all of which are at risk of delay or even cancellation under the administration’s policies.

To be clear, those figures represent the high end of what’s at stake — they’re based on what’s currently in the interconnection queue, and projects drop out of that process all the time for various reasons.

But if even a fraction of that investment is canceled or delayed, it will be painful for the regions that miss out on the tax revenue and jobs, with Texas, Illinois, and New Jersey standing to lose the most.

It would also be bad timing: Electricity demand is on the rise nationwide, largely due to the boom in AI data center construction. Delaying or blocking the buildout of gigawatts worth of wind projects when the U.S. is in the midst of an energy-supply crunch would drive up already-climbing power bills. Wind produced just over 10% of U.S. electricity last year.

And, of course, any slowdown in the construction of clean energy is a setback for efforts to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels, a task that grows more urgent with the passage of every hot summer day.

Trump entered office in January with promises that not a single new ​“windmill” would be constructed during his second term. Though he’s not managed to carry out that vision in its most literal sense, he has certainly operated with its spirit in mind.

On his first day, he issued an executive order calling for an end to offshore wind leasing and a review of leases and permits for all wind projects. In the spring, Trump tried — and ultimately failed — to quash the Empire Wind offshore installation that had just begun construction near New York’s coast. After GOP lawmakers rammed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act through Congress, Trump signed the megalaw on July 4, mandating the swift phaseout of tax credits for wind (and solar) projects.

In recent weeks, his administration has stepped up its attacks even further and undertaken an all-out blitz on wind power, issuing a barrage of far-reaching orders that, at least in theory, could jeopardize every wind project underway in the country.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/COTW-EU-solar-1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=3f3c579d690402e1aeafdfade2271469,N,,2025-08-15 07:00:53.227850

Unlike the tobacco cases, climate suits have struggled in court, even in traditionally progressive jurisdictions.
However, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to intervene in the latest round of suits on procedural grounds.
In January, it declined to review a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling in Honolulu’s case.
Although the suit claims it does not seek to regulate fossil fuels, its language mirrors city and state climate complaints.","Add Charleston to the string of courtroom defeats for climate-change litigation targeting major energy producers, a legal trend likely to continue until the U.S. Supreme Court steps in.

Critics see it as an attempt to achieve, through the courts, what climate activists have been unable to get through legislatures — often with the aim of securing large settlements or policy changes.

The wave of lawsuits began in 2018 when Rhode Island sued BP, Chevron, Citgo, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Marathon Oil and Shell under its state climate laws. Soon after, seven other states and more than a dozen cities and counties filed similar claims.

The lawsuits began under Democratic-led governments, backed by environmental groups, and accuse oil companies of misleading the public about the effects of fossil fuels. Plaintiffs are seeking multibillion-dollar settlements modeled after the landmark 1990s Big Tobacco agreement, in which cigarette makers paid billions over deceptive health claims.

Unlike the tobacco cases, climate suits have struggled in court, even in traditionally progressive jurisdictions. Judges have dismissed cases in California, New York, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

In early August, a South Carolina judge threw out Charleston’s lawsuit with prejudice, blocking it from being refiled. The city may appeal.

“These lawsuits promise to create a chaotic web of conflicting legal obligations for Defendants as each state and municipality (sometimes within the very same state) imposes its own de facto regulations on the worldwide production, marketing, transport, and sale of fossil fuels. Neither federal nor South Carolina law permits such a result,” S.C. Circuit Judge Roger Young wrote.

And, Young added, there doesn’t appear to be a limiting principle for these lawsuits.

“As with the list of plaintiffs, the list of potential defendants thus appears boundless. In fact, in this very case, Plaintiff has sued — alongside large energy companies, retailers and a pipeline — two small, family-owned South Carolina businesses.”

Energy companies have long argued such cases belong in federal court, citing the 1963 Clean Air Act. “States and municipalities cannot pursue climate change litigation under state laws, because such claims are precluded and preempted by federal law under clear U.S. Supreme Court precedent,” said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., counsel for Chevron.

The high court has previously agreed. In American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (2011), the court unanimously ruled that the Clean Air Act took precedence over state nuisance claims regarding greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to intervene in the latest round of suits on procedural grounds. In January, it declined to review a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling in Honolulu’s case. Two months later, it rejected a bid by Republican-led states to sue Democratic-led states for alleged interference with state sovereignty.

Meanwhile, the lawsuits get more aggressive — some say desperate.

In Washington state, a lawsuit was filed in May over the 2021 heat-related death of Juliana Leon. According to documents filed with the court, Leon, a 65-year-old bariatric surgery patient, died after leaving her doctor’s office in Seattle during a 102-degree day. With no air conditioning in her car, she rolled down the windows for the 100-mile drive home. Hours later, she was found dead in a neighborhood.

Attorneys for her family allege fossil-fuel-driven climate change caused the extreme heat that led to her death and are seeking damages for her suffering before she died.

Although the suit claims it does not seek to regulate fossil fuels, its language mirrors city and state climate complaints.

“With all these cases all over the country, it would have been very helpful for the Supreme Court to at least lay down the standards and the rules of the road for how these cases should be looked at,” said Philip S. Goldberg, special counsel to the Manufacturers Accountability Project, at a webinar hosted by the Washington Legal Foundation last spring.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/46/946c43aa-d931-4a5c-9008-5830852a4180/64ad64b6a8a43.image.jpg?crop=956%2C502%2C0%2C146,N,,2025-08-15 08:01:00.971392

In May, a last-minute order from the U.S. Department of Energy forced Michigan's Consumers Energy to cancel its planned retirement of an aging coal-burning plant, and the Trump administration has signaled it may stop other coal burning plants in the U.S. from shutting down as well.

Consumers has already planned to replace the J.H. Campbell coal plant in West Michigan with a less polluting and less costly natural gas facility. The Trump administration ordered the utility to keep the coal plant operating for 90 days.

Michael Lenoff is a Senior Attorney with Earthjustice, one of the environmental groups that commissioned the Grid Strategies report.

He said grid operators across the country have been meeting higher demand for electricity largely by adding more solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas to the grid, while simultaneously allowing the retirements of old, polluting coal-burning units.

""We don't need DOE blundering in to prop up old, dirty, expensive and unneeded power plants to advance an ideological agenda,"" Lenoff said.

Lenoff said the burning of coal for electricity causes thousands of premature deaths every year. In West Michigan, he said, the Campbell plant caused multiple premature deaths annually, dumped heated water and toxic chemicals into Lake Michigan, and added to coal ash deposits near private drinking water wells.

The U.S. Department of Energy did not respond to Michigan Public's request for a response to the Grid Strategies report, but its May 23rd order to keep the Campbell plant open claimed there was an energy emergency.

The order ends on August 21. Consumers Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission said they had not heard anything from the Department of Energy about whether the order will be allowed to expire, and the plant to shut down.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/496c036/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2Fe2%2F791153484d4abdbc524310e51ef1%2Fcampbell.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 09:00:34.862752

The property at 1223 West Saginaw Road was home to the Halfway Truck Stop, which included a gas station, repair shop and restaurant. The redevelopment also includes 1211 West Saginaw which was used for warehousing, a gravel supply company, and a construction company. The 1.9-acre site has been vacant since 2022.

Environmental assessments found metals and petroleum compounds in the soil. Multiple petroleum releases have been reported from the eight underground storage tanks (UST) removed from the site in 1998. The EGLE brownfield grant will be used for the following work:

Additional site investigations and sampling

Excavation and disposal of contaminated soil

The port opened in 1940 and expanded operations over time. It is currently lacking infrastructure needed to handle international containerized cargo.

The current $16 million redevelopment plan calls for three major improvements:

Construction of a second wharf to handle and inspect larger international cargo under U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection policies.

Construction of a readiness slip for the port’s tugboat and for emergency boats used by the U.S. Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and the city of Monroe.

Improvements to the turning basin, a large area where freighters can turn around and where the port receives liquid asphalt.

The second wharf and the turning basin improvements will require dredging, which is where the EGLE grant comes into play. Sediment is contaminated with metals left over from more than 100 years of heavy industrial activity along the River Raisin. Grant money will be used to help cover the cost of properly transporting and disposing of contaminated sediment.

Additional project funding is coming from the U.S. Department of Transportation, the State of Michigan, and the Monroe County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority. The improvements will make the Port of Monroe the first maritime container terminal in Michigan. A study of the previous improvement project completed at the port in 2017 found that it spurred more than $6 million in economic activity in the first year and the creation of more than 700 jobs. The port’s owner believes the new project’s impact will meet or exceed that of the 2017 work. Grant-funded work is expected to be finished by the fall of 2026.

Trucking orgs call for delay of EPA's heavy-duty NOx rule

The American Trucking Associations, National Tank Truck Carriers, Truckload Carriers Association and 49 state trucking associations penned a letter Wednesday to the Environmental Protection Agency calling for a delay in the implementation of EPA's heavy-duty NOx rule until 2031.

The rule is currently set to take effect with the 2027 model year. It tightens NOx limits from the stacks to a level more than 80% below the current standard and reduces the particulate matter limit by 50%. The agency also will require that OEMs extend warranties to 450,000 miles from 100,000 and useful-life limits to 650,000 miles from 435,000 miles.

The organizations cited substantial added costs amid already-existing economic and operational pressures facing the trucking industry.

[Related: Trucking groups slam 'challenging' new EPA rule that slashes truck emissions limits]

""As finalized, the heavy-duty NOx rule imposes substantial compliance costs and operational burdens at a time when the trucking industry is already contending with historically difficult market conditions,"" the letter said. ""With prolonged weakness in freight demand and inflationary cost pressures, the rule’s 2027 implementation timeline threatens to intensify strain across our industry.""

In addition to calling for a delay of the rule, the trucking groups also urged EPA ""to conduct a full reconsideration of current heavy-duty NOx standards, allowing for a comprehensive review and public comment on key provisions, including NOx stringency levels, warranty obligations, useful life requirements, and associated technical elements. EPA would need to finalize this review and rulemaking process by the end of 2026 to provide engine manufacturers with the requisite lead time for implementation in 2031.""

The letter comes just weeks after the EPA announced it will revoke the Endangerment Finding that has allowed presidential administrations to regulate greenhouse gases since 2009, and with that, roll back the Greenhouse Gas Phase 3 rule set to take effect in 2027. Just this week, EPA announced new guidance around derating procedures after faults in SCR emissions systems, too, complicating both in-place and upcoming emissions standards for truck makers.

Load One receives ‘Spirit of Giving’ award from Wreaths Across America

Wreaths Across America (WAA) this month recognized Load One Transportation & Logistics, headquartered in Detroit, as the ninth recipient of the organization’s James Prout Spirit of Giving Award. As a member of the WAA Honor Fleet, Load One has been helping move the organization’s mission since 2010.

The James Prout Spirit of Giving Award is named in memory of James Prout, owner of Blue Bird Ranch Trucking of Jonesboro, Maine. Prout was the first person to volunteer to haul wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery when the program was in its infancy. The award is given semi-annually to a deserving professional truck driver, transportation company or organization that has supported charitable causes in a way that will affect generations to come.

“Load One has been an incredible partner in helping us fulfill our mission. When other companies or owner-operators can’t take a load, they step up, often at the last minute, to ensure every wreath is delivered,” said Courtney George, WAA Director of Transportation & Industry Relations. “They generously block out their broker fees, so we receive services at a discount, and they go the extra mile to make sure every ceremonial wreath is included in the Escort to Arlington.”

George noted that Load One took five loads of wreaths in the 2024 Wreaths Across America effort, “an impressive commitment for an expedite carrier with most of their trucks being sprinter vans and straight trucks,” she said.

“It is incredibly meaningful to be selected for the James Prout Spirit of Giving Award by Wreaths Across America,” said John Elliott, Executive Chairman, Load One. “I have long said, hauling veterans’ wreaths is easily the most sacred cargo we have the honor of delivering each year. I am proud of our team, who step up to volunteer their time, and as a veteran myself, I am honored to play a part in this important mission.”

The trucking industry is vital in helping WAA move the mission to more than 5,000 participating locations across the country. National Wreaths Across America Day will be held this year on Saturday, December 13, 2025. It is a free event open to all.

Trucker’s quick action to help following truck rollover earns recognition

David Cyr of Glen St. Mary, Florida, a truck driver for ABF Freight, has been named a Highway Angel by the Truckload Carriers Association for his quick thinking and courageous actions that helped save a fellow truck driver following a rollover accident in Jacksonville.

On July 7 around noon, Cyr was driving down Phoenix Avenue in Jacksonville when he witnessed a tractor-trailer flip on a curve. Acting instinctively, Cyr and another driver stopped immediately and rushed to the scene.

“We were running down the side of the trailer and the wheels were still spinning -- that’s how quickly we got there,” Cyr recalled. “It was like 15 seconds after the truck flipped.”

With the cab crushed and the driver trapped inside, Cyr quickly assessed the situation. He checked for any signs of leaking fluids or potential fire hazards before jumping down the embankment beside the guardrail to reach the cab. Inside, the driver -- standing on the passenger-side window amid scattered debris -- was clearly shaken.

Despite a language barrier, Cyr was able to help the driver out of the wreckage and bring him to safety before calling 911. The driver appeared unharmed but understandably rattled by the experience.

“You gotta help people out,” said Cyr, a 30-year trucking veteran. “It’s the human thing to do.”",https://img.overdriveonline.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/08/truck-exhaust-stack-emissions-adobestock-137722846.USqCI1f0Qj.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-08-15 12:07:52.641964

EPA’s decision to grant a grace period to make repairs or refill DEF is the right thing to do.
While well intended to reduce emissions, DEF systems have brought significant repair costs and untimely delays during planting and harvesting.
This common-sense fix for DEF systems means more productivity in the field and less worry about unexpected breakdowns.
Thank you EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of farmers, truckers, and equipment operators and taking action to fix diesel exhaust fluid system issues.","On Tuesday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency is issuing manufacturer guidance to address widespread concerns from truckers, farmers, and other diesel vehicle operators about power loss and other issues caused by selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems that use diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). Specifically, EPA is urging engine and equipment manufacturers to provide solutions for diesel trucks and equipment already in use which continue to suffer from unresolved performance failures.

Here’s what people are saying:

U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins: “This announcement today is such a big deal, especially on behalf of our farmers and ranchers. At a time when our ag sector is really hurting, our farmers have had to endure a 30% cost increase in inputs, and a $30 billion Biden-era trade deficit, these everyday regulations being lifted makes such a difference.”

U.S. Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler: “Administrator Zeldin’s new guidance on diesel exhaust mandates will save family farmers an estimated $727 million per year. The Trump Administration is fighting to roll back Green New Scam regulations that have crushed small businesses across America’s heartland.”

Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA): “The previous arbitrary diesel exhaust fluid system guidelines severely hurt farmers, truckers, and small businesses that rely on diesel powered trucks. Today we are taking another important step forward by undoing these diesel fluid guidelines that have hurt our farmers and small rural businesses. Not only will these new guidelines save family-run farms hundreds of millions of dollars per year, but it is also just common sense, folks. No farmer should have their tractor come to a halt in the middle of a field due to Green New Deal-style regulations from Washington.”

Representative Mike Collins (R-GA-10): “Great work from Administrator Loeffler and Administrator Zeldin rolling back the Green New Scam.”

Oklahoma Secretary of Agriculture Blayne Arthur: “Thank you to Administrator Zeldin and EPA for listening to American farmers and ranchers and taking action to provide common sense relief from overburdensome regulation that impacts agriculture production and public safety. Seeing the Trump Administration take a tailgate conversation in rural Oklahoma about real issues impacting rural communities and promptly implement change is sincerely appreciated and an encouraging example of responsive leadership.”

Indiana Representative Michelle Davis (R-Whiteland): “After my son experienced a dangerous DEF system-related incident on the interstate, I knew something needed to change. I’m grateful to the leadership of the EPA and Trump Administration for taking the time to listen to our concerns and work toward a commonsense solution. They took the time to hear from myself and my son, Nick Davis, owner and operator of Freedom Dumpsters LLC.”

American Bus Association President and CEO Fred Ferguson: “We thank the EPA for taking action to make the derate schedule fix permanent. This change means a safer and more efficient experience for passengers, ensuring they reach their destinations without unexpected disruptions or breakdowns. After years of data collection, public comment, industry coordination, and direct engagement, we’re pleased with the Trump Administration’s meaningful regulatory improvement that prioritizes both efficiencies and operational reality. Thank you for listening to substantive and meaningful input from industry and taking action.”

American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall: “Farm Bureau thanks the EPA and Administrator Zeldin for their common-sense approach to heavy trucks and off-road equipment that use Diesel Exhaust Fluid. When a vehicle runs out of DEF or there is an error in the software, it loses power, causing delays that could be the difference between getting a crop harvested or animals to their destination. EPA’s decision to grant a grace period to make repairs or refill DEF is the right thing to do. It keeps commerce moving and farmers in the field.”

American Trucking Association Vice President of Energy and Environmental Affairs Patrick Kelly: “Trucking fleets across the country applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin for responding to the concerns of our industry and providing common-sense solutions that reflect the complexities and realities of trucking. EPA’s new guidance will avoid unnecessary towing costs and equipment downtime while preserving the full environmental benefits that Selective Catalytic Reduction systems provide.”

America First Policy Institute Energy & Environment Vice Chair Oliver McPherson-Smith: “The administration’s policy of energy dominance means letting Americans use the machines that keep the country running without needless breakdowns. This commonsense solution puts control back in the hands of operators and keeps equipment working. It helps transportation and energy do what they do best: create jobs and opportunity.”

America First Rural Policy Institute Vice Chair Ambassador Kip Tom: “When a tractor dies in the middle of planting or harvest, it’s not just an inconvenience—it can ruin a season’s work. By stopping sudden engine slowdowns, the EPA is helping the 1.9 million family farms that feed America, saving an estimated $727 million a year and keeping our producers on time, in the field, and on the road.”

Cummins External Communications Director Melinda Koski: “Together, we aim to provide regulatory certainty, greater flexibility, and the dependable solutions that contribute to the American economy.”

Engine Technology Forum Executive Director Allen Schaeffer: “EPA has heard from users of diesel trucks, tractors, and equipment and, working with manufacturers, has responded with these adjustments to improve operational performance while ensuring emissions integrity. . . EPA’s announcement today provides new guidance that allows manufacturers to adjust these systems to ensure that farmers, motor coach operators, and truckers who all rely on diesel engines and equipment will be able to complete critical work with sufficient lead time for scheduling maintenance and repairs.”

Freedom Dumpsters LLC Owner/Operator Nick Davis: “The EPA team listened to my concern and came to a solution quickly and efficiently. This update will make our highways safer and help small business owners like myself to continue to provide quality service to our customers”

Georgia Farm Bureau President Tom McCall: “American farmers are often bound by uncontrollable factors like weather and global market conditions. When conditions are right, it is critical that we have reliable equipment to plant seeds and harvest our crop. Our farmers have been disadvantaged by excessive regulations compared to our international competitors and the burden of additional inputs and derate issues when those systems fail. I applaud the EPA for this announcement, their attention to restoring reason in regulations on equipment only used for a portion of the year, and prioritizing the production of a safe, reliable food supply.”

Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association Executive Director Rasto Brezny: “Clean technology suppliers applaud Administrator Zeldin and EPA staff for listening to the concerns of end users and working with industry to develop a commonsense engine derate stringency that balances the needs of owner/operators with continued engine and emission control performance. SCR systems have been integral parts to trucks in the US and around the globe since 2010.”

Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation (MFBF) President Mike McCormick: “MFBF applauds the EPA in making these key changes to the regulations that govern diesel exhaust fluid systems. While well intended to reduce emissions, DEF systems have brought significant repair costs and untimely delays during planting and harvesting. This is a huge win for Mississippi farmers and ranchers.”

Missouri Farm Bureau President Garrett Hawkins: “Missouri Farm Bureau appreciates the Environmental Protection Agency and Administrator Lee Zeldin for taking this common-sense step to reduce government overreach that disrupts agriculture with its revisions to the Diesel Exhaust Fluid guidelines. Our members have spoken loud and clear: power losses in equipment due to DEF issues significantly disrupt farming operations. This is just the latest example of an administration that’s listening to our members and showing it has the backs of America’s farmers.”

National Cotton Ginners Association and National Cotton Council Chairman Patrick Johnson: “We appreciate the EPA and the entire administration for addressing the issues of and providing support to small businesses and farmers. This common-sense fix for DEF systems means more productivity in the field and less worry about unexpected breakdowns. The actions taken by EPA to protect diesel equipment operators from sudden speed and power losses caused by DEF systems will certainly benefit the cotton industry.”

National Sorghum Producers: “Big win for America’s farmers and truckers! Thank you EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for listening to the concerns of farmers, truckers, and equipment operators and taking action to fix diesel exhaust fluid system issues. This new guidance will keep tractors, trucks, and other diesel-powered equipment running when it matters most-without compromising environmental standards-and is expected to save family farms an estimated $727 million each year. Your leadership makes a real difference in the field.”

Oklahoma Cattlemen’s Association (OCA) Executive Vice President Michael Kelsey: “OCA applauds the Trump Administration’s EPA for listening, recognizing, and acting upon the issues surrounding DEF. Cattle Producers should not be hamstrung by onerous issues when transporting their livestock or supplies. Thank you, EPA, for his common-sense step in the right direction.”

Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) President Todd Spencer: “OOIDA and the 150,000 small-business truckers we represent thank Administrator Zeldin for listening to the men and women behind the wheel who keep America’s economy moving. EPA’s guidance establishes more commonsense inducement schedules that will help drivers maintain safe control of their vehicles as they diagnose and remedy faulty DEF/SCR systems. More flexible inducement speeds and times will help truckers finish their trips, plan for necessary maintenance, and avoid parking their truck for an extended period simply because of a false alarm. Nonsensical inducement rules have sidelined small-business truckers for too long and this accelerated relief shows what can be achieved when regulators hear directly from the people doing the job. We look forward to continued engagement with [Administrator] Zeldin and his staff to implement additional emissions solutions that better reflect the realities of trucking.”

Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) Executive Vice President Timothy Blubaugh: “EMA and its member companies welcome the new guidance and are preparing to implement it as quickly as possible. The new guidance is evidence of EPA’s willingness to engage with stakeholders to understand the complexities of industry. We look forward to continued collaboration with EPA and other industry stakeholders to find workable solutions to ensure heavy-duty diesel engines continue to provide clean and efficient power for trucking, agriculture, and other crucial industries.”

Truck Renting & Leasing Association (TRALA) President and CEO Jake Jacoby: “TRALA commends the EPA for listening to trucking industry concerns by issuing today’s revised SCR inducement guidance. This new guidance will not only continue to discourage modifications or tampering with SCR aftertreatment systems but will also afford more time at higher speeds during derate periods to ensure the delivery of freight and the safety of drivers as they return their vehicles to maintenance facilities for inspection and service.”

United Motorcoach Association President and CEO Scott Michael: “The United Motorcoach Association applauds the new guidance from the Environmental Protection Agency under the leadership of Administrator Lee Zeldin regarding Diesel Exhaust Fluid regulations for motorcoaches. EPA’s new guidance will improve safety, avoid passengers stranded on the side of the road, and unnecessary towing costs while maintaining the goal of safeguarding the environment.”

Vandalia Bus Lines Operations Manager Phil Streif: “They came out early, promising a goal to reduce regulation and the red tape that makes our businesses more challenging to operate. After many exchanges, we made great progress, and now we’re finally at the finish line… [This is] a game changer… There are so many things that run through your head when you see an inducement code and know you have four hours before the bus is essentially inoperable.

The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" and executive order haven't given homeowners much time to install solar panels to reap the benefits.
Solar panels are also better for the environment.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar panels don't produce polluting gases like dirty energy sources do.
Getting your solar installation started by the end of the year could save you thousands of dollars.","While many Americans want to benefit from the savings from solar power, the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" has put a time crunch on things that's having a rippling effect.

According to EnergySage, an expert in the rooftop solar industry, ""the 30% residential solar tax credit ends completely after December 31, 2025."" Commercial projects also have to be in service by the end of 2027, if construction starts after June 2026, to qualify for the tax credit.

What's happening?

There is a workaround for companies called safe harboring, allowing ""commercial developers to lock in current tax credit rates by either breaking ground on projects or investing at least 5% of project costs in equipment,"" per EnergySage.

Companies are now stockpiling various components, including panels and inverters, that are available for residential installers. The current administration also signed an executive order restricting safe harboring. An unspecified amount of the project has to be built to get the tax credit, and the Secretary of the Treasury has until mid-August to decide how much.

It's causing panic buying at a time when residents have until the end of the year to install their solar panels to earn the tax credit.

Per EnergySage, BayWa r.e. VP said, ""It's legitimately fear-inducing. We should not be leveraging incentives to create a problem for ourselves that prevents us from deploying solar.""

Why are solar panels important?

The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" and executive order haven't given homeowners much time to install solar panels to reap the benefits. Investing in solar can help you save $1,500 a year on your energy bills. Until the end of 2025, you can still get tax credits with the Inflation Reduction Act.

Solar panels are also better for the environment. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar panels don't produce polluting gases like dirty energy sources do. They also help lessen society's reliance on dirty energy sources.

The gases warm the planet and contribute to the increase in extreme weather events.

What's being done about access to solar panel installation?

EnergySage offers a simple and free tool you can use to search for providers in your area and compare prices. The energy company can even help you save up to $10,000 on installation.

Additionally, EnergySage provides a mapping tool to show you how much solar panels and installation cost state-by-state, and what incentives are available for each state. More states are even creating state incentives for solar, including Minnesota.

Since Congress has eliminated the Investment Tax Credit by the end of this year, it's important to act fast to cash in on incentives and claim the 30% tax credit.

Fluence signed close to $508.8 million in new orders in Q3 that expanded its backlog as of June 30, 2025, to approximately $4.9 billion.
Fluence is now working with its domestic suppliers to ensure they achieve compliance with the OBBBA by the end of 2025.","Fluence Energy, a Siemens and AES-backed energy storage company, posted Q3 2025 (period ending June 30, 2025) revenues of $602.7 million, about $100 million below expectations due to a slower US facility ramp-up. Despite this, its profitability improved, and liquidity totaled $903 million.

Fluence has 6 production facilities in the US, namely battery cell manufacturing in Tennessee, module manufacturing in Utah, enclosure and DCPM factory in Arizona, Chiller / HVAC manufacturing in Houston, inverter fab in South Carolina, and communication equipment in Georgia. It expects the company’s Utah-produced battery modules to qualify for Section 45X tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) at $10/kWh.

It is specifically experiencing a slower ramp-up at the enclosure fab in Arizona, due to which it has now pushed some of its anticipated revenue for FY 2025 to the next year. It now sees its US factories reach the targeted capacity by the end of the calendar year 2025.

While Fluence has reaffirmed its FY2025 revenue guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, it now expects to achieve the guidance at the lower end, compared to the midpoint of $2.7 billion that the management forecast a quarter back. In FY 2024, it reported $2.69 billion in revenues. Adjusted EBITDA for FY2025 is guided within $0 million to $20 million at the midpoint $10 million.

Nevertheless, the energy storage expanded its annual revenues by around 24.7%, with an adjusted EBITDA of approximately $27.4 million that expanded from $15.6 million in Q3 2024. Fluence also expanded its net income during the reporting quarter to close to $6.9 million, vis-à-vis $1.1 million in the same quarter last year.

Fluence signed close to $508.8 million in new orders in Q3 that expanded its backlog as of June 30, 2025, to approximately $4.9 billion. Additionally, in July and August this year, it also signed $1.1 billion worth of contracts, including 2 in Australia. Its utility scale pipeline expanded from $22 billion to $23.5 billion with 47% in the Americas.

“We believe the fundamentals of our business remain incredibly strong, supported by a robust backlog, of which we expect approximately $2.5 billion to convert to revenue in fiscal 2026, including contracts signed in July and August to date,” said Fluence Energy CEO Julian Nebreda.

He also sees the long-term Investment Tax Credit (ITC) security for storage through 2034 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) as supporting its strategy. It also creates limited Chinese competition in the US through the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions for a 30% base ITC, while an extra 10% ITC credit is available for meeting domestic content targets.

At present, the US Department of Commerce (DOC) has issued preliminary 113.4% combined duties on certain China-origin active anode material, which applies to key battery cell components, and not to integrated BESS. This only results into $5/kWh cost increase, which Fluence sees as manageable.

Fluence is now working with its domestic suppliers to ensure they achieve compliance with the OBBBA by the end of 2025. “Rising domestic content thresholds under OBBBA favor Fluence’s established U.S. supply chain,” stated Fluence.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-08-15%2Fe8y7tv2z%2FFluence-Q3-.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-08-15 09:01:01.922638

Boasting a lifted ride, 24-inch wheels and both autonomous and performance-driving modes, the Cadillac Elevated Velocity concept car reveals designs and features that will carry the brand’s V-series vehicles into the future.

With electric all-wheel drive and an adjustable air suspension, the sleek SUV has gull-wing doors, a modern, roomy interior, 2+2 seating and an augmented-reality head-up display ― combining features Cadillac offers now and is evaluating for tomorrow.

The concept also previews innovative ideas for desert racing, including repelling sand from its sleek four-door body and peering through dust storms.

The Elevated Velocity debuts at the Quail, a luxury vehicle event in Carmel, California, on Aug. 15. The Quail is part of a weekend of events for luxury, racing and classic vehicles on and near the Monterey Peninsula.

An earlier Cadillac concept called Opulent Velocity debuted at the Quail last year.

What’s cool about the Cadillac Elevated Velocity?

Elements defy mode that vibrates the car to shed dust and dirt.

That enhanced vision to peer through sandstorms.

24-inch wheels

Electric all-wheel drive

Air suspension

Gull-wing doors

2+2 seating

The look of tomorrow's Cadillacs

Cadillac expects the market for high-performance electric luxury SUVs to grow.

The Elevated Velocity’s profile ― long hood, spacious interior, short rear overhang, fastback rear end ― is consistent with the current Cadillac Lyriq and Celestiq.

“Concepts are the compass for us,” GM design chief Brian Nesbitt said during a briefing on the Elevated Velocity.

Other exterior touches include Cadillac’s signature vertical lighting, illuminated front and rear badges, Vapor Blue exterior paint and blue-tinted windows. Full-width rear lights create a three-dimensional effect Cadillac calls a “light tunnel.”

Infrared light and ‘dust-phobic vibration’

The Elevated Velocity has modes for interior comfort and different kinds of travel, from hands-free relaxation to desert racing.

Welcome: On approach, the gull-wing doors open, soft white light bathes the interior, an animation on the steering wheel mimics shifting desert sand, V-series logos light up on interior door caps.

Elevate: Autonomous driving to recover from strenuous activity. The steering wheel and pedals retract, ambient light shifts to red and the seat backs emit infrared light. The climate control system filters and perfumes cabin air; and adjusts for changes in temperature, humidity and elevation. The IR light is part of red light therapy, an experimental treatment to help “occupants recover from vigorous pursuits.”

Velocity: The driver is in charge and has access to the car’s full performance. Cool white interior lighting. The steering wheel displays speed, time, battery health and temperature. Augmented reality display and navigation on the HUD.

A separate set of driving modes — in addition to that enhanced vision for sandstorms and that ""elements defy"" mode that generates a “dust-phobic” vibration, like a horse shaking itself clean — include:

E-Velocity mode for intense on-road driving.

Terra mode for peak off-road performance.

Interior luxury

The interior has four pedestal bucket seats. A floating center console extends from the dash to rear seats.

The yoke-style steering wheel incorporates a hub-mounted display screen that’s intended to be most useful when the driver seat reclines and the steering wheel retracts.

The HUD delivers information to the driver when the car is in hands-on mode.

Interior colors and materials include:

Morello red leather for the door uppers seat cushions, cabin and floor.

Cerise red fabric on the doors, dash and seat backs.

Garnet: A red boucle fabric for arm rests, center console and instrument panel.

3D black crystal on the doors in a pattern of “the dynamic action of desert polo ― the clashing of mallets or motion of the horses' hooves as they sprint across a field of shifting sand.”

Cadillac doesn’t plan to build the Elevated Velocity, but its appearance and features will influence the brand’s upcoming performance models.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/13/PDTF/85651124007-my-25-cadillac-elevated-velocity-1-ap-39682.jpg?crop=8191,4609,x0,y427&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-15 09:00:49.314184

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

MICHIGAN FIGHTS BACK AGAINST TRUMP COAL PLANT: Michigan LCV joined community members in protesting the Trump administration’s continued support of a coal plant in Ottawa County that was set to close in May this year. The plant has been forced to remain open by the Trump administration, who declared an unnecessary energy emergency to keep the plant operational despite widespread support for its retirement. The plan to retire the plant has been set since 2021, and its closure is expected to save ratepayers $600 million by 2040 and protect communities from coal pollution.

MILCV TAKE: Michigan LCV West Michigan Regional Coordinator Jayce Bylenga said, “This is a clear example of how the Trump administration is making our energy costs more expensive and locking us into outdated, expensive fossil fuel infrastructure when we should be moving as quickly as possible to cleaner, more affordable energy options.”

NATIONAL NEWS

LCV JOINS STATES IN MOBILIZATION TO PROTECT PUBLIC LANDS: LCV, in partnership with state affiliates in the Conservation Voters Movement (CVM), announced a nationwide tour calling attention to the Trump administration’s threats to public lands. Events on the tour will take place across the country through August recess, and will be organized alongside local communities and elected officials. The tour kicked off in Colorado, where the U.S. House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse (CO-02) joined Conservation Colorado, LCV, and other local leaders for a solidarity hike through the Flatirons and spoke about the unique threats posed to his district and the state at large.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “From day one, the Trump administration launched countless attacks on our public lands and waters. Trump and his extreme allies have gutted our land management agencies, opened up millions of acres of our lands to drilling and logging, and allowed corporate polluters off the hook after they poison our lands and waters. We are all-in to fight back against the Trump administration’s sell-off of public lands to Big Polluters and corporate interests.”

CONSERVATION COLORADO TAKE: Conservation Colorado Public Lands Campaign Manager Brien Webster said, “In Colorado, public lands aren’t just scenic backdrops. They’re essential to supporting our families, teaching our kids the value of nature, and finding solace in a world full of distractions. These lands support our watersheds, our wildlife and our well-being. Treating them like a commodity to be sold off is not only shortsighted, it’s deeply wrong. We’re standing up for a simple truth: these lands should remain in public hands for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. “

REP. NEGUSE TAKE: Representative Joe Neguse said, “In Colorado, access to the outdoors — and the preservation of our public lands — is a cornerstone of our state’s economy and a core part of our state’s identity and way of life. That’s why, at every turn, I’ve fought back against Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ efforts to sell off these treasured public lands and dismantle the agencies that protect them. And it’s also why I’m proud to join LCV this August in getting outside and highlighting the lands and waters we’re so lucky to have in our backyards.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO CANCEL SOLAR FOR ALL: Last week the Trump administration announced its plans to end the Solar For All program, which provides funding for organizations to build community solar installations that help lower energy bills for low-income households. Nevada’s Solar for All program now faces obstacles to building out solar capacity expected to provide clean, affordable energy to at least 50,000 Nevadans and lower household energy bills by at least 20%.

CHISPA NV TAKE: Chispa Nevada Senior Organizer Juan Carlos Guardado said, “Solar For All helps Nevadans who are struggling with the rising costs of utilities and urgently need relief. The program was designed to guarantee 20% lower electricity bills for low-income Americans, regardless of whether or not they own a home or can afford rooftop solar panels. Many Latine families were looking forward to signing up and are now deeply concerned by this news. We need Solar For All to reduce burdens on households already facing high energy costs.”

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

TRUMP ORDERS FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF DC: The Trump administration took control of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department from D.C.’s elected leaders and deployed the National Guard in the District, despite the fact that violent crime in D.C. last year was at a thirty year low. This egregious abuse of power comes on the heels of recent decisions to gut public safety programs and the D.C. budget.

OUR TAKE: LCV President Pete Maysmith said, “Deploying the National Guard and taking over the police force in the nation’s capital is a direct attack on our freedoms and the safety of our communities, especially the Black and brown communities who have been historically targeted by force. Instead of making our communities safer, this administration is instituting a political power grab that could harm our families and communities. The military should not be used to intimidate our communities and undermine local authority in order to help fulfill Trump’s extreme and inhumane immigration policies and harm our civil rights — especially given the recent deployment of armed forces in Los Angeles and today’s threat by Trump to expand this to other cities.

“Just one month after gutting critical funding from programs that would have actually protected the health and safety of people across the country and after cutting $1 billion from D.C.’s budget, Trump is wasting our federal and local resources and is using military members against their own communities. The Trump administration’s extreme and politicized Justice Department cannot be trusted with good faith law enforcement — they must get their hands off of D.C., and Congress must immediately grant D.C. its long-overdue statehood.”

LCVAF ENDORSES CHRIS PAPPAS FOR SENATE: LCV Action Fund (LCVAF) announced the endorsement of Representative Chris Pappas (NH-01) for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire. With a lifetime score of 97% on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard, Pappas is an environmental champion with a demonstrated commitment to protecting public health and the environment.

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Vice President of Political Affairs Craig Auster said, “Representative Chris Pappas’s strong leadership in the U.S. House to help protect the health and safety of communities demonstrates how he will continue to fight for Granite Staters and our environment in the U.S. Senate. We need more champions in Congress like Representative Pappas who will safeguard our rights and help build a more affordable, more resilient clean energy future, and LCV Action Fund is proud to support his campaign for the Senate.”

LCVAF NH TAKE: LCVAF New Hampshire State Director Rob Werner said, “During his time in Congress, Representative Chris Pappas has had a proven track record fighting for people and protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink. As we continue to experience the impacts of extreme weather, the climate crisis, and pollution across New Hampshire, we need strong leaders to represent our communities in the U.S. Senate, and we’re proud to support Representative Pappas’ campaign.”

U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said Tuesday the company is working closely with local, state and federal authorities.
The facility is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.
The plant has a long history of environmental problems, especially fouling the air in communities nearby the sprawling plant.
The concerns about air quality also come as the federal Environmental Protection Agency moves to postpone new hazardous air pollution standards for coke plants, like Clairton.","The Pennsylvania county where an explosion at a U.S. Steel plant south of Pittsburgh killed two people and injured more than 10 others announced Thursday that it is stepping up air quality monitoring in the area of the sprawling facility that has a troubled environmental record.

The Allegheny County Health Department announced that mobile air units provided by the state and Carnegie Mellon University will be stationed in the Mon Valley where the plant is Thursday and Friday. The county said these measures are part of its ongoing investigation into Monday's explosion at Clairton Coke Works.

The county said the measures go “well beyond the normal and rigorous regulatory air quality monitoring” and will assess parts of the valley for different types of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 pollutants and sulfur dioxide.

After Monday’s blast, the county health department initially told residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. The department lifted the advisory after its monitors didn’t detect levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.

The Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office also confirmed Thursday that the second person who died in the blast was Steven Menefee, 52, of Clairton. Earlier, the county medical examiner’s office identified one of the dead as Timothy Quinn, 39.

U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said Tuesday the company is working closely with local, state and federal authorities. He would not speculate about the cause of the explosion.

The massive plant along the Monongahela River in Clairton converts coal to coke, a key component in the steelmaking process. The facility is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.

To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what is known as coke gas — a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

The plant has a long history of environmental problems, especially fouling the air in communities nearby the sprawling plant.

In 2018, a Christmas Eve fire damaged pollution-control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a subsequent lawsuit. The fire prompted Allegheny County to warn residents to limit outdoor activities. Residents said it was hard to breathe for weeks afterward and that the air felt acidic and smelled like rotten eggs. U.S. Steel settled a lawsuit last year with an agreement to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs.

Dr. Deborah Gentile, the medical director of Community Partners in Asthma Care, studied asthma levels after the 2018 fire and found twice as many patients sought medical treatment.

In 2019, U.S. Steel agreed to settle a lawsuit regarding air pollution from Clairton for $8.5 million.

The concerns about air quality also come as the federal Environmental Protection Agency moves to postpone new hazardous air pollution standards for coke plants, like Clairton.

Matthew Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a public health advocacy group in Pittsburgh, said the regulations were deemed to be almost insignificant to operational costs and would have helped protect the public with air quality monitoring.

The regulation would have required — like is already required at refineries all over the United States — fence-line monitoring for hazardous air pollutants at the Clairton plant, Mehalik said.

That information would have been “incredibly useful” when the explosion happened on Monday, Mehalik said.

Donald Trump’s election as President of the world’s largest economy has created fresh bottlenecks for the global energy transition, as he imposed tariffs on the United States imports of clean energy technologies from across the world. In addition, plans to roll back the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) threaten to further stall the country’s shift to clean power.

Both pieces of legislation, passed under former President Joe Biden, aimed to promote major significant capital investments in US’s domestic clean energy manufacturing.

The extent to which the US decarbonises matters for the global transition. The country has been a historic polluter, responsible for almost 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions since the pre-industrial era. Six months into Trump’s presidency, the data on clean energy investment paints a bleak picture.

A report from Wellesley College’s environmental studies department, based on its ‘The Big Green Machine’ database tracking US clean energy projects, found that solar, wind, battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing projects are being paused, cancelled or closed at a rate six times higher than during the same period in 2024 — and 30 times higher than in 2023.

In the past six months, 26 projects, adding up to $27.6 billion in capital investment and 18,849 jobs, have been halted or scrapped. Over the same period, only 29 new projects were announced, worth $3 billion and creating 8,334 jobs.

By comparison, the first half of 2024 saw 54 new projects announced, adding up to $15.9 billion in capital investment and creating more than 25,000 jobs. Only eight projects were paused, slowed or cancelled at that time, totalling $4.1 billion and 3,820 jobs.

While the figures show significant disruption, the report noted that some previously announced projects have initiated pilot production or even moved beyond. In the past six months, 39 projects worth $21.1 billion have advanced, creating over 25,000 jobs; however, these are generally smaller in scale and less likely to receive federal support, compared to the projects that are paused, cancelled or closed.

Although it is not surprising that projects dependent on federal loans and grants were more likely to experience delays, it is interesting to note that those located in poorer regions or disadvantaged communities had a higher likelihood of being slowed (ie, paused, cancelled, or closed). This implies that the communities most in need of livelihoods and opportunities could end up losing out even further.

More specifically, based on project count, disadvantaged communities have seen 47 per cent of projects slowed, compared with 30 per cent in non-disadvantaged communities. In terms of capital investment, the former experienced 70 per cent of projects being slowed, while the latter saw 30 per cent affected.

The policy regulations, whether concerning trade with various countries or domestic measures such as diluting the IRA and BIL, have serious implications for the country’s clean energy manufacturing. For instance, Trump recently announced a tariff of 93.5 per cent on anode-grade graphite imported from China, a key raw material for EV batteries. While this could favour domestic graphite production, it represents a setback for domestic manufacturers reliant on Chinese graphite imports.

The Trump administration is also planning to reverse vehicle fuel efficiency standards, which could reduce demand for EVs. Furthermore, Congress recently revoked California’s emission waiver for registered vehicles — a tool critical to achieving the state’s target of 100 per cent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035, a goal also adopted by 17 other states.

According to the report, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Trump administration will roll back tax incentives, loan support, grants and other policies established under the IRA and BIL. The impact of these rollbacks will be felt by manufacturers in the US and globally.

The lack of federal support for new EVs and the termination of manufacturing credits for clean energy technologies, such as wind turbine components, will further impede a transition that is urgently needed worldwide.

,American Energy,2025-08-15 05:06:05+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Contributor: A climate report without denial and without excessive alarm bells,Veronique de Rugy,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-08-14/department-of-energy-climate-working-group-report,"The debate over climate change and responses has become so polarized that acknowledging the problem of human-driven warming without accepting a narrative that can sound apocalyptic invites attacks from all sides.
I understand that the findings are controversial and hope climate scientists debate every detail.
Wright’s plan was simple: “Elevate the debate” by gathering a team of credible, often-overlooked, independent experts to critically review the state of climate science — without political filters — and publish the results openly.
Far from denying climate change, this perspective puts it into context and reminds us that sometimes the strongest medicines can hurt more than the disease.
I also hope the result is a climate policy crafted from facts, whatever they might be, rather than fear.","A new report from the Department of Energy concludes that, yes, the climate is changing and humans contribute to it — but no, it’s not necessarily the impending catastrophe we’ve been warned about. In another era, an agency charting this kind of middle course would be unremarkable. Today, it feels revolutionary.

The debate over climate change and responses has become so polarized that acknowledging the problem of human-driven warming without accepting a narrative that can sound apocalyptic invites attacks from all sides. I understand that the findings are controversial and hope climate scientists debate every detail. Considering the upside of getting this issue right, you would think more people would encourage open debate.

That is exactly what led energy analyst Travis Fisher of the Cato Institute to return briefly to the administration to help organize the Climate Working Group, which generated the report. Like many of us who read from outside our ideological circles, Fisher was frustrated that many members of the left treat climate-crisis dissent as a thought crime, while many on the right still dismiss climate change as a joke.

Fisher was initially hesitant to return to government service after a bruising prior stint. He was won over by Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s stated desire to follow the data and inject more hard evidence into the conversation. Wright’s plan was simple: “Elevate the debate” by gathering a team of credible, often-overlooked, independent experts to critically review the state of climate science — without political filters — and publish the results openly.

Five scientists were chosen by the Energy secretary. They are all highly credentialed and have decades of research under their belts. Importantly, they were given complete freedom over their conclusions. One need not agree with the Trump administration’s overall climate policy — such as the dismissal of the 400 volunteer scientists preparing the next congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment — to recognize the legitimacy of this new report and its small group of authors.

What does the report say? In a nutshell, as Fisher puts it: “climate science — let alone climate policy — is far more nuanced than the summaries for policymakers (produced by previous government efforts) would have you believe.”

The report affirms that greenhouse gases are warming the planet but tempers several claims. For example, the authors found no convincing evidence that U.S. hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or droughts have become more frequent or intense in recent decades, despite what you’d gather from headlines. This debate will continue, as it should, with many related dimensions to consider. But at least there is now high-profile evidence on record to give a say to reasonable experts who disagree with other, more alarmed perspectives.

The Department of Energy report’s authors also find that the planet’s warming is unlikely to cause as much economic damage as is commonly claimed, in part because they believe past projections have been too extreme — something the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other mainstream climate scientists have recognized in recent years.

Another finding in the report is that drastic policies meant to reduce warming could do more economic harm than good, and that even the most heavy-handed climate policy can’t make much of a difference. Even if we eliminated all U.S. emissions, the authors argue, it would have an “undetectably small” effect on global temperatures. Far from denying climate change, this perspective puts it into context and reminds us that sometimes the strongest medicines can hurt more than the disease.

None of this is to say that the report has all the answers or that other, more worried scientists should not be heard. That’s exactly the point: There should be an ongoing debate. Insisting that “the science is settled” implies that only one narrative is allowed and downplays other important conversations about the effects and scale of the challenge.

So, while some self-styled science defenders try to silence any dissenting view, one of the authors of the new report, Judith Curry of Georgia Tech, rightly notes that “any scientist that isn’t skeptical isn’t doing their job. … The ‘mainstream’ attempt to enforce a faux consensus to support political objectives is antithetical to science.” A healthy process welcomes scrutiny and disagreement, which should help sharpen the work of any conscientious expert.

For better or worse, the study is already having an impact, with the Environmental Protection Agency citing it in a proposal to reconsider the federal government’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

That will mean legal fights, lots of criticism — and more debate.

This report — the first of many of its kind, I hope — shows that it’s still possible to respectfully and professionally confront entrenched dogma. It takes experts and people in power who are willing to be challenged or erroneously smeared as deniers. That’s no small thing. I also hope the result is a climate policy crafted from facts, whatever they might be, rather than fear.

For that to happen, others must insist that open debate guides the response. And more importantly, we must all tolerate the debate.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/170d4e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff4%2F28%2F16b20fc4464aa08320c3271f2e61%2F1167025-me-morro-bay-smokestacks-gxc-0006.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 08:00:09.193733

Per a bulletin sent to dealers, 2025 Mercedes-Benz G-Class EV leases have up to a $9,500 incentive this month. Additionally, our analysis uncovered discounted lease rates on G 580 EVs. The changes come ahead of next month's end of a major government tax credit.

Mercedes G-Wagen EV Has A $9,500 Discount Off MSRP

The 2025 Mercedes-Benz G 580 with EQ Technology now features $9,500 in lease cash. That's $2,000 more than last month's $7,500 incentive and equates to a 27% boost in savings. Like most electric vehicles, G-Class EV lease deals have benefitted from a loophole even though the SUV is excluded from a tax credit on purchases.

Electric G-Wagens Have Discounted Lease Rates, Too

With tax credits going away after September 30th, Mercedes may be hoping to capitalize on a rush to snatch up EV lease deals before they're gone. Previously, G-Class EVs were only eligible for standard lease rates. Now, the 2025 G 580 has a money factor of 0.00180. That basically translates to an interest rate of 4.3% APR.

It Still Has A G-Wagen Price

Having said all of that, this doesn't make the G-Class a killer deal. First, only the EV model is eligible for lease cash and promotional money factors. Additionally, the high-riding EV has a base price of $162,650, including destination. That's $13,000 more than the gas model. The $9,500 offer also equates to just a 5.8% discount.

Despite being an EV, the G 580 isn't all that efficient, with an EPA rating of 62 MPGe overall and an electric range of just 239 miles. Still, the ability to ride in style with its traditional G-Wagen looks in a zero-emission vehicle could be attractive for some luxury shoppers. In contrast, the standard G 550 is rated at just 18 mpg overall.

With the tax credits for EVs and PHEVs going away next month, now could be a good time to lease a G 580. Just be aware that there are no incentives for purchasing the G 580 EV. The advertised lease for the G 580 is currently $1,869 for 36 months with $14,613 due at signing (10,000 miles) for an effective cost of $2,275 a month.

Current Mercedes deals end on September 2nd.

After the rush to claim the credit, Busch anticipates a sharp decline in residential customers.
The nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council conducts an annual solar jobs census that found the U.S. solar industry employed about 280,000 workers in 2023, the most recent year available.
The company’s most recent marketplace report said solar prices dropped for the third six-month period in a row, hitting $2.50 per watt, the lowest median quoted price since the company began tracking data in 2014.
In the meantime, retail energy prices are rising and solar is growing more popular even in states without supportive policies, Walker said.","This story was originally published on Utility Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter.

Growing up in Georgia, Montana Busch says he had two passions: technology and the environment. In 2007, when he was still a teenager, he founded Alternative Energy Southeast, a solar installer that today employs some 30 people between its offices in Athens and Savannah.

Business is booming, but Busch fears it will be short-lived. He saw a three to fourfold increase in requests for quotes “overnight” after President Donald Trump signed his signature tax and spending law that ended a 30% residential tax credit for homeowners to install solar nearly 10 years early. Third-party owners, such as those that offer lease agreements, can continue to get the credit until the end of 2026.

After the rush to claim the credit, Busch anticipates a sharp decline in residential customers. He hopes to replace the lost business with new commercial clients, but he’s concerned. He must also contend with rapidly-shifting tariffs and the potential abrupt end of Solar For All, a $7 billion federal program to expand access to solar power and had just launched in Georgia to enthusiastic demand.

“We’ve sold a record number of projects in the past few weeks and, you know, it’s great in a lot of ways, but it’s also a big challenge for a business to ramp up and ramp down,” Busch said. “That’s what doesn’t make any sense about this: Solar provided means for someone like me ... to build a business from the ground up, i.e. the American Dream, right? But our own government is against our industry.”

A similar pattern of surging demand and unease appears to be happening nationwide, according to representatives for EnergySage, an online shopping tool where users can request and compare quotes for solar, storage and heat pumps.

Overall, EnergySage saw a 59% month-over-month increase in registrations from potential customers from June to July.

“We have seen some of our biggest weekly registration numbers in our entire history” since the company was founded in 2014, said Emily Walker, director of content and insights at EnergySage. “That’s very indicative of huge spikes in demand.”

But the company also conducted a survey of contractors and found that more than 90% said the tax credits going away would harm their business, with nearly two-thirds expecting ""dramatic harm."" One in four said they would consider leaving the industry altogether if the credits were cut.

“Pretty striking numbers in terms of the effect that this is going to have,” Walker said.

The nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council conducts an annual solar jobs census that found the U.S. solar industry employed about 280,000 workers in 2023, the most recent year available.

Walker pointed out that the industry is also enjoying some good news. Solar system installation prices remain at historic lows, though it’s early to gauge the impacts of tariffs. The company’s most recent marketplace report said solar prices dropped for the third six-month period in a row, hitting $2.50 per watt, the lowest median quoted price since the company began tracking data in 2014. Quoted storage prices also fell to a new record low of $999 per kilowatt-hour stored, it said.

In the meantime, retail energy prices are rising and solar is growing more popular even in states without supportive policies, Walker said.

“I think a lot of it is energy independence, grid instability and rising electricity rates,” she said. “We’re expecting electricity prices to rise pretty significantly.”

Aurora Solar recently released the findings of a survey it did that found most respondents were not familiar with the details of what was in the tax and spending bill, but that expiration of the incentives made them more interested in pursuing installation.

“Under the current Trump administration, the renewable energy sector has lost something critical: long-term policy stability and investor confidence,” Chris Hopper, the CEO of Aurora Solar, said in a statement. “While I’m confident it will be rebuilt, the erosion of trust and capital in the meantime makes it harder for businesses to invest with conviction.”

According to Teslarati, a recently filed patent outlines an active aerodynamic system that uses fans and deployable skirts. The system would generate low-pressure zones beneath the car, increasing traction during extreme acceleration and high-speed cornering.

When the Roadster was first revealed in 2017, Elon Musk promised a blistering 0-60 mph time of 1.9 seconds. Since then, Tesla's Model S Plaid has nearly matched that, hitting 1.99 seconds, for a fraction of the Roadster's expected price.

In early 2024, Musk raised the stakes, saying Tesla was aiming for a sub-one-second 0-60 mph time, describing it as the ""least interesting"" feature of the vehicle.

While such acceleration is possible in specialized dragsters, no street-legal car has come close. If Tesla's new aero system works as intended, it could help keep the Roadster firmly planted during these extreme launches.

Beyond the engineering feat, this innovation could help Tesla reassert its leadership in an EV market where competition is growing fast.

It might also bolster interest in a brand that's faced headwinds in 2025: Tesla's second-quarter revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion — its steepest drop in over a decade — while vehicle deliveries slid 13% year over year.

For drivers, the benefits go beyond speed. Better aerodynamic control can improve efficiency by reducing drag in certain conditions, extending range and lowering charging costs. And because EVs produce no exhaust pollution, advances that make them more appealing could accelerate the shift away from gas-powered cars.

Pairing an EV like the Roadster with home solar can make ownership even more cost-effective. Charging with solar energy is cheaper than using public stations or the grid, and EnergySage makes it simple to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on installation.

Tesla has not confirmed when the new Roadster will launch, but the car could set a new benchmark for what's possible in a street-legal EV if this patent becomes reality.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-recTAxCdctjHEFgIf.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 04:59:32.327229

However, the clear limiting factor to the U.S.’s data center infrastructure development, according to a Deloitte industry survey, is stress on the power grid.
This leaves little room to absorb the rapid load increases AI infrastructure requires, Fishman ntoed.
In China, energy planning is coordinated by long-term, technocratic policy that defines the market’s rules before investments are made, Fishman said.
Without a dramatic shift in how the U.S. builds and funds its energy infrastructure, China’s lead will only widen.","“Everywhere we went, people treated energy availability as a given,” Rui Ma wrote on X after returning from a recent tour of China’s AI hubs.

For American AI researchers, that’s almost unimaginable. In the U.S., surging AI demand is colliding with a fragile power grid, the kind of extreme bottleneck that Goldman Sachs warns could severely choke the industry’s growth.

In China, Ma continued, it’s considered a “solved problem.”

Ma, a renowned expert in Chinese technology and founder of the media company Tech Buzz China, took her team on the road to get a firsthand look at the country’s AI advancements. She told Fortune that while she isn’t an energy expert, she attended enough meetings and talked to enough insiders to come away with a conclusion that should send chills down the spine of Silicon Valley: in China, building enough power for data centers is no longer up for debate.

“This is a stark contrast to the U.S., where AI growth is increasingly tied to debates over data center power consumption and grid limitations,” she wrote on X.

The stakes are difficult to overstate. Data center building is the foundation of AI advancement, and spending on new centers now displaces consumer spending in terms of impact to U.S. GDP—that’s concerning since consumer spending is generally two-thirds of the pie. McKinsey projects that between 2025 and 2030, companies worldwide will need to invest $6.7 trillion into new data center capacity to keep up with AI’s strain.

In a recent research note, Stifel Nicolaus warned of a looming correction to the S&P 500, since it forecasts this data-center capex boom to be a one-off build-out of infrastructure, while consumer spending is clearly on the wane.

However, the clear limiting factor to the U.S.’s data center infrastructure development, according to a Deloitte industry survey, is stress on the power grid. Cities’ power grids are so weak that some companies are just building their own power plants rather than relying on existing grids. The public is growing increasingly frustrated over increasing energy bills – in Ohio, the electricity bill for a typical household has increased at least $15 this summer from the data centers – while energy companies prepare for a sea-change of surging demand.

Goldman Sachs frames the crisis simply: “AI’s insatiable power demand is outpacing the grid’s decade-long development cycles, creating a critical bottleneck.”

Meanwhile, David Fishman, a Chinese electricity expert who has spent years tracking their energy development, told Fortune that in China, electricity isn’t even a question. On average, China adds more electricity demand than the entire annual consumption of Germany, every single year. Whole rural provinces are blanketed in rooftop solar, with one province matching the entirety of India’s electricity supply.

“U.S. policymakers should be hoping China stays a competitor and not an aggressor,” Fishman said. “Because right now they can’t compete effectively on the energy infrastructure front.”

China has an oversupply of electricty

China’s quiet electricity dominance, Fishman explained, is the result of decades of deliberate overbuilding and investment in every layer of the power sector, from generation to transmission to next-generation nuclear.

The country’s reserve margin has never dipped below 80%–100% nationwide, meaning it has consistently maintained at least twice the capacity it needs, Fishman said. They have so much available space that instead of seeing AI data centers as a threat to grid stability, China treats them as a convenient way to “soak up oversupply,” he added.

That level of cushion is unthinkable in the United States, where regional grids typically operate with a 15% reserve margin and sometimes less, particularly during extreme weather, Fishman said. In places like California or Texas, officials often issue warnings about red-flag conditions when demand is projected to strain the system. This leaves little room to absorb the rapid load increases AI infrastructure requires, Fishman ntoed.

The gap in readiness is stark: while the U.S. is already experiencing political and economic fights over whether the grid can keep up, China is operating from a position of abundance.

Even if AI demand in China grows so quickly renewable projects can’t keep pace, Fishman said, the country can tap idle coal plants to bridge the gap while building more sustainable sources. “It’s not preferable,” he admitted, “but it’s doable.”

By contrast, the U.S. would have to scramble to bring on new generation capacity, often facing years-long permitting delays, local opposition, and fragmented market rules, he said.

Structural governance differences

Underpinning the hardware advantage is a difference in governance. In China, energy planning is coordinated by long-term, technocratic policy that defines the market’s rules before investments are made, Fishman said. This model ensures infrastructure buildout happens in anticipation of demand, not in reaction to it.

“They’re set up to hit grand slams,” Fishman noted. “The U.S., at best, can get on base.”

In the U.S., large-scale infrastructure projects depend heavily on private investment, but most investors expect a return within three to five years: far too short for power projects that can take a decade to build and pay off.

“Capital is really biased toward shorter-term returns,” he said, noting Silicon Valley has funneled billions into “the nth iteration of software-as-a-service” while energy projects fight for funding.

In China, by contrast, the state directs money toward strategic sectors in advance of demand, accepting not every project will succeed but ensuring the capacity is in place when it’s needed. Without public financing to de-risk long-term bets, he argued, the U.S. political and economic system is simply not set up to build the grid of the future.

Cultural attitudes reinforce this approach. In China, renewables are framed as a cornerstone of the economy because they make sense economically and strategically, not because they carry moral weight. Coal use isn’t cast as a sign of villainy, as it would be among some circles in the U.S. – it’s simply seen as outdated. This pragmatic framing, Fishman argued, allows policymakers to focus on efficiency and results rather than political battles.

For Fishman, the takeaway is blunt. Without a dramatic shift in how the U.S. builds and funds its energy infrastructure, China’s lead will only widen.

“The gap in capability is only going to continue to become more obvious — and grow in the coming years,” he said.

Most of Arizona’s fleet vehicles – from sedans to pickup trucks to construction vehicles – are internal combustion engine vehicles that use gasoline or diesel, which are costly to fuel and to maintain.
Of those reductions, 98,000 tons could come from electrifying the state fleet alone.
Share expertise and pool resources across state and local governments.
This new research builds on previous reports on fleet electrification, which were conducted by Arizona PIRG Education Fund and Frontier Group.","According to new research released by Arizona Public Interest Research Group (Arizona PIRG) Education Fund, The Nature Conservancy in Arizona, and Frontier Group, even without federal tax incentives, Arizona and its local governments can realize savings of more than $100 million over the next decade by replacing retiring light-duty trucks, SUVs and vans in Arizona’s state and local government fleets with comparable electric vehicles (EVs).

Diane E. Brown, Executive Director of Arizona PIRG Education Fund, stated, “By transitioning to electric vehicles as older vehicles retire, the state and local governments can save $100 million for taxpayers and ensure air quality and public health becomes better, not worse.” Brown added, “Electric vehicles are less expensive, more capable, and can travel much farther on a charge than those available just a few years ago, making them an increasingly smart choice for government fleets.”

Dan Stellar, State Director for The Nature Conservancy in Arizona, added, “Making a meaningful transition to zero-emission vehicles is beneficial for air quality and public health, as well as our state economy, which continues to thrive, in part, due to investments in clean technologies like EV and battery manufacturing. We thank our partners for conducting this timely research, which shows that we can make forward-thinking investments that benefit people and nature.”

The organizations pointed to key factors and findings in their analysis:

State and local governments in Arizona own more than 100,000 vehicles, with more than 7,500 in the state fleet alone. Most of Arizona’s fleet vehicles – from sedans to pickup trucks to construction vehicles – are internal combustion engine vehicles that use gasoline or diesel, which are costly to fuel and to maintain.

EVs are less expensive, more capable and can travel much farther on a charge than those available just a few years ago. More than 100 models of light-duty and larger EVs are currently available and already on our roads, including pickup trucks and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles such as electric buses, cargo vans, freight trucks and garbage trucks. The U.S. Department of Energy lists dozens of such vehicles now available, with more on the way.

Driving EVs instead of gasoline-powered light-duty vehicles over the next decade could enable Arizona state and local governments to save more than 1 million barrels of oil; cut emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds by 103,000 pounds and 496,000 pounds, respectively; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 387,000 tons (carbon dioxide equivalent), the same amount as produced by 81,000 typical cars in a year. Of those reductions, 98,000 tons could come from electrifying the state fleet alone.

“While the total cost of ownership savings from replacing retiring vehicles with electric vs. gasoline-powered vehicles over the next 10 years is significant, savings may be greater than estimated if state and local fleet managers are able to purchase vehicles that are designed specifically for fleets,” said Elizabeth Ridlington, Associate Director and Senior Policy Analyst for the Frontier Group. Ridlington highlighted how savings could be nearly $90 million greater by purchasing the Ford F-150 Lightning Pro model designed for fleets rather than the XLT model sold to individual consumers.

The organizations said that “Arizona should tap into the promise to save money for taxpayers and to reduce air pollution” by following this roadmap:

Make bold commitments and stick with them, showing the resolve of the state and local governments to save taxpayers' money by electrifying vehicles.

Develop a detailed fleet electrification plan to set purchasing priorities and guide investments in charging infrastructure.

Share expertise and pool resources across state and local governments.

Take full advantage of incentives offered by APS, SRP, and TEP, including technical assistance programs that offer an analysis of current fleets, as well as opportunities to transition to EVs, add charging infrastructure, and tailor electricity rates for EV charging.

China installed over 270 GW of solar power in 2024 alone, more than the rest of the world combined.
Solar can compete in the energy markets without the help of subsidies, as long as those energy markets are mature and complemented by robust energy infrastructure.
China’s energy reform reflects just such maturity of the sector and echoes a broader trend toward market-driven clean energy policy.
Despite China’s solar dominance, the country is also still building coal capacity, with medium-to-long-term contracts locking in coal generation for decades to come.","This past June, China installed around 14 gigawatts of solar PV, 85 percent less than the previous month and close to 40 percent less than June of the previous year. This followed the final phase-out of the country’s guaranteed feed-in tariffs (FiTs) on June 1.

When the global undisputed solar leader seemingly shifts its support away from the industry, the rest of the world pays attention. But rather than a warning sign about solar deceleration, China’s recent policy shifts are, if anything, a good sign of the continued – and increasing – competitiveness of solar power, and China’s own shift from regulation- to market-driven clean energy policy.

Read the full CKI report: Scaling Solar

The phase-out of FiTs wasn’t a sudden decision. China first introduced a national FiT of ¥1.15/kWh ($0.18/kWh) in 2011, following the successful adoption of earlier provincial pilots. This model was influenced by FiTs pioneered by Germany in the early 2000s under its Renewable Energy Act (EEG).

China first reduced its FiTs in 2013 to between ¥0.9 and 1.0/kWh ($0.13-0.14/kWh), depending on the region. The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016) included generous FiTs as part of its strategy to achieve renewable energy targets, and laid out a gradual further tapering from 2016 to 2020.

The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021) marked a pointed shift in China’s policies from a centrally planned, subsidy-driven model of support to a more competitive energy market. Along with subsequent notices, the new rules ordered a final (staggered) phase-out of national FiTs for most solar PV and onshore wind projects.

To ease the shift away from FiT, China introduced a protective contracts-for-difference (CfD) policy in 2025 for projects placed in service after June 1, where developers are compensated for any difference between market price and a fixed ""strike price."" It also expanded clean energy obligations of large energy users, mandating, for instance, that data centers source at least 80 percent of their power from renewables.

Since 2015, China has been gradually developing medium- and long-term power contracts, spot markets, and ancillary service markets. Market-based electricity trading volume surged from 1.1 billion MWh in 2016 to 6.2 billion MWh in 2024, accounting for 63 percent of nationwide electricity consumption. Cross-provincial trading expanded tenfold in that time. By the end of 2025, the government aims to establish a nationwide power spot market.

While the June 1 phase-out of FiTs had long been planned, it did lead to a spike in installations in both April and May, similar to when Germany gradually phased down its FiTs between 2004 and 2006, each time beginning January 1.

But China, of course, is still building. Overall, solar PV installations are strong and gaining strength, with an increase of well over 50x since 2013. China installed over 270 GW of solar power in 2024 alone, more than the rest of the world combined.

Solar and wind are no longer emerging technologies. They are mature and cost-competitive, and are still getting cheaper. That goes both for solar alone, and for solar plus storage. Lithium-ion battery prices dropped another 50 percent in just the past 18 months.

Solar can compete in the energy markets without the help of subsidies, as long as those energy markets are mature and complemented by robust energy infrastructure. China’s energy reform reflects just such maturity of the sector and echoes a broader trend toward market-driven clean energy policy.

Despite China’s solar dominance, the country is also still building coal capacity, with medium-to-long-term contracts locking in coal generation for decades to come. China’s push toward renewables and move toward market-driven energy policies does not absolve it of the need to price the negative carbon and broader pollution externalities of fossil energy.",https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/articles/images_upload/shutterstock_2483615551_huge.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 01:59:38.345522

The report also found that Q2 saw the lowest level of investment in large-scale battery storage seen in almost two years (since Q3 2023) representing 334 MW of capacity – less than a quarter of the levels seen in Q1 2025 (1520 MW). However, despite a slower quarter, with three projects reaching financial close in Q2, battery storage generation remains on track to meet and beat deployment levels under the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Step Change scenario, with newly committed capacity exceeding 1000 MWh for nine consecutive quarters.

“Unsurprisingly, the Federal Election in May created a great deal of political and policy uncertainty which has been unhelpful to energy investors who are trying to make very large investments in assets which will be in operation for decades to come,” Ms Freeman said.

“International and local investors are ready to invest in Australia, but assessments need to be faster, clearer and more predictable to unlock projects.

“Victoria has not approved a large-scale wind farm since 2023 and projects in Queensland are now facing a higher degree of uncertainty.

What Are The Driving Factors Impacting The Battery Recycling Market?

The proliferation of electric vehicles is projected to spur the expansion of the battery recycling market in the upcoming years. Electric vehicles (EV), which are either wholly or partially powered by electricity, have become increasingly prominent. Recycling the batteries of these vehicles, which can be costly to discard due to their valuable materials, offers a chance to minimize life-cycle expenses. It enables the extraction of high-value materials and helps to sidestep the cost of disposing hazardous waste. The market has witnessed an increase in the number of lithium-ion batteries due to rising EV sales. The finite lifespan of these batteries necessitates a practical recycling method to balance domestic material supplies for battery manufacturing, reduce the need for raw materials, and decrease supply chain disruptions caused by political instability. After a lifespan of 5-8 years, these batteries may fail to power EVs effectively, but can still be used in lower-grade applications such as household use, energy backups, renewable energy storage, and off-peak energy storage. The process of recycling EV batteries aids in recovering metals such as cobalt, lithium, and nickel, which can subsequently be used in the production of new batteries, thereby conserving resources and reducing manufacturing costs. As per the International Energy Agency, it is predicted that global electric vehicle sales will reach 125 million by 2030. Hence, the rising prevalence of electric vehicles is further stimulating the growth of the battery recycling market.

AMES — U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Thursday during a visit to Ames National Laboratory that he supports the development and research of clean energy sources — but also said he believes the ending of some federal supports for industries like solar and wind energy has come at the right time.

Several parts of the budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump change clean energy programs created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the flagship legislation of former President Joe Biden. The “big, beautiful” law takes funding out of some of these programs, in addition to ending or phasing out clean energy tax credits, shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects and terminating rebates this year for purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient home upgrades.

Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Advocates for clean energy say Iowa, which has a higher share of wind energy production than other states and hosts a growing solar energy industry, could see higher costs and the loss of new projects, jobs and manufacturing facilities as these federal incentives end.

But Wright told reporters he supported the move to end these incentives, saying the industry has grown enough to be able to compete without the government financial support.

” I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said. “… In an early energy producing industry, the government provides subsidies or incentives or whatever to do it. But they’ve been around for 33 years, and I think you’ve seen a mature industry develop. So like with any energy source, it’s got to achieve maturity and compete in the marketplace.”

Wright was joined by members of Iowa’s federal delegation, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, as well as other members of the conservative climate caucus in the U.S. House, Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas.

Ernst said discussions are ongoing with the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on wind projects in Iowa “to make sure that they do qualify for those tax credits.”

“It doesn’t mean our wind energy is going away. It just means that those tax credits will be phased out,” Ernst said. “So I can anticipate that states like Iowa, we will continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines, the solar projects that are there, but we will see less subsidies coming from the federal government.”

Wright also spoke in support of other components of the budget reconciliation law, saying the measure included some changes to permitting that “took some shackles off” on building new energy production infrastructure, as well as for natural resource extraction within the country.

The Ames National Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus, is one of the 17 national laboratories throughout the country that focus on research related to energy production, national security and environmental impact. The Ames lab focuses on issues related to materials science and minerals — areas of research Wright said are vital, as the nation needs to become less dependent on countries like China.

Currently, he said, the U.S. is over-reliant on foreign countries for certain chemicals and minerals that are needed in many energy, technology and medical fields.

Miller-Meeks said bringing the mining of minerals back to the U.S. — as well as setting up more processing and manufacturing industries for these natural resources in the U.S. — would be more environmentally conscious overall, as there are “better labor practices, better environmental practices” in the U.S. than in other countries.

There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.

Wright said while there were cuts made through the budget reconciliation law and other efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to cut costs, he said he does not expect cuts to the National Laboratory system.

“Of course, when I got there, the original idea was, ‘Let’s cut everything, let’s shrink everything,'” Wright said. “We need to shrink our spending of the government. But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future. They’re much smaller dollars than giant corporate subsidies, and they have huge payoffs.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/albianews.com/content/tncms/custom/image/f7deabe0-6a5c-11e8-8f18-73c4a2510a2b.png?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-08-15 00:00:13.331061

Powered by its Iron Core technology, the Energy Base offers up to 22 hours of energy storage in a modular, non-flammable design.
This platform addresses two critical pain points in the energy storage sector: safety (non-flammable chemistry) and scalability (modular architecture).
ESS's Energy Base competes directly with these technologies, but its non-flammable iron flow chemistry and U.S. manufacturing edge position it as a strong contender.
- Risks: - Execution Risks: Scaling production at Wilsonville and meeting delivery timelines for Energy Base projects are critical.","The energy storage sector is undergoing a seismic shift as demand for non-lithium, long-duration solutions accelerates. At the forefront of this transformation is ESS Tech, Inc. (NYSE: GWH), which has embarked on a strategic reset in 2025 to position itself as a leader in the long-duration energy storage (LDES) market. With a $31 million capital infusion, operational efficiency gains, and the launch of its proprietary Energy Base platform, ESS is betting big on a future where grid resilience and decarbonization drive demand for safe, scalable, and sustainable storage solutions. But does this reset translate into long-term value creation, or is ESS merely catching up to a crowded field?

Strategic Reset: Capital, Operations, and Leadership

ESS's second-quarter 2025 results underscore a disciplined approach to financial and operational restructuring. The company secured $31 million in new capital, including a $25 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (SEPA) with YA II PN, LTD, extending its operational runway and providing flexibility to scale deployments. This infusion is critical for a company that previously struggled with cash burn, but the real story lies in the 80% reduction in operating cash burn in June 2025 compared to Q1 averages. Such efficiency gains, coupled with a 294% year-over-year increase in GAAP revenue to $2.4 million, signal a pivot toward disciplined execution.

Leadership changes further reinforce this shift. The appointment of Jigish Trivedi as COO and Kate Suhadolnik as interim CFO brings seasoned expertise to a company that has historically faced management turnover. Kelly Goodman, the interim CEO, has emphasized a “sharper focus” on long-duration storage, a departure from ESS's earlier reliance on containerized solutions. These moves suggest a commitment to stability and strategic clarity, which are essential for navigating the complexities of the LDES market.

Energy Base: A Technological and Commercial Breakthrough

The launch of the Energy Base marks ESS's most significant product innovation to date. Powered by its Iron Core technology, the Energy Base offers up to 22 hours of energy storage in a modular, non-flammable design. This platform addresses two critical pain points in the energy storage sector: safety (non-flammable chemistry) and scalability (modular architecture). The first 8 MWh Energy Base order, secured in July 2025, validates the product's commercial viability, while over 1.1 GWh in submitted proposals highlight growing demand from Tier 1 customers.

ESS's “Made in the USA” model, with 98% of components sourced domestically, is another differentiator. This aligns with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which maintains Section 45X Production Tax Credits and expands incentives for domestic manufacturing. As global supply chains remain volatile, ESS's localized production reduces exposure to geopolitical risks and tariffs, a strategic advantage in a market where cost and reliability are paramount.

Competitive Landscape: Innovation and Challenges

The LDES market is no longer a niche. California's LDES program alone has allocated over $270 million to advance non-lithium technologies, with competitors like Form Energy (iron-air batteries) and Charge Bliss (zinc hybrid cathode systems) making headlines. ESS's Energy Base competes directly with these technologies, but its non-flammable iron flow chemistry and U.S. manufacturing edge position it as a strong contender.

However, challenges persist. The sector faces community opposition (NIMBYism), safety concerns, and regulatory hurdles. For example, a 2023 battery fire at a Terra-Gen facility in California raised questions about the reliability of certain LDES systems. ESS's non-flammable design mitigates this risk, but execution on deployment timelines and cost efficiency will be critical.

Market Dynamics and Policy Tailwinds

The demand for long-duration storage is being driven by three forces:

1. Grid Resilience: Extreme weather events and aging infrastructure are pushing utilities to adopt LDES for backup power and grid stability.

2. Renewable Integration: As solar and wind penetration grows, long-duration storage is essential for balancing intermittent generation.

3. Data Center and AI Demand: The surge in AI and cryptocurrency operations has created a $1,000 TWh+ energy demand by 2026, with ESS targeting this market with its Energy Base.

Policy support is equally robust. The Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits, combined with state-level mandates, have created a favorable environment for LDES. ESS's alignment with these policies—particularly its domestic manufacturing—positions it to benefit from federal incentives that could reduce project costs by 30% or more.

Investment Implications: Catalysts and Risks

ESS's strategic reset and Energy Base launch present a compelling case for long-term value creation, but investors must weigh several factors:

- Catalysts:

- Commercial Momentum: The 1.1 GWh in submitted proposals and first Energy Base sale indicate strong demand.

- Cost Efficiency: A 17.8-hour duration at reduced power and material cost reductions could drive margins higher.

- Policy Tailwinds: Section 45X credits and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provide a regulatory tailwind.

- Risks:

- Execution Risks: Scaling production at Wilsonville and meeting delivery timelines for Energy Base projects are critical.

- Competition: Form Energy's 100-hour iron-air and zinc-based systems from Eos Energy could erode ESS's market share.

- Valuation: ESS's stock has historically traded at a premium to peers, requiring strong revenue growth to justify multiples.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Play in a High-Growth Sector

ESS Tech's strategic reset—combining capital discipline, operational efficiency, and product innovation—positions it as a key player in the long-duration storage race. The Energy Base's non-flammable, modular design and U.S. manufacturing model address critical market needs, while policy tailwinds and growing demand for grid resilience create a favorable backdrop. However, execution risks and a competitive landscape filled with emerging technologies mean investors must remain cautious.

For those willing to take a long-term view, ESS offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on the energy transition. If the company can maintain its operational momentum, scale the Energy Base, and secure a leadership position in the LDES market, it could deliver substantial shareholder value. But as with any high-growth story, patience and a close watch on execution will be key.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-14 21:03:12.495638

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities on Wednesday approved $100 utility bill credits meant to defray the impact of surging electricity prices.

In a unanimous vote, the regulator’s three board members approved credits that will reduce residential monthly electricity bills by $50 in September and in October, part of state officials’ latest bid to curb energy costs amid summer heat and soaring rates.

“This should be helpful for people, but in no way solves the problem. I hope this helps some people get over the hump. This is a very difficult time,” said Commissioner Zenon Christodoulou.

All residential ratepayers are eligible for the credits, regardless of their income.

Electricity rates have surged nationwide, driven upward in part by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy demand, while New Jersey’s plans for new renewable generation — chiefly in the form of offshore wind — have largely failed to provide relief.

Wholesale electricity prices rose by roughly 20% in June and are due to rise as much as 5% when the results of a recent price-setting capacity auction take effect in June 2026. Regulators have said they expect prices to rise even further in a capacity auction planned for next July.

The credits will be funded by funds from the solar alternative compliance payment, which is paid by electricity suppliers that are unable to meet the state’s renewables standard, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which generates funds by auctioning tradeable emissions allowances to fossil fuel plants.

Solar funds, tallied at $263 million Wednesday, would be used before money from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which totaled $123 million Wednesday, Board of Public Utilities staff said.

The credits are part of a plan Gov. Phil Murphy and other state Democrats announced days after higher prices took effect in early June.

That month, the board approved a plan to defer $60 total from electricity bills in July and August, when high temperatures and air conditioning drive power use to a peak. Ratepayers are responsible for repaying those deferred balances, which do not accrue interest or other carrying costs, over the following six months.

“We want to make sure we’re doing everything we can, and we’ll continue to do everything we can with the resources that we have to reduce costs for ratepayers,” said Board of Public Utilities President Christine Guhl-Sadovy.

At the same time, the board approved other programs that extended $175 in bill credits to low-income ratepayers. Those credits are to be applied in equal installments over seven months, from August to February 2026. That benefit was paid last year as a single $175 credit to August utility bills.

Democrats have blamed PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states, for recent rate increases, arguing it has been too slow to connect chiefly renewable projects to its grid.

Republicans have blamed Murphy’s renewables-heavy energy goals and the administration’s focus on offshore wind, which has failed to stand up any new generation.

The state’s offshore wind projects appear dead in the water amid opposition from the Trump administration, which has paused or rescinded leases and permits for such projects, and lingering supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic.

The board on Wednesday approved an order terminating a contract with Atlantic Shores for a 1,509-megawatt wind farm off the coast of Atlantic City.

The developer requested that cancellation in June, citing federal uncertainty and the Trump administration’s withdrawal of a Clean Air Act permit needed for construction. The project’s first 762 megawatts of generation were due to come online in September 2027, with the remaining generation expected to start by April 2028.

Atlantic Shores sought to rebid that project, but the utilities board closed its fourth round of offshore wind solicitations without awarding any projects, citing uncertainty at the federal level.

Regulators acknowledged plans for wind generation would have to wait at least a few years. On Wednesday, the board approved an order delaying required in-service dates for offshore wind transmission infrastructure by two-and-a-half years.

Officials said the delay is meant to ease cost pressures by delaying transmission infrastructure investments, which ratepayers fund through their utility bills, without any electricity to bring to shore.

“Obviously, some federal uncertainty has created a situation where we need to make sure we’re acting in a way that we always do — on the best interest of ratepayers,” Guhl-Sadovy said. “This, along with some of the other actions today, are in response to some of those federal decisions around clean energy.”

Those projects, now required to be in service by January 2033, are meant to bring electricity from offshore wind turbines to the coast and prepare the grid for that power.

The order did little to shake environmental groups’ commitment to wind energy.

“Offshore wind is critical to our clean energy portfolio and to protecting our health, environment, and economy. Every delay forces our residents—especially low-income families and communities of color—to breathe dirty air and bear the brunt of climate change. We’ve been knocked down, but we’ll keep getting back up,” said Ed Potosnak, executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/PGR/2023/10/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4386393.webp,N,,2025-08-14 21:59:53.156238

As temperatures climb into the triple digits, homeowners across the Valley brace for the inevitable spike in their electricity bills. For many, a powerful and efficient air conditioning system isn’t a luxury; it’s a critical component of a safe and comfortable home. But what if you could upgrade to a state-of-the-art, energy-saving HVAC system—and make other crucial home performance improvements—for a fraction of the expected cost?

Thanks to landmark programs funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, that possibility is now a reality. Arizona has been allocated over $153 million in program funds to be distributed directly to homeowners through substantial rebates.

This opportunity is a game-changing way to enhance your comfort, drastically lower your monthly bills and increase your home’s value.

Reeis Air Conditioning believes every Arizona family deserves to be comfortable without breaking the bank. They have been at the forefront of these developments since they were first announced.

In August 2022, owner Todd Russo was featured on local programs discussing the future of these rebates. After two years of planning, the programs are finally here, and the savings are bigger than we ever imagined.

As one of the few contractors in Arizona approved to work under the new program guidelines, their mission is to guide homeowners through the process. This process isn’t just about a single rebate; it’s about strategically stacking multiple offers to significantly reduce — and in some cases almost completely cover — the cost of a brand-new, high-performance home comfort system.

Your guide to two new Arizona rebate programs

The Arizona Office of Resiliency has structured the funding into two distinct programs.

1. The HEAR Program (Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates) — Available now

The HEAR program is an income-contingent rebate program designed to help homeowners purchase new, energy-efficient electric appliances and systems.

The rebates are substantial and cover a wide range of improvements. Qualified homeowners can receive rebates up to the following amounts:

$8,000 for a new high-efficiency heat pump (for heating and cooling)

$4,000 for an electric load service center (panel) upgrade

$2,500 for new electric wiring

$1,750 for a new heat pump water heater

$1,600 for insulation, air sealing, and ventilation improvements

$840 for an electric stove, cooktop, range, oven, or heat pump clothes dryer.

How to qualify for HEAR rebates:

Qualification is based on your household’s annual income relative to the Area Median Income (AMI).

Up to 100% of costs covered: If your family’s annual income is less than 80% of the AMI, these rebates can cover the entire cost of your project, up to a $14,000 total cap.

Up to 50% of costs covered: If your family’s annual income is between 80% and 150% of the AMI, you can have 50% of your project cost covered by rebates, up to the $14,000 cap.

In the Phoenix metro area, this means a family could have an annual income between $117,850 and $222,200 (depending on household size) and still qualify for thousands of dollars in savings.

The program has specific guidelines and requires working with a state-approved, qualified contractor like Reeis to ensure all work meets program standards

2. The HOMES Program (Home Efficiency Rebate Program) — tentatively scheduled for late 2025

The second program — set to launch this fall — is the HOMES program. This initiative focuses on performance-based rebates.

Instead of a fixed amount per appliance, the rebate amount is determined by the total energy savings your retrofit project achieves. It’s a comprehensive approach that rewards homeowners for making their entire home more efficient.

The maximum rebate available under the HOMES program is $8,000 per home.

The program guidelines are still being finalized, but it will involve a detailed home energy analysis to create a custom retrofit plan that maximizes your energy savings and, therefore, your rebate.

Stacking your savings: beyond the state rebates

The $14,000 from the HEAR program is just the beginning. As a homeowner, you can stack these state rebates with existing federal tax credits and local utility rebates to achieve truly astonishing savings.

These additional, stackable incentives include:

Federal Heat Pump Tax Credit (25C): up to $2,000

Federal Energy Efficiency Tax Credit (25C): up to $1,200 for insulation and other improvements.

APS/SRP Utility Rebates: up to $1,000 for HVAC system replacement.

APS/SRP Duct Sealing Rebates: up to $1,000

APS/SRP Insulation Rebates: up to $600.

When you add it all up, the potential savings are staggering.

“Since 2009, Reeis has helped homeowners maximize financial incentives for programs like these,” Russo said. “We’ve built a system to manage every step of the process. It starts with an initial, no-obligation free consultation to determine if you and your home qualify. From there, they manage the entire process for you, getting you the maximum incentive for qualified improvements.”

In 16 years of managing these programs, this is the single largest incentive program Russo has ever seen. Many homeowners will receive total rebates and tax credits of more than $18,000.

Why trust Reeis?

Navigating the applications, income verifications and technical requirements for these programs can be complex and overwhelming. Choosing the right partner is crucial.

Reeis Air Conditioning is not only a qualified contractor under the State of Arizona program, but it is also the only Rosie on the House certified partner qualified to work under the HEAR and HOME rebate programs. This certification is your assurance that you are working with a contractor vetted for integrity, quality and customer service.

The Reeis Rebate Maximizer Consultation is designed to make this process simple and rewarding for you. They handle the paperwork, applications and coordination, ensuring you receive every single dollar you are entitled to without the headache.

Don’t wait—these funds are limited.

An allocation of $153 million sounds like a lot, but these funds are finite and available on a first-come, first-served basis. Once the money is claimed, the program will end. With the HEAR program already live, savvy homeowners are acting now to secure their share of the savings.

Don’t wait for your A/C to fail in the dead of summer. Take proactive steps today to secure a more comfortable and affordable future for your home.

Change is inevitable. As are transitions: the all-important means of adapting to changes.

Dutch researcher Derk Loorbach refers to transitions as the “fundamental changes within the culture, structure, and practices of societal systems.” To illustrate this notion, he developed a concept known as the ‘X-curve’ (below) — an application of these transition dynamics within a society or a specific context.

While this may sound complicated, the theory is simple: over time, new ‘things’ (the blue line) come along to replace old ‘things’ (the orange line) until the old ‘things’ become obsolete and the new ‘things’ become the new standard. For each of these ‘things’ are five stages: three before the transition (cross-over) happens, followed by two additional stages after the transition. Once the breakdown and phase-out transitions have truly started, there is no turning back — the institutionalization and stabilization of the new ‘thing’ has formally become the new societal norm.

Source: Drift for Transition, “X-Curve: a sensemaking tool to foster collective narratives on system change” (2023)

These stages of transition dynamics can be applied to just about anything. For example, in the business world, streaming services like Netflix (the new) have come to replace physical video rental stores like Blockbuster Video (the old). Outdated technologies are deemed unsustainable and are replaced by more efficient ones.

The X-curve popped into my brain recently after the International Energy Agency (IEA) released its 10th annual report, which highlighted that the world’s energy investment has reached $3.3 trillion and increased spending by 20% in the last decade. The report also looks at how energy spending in different categories has changed over the last decade.

See if you can spot the noteworthy pattern in their summary chart:

Source: International Energy Agency, World Energy Investment Report, 2025

Hmmm.

While not on the same axis, the dynamics of this chart and the X-chart are uncanny. Renewables, grids/storage, energy efficiency, nuclear and electrification all show signs of “building up”, while oil, natural gas, and coal all show signs of “breaking down”.

Perhaps there is a good reason for that.

“One Big Beautiful…”

The recent enactment of the U.S. Congress bill “H.R.1.” (more widely known by its vernacular name, the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) has brought more than anxiety to a large swath of Americans. Among the many issues forthcoming from its implementation are cuts in funding to agencies designed to protect the environment and the public, and an increase in funding to energy industries that have entered the breakdown phase.

H.R.1. stands as a foil to the prior administration’s “Inflation Reduction Act” (or IRA), and rather than compare and contrast the details of each bill, here is a table that summarizes the key differences between the two pieces of legislation specifically on renewable energy:

Whether you are a financial advisor, an investment professional, a business leader, an asset owner, a student, a teacher, a policymaker, or someone with stubborn friends — the information in this piece will help you in making the ECONOMIC and BUSINESS case for why renewable energy investments should continue in the United States: first by assessing how H.R.1.’s stance on renewables will harm the U.S. economy, and second why Republican lawmakers should reconsider their stance on renewable energy investments in the U.S. Ultimately, H.R.1. could not only spell trouble for the U.S. energy sector, but for the U.S. economy overall for years to come.

(NOTE: While I am well aware that there are many reasons to consider clean energy investments, please understand that I am intentionally laboring under the assumption that those needing convincing need to hear the pecuniary argument. Here it is.)

6 key reasons H.R.1. renewable energy stance will harm the U.S. economy

Undermines clean energy competitiveness: By weakening the incentives outlined in the IRA for renewables and green technologies, we will see a decline in investments in the American renewable energy market, which, up until now, has been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy. The rest of the world is making sizable investments in renewables and green technologies. By doubling down on oil and gas, plus stripping their support for solar and wind, the U.S. will quickly fall behind global leaders like China and the European Union in exports and clean energy innovation.

Rise in climate-related economic risks: Whether or not it is ‘believed’, the reality is that the burning of fossil fuels exacerbates the risks of climate change. A 2021 study concluded that over 99% of peer-reviewed scientific papers agreed on the link between fossil fuels and climate change; and the 1% that disagreed with the consensus contained errors or could not be replicated. As such, increased production of oil and gas will undermine efforts to mitigate the risks of climate change and thereby increase the likelihood, frequency, and intensity of climate-related disasters — hurricanes, floods, wildfires, severe thunderstorms, droughts, etc. The U.S. already spends in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually on these disasters; increasing their frequency would lead to instability and the potential collapse of the insurance industry, crop failures, food price inflation, and supply chain disruptions.

Neglects renewable energy transition momentum: As previously stated, the global investment in clean energy reached $3.3 trillion in 2025. By ignoring this shift, H.R.1. will cause capital to be directed to other countries that are more aligned with net-zero transition goals. This also risks the long-term financial stability of companies and workers dependent on carbon-intensive industries; rather than investing in viable alternatives for them, their entire existence is put into jeopardy.

Opportunity miss for job creation: H.R.1. completely misses the mark when it comes to seizing the opportunity for innovation and competition. Even the U.S. Department of Energy has stated that jobs related to renewable energy employ three times more workers than those in the ‘traditional’ energy sector. The DOE also stated that renewable energy accounted for more than 84% of net new electricity generation jobs in 2022. H.R.1. does not provide any support or provisions for clean energy workforce development or transition strategies, which will potentially cost the U.S. millions of jobs both now and in the future.

Decrease in U.S. energy resilience: H.R.1. ignores the fact that grid modernization and renewable integration are both necessary to prevent blackouts and reduce America’s dependence on the increasingly volatile fossil fuel markets. The bill does not address any investments in distributed renewables, storage, and microgrids, which would increase local energy security. This could be a whole story on its own: an increased reliance and investments in artificial intelligence (AI), but offering no substantial balance in energy modernization, is like investing in a Ferrari with bicycle tires. It just won’t be possible to use AI applications in the future at current energy levels. According to the World Economic Forum, the computing power required for sustaining AI’s rise is doubling roughly every 100 days. In order to reach a tenfold boost in AI model efficiency, the computation power demanded could surge by over 10,000 times its current usage before it’s fully optimized.

Weakens U.S. global leadership on climate: Throughout the 20th Century, the United States was seen as the gold standard in many technological and diplomatic aspects. Those days seem to be in the past. Withdrawing virtually all support for climate goals undermines our diplomatic credibility, trade opportunities, and participation in emerging international carbon markets. Not only has the U.S. lost credibility, but it could potentially become even more expensive in the future to do business with the rest of the world. The European Union and other nations are already considering imposing carbon border taxes on the U.S., and further investments in fossil fuels outlined in H.R.1. could make U.S. exports more expensive and less competitive in the global markets.

The “Upside”(?)

While the “Lower Energy Costs Act” component of H.R.1. is marketed to the public as a way to reduce energy costs and increase the U.S. energy independence, there are many long-term negative consequences for the U.S. economy overall. If we zoom out, none of the provisions in H.R.1. help to set up the U.S. energy sector for long-term success in a global market that is actively shifting from fossil fuels towards renewables (see the IEA’s chart way above).

There would be an opportunity for positive growth IF the reform were also paired with pro-renewable policies. However, the bill’s rollback on incentives from the IRA and the emphasis on fossil fuels will ultimately:

Reduce the U.S. competitiveness in the renewable energy market

Limit job growth in the emerging energy industry

Increase investor exposure to volatile fossil-fuel markets and climate risks

The “positives” in H.R.1. related to the U.S. energy markets are 1) largely short-term and 2) restricted. If the U.S. doesn’t have strong, sustained support for clean energy infrastructure and development, there won’t be any long-term benefits realized for the American energy sector. By the time the advocates of H.R.1. recognize this reality, and it will be too late to play catch-up.

6 economic data-driven reasons for Republicans to reconsider H.R.1.’s stance on renewable energy

When it becomes clear how much it costs to avoid investing in renewable energy, and how little there is to gain, this is where progress can happen. But hopefully, having a safe, clean environment is a good enough reason to consider renewable energy in the first place.

Here are six objective, data-driven points on why it is in the long-term economic interest of Republican lawmakers, and the GOP broadly, to reconsider positions that limit renewable energy development:

Economic growth and job creation: While no Republicans in the House or Senate voted to pass the IRA, it was on track to generate 1.4-1.5 million additional clean-energy jobs by 2030, at the same time increasing the American GDP by 0.84-0.88%. Since its passing, more than 334,000 clean energy jobs and $422 billion in investments have been distributed across 48 states and Puerto Rico — the majority of those funds have gone to Republican-held districts. Just one of many instances of growth: in New York, clean energy investments created nearly 29,000 new jobs and brought $115.5 billion in private capital to the state since 2022.

Republican-district benefits: Expanding upon that last point, around 75% of the federal clean-energy funds under the IRA have gone into Republican-held districts, which have helped both local economic gains and contributed to their political support. Out of these investments with these funds, there were approximately 405 projects in total that delivered $204.7 billion in capital and created a total of 216,322 new jobs in clean energy across Republican districts.

Clean energy economics in red states: In many red states, wind energy is now the primary source of electricity generation. In 2022, for instance, Kansas generated nearly 47% of its electricity from wind. The top four states in wind generation were all Republican-leaning states (Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas), and about 70% of U.S. wind power overall comes from red states — a fact that ought to demonstrate that this type of energy use is driven by economic, and not ideological, reasons. The continued investments in these states are expected to yield even more positive economic results for their respective populations. Building 1,000 megawatt (MW) of new wind capacity in Kansas is anticipated to bring in $1.08 billion in local economic benefits…(in addition to saving water and reducing carbon emissions).

Broader economic gains and risk mitigation: According to Goldman Sachs in a TIME article, renewable energy investments could drive up to $16 trillion in global investments over the next ten years. Remember, they’re currently at $3.3 trillion. When it comes to externalities, the savings are quite substantial: Yale Center for Environmental Communication says public health and climate benefits from clean energy could save the U.S. economy $118-$200 billion by 2030, due to reduced air pollution and impacts from natural disasters. Additionally, while H.R.1. is expected to increase the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next ten years, the IRA alone is expected to reduce the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over 20 years by improving energy security and promoting efficiency.

Voter preferences and public sentiment: In June 2025, a survey from Pew Research found that about 61% of Republicans support more solar power, despite the fact that overall support has declined in recent years. Approximately 58% of registered Republican voters said they would back renewable energy integration in their state’s energy mix, in particular when the question was framed as having energy independence and economic opportunities. On the whole, public support for renewable energy remains strong, with 79% of registered voters supporting renewable energy generation on public land and 65% supporting building solar farms.

Strategic economic positioning: When it comes to innovation, clean energy has become a major driver for U.S. manufacturing — something that the current administration seems determined to return domestically. To interrupt that process risks giving a competitive edge to other economies, like China. The Climate Leadership Council says that a carbon dividend model linked to renewables could potentially generate $1.4 trillion in new capital investment and create 1.6 million new jobs by 2035. Additionally, economic models also show that the United States’ GDP could reach $190 billion more on an annual basis by 2036 if carbon-efficient manufacturing were to align with renewable energy expansion.

The 30 second summary — Why reconsider?

Jobs and investments: renewable expansions grow local economies and create jobs, especially in GOP districts.

Public support: voters favor clean energy when tied to jobs, reliability, and independence.

Economic competitiveness: renewables and clean manufacturing support innovation and protect U.S. leadership globally.

Fiscal and health savings: reduced climate and health risks, delivering long-term economic relief across both federal and state budgets.

Our economic Darwinism

Loorbach’s conceptualization of transitions using the “x-curve” is not about politics — it’s about momentum.

Global economies, markets, technology, and local communities are already advancing toward cleaner, more efficient energy sources. H.R.1 may try to stall this shift, but the tide of economic logic runs in the other direction.

The numbers are clear: renewable energy is creating jobs, drawing private capital, boosting GDP, and delivering savings on everything from healthcare costs to disaster recovery. These benefits are flowing not just to blue states or red states, but to every corner of the country.

The biggest question for investors to ask is whether we seize this moment or watch others take the lead. Aligning with the energy transition isn’t about ideology—it’s about ensuring America remains competitive, resilient, and prosperous in a rapidly changing global market. In business, as in nature, the systems that adapt are the ones that survive. The choice before us is whether to adapt now, on our terms, or be forced to later…but at a far greater cost.

This collaborative effort, enabled through the State’s Energy Storage Solutions program, will focus on deploying residential solar systems and battery energy storage to help lower energy costs, improve grid resilience, and advance Connecticut’s clean energy goals.

Enabled by GoodLeap’s AI-powered proprietary software, GoodGrid, the fastest growing VPP network in the US, and integrated with the utility’s Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), the VPPs can aggregate thousands of residential solar and storage systems into coordinated networks to provide grid services, such as peak demand reduction, helping reduce strain on the electrical grid, potentially deferring distribution infrastructure investments for utilities, and will better position Connecticut to meet its clean energy deployment targets. This can help lower costs for all homeowners as more expensive sources of energy can be avoided during these peaks, and will increase access to distributed energy resources.

“Together with GoodLeap, we are working to ensure that Connecticut residents — especially those in vulnerable communities — benefit from clean, resilient, and affordable energy solutions,” said Bryan Garcia, President and CEO of the Connecticut Green Bank. “We saw GoodLeap leading on VPPs in other states around the country and felt that their technology, products and services were needed in Connecticut to help our families realize the benefits of these distributed energy resources. This initiative will bring new resources to homeowners and ratepayers while supporting our state’s climate and energy goals.”

Eligible Connecticut homeowners will receive monthly cash rewards through the GoodGrid cash rewards, advancing the goals of the Energy Storage Solutions program. The Green Bank will also support the partnership through technical assistance to streamline project development and interconnection, as well as stakeholder and community engagement to boost awareness and participation while ensuring equitable access.

“We are thrilled to work with the Connecticut Green Bank to scale residential clean energy and energy storage solutions across the state,” said Daniel Lotano, Chief Operating and Strategy Officer at GoodLeap. “Our technology has already helped tens of thousands of homeowners across the United States earn money for supporting a more reliable grid, and we’re glad to bring our AI powered VPP software and our deep residential customer expertise to Connecticut.”

Through this agreement, Connecticut Green Bank and GoodLeap will partner in ongoing collaboration on performance metrics, grid integration, and community impact reporting.

The Energy Storage Solutions program is overseen by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, is paid for by electric ratepayers, and is administered by the Connecticut Green Bank, Eversource, and UI. For more information on the Energy Storage Solutions program, visit https://energystoragect.com.

About the Connecticut Green Bank

The Connecticut Green Bank was established by the Connecticut General Assembly in 2011 as the nation’s first state-level green bank and has since supported the creation of nearly 30,000 green jobs in the state, while reducing the energy cost burden on over 77,000 families, businesses, and nonprofits. The Green Bank’s vision is a planet protected by the love of humanity and its mission is to confront climate change by increasing and accelerating investment into Connecticut’s green economy to create more resilient, healthier, and equitable communities. This is accomplished by leveraging limited public resources to scale-up and mobilize private capital investment into Connecticut. In 2017, the Connecticut Green Bank received the Innovations in American Government Award from the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation for their “Sparking the Green Bank Movement” entry. In 2021, the Green Bank’s model was expanded to include new areas of environmental infrastructure, related to climate adaptation and resiliency, land conservation, parks and recreation, agriculture, water, waste and recycling, and environmental markets, including carbon offsets and ecosystem services. To date, the Green Bank has mobilized nearly $3 billion into the State’s green economy. This has reduced the energy costs for thousands of families and businesses, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change and worsen public health.

Iowa, the nation's leader in wind energy, generates about 60% of its electricity from renewables.

Wright also defended his review of national climate assessments, arguing that public discourse on climate change is divorced from data.

AMES — U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright says it's time to end tax credits that have helped make Iowa a wind energy leader.

Speaking Thursday, Aug. 14 during a visit to Ames National Laboratory, Wright said wind energy incentives “have been around for 33 years, and I think you've seen a mature industry develop.” Wind and solar energy need to “compete in the marketplace” like other sources, he said.

“It doesn’t mean that wind is going away” in Iowa, said U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, who joined Wright at the federal lab along with U.S. Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, also Iowa Republicans.

Iowa gets about 60% of its annual energy from renewable sources, mostly wind. It's the state with the largest share nationally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“We’ll continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines,” said Ernst, adding that she’s talking with the Trump administration to ensure that Iowa wind and solar projects qualify for incentives.

The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" tax and spending measure the Senate gave final approval in July sets aggressive deadlines that new renewable energy projects must meet to qualify for the credits before they disappear.

In July, Alliant Energy proposed investing up to $3 billion to build 1,000 megawatts of wind energy over the next two years, and in February, MidAmerican Energy said it plans to build 800 megawatts of solar energy along with a $600 million natural gas ""peaker"" plant in southern Iowa.

Think tanks and advocacy groups have said eliminating wind and solar incentives would slow Iowa's adoption of renewable energy and raise residents' utility bills.

Wright on Thursday also defended efforts to review past national climate assessments, telling reporters that climate change is a “real thing. It’s a true physical phenomenon. But it's just not even close to the world's greatest problem.”

Here’s what to know about the energy secretary’s visit to the Ames federal lab with companions who also included U.S. Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, Republicans who are chairs of key energy committees.

U.S. must mine, refine critical minerals, Wright, others say

Wright touted the importance of the lab’s critical materials research a day after the Energy Department’s announcement that it will pour nearly $1 billion into speeding the development of U.S. critical minerals and materials, used in everything from cell phones to electric vehicle batteries.

He and the congressional members said the U.S. needs to mine and refine the critical minerals that are available nationally, instead of relying on China and other countries for them.

“We’ve outsourced that overseas,” said Wright, former CEO of Liberty Energy, a Colorado oil and gas company. “It’s become a national defense problem for us. It’s become a medical problem for us.”

The Ames laboratory, one of 17 nationally, “is a leader in bringing these technologies and capabilities back to our country,” said Wright, an engineer, noting that there are “92 naturally occurring elements” and “everything we do is made up from combinations of those elements.”

The Energy Department said Wednesday it would make nearly $1 billion in funding available to “advance and scale mining, processing and manufacturing technologies across key stages of the critical minerals and materials supply chains.""

Westerman, the House Committee on Natural Resources chair, said Alaska alone holds 49 critical minerals. “We’ve got to start mining more,” he said. “We can’t just mine it, we’ve got to refine it. We’ve got to make it into those useful metals that go into all those components.""

Then “we can start manufacturing with it,” he said, adding that refining the minerals boosts their value by 650%.

While environmentalists have raised concerns about mining in Alaska, Miller-Meeks said the U.S. can better protect the environment and workers who mine and refine critical minerals than China and other countries.

Wright defends challenges to established climate science

Critics have called Wright's decision to review past national climate assessment reports as an upending of climate science.

Last month, the Energy Department issued a report concluding that ""carbon dioxide (CO2)-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and that aggressive mitigation strategies could be more harmful than beneficial.""

Wright said he asked five scientists to examine climate data because the ""public discourse around climate change is so divorced from the actual data and facts.""

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the ""influence of human activity on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact"" and that climate change ""is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe,"" leading to ""losses and damages to nature and people.""

But Wright said concern over climate change has been used “as a cudgel to make energy more expensive, to export jobs overseas, to make kids have nightmares… and for young people to not want to have children because they think the world's going to be terrible and dangerous going forward.”

The agency's report helped support the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposal last month to rescind a 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment finding that is the foundation for regulating the gases as a pollutant.",https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/-mm-/1fecae5856e58374cc9e1c0fd6dcc3c6aae79d4e/c=0-293-5760-3547/local/-/media/2017/04/18/IAGroup/DesMoines/636281232925835548-WindPower1.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,N,,2025-08-14 21:01:58.683628

“EPA’s unprecedented rescission ignores the challenges Iowans face in protecting a critical public health resource — our drinking water,” he said.
In late June, the Des Moines River was reported to have nitrate levels of 14.57 mg/L.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limits nitrate levels in drinking water to 10 milligrams per liter.
Elevated nitrate levels in drinking water also can be harmful to babies and pregnant people.","Less than a year after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency added segments of five Iowa rivers to the impaired waters list for nitrate, the same agency — now operating under the Trump administration — has rescinded the decision.

The move comes during a summer when Iowa has seen elevated levels of nitrate in some of its rivers.

The EPA’s region 7 office — which covers Iowa and much of the Midwest — on July 11 notified the Iowa Department of Natural Resources that the agency had reversed its November decision to add seven segments of the Cedar, Des Moines, Iowa, Raccoon and South Skunk rivers on Iowa’s list of impaired waterways.

The letter from the EPA to the Iowa DNR stated that the major rivers in Iowa are not treated as exceeding the nitrate standard for purposes of the Clean Water Act.

The federal Clean Water Act — which was expanded in 1972 — establishes how states can regulate the discharge of pollutants into waterways across the country.

When a body of water does not meet its state’s standards, it is considered “impaired.”

Under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, states are required to submit a list to the EPA every two years identifying impaired waterways, along with a plan to mitigate the pollution.

In 2024, the Iowa DNR submitted a list of 577 water bodies with nearly 750 impaired segments to the EPA.

Jason Taylor, the executive director for Bur Oak Land Trust, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting natural landscapes and advancing biodiversity in Eastern Iowa said the decision harms Iowans.

“It is unfortunate that federal and state officials refuse to acknowledge what everyone knows: Iowa's water quality is abysmal,” Taylor said. “Playing games to delist known polluted waterways only protects the interests of those that are doing the polluting, not those forced to drink the water.”

Taylor said that Bur Oak Land Trust is currently doing conservation work that will double the size of the organization’s protected watershed on the lower Cedar River but that conservation efforts by Bur Oak — and other groups in the region — won’t solve the problem.

“While we have the support of the community to do this work, to make a long lasting impact we also need support from state agencies and lawmakers,” he said.

In a statement, Michael Schmidt, who is general counsel for the Iowa Environmental Counsel, said the efforts to delist the Iowa water bodies for nitrate are “clearly misguided.”

“This action undermines the public process and the public trust in the agencies charged with keeping our water clean. The public already had (an) opportunity to comment and overwhelmingly supported the listing that reflected real-life conditions in these rivers,” Schmidt said. ""We call on EPA and DNR to engage in a public process and bring Iowans together to address nitrate concerns that threaten the health and economic well-being of people across Iowa, rather than taking action behind closed doors.

“EPA’s unprecedented rescission ignores the challenges Iowans face in protecting a critical public health resource — our drinking water,” he said.

David Cwiertny, director of the Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination at the University of Iowa, said the move by the EPA is “troubling.”

The decision “basically ignores monitoring data that shows these water body segments have contained unsafe levels of nitrate based on their use as drinking water sources,” Cwiertny said, who is also the director for UI’s Environmental Policy Research Program. “What is the point of having numeric criteria and water quality standards based on designated use, which are the foundation of the Clean Water Act, if they aren’t going to be used in determinations as to whether a water body is impaired?”

Summer nitrate spikes

The EPA’s decision comes several weeks after many major rivers in Iowa experienced nitrate spikes.

On July 2, the Raccoon River — which runs through Des Moines — reached a nitrate level of 16.04 mg/L. In late June, the Des Moines River was reported to have nitrate levels of 14.57 mg/L.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limits nitrate levels in drinking water to 10 milligrams per liter.

In Cedar Rapids, nitrate levels were slightly lower as the city reassured residents that the water was safe to consume. In late June, the Cedar River’s nitrate level was 12.9 mg/L, but the two water treatment plants were measuring nitrate levels of 9.0 mg/L and 7.2 mg/L.

“Iowa has just gone through an extended period where rivers across the state have had levels of nitrate that make them unreliable as drinking water sources. Iowans are rightly concerned about the safety of their drinking water supplies,” Cwiertny said. “This move ignores those concerns, and increases the likelihood that a water system reliant on these segments will eventually not be able to provide safe drinking water to their consumers.”

Chris Jones, a vocal water quality advocate with the Driftless Water Defenders group and former researcher with the University of Iowa, said he believes that by getting rid of the water impairment listing, there will be more room for new dischargers to come in.

“What they're doing here is they're essentially canceling the Clean Water Act. They're trying to get around the restrictions of the Clean Water Act to get new point source discharges in the state,” Jones said. “We're trading our water quality for some proposed economic development. We're flat out trading.”

Health impacts

Colleen Fowle, water program director at the Iowa Environmental Council, said the risks of nitrate in Iowa’s drinking water are significant.

Nitrate has been linked to some types of cancers, particularly colon, kidney and stomach cancers, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Elevated nitrate levels in drinking water also can be harmful to babies and pregnant people. The contaminant has been linked to “blue baby syndrome,” a life-threatening condition that can reduce an infant’s ability to carry oxygen through the bloodstream.

Fowle said Iowans are living with these risks every day.

“Drinking water utilities around the state have struggled to ensure people receive water (that’s) safe for their families. This summer in particular has provided a clear picture of the consequences of high nitrate in our drinking water sources,” she said. ""Iowans across the state have been concerned about nitrate in drinking water on all the rivers that EPA has decided to remove from the impaired waters list. All have regularly exceeded the drinking water standard, but not all the cities relying on them have treatment systems to remove nitrate.“

Larry Stone, an Elkader-based water quality advocate and conservation writer said decisions regarding water quality should come down from scientists.

“Whether these classifications come from state or federal officials, we Iowans deserve to have scientists, not politicians or bureaucrats or industrial agriculture apologists, assess the health of our rivers,” he said.

The latest round of California funding from the CEC will be available for charging locations statewide.","California is moving forward with an incentive program to expand electric vehicle (EV) charging, opening up millions of dollars in grant funding as the federal government restarts a similar car-charging incentive program.

The California Energy Commission (CEC) has made $55 million available for the further buildout of high-speed charging. The Fast Charge California Project will rebate up to 100 percent of the installation costs for EV fast chargers, as part of the California Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Project (CALeVIP). The program funds projects that are “shovel ready,” to speed development, according to Harrison Reilly, an information officer with the CEC media and public communications office.

“The California Energy Commission continues to analyze state needs to develop funding opportunities that help address all of California’s electric vehicle charging needs,” he said via email. “This includes ensuring equitable access throughout the state.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) recently released its new guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which received $5 billion in funding from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Federal Highway Administration paused NEVI in February to allow federal officials to issue new guidance “to align with current U.S. DOT policy and priorities,” according to a memo.

CALeVIP is being administered by the Center for Sustainable Energy, a national nonprofit focused on expanding clean transportation. This latest round of funding follows Golden State Priority Project 1, which has activated 179 charging ports with about a dozen more expected; and Golden State Priority Project 2, which provided $38 million in funding.

As of February, California, the nation’s largest electric car market, had some 178,500 public and shared private electric vehicle chargers, according to state data. This includes nearly 16,400 DC fast chargers.

California’s strategy to deploy more car charging parallels Biden administration policies, which sought to build out a network of 500,000 fast chargers nationwide as part of NEVI. USDOT recently released new guidance which removes requirements around the distance between chargers. Original NEVI rules required charging stations be 50 miles apart along major roadways like interstates.

“Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure,” USDOT Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.” The guidance release — which gets the NEVI program back on track — has been welcomed by industry watchers.

""We are excited to see this critical program back in motion,” Cat Plein, development and communications director at Forth Mobility, an Oregon-based EV policy and advocacy group, said, adding that even though the federal government relaxed rules related to equity, resiliency or emergency preparedness, states are still free to include these in their own transportation planning policies.

“We urge states that have invested in thoughtful planning to stick with it and make those priorities central to their charging investments,” Plein said via email.

Relaxing the 50-mile distance requirement between charging stations, Plein said, “could bring useful flexibility, especially in rural regions, but we hope states honor their current charging commitments and keep delivering for the communities they serve.”

“We are particularly encouraged to see the new, simple process for states to declare their fast-charging corridors complete,” she said. “This will free up funds for more community-based charging — something many states can and should act on quickly.”

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said he welcomed the regulatory certainty, and the green light it offers for the further development of charging infrastructure.

“NEVI was designed for states to distribute funding based on their specific needs. Finalizing the guidance ensures that this important work will continue,” Gore said in a statement.

Regardless of actions taken by Washington, Reilly said California is poised for a green transportation future. CALeVIP’s Fast Charge California Project, which is state-funded, is “one of many funding mechanisms that the Energy Commission utilizes to deploy EV chargers,” he said. “California prides itself as one of the country’s leaders in clean energy and will continue its leadership role into the future, working with the private market to ensure the economic and jobs benefits of EVs and infrastructure.”

A full 87 NEVI-funded sites are now open, according to the EV States Clearinghouse database dashboard. Those projects only account for $45.8 million, according to the dashboard, leaving the bulk of its nearly $5 billion in funding still to be distributed and spent. The latest round of California funding from the CEC will be available for charging locations statewide.

“We’ve tailored it a bit so that it’s sort of market-driven,” Evan Wright, director of electric vehicle infrastructure and operations at the Center for Sustainable Energy, said. “We do still prioritize disadvantaged communities, low-income communities, and tribal applications. However, that’s not a requirement anymore.”

To qualify for the $55,000 per-port rebates, chargers must deliver at least 150 kilowatts of power per plug. Chargers delivering 275 kilowatts of power or more qualify for a $100,000 rebate per port. Chargers must also meet Energy Star requirements, be operational for at least six years, and provide charging utilization data for six years, giving planners data related to how often they are used, and how this has changed over time.

“That’s important for us to inform the design of future projects and programs,” Wright said. “We want to see how much these chargers are being utilized, and are installers installing equipment that is operational, giving the uptime requirements.”

The all-Republican Corporation Commission voted 5-0 to direct staff to take the first steps to repeal the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, or REST, rules, first adopted by the commission nearly two decades ago.

The rules require many utility companies to obtain at least 15% of their electricity from renewable sources, with 30% of that coming from sources like residential rooftop solar panels.

Commissioners argued the rules were no longer needed.

“I don't think that there's going to be any impact, or at least minimal impact, on the solar or wind or any kind of renewable industry,” Commissioner Nick Myers said. “They are self-sufficient enough as it is.”

Renewable energy and environmental advocates agreed that the rules have been effective in increasing the amount of renewable energy used by Arizona’s utilities to provide power to the state

“The outcome of that policy, in two decades, renewable energy and renewable energy with storage, now provides greater reliability, lower costs, stable costs, and lower water use than fossil fuels,” said former Arizona Energy Office director Amanda Ormond, a clean energy consultant.

But they disagreed that the rules are no longer needed.

Autumn Johnson with the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association acknowledged that Arizona’s major utilities exceed the 15% renewable requirement included in the rule.

However, she argued that could change as energy demands grow and utilities continue to invest in non-renewable sources to meet it, including a $5.3 billion gas pipeline from Texas.

“There is absolutely no certainty that the utilities will remain at 15%,” she said, pointing to APS’ recent decision to get rid of its own zero-carbon goals.

And critics argued that the rules are needed now more than ever to protect ratepayers from price volatility, pointing to data showing renewable energy can be more cost-effective than its fossil fuel counterparts.

Financial services firm Lazard recently found that wind and solar “remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”

However, the five Republican commissioners were in lock step prior to the vote, arguing it was the market, not regulators, that should determine where utilities purchase their energy.

“I've heard firsthand from ratepayers across the state that the importance of reliable energy at the most affordable rates is where they want us to focus,” Commissioner Lea Márquez Peterson said. “That's why I support an all-of-the-above approach to our energy generation and the continued use of all source RFPs.”

The commissioners argued that all-source RFP process, which calls on utilities to prioritize cost and reliability when sourcing new electric generation, ensures utilities are picking the best options for ratepayers, whether that’s solar, gas or another technology.

And Commissioner Rachel Walden said that, if solar and other renewable energy options are as affordable as their supporters say, utilities will continue to purchase them.

“Certainly renewables will continue to be an option, and in a competitive marketplace, will have a role to play,” she said.

Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, who voted in favor of the REST rules as a Republican member of the Corporation Commission in 2006, also claimed the current commission isn’t going through the correct process to repeal the rules, which could violate the law.

A spokesman for the attorney general declined to say whether Mayes plans to file suit against the commission.

“We are evaluating all legal options,” spokesman Richie Taylor said.

The vote on Thursday won’t immediately repeal the REST Rules. The change must clear several other steps, including opportunities for public comment, before a final vote that could occur sometime next year, according to a Commission spokesperson.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/65c0bec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x788+0+169/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fs3fs-public%2FArizona-Corporation-Commission-2023.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 20:02:56.157481

He toured the Ames National Laboratory, a government owned physics and chemistry facility on Iowa State's campus, along with members of Iowa's federal delegation.

The lab was initially founded in 1947, five years after ISU chemistry professor Harley Wilhelm played a key role in the creation of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project.

“We built Ames National Laboratory right here on that site,"" Wright told press during the tour. ""And it’s leading today in so many of the development of new materials, reshoring dependencies from overseas and innovating new materials.”

That includes new developments in nuclear fusion energy, which scientists have been working at replicating for decades.

“These things require advanced materials, that requires chemistry, that requires processes, and that requires scientists ceaselessly working on these problems,” Wright said.

It also requires funding. Wright says he expects the web of 17 national labs to be safe in the midst of federal spending cuts across the board.

“Of course, when I got there the original idea was 'let's cut everything,'"" Wright said. ""'Let's shrink everything. We need to shrink our spending from the government.' But the smallest, and potentially no cuts, will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future.”

He says that's in contrast to private science subsidies.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denied an appeal of the EPA’s cancellation of the grant that was paying for the study, a spokesperson for Louisville’s air pollution regulator said.

The Lantern previously reported the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District was notified by the EPA in March that a $1 million grant for the study would be terminated because it was “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, agency priorities.” It was one of hundreds of canceled EPA grants, the majority involving environmental justice programs. The study was set to benefit predominantly Black neighborhoods in West Louisville.

The Louisville agency told the Lantern in May it would contest the grant termination through an internal EPA process. But Madd Mudd, a spokesperson for the air pollution district, in a statement Thursday to the Lantern said the appeal was rejected as Louisville Public Media previously reported.

“Clearly this is not the outcome we hoped for, but we will continue to keep our options open and conversations will continue with the county attorney’s office and our partners on the project about our path forward and other potential work together,” Mudd said.

The grant was set to pay for placing canisters and monitors measuring volatile organic compounds and airborne metals. Some of the monitors were to be placed downwind of Rubbertown, a collection of chemical plants near West Louisville that has been the subject of complaints from the adjacent neighborhoods and beyond. The monitors would have compared the levels of air pollution and health impacts to those in a study conducted in the early 2000s that found unacceptably high levels of a number of cancer-causing pollutants.

The Lantern did not receive a response to an emailed request for comment sent Thursday to a regional EPA office. When asked about the grant termination, an EPA spokesperson previously told the Lantern the former Biden administration “shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

The air monitoring was part of a larger community project studying the health impacts of air pollution involving multiple organizations. Arnita Gadson, the executive director of the West Jefferson County Community Task Force, one of the groups involved in the community project, told the Lantern the rejection of the appeal was “terrible.” She said a key part of the community project was educating local health care professionals on how to treat exposure to air pollution.

“This grant was to help people who had been disproportionately exposed to chemicals from the Rubbertown complex through no fault of theirs,” Gadson said.

Gadson said she wasn’t sure what would happen with the efforts to study the health impacts of air pollution near Rubbertown.

She said the community task force did a previous study with the University of Louisville that heard from people who were exposed to pollution from Rubbertown before the creation of the EPA in 1970.

“We found a few people who were still living, and the stories they told of living close to those companies — they were horrible,” Gadson said. “These are not ‘DEI’ people.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47652/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_1088-1024x6951755216061.jpg?h=3ac079aa&itok=jGk8iRdU,N,,2025-08-14 20:03:30.427357
