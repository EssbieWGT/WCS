Its most recent foray into American-market EVs involved a partnership with General Motors, which resulted in the Honda Prologue and the Acura ZDX crossovers.

The Prologue has had decent success so far, but the ZDX bowed out when EV tax credits vanished. Yet Honda wants more—and wants to do things its way. So it’s investing billions of dollars into a brand-new, bespoke electric architecture that will underpin several new EVs by the end of the decade. It's called the 0 Series, and it may be the most important new vehicle platform of Honda's modern era.

One of the first cars to wear the 0 Series badge is simply called the Saloon. It’s a futuristic, razor-like sedan proudly positioned as the brand’s flagship, which will take on some of the most high-tech EVs out there.

So let’s see what Honda has in store.

Honda 0 Series: An All-New Platform

The Saloon, which debuted as a concept car in 2024, will ride on Honda’s new in-house platform. It’s a vertically integrated architecture that the automaker can have full control over, allowing it to make quick changes to the hardware and patch software issues with over-the-air updates without having to wait on third-party suppliers and developers.

Honda has gone to great lengths to integrate light materials into the cars’ construction, and is betting big on megacasting technology and a new, AI-enabled software suite that can integrate lidar sensors and ultimately offer Level 3 ""eyes-off"" driving capabilities.

Honda's 0 Series platform revolves around three key words: Thin, Light and Wise.

The platform itself can accept battery packs rated at 800 volts, which enables them to charge faster than more mainstream 400-volt alternatives, as we have seen with 800-volt cars like the Kia EV9 and Porsche Macan. Honda has not yet offered official specifications for charging power and charging session times, but it’s aiming for a 15% to 80% top-up in 15 minutes or less.

It’s also worth noting that some 0 Series-based models could get a 400-volt battery system to keep costs down, but that’s unlikely to happen with the flagship Saloon.

Honda said that it would offer two versions of its e-axle motor: one with 241 horsepower (180 kilowatts), and the other with 67 hp (50 kW). In other words, the most powerful version of the 0 Series Saloon would have a total of 482 hp, which is not record-breaking by any stretch of the imagination. But if Honda manages to keep the weight down as it promises, it should be enough for any driving scenario.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Design

There’s no way around this: the Honda 0 Series Saloon is a head-turner. The four-door EV is low to the ground, thanks to the slim battery pack nestled inside the floor, and looks like something out of a futuristic cartoon.

It’s a razor-shaped sedan that’s bound to get everybody’s attention once it hits the streets, but there’s no guarantee that Honda will stay true to the concept’s looks once the production version rolls off the assembly line.

The original show car did go through some modifications for its second public appearance, with the huge double doors being replaced with a set of more conventional four doors. Inside, everything screams “future,” from the profiled seats to the full-width screen and massive panoramic roof.

Asimo OS, a brand-new operating system that gives a nod to the cool and quirky Honda humanoid robot, powers it all. That too is a big deal. It lays the groundwork for future software-defined vehicles at Honda, future connected cars, autonomous driving, over-the-air updates and more. Like its Japanese rival Toyota, Honda is behind new players like Rivian, Tesla and the Chinese automakers at software, and Asimo OS represents the brand's attempts to hit back.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Availability

The Honda 0 Series Saloon was initially scheduled to go into production in Ohio this year, as the first model based on the 0 Series platform. However, after several setbacks, including the cancellation of the $7,500 federal tax credit, Honda has decided to postpone the launch of the 0 Series Saloon to 2027.

The company is still moving forward with its 0 Series-based models, but the first models to roll off the assembly line this year will be the Honda 0 Series SUV and Acura RSX crossovers. The Japanese automaker also cut its investment plans for new EVs, going from $69 billion to roughly $48 billion until 2030.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Price

Although Honda has not publicized a figure yet, the 0 Series Saloon is widely expected to start around $50,000. That doesn't make it a cheap new EV, but it does put it around the average newcar price in the U.S. If it can deliver on these specs, then Honda fans are getting a lot of car for the money.

But given the current softening of EV demand in the U.S., and the American market largely souring on sedans in recent years, the delay to 2027 makes sense—especially if Honda ends up leading with the 0 Series SUV. Either way, the 0 Series platform should be the start of something big from this manufacturer. Let's hope it finds a way to production, and wins hearts and minds with EV fans and newcomers everywhere.

The report, “Data Center Power Play,” projects U.S. electricity needs increasing more than 60% by 2050 in its mid-level data center demand growth scenario.

Stronger ratepayer protections can also prohibit utilities from passing on the costs from data centers through higher prices.
“With surging demand from data centers, the need for plentiful, affordable power has never been higher.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (January 21, 2026)—Electricity demand is up and so are household bills across the country. More energy is needed to bolster the U.S. electricity grid as the addition of data centers is widely expected to reshape the energy landscape in coming years. A new report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) highlights the projected consequences of data centers’ growing electricity demand on the U.S. power grid and how decisionmakers can mitigate harmful economic, climate, and health impacts through clean energy development and strong ratepayer protections.

Since future data center demand growth is highly uncertain, largely due to a lack of transparency from utilities and Big Tech companies, UCS modeled multiple demand growth scenarios as well as energy policy scenarios for how that demand is met. The report, “Data Center Power Play,” projects U.S. electricity needs increasing more than 60% by 2050 in its mid-level data center demand growth scenario. In the next five years, data centers were projected to account for nearly half of total electricity demand growth nationally.

Without strong ratepayer protections, such rapid data center growth could put households and businesses at risk of more than $500 billion in cumulative electricity costs nationally by 2035 and nearly $1 trillion by 2050, UCS reports. Absent ambitious climate and clean energy policies, additional fossil fuels burned to power data centers could increase carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 19% and result in a further $1.6 trillion in climate and health damages over the next decade, growing to $4.5 trillion by 2050.

“Frenzied data center growth with little transparency or guardrails puts the public at risk of massive cost increases,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research at UCS and lead report author. “The climate and health benefits and net cost savings of building clean energy to meet future electricity needs are obvious and enormous, but they will not materialize without political support and responsible management of data center load growth.”

Amid the rapidly escalating and costly impacts of fossil fuel-driven climate change and an affordability crisis nationwide, state and federal support for affordable clean energy paired with substantive ratepayer protections is the smartest and quickest way to meet growing electricity demand while protecting people’s health, wallets and the climate.

Key report findings, which assume mid-level demand growth for data centers:

$248 billion in wholesale electricity costs could be avoided by 2050 by restoring federal clean energy tax credits slashed by the Trump administration.

Reducing U.S. power sector CO2 emissions 70% by 2035 and 95% by 2050 would result in more than $1.6 trillion in avoided global climate damages by 2035 and $13 trillion by 2050.

Such power sector decarbonization would also dramatically reduce air pollution from fossil fuels, resulting in $40 billion in avoided health costs nationally by 2035 and $220 billion by 2050.

Decarbonizing the power sector would come with modest increases in wholesale electricity costs, but those costs would be far outweighed by the avoided health and climate damages from reducing fossil fuel use. Stronger ratepayer protections can also prohibit utilities from passing on the costs from data centers through higher prices.

“Data centers are already secretly increasing peoples’ electricity bills,” said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at UCS and author of a recent UCS report on loopholes exploited by data center developers to push their costs onto the public. “While some utility companies and data center developers are intentionally misdirecting scrutiny, others are willfully ignorant about their roles in passing costs onto consumers. In a future with immense data center growth, ratepayers shouldn’t be forced to subsidize Big Tech’s profits at the expense of their own health, climate and pocketbooks. State utility regulators have clear authority to assign costs to those that cause them—it’s time they require data center developers to pay their fair share for energy needs that can dwarf that of entire cities.”

This latest UCS report recommends stronger policies to accelerate the clean energy transition while creating guardrails to protect people and communities from the harms and costs of meeting data centers’ electricity demands. It also calls out the Trump administration’s prioritization of fossil fuel polluters that put people, the environment, and electricity affordability and reliability at risk.

“The Trump administration has repeatedly worked to derail clean energy deployment precisely when we need it most,” said Julie McNamara, associate policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. “With surging demand from data centers, the need for plentiful, affordable power has never been higher. Yet instead of clearing the path for the fastest, cheapest, cleanest resources to deploy, President Trump is sidelining renewables just to boost the interests of the fossil fuel industry. People will pay the price: in higher bills, in dirtier air, in lost local investments and in worsened climate impacts.”",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2026-01-21 00:58:41.478240

In a letter to the school community posted online Monday, the Board of Education said that an investigator interviewed multiple parent and student witnesses, along with “additional individuals” who had been contacted by students or parents.

From Oct. 21 to Nov. 18, the board said that Langs “refused to meet with the investigator to discuss the allegations,” which delayed the investigative process. On Nov. 18, “a targeted set of specific questions — a snapshot of allegations from the report” were sent to Langs, the letter said. He submitted written responses on Nov. 24.

A 40-page investigation report that was released by the district listed several findings, including a point that stated: “In his role as football coach, Tyler Langs has engaged in conduct and speech over a period of at least three years that violates Board Policy 4201, has negatively impacted students, created a toxic environment, and cast aspersion on the District.”

The final of eight points listed said: “The employment of Langs as coach, athletic director, and dean of students gives the appearances of nepotism, including favoritism, to the detriment of the District.”

An additional point listed that in his role as athletic director, “Tyler Langs has not communicated promptly and appropriately with students, parents, or the community.”

The board acknowledged that while playing time caused speculation, none of the issues brought to administration were directly related to it.

On Jan. 16, the district said that the superintendent reached out to Langs “to try to reach an amicable agreement that would maintain his employment with the District as Dean of Students,” while adding that Langs has a contract to remain employed for the 2026-27 school year. The district said it is waiting on his response.",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2021/08/1-35.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 02:57:36.589836

The federal Clean Water Act requires these permits be strong enough to protect Oregon’s waterways.

ODA and DEQ must limit waste disposal to put water quality and public health first.
Monitoring is key to the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act’s permit program, because it provides transparency and allows for accountability.","Late last year, the Oregon Departments of Agriculture and Environmental Quality proposed the long-overdue renewal of a permit that regulates how hundreds of the state’s factory farms manage their mountains of livestock waste. Unfortunately, their draft falls seriously short.

Factory farms are well known for dumping massive amounts of pollution into the environment, which can have disastrous impacts on our communities and our water. In 2022, milk cows on Oregon’s mega-dairies alone produced over 4 billion pounds of manure — or enough to overflow two-and-a-half Olympic swimming pools each day.

Much of this manure is then over-applied to agricultural land, where it can run off into streams and leach into drinking water — contributing significantly to Eastern Oregon’s three-decade-long nitrate contamination crisis. Oregon only updates the permit every five years at most, so it is critical to get this renewal right.

The federal Clean Water Act requires these permits be strong enough to protect Oregon’s waterways. Specifically, Clean Water Act permits require dischargers to restrict their pollution by using the best available control technology and management practices, and to monitor those discharges to show they are not violating the law. But for decades, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Oregon regulators have let factory farms off the hook on both counts — and this permit proposes to continue that trend.

First, the permit does not go far enough to protect Oregon’s waterways. It allows factory farms to spread waste on cropland according to plans that prioritize maximizing crop production, not protecting water quality.

It lacks common-sense provisions like strong liner standards for all waste impoundments and a prohibition on spreading waste on frozen ground, where it is likely to run off into nearby streams. These inadequate plans can allow cancer-causing nitrates to leach into groundwater, contributing to drinking water crises in the Lower Umatilla Basin and elsewhere. ODA and DEQ must limit waste disposal to put water quality and public health first.

Second, the permit leaves Oregonians and regulators in the dark about pollution because it does not require adequate monitoring. Monitoring is key to the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act’s permit program, because it provides transparency and allows for accountability.

Food & Water Watch won an important Ninth Circuit lawsuit in 2021 confirming that monitoring is required for factory farms — just like it is for factories and wastewater treatment plants. But despite this and a similar, recent decision from Washington, ODA and DEQ have doubled down on the permit’s ‘see no evil’ approach.

The factory farm industry has long benefited from special treatment and governments allowing these facilities to pollute our water without meaningful oversight. Now, as the Trump administration seeks to limit the scope of the Clean Water Act and attack all of our bedrock environmental laws, Oregon regulators can go above and beyond and use every authority to protect Oregonians and our waterways. ODA and DEQ’s draft factory farm permit falls short of what the law requires and what Oregonians deserve, but it is not too late for the agencies to make critical improvements.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00276-2-2048x1440.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 22:59:38.506793

The Indiana University Office of Sustainability hopes you'll consider a swap.

So far this winter, 96 space heaters have been traded. Why is this the focus?

Why Indiana University wants you to trade your space heater this winter

""With these four options, you're putting the heat directly onto the person instead of the air, so it's a more efficient way for you to get warmer,"" said Jessica Davis, Associate Vice President for Sustainability with Indiana University.

Davis went on to explain how these swaps have saved energy around Indiana University's campuses.

""If you happen to be in a location that's near the building's thermostat, the building may start reading that your space is hotter than it truly is,"" Davis continued. ""You're kind of creating an artificial environment; the building may actually start cooling down your space.""

Stacy Lozer is the Director of Career Services for the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.

Lozer recently took advantage of the trade-in program.

""We had this really unique and amazing opportunity to take those old space heaters that eat up a lot of energy, that quite often smell and aren't as effective, and trade them in for a nice warm fuzzy blanket,"" Lozer said, while covering up with her new heated blanket. ""In my office, I have a lot of windows. It's a great way to stay warm and just not waste kind of that space heater air that's just circulating around.""

The 96 space heaters that have been traded in (including Lozer's) will save energy and money for the university.

""About 48,000 kilowatt hours of energy a year, and that's about $12,000 worth of financial savings,"" Davis stated.

""If you make little changes, it makes a huge difference,"" said Lozer.

The Office of Sustainability works with Circle City Mutual Aid to find new off-campus homes for the space heaters traded in during this initiative.

While the exchange program is only offered to those at IU, Davis hopes the public will consider switching their own space heaters for greener alternatives, similar to the ones offered in the campus program.

""The same learnings here at IU can apply at home as well,"" Davis said.

If a space heater makes the most sense to use to keep your space warm, make sure you use it safely.

""Only use space heaters when you're in the room,"" says Tim Griffin with the Carmel Fire Department. ""Don't leave the house. Don't leave it plugged in, and if you are going to have it plugged in, have it plugged directly to the wall. Don't use an extension cord.""

Griffin went on to say that extension cords can use too much power with a space heater, and cause it to overheat.

""Make sure that it's three feet away from anything,"" Griffin continued.

Keeping the space heater in an open area on top of stable ground could prevent you, your pets, and your kids from knocking the space heater over, which could start a fire.

""I know we're talking about the extreme temperatures, but if something does happen because of the extreme cold, those working smoke detectors are going to make a difference in early detection, so we can get there and stop that fire before it spreads,"" Griffin said.

What else would Griffin avoid to keep warm?

""Leaving your stove on,"" Griffin said. ""Having it open like that, if you have any small children, again, pets, animals that could burn themselves, you know, it's never a good idea to try to heat the house with the stove.""

""If you've got a blanket or clothes, shove them in the base of your door, shove them around your window,"" Davis recommended. ""Hopefully, we just try to make it through this, these couple of weeks that are really cold.""

The engine whir reminds us of family BBQs, swinging on a Hills Hoist, and sinking back a cold one. But that familiar sound also means trips to the servo, buying two-stroke oil, cleaning and sharpening, and changing the air filter.

The tide of electrification has hit the gardening equipment department. Bunnings now has a full aisle dedicated to electric alternatives from lawnmowers to hedge trimmers, brush cutters to blowers. Whether it’s time to upgrade or curiosity has you perusing, we’ll take a look at whether the investment in electric gardening equipment is worth it.

Point of difference: Comparing petrol and electric gardening equipment

Most people switch for one of three reasons: less hassle, less noise, and fewer fumes. Petrol still wins for raw grunt and endless runtime. Battery wins for convenience, cleaner storage, and easy starting.

Here’s the practical comparison that matters in a normal Aussie backyard. Note that we have compared petrol and electric lawnmowers below, but the same applies to every garden power tool with electric alternatives.

Starting and day-to-day ease

Electric mowers start with a button and go. Petrol mowers can demand priming, pulling, and occasional colourful language. If you mow often, that convenience adds up fast.

Noise and neighbour friendliness

Battery mowers generally run quieter than petrol options. That matters if you mow early, live on a small block, or just like staying on speaking terms with the neighbours.

Maintenance and ongoing fuss

Petrol mowers need ongoing care, like filters, plugs, fuel, oil mixing for two-strokes, and off-season fuel management. Battery mowers skip most of that, because they have fewer moving parts. You still sharpen blades and keep the deck clean, but the routine feels lighter.

Running costs

With petrol, you pay every mow. With battery, you mostly pay upfront, then charge at home. If you already own batteries and chargers in a tool platform, the upgrade can be cheaper than you think.

Power and performance

For small to medium lawns, modern battery mowers do the job well. For thick kikuyu, long wet growth, or big blocks, petrol can still be the path of least resistance. Some brands also say battery will not replace petrol for every heavy duty use case, at least not yet.

What you will actually pay in Australia

At Bunnings, cordless mower kits can sit around the mid hundreds, and climb higher for self propelled, wider decks, or premium brands. Petrol mowers also span a wide range, from budget to “this will outlive me” territory.

The hidden cost is the ecosystem. If you buy into a battery platform, you can run a trimmer, blower, hedger, and chainsaw off the same batteries. That can make the numbers stack up, especially if your shed currently holds three half-working petrol tools.

Apples for apples, the prices can be quite even. A petrol 18-inch Victa will set you back about $409 to $509. A battery-powered 18-inch Victa kit with 2 batteries is about $415.

You will need to factor in whether you require additional batteries. That’s the kicker, as batteries can cost a few hundred dollars on their own.

The electrification bonus: One battery, many tools

Battery platforms are the quiet achievers here. If you already own compatible batteries, “skin only” tools can be great value. If you do not, starter kits cost more, but they set you up for the rest of your garden gear.

A simple approach works best: pick one platform you can stick with. Then add tools as your petrol gear retires.

Emissions and air quality: The bit we do not smell until we do

Petrol mowers emit exhaust at ground level, right where you stand. Australian research has measured emissions from in-use lawn mowers, with attention on pollutants like hydrocarbons from small engines.

Electric mowers shift emissions to the electricity source instead of the backyard. Several life cycle studies have compared petrol and electric mowers, and generally find petrol models have higher emissions during use, with battery manufacturing impacts sitting on the other side of the ledger.

If your home runs on solar, your mower can too. That is about as neat as it gets.

Robot lawnmowers: Are they worth it?

Many of us enjoy the set-and-forget ease of robovacs, but robot lawnmowers are the next “big thing”. They operate almost exactly the same as your Roomba, but do they actually do the job?

The short answer is yes – but they have specific use cases.

If you have a small backyard with minimal obstacles, then it might be the perfect fit. They mow often enough that the grass never grows long enough to be an issue for it. You might find that your edges are lacking, but the trade-off for the convenience may be worth it.

When upgrading makes sense

Upgrading usually makes sense if you tick a few of these boxes:

Your lawn is small to medium, and you mow regularly.

You want less maintenance, less storage hassle, and easier starts.

You already own batteries in a tool platform.

You dislike fumes, noise, or keeping fuel around the house.

When petrol still earns its keep

You might stick with petrol, or delay the switch, if:

You mow a large block, or you need a long runtime without swapping batteries.

Your lawn grows thick and fast, and you often mow it long or wet.

You need maximum cutting power for tough conditions, every time.

A simple decision checklist

If you want a quick call, use this:

Under 300 square metres and mowed often: Battery will likely feel like an upgrade.

Already on a battery platform: Battery almost always wins on convenience and value.

Big block, thick grass, infrequent mowing: Petrol may stay the safer bet.

Battery-powered gardening tools have earned their place

For most suburban Aussie yards, a modern battery mower is a genuine quality of life upgrade. You ditch fuel runs, reduce maintenance, and keep the peace with the neighbours. Petrol still has a place for bigger, tougher jobs, but for the average weekend mow, battery gear has well and truly arrived.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Energy-Matters-Electrifying-Australia.png,N,,2026-01-20 21:58:48.505484

Business groups believe a proposed Senate bill would lower their energy costs through the basic principle of supply and demand.
House Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications Committee Chair Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said he has no plans to schedule Ledbetter’s bill for a hearing.
“‘Should we expand in Indiana?’ ‘What’s the cost of electricity in Indiana?’” Becker said at the event.
What portion of those costs are they going to be responsible for moving forward?” Indiana Energy Association President McGrath agreed, saying energy-choice policies create volatility.","For decades, Indiana’s energy landscape has operated under a vertically integrated system with state-regulated utilities generating and distributing electricity to customers in their assigned regions.

But two bills from Republican lawmakers could change that dynamic by allowing businesses, and potentially individual households, to get their electricity from a provider other than their local utility company.

Consumer control over buying or producing power—sometimes called energy choice or energy deregulation—is not new, but it’s not been widely discussed in Indiana so far.

And it’s not clear whether it will be this year, either. Neither bill has been scheduled for a hearing in what is expected to be an unusually short session. But advocates of the legislation aren’t likely to give up, even if the bills don’t move over the next six weeks or so.

Business groups believe a proposed Senate bill would lower their energy costs through the basic principle of supply and demand. If businesses have more options for buying energy, competition will lower prices, they say.

And large users, such as advanced manufacturers and data centers, say if they’re able to bypass the state-regulated—or incumbent—utility in their assigned service area to buy power, that utility won’t need to invest in big infrastructure builds, keeping prices lower for everyone else.

Abby Foster is vice president for policy and advocacy for the Retail Energy Advancement League, or REAL, which represents a collection of energy companies that work in natural gas, nuclear and renewables. She said the Northern Indiana Public Service Co. has allowed large users to shop for their own power in some cases, but codifying such agreements is the next step.

“This is already happening in Indiana,” Foster said. “But our members would like more certainty than what the regulatory process can offer. So in order for this to truly be enough certainty for them to come and invest and build and serve these customers, it really needs to be in statute.”

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s investor-owned utilities, has a different take. IEA President Danielle McGrath said energy-choice policies can lead to unpredictability for companies and utilities alike.

“It definitely is creating more risk and uncertainty when we really need a period of stability,” McGrath said.

Wholesale energy

Language outlining energy-choice policy sits in Senate Bill 272 and House Bill 1276, carried by Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, and Rep. Cindy Ledbetter, R-Newburgh, respectively.

Donato’s bill would allow businesses that use more than 1 megawatt of power a year to buy energy from a “competitive electricity supplier,” beginning in July 2027. The utility managing that service area would have to distribute the purchased electricity through its transmission lines with no added fees.

The bill would cap the percentage of third-party energy sales allowed within an incumbent utility’s territory. It would set an initial cap of 20% of the utility’s sales from the prior year, excluding any sales for customers using more than 75 megawatts, but allow the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to amend the cap.

The proposed legislation mirrors an energy-choice law Michigan passed in 2008 where, according to Foster, demand for wholesale energy purchases reached the state’s 10% cap within two years.

Data from the Michigan Public Services Commission shows 5,514 customers took part in the energy-choice program in 2024, and all of Michigan’s regulated utilities were at or near their 10% cap for alternative electric sales that year.

“If Michigan’s any story of what we can expect, customers are going to want to avail themselves of this,” Foster said. “And for every megawatt that’s procured from a third party, that’s one less megawatt that the utility, who gets to charge all ratepayers, has to build.”

If energy demand for outside power supplies exceeds the state’s cap, a queue system would kick in, and third-party electricity suppliers would have to register with the IURC.

Legislation from Ledbetter goes even further, allowing residential customers to also seek electric service on the open market.

Ledbetter’s House Bill 1276 would require investor-owned utilities to decouple their costs of generation from the costs of distributing electricity and charge customers only for what they use. Customers who don’t want to shop around would stay with their default utility.

Ledbetter said the intent of her bill is to drive down costs with a free-market approach.

“With us shutting down coal and converting everything to natural gas and going to renewables, the consumer has to pay for those costs, and those costs are getting high,” she said. “So if we go to free-market electricity, much like with cellphones, we will see those costs eventually come down.”

Both bills have been sent to their respective utility committees. Senate Utility Chair Eric Koch, R-Bedford, wouldn’t tell IBJ what bills will be scheduled yet this session. House Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications Committee Chair Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said he has no plans to schedule Ledbetter’s bill for a hearing.

New energy paradigm

Anne Becker, a director at Indianapolis-based law firm Lewis Kappes, said during the IBJ’s Future of Energy Summit on Nov. 21 that businesses she works with are constantly thinking about their energy costs.

“‘Should we expand in Indiana?’ ‘What’s the cost of electricity in Indiana?’” Becker said at the event. “It’s a huge component to their costs. ‘Can we put something behind the meter on our property?’ All this stuff goes into the equation.”

Data from the Indiana Office of Energy Development shows Indiana’s electricity costs rose higher than the national average from 2002-2016 but below the national average from 2017-2023. A Lawrence Berkeley study published in December found Indiana’s electricity prices decreased from 2019 through 2024 when inflation is not considered.

But cost isn’t the only factor. Many large ratepayers are looking for “bespoke” energy plans that are diversified for resiliency or to meet environmental goals.

Foster, the vice president of REAL, said the proposed new model is a win for ratepayers large and small. With utilities building power plants to serve the demand of large manufacturers and data centers, the cost of that infrastructure investment can be passed on to consumers. But if those large users were responsible for their own power needs, utilities—and remaining ratepayers—would be off the hook, Foster said.

Under the current structure, she said, “If these data centers at the end of their power-purchase agreements with the utilities no longer need this generation, or say, new technology comes out that makes data centers super-efficient, and they don’t need the amount of capacity, the ratepayers in Indiana are the ones that pick up that bill.”

Foster and Becker pointed to NIPSCO, which created the subsidiary GenCo last year to facilitate large-load customers in its service area exploring their own energy options.

Kristina Wheeler, a partner at business law firm Bose McKinney & Evans, said that arrangement helped one of the biggest companies in Indiana.

“Kudos to NIPSCO for allowing their customers above 10 megawatts to go to the market for power. It kept our client, U.S. Steel, operating in Gary, Indiana,” Wheeler said at the IBJ Future of Energy Summit. “It was beneficial to a lot of other major users and existing businesses in northern Indiana.”

A spokeswoman for NIPSCO declined to comment for this story.

Not that simple

But Indiana’s regulated utilities and consumer advocacy groups say deregulation legislation will raise rates for most customers.

Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson said it takes years to plan and hundreds of millions of dollars for utilities to build their energy grid to serve their territories, meaning individual businesses packing up and leaving the grid is “just not as simple as people want it to be.”

Olson said that if large users don’t have to pay for electricity through their area utility, the cost of a power plant that was built 15 years ago to serve that very customer could then be passed along to everyone else.

“You build these massive systems to serve all of your customers, and then with 30 days’ notice, a huge customer can just leave that system and not pay anything,” Olson said of the proposed legislation. “They’re still using the grid. They’re still connected to the system. What portion of those costs are they going to be responsible for moving forward?”

Indiana Energy Association President McGrath agreed, saying energy-choice policies create volatility. Because regulated utilities are required by law to serve customers in their territories, she said, businesses buying energy on the wholesale market but still connected to the existing grid would still need to be served in an emergency.

“If something does go wrong, those businesses are still going to count on us to meet their needs, but that comes at a cost,” McGrath said. “If you don’t have the appropriate parameters in place and that customer comes to us, but there isn’t sufficient capacity, what do they do? What do we do?”

McGrath said Illinois and Ohio have both adopted energy-choice programs for residential ratepayers, but prices haven’t come down. She cited a study conducted by Ohio State University in 2024 that found 72% of offers for electricity on the residential retail market were more expensive than if the household had stuck with their default utility.

In Illinois, she said, the state’s Office of Attorney General has filed a string of lawsuits against retailer energy providers that the state says have used deceptive marketing practices to sign people up for their more expensive rates.

Ledbetter said she’s not concerned about residential users figuring out a new energy marketplace because her bill would allow customers to stay with their current utility provider if they choose.

“Also, there is a built-in educational portion for consumers that the IURC will develop to help keep them safe as it relates to those matters,” she said.

In 2021, when Beijing finally pledged to stop building and financing new coal power plants overseas, Western governments and climate advocates rejoiced. John Kerry, US climate envoy at the time, said he was “absolutely delighted to hear” of the decision.

It is “a key topic of my discussions during my visit to China”, Alok Sharma, a member of the British House of Lords, wrote on social media, suggesting it was a result of pressure from the West.

But now, from Chile to Spain to Portugal, country after country is grappling with major blackouts. A troubling question is emerging: has this major climate victory over China backfired?

Because while China agreed to halt coal power exports under intense international pressure, at home it took the opposite approach.

Far from abandoning coal, China doubled down on advanced, ultra-efficient coal units that acted as grid stabilisers, backing up its massive expansion of wind and solar power.

In effect, China developed a dual strategy: export pure green energy to the world while keeping the stabilising backup systems and tech largely for itself.

Today, as renewable-heavy grids in Europe and Latin America face strain, and extreme weather exposes the vulnerabilities of intermittent power sources, the irony is hard to ignore: while nations are embracing that green future, they are confronting power failures that may have been tempered with the very technologies that they asked China not to export.

Commitments that they largely would not have needed if they had access to global supply chains.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

At CES, I didn’t get the chance to attend as many panels and discussions as I had hoped. When I made it, I was often pulled away partway through by another commitment. However, I had the chance to attend “Competing in a Trade-Disrupted World,” moderated by Ed Brzytwa, Vice President of International Trade for CTA, which produces CES. The panel included diverse perspectives, including Dan Anthony, who runs the website WePayTheTariffs.com, and Robin Liss, CEO of Suvie, who explained her challenges as a SMB. As clean technology has been hardest hit due to a combination of politically connected legacy interests, trade was already on my mind. Listening to the conversations, reading the stories and seeing the diverse inputs into the technology ecosystem, I gained a new appreciation for how it is not just one sector or the consumer paying the price for protectionism. We all pay.

People Pay In Different Ways

Consumers paying the price should be obvious. Increasing taxes and blocking competition distorts markets. In most cases, the hours of work wasted to earn money to overpay for products are more than the net hours of work preserved at uncompetitive companies. If we blocked TVs when Zenith went bankrupt to prop them up in the 90s, we might still be looking at months of pay for a product that underperforms what people can now buy with a few hours of pay.

But small businesses also pay in many ways. Retailers faced with increased costs on goods, often beyond what their customers are willing or able to spend, clearly pay price for protectionism. Sales go down while margins squeeze, making viability a challenge.

Entrepreneurial innovators and manufacturers also suffer. We simply do not have the industrial capability to do everything on our own, and small companies do not have the capital to reinvent the wheel. When I spoke to several US-based entrepeneurs about it, they mentioned that they can use a Chinese company to produce a prototype part and have it in weeks, instead of months. They mentioned that they could have the product manufactured and in market faster than they could build the prototype in the US. Even if they could build it here, competitors would be generations ahead of them by the time it hits the market. And then, when it gets to market, the cost is often too high, especially if they are cut off from imported components and materials.

China has massive industrial supply chains and a well-developed technology ecosystem. They also add the equivalent of the US engineering workforce to their workforce roughly every year. Many of these engineers are focused on the essential but less exciting parts of the project, like DFM and injection mold tooling, rather than focusing on creating the next attention-grabbing breakthrough. They have the talent to do much of the “99% perspiration” that turns the “1% inspiration” into a viable product. That is undoubtedly one of their greatest advantages. Other countries seeking to compete with China need to offer their own advantages. We simply do not have the population or education system needed to match global capabilities internally. Those global capabilities can be utilized to help our companies, if we let it happen. When we stand in the way of it happening, we pay the price.

In addition, if you have ever taken apart an electronic product, you will see things like capacitors from Japan, memory chips from Arizona, processors from Taiwan, batteries from China, displays from Korea… no one country makes everything, regardless of where final assembly and packaging takes place. The South Hall at CES especially was filled with these types of manufacturers and suppliers. No one country is going to be good at everything, and the more options that are available, the better cost/performance of the product. Isolating any country weakens the entire technology ecosystem. The overall collaboration is less productive. Cutting off the supply of individual components, software, or technologies makes creating innovative products more difficult. This is especially the case for startups and small businesses that can’t pay for custom-made chips or to build their own factories. They can’t afford to order a spool of custom-alloyed stainless steel. They have to use largely off-the-shelf parts and materials, and we just made that shelf smaller and more expensive.

Even large companies with the capital to build factories to supply their operations have to pay the price. Some may look at the tens of billions of dollars that Detroit is writing off on scaled back EV plans and think it is just about EVs. But much of those write-downs and penalties are for supply commitments and capacity being built that they do not need now. Commitments that they largely would not have needed if they had access to global supply chains. That added cost, and now cancellation cost, sets EV adoption back. With access to global supply chains, EV adoption could have accelerated, and localization of the heavy, highly automated battery production would happen with the market scale that comes from increased adoption. Now, with that market scale postponed and isolation from global markets, US EV adoption is set back further.

We also pay the price for isolation from their consumers. In the US, the average new car buyer is in their 50s, over two decades older than the average new car buyer in China. While China may be aging and shrinking overall, their wealth is much younger and growing faster, largely driven by technology. The gap is expanded due to our education system, the debt loads our education system puts on young people, and our elevated prices. Young people in tech-focused careers who grew up with smartphones have different perspectives and expectations on technology than their parents. The early adopter market is much larger. The adoption curve is different. As such, some Chinese companies are moving to smartphone-like technology iteration, accelerating progress. In many ways, the consumer is just as important to technology adoption as the producer.

Even Legacy Pays Eventually

In the end, legacy industry also pays the price. Like the overprotective parent coddling a whiney child, our government has enabled underperformers. Initially, it may look like they are being protected from competition. But they also are not growing, evolving, gaining perspective, or making connections. As that kid becomes an adult still living with their parents, surrounded by participation trophies in a state of persistent dependency, were they really being helped?

As I mentioned to Tom and Riz on Ludicrous Feed, US legacy automakers have already lost on EVs in an “us versus them” adversarial contest. But there is hope in collaboration. Many people still have love for the brands. However, the longer we isolate our country from global competition and global collaboration, the farther behind we will fall. And the less relevant the US part of the collaboration will become.

Eventually, the walls politicians put up around their people and industry will come down. When they do, the artificially propped up and isolated industries tend to fall with them. Trabant no longer makes cars. Its fellow Soviet Bloc Dacia and Skoda brands still exist through the involvement of Western automakers, but they now have little to do with their closed market predecessors.

Innovation Is A Team Sport

There are no completely new ideas. All ideas build on other ideas. No single country has a monopoly. It makes no sense to go back to prehistoric understandings of the world in order to rediscover fire and reinvent the wheel over and over again. The larger the pool of ideas people get exposed to, the better the ideas they can come up with.

Some will say that others are just copying, but that is a cop-out. Otto, Diesel, Volta, Faraday, Newton… were not American. But it would be dishonest to say that a modern automobile is just copying them. People also said Harry A. Miller was just copying European engines when his company developed what would become the most successful racing engine in American history. But that misconstrues the progress of ideas building on other ideas and the hard work needed to realize the potential of those ideas.

It is easy to put one person on a pedestal as the key to innovation in the technology sector. It makes a good story. But the reality is that it takes a wide range of people with different capabilities and talents to make a technology succeed. The larger the potential talent and supply pool, the better.

Segregating teams by skin color didn’t make baseball better. Segregating technology teams by lines on a map doesn’t make those teams better either.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260109_005851221.MP1_-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 22:59:46.757298

Today's Big Stories

1. Trump has promised cheaper oil. Texas’ economy could pay a price

After COVID-19 tanked oil prices, Texas’ oil and gas industry rebounded. By 2024, operators were drilling record amounts of oil. Each barrel sold for at least $70, bringing profits and momentum that enriched the state’s coffers, school districts and local government budgets with billions in tax revenue.

Now, President Donald Trump’s pledge to bring oil prices down to $50 a barrel could decimate that momentum, making trouble — even if temporarily — for the Lone Star State.

2. TxDOT rejects bid to keep rainbow, Black Lives Matter crosswalks in Dallas

Dallas is the latest Texas city to be denied an exemption request to keep pavement markings during the state’s recent push to ban politically-charged messaging from streets.

According to a report from the Dallas Morning News, the request was for 30 markings, including rainbow LBGTQ+ Pride, Black Lives Matter and other custom designs. This comes after Gov. Greg Abbott in October banned cities from displaying street markings that convey “social, political or ideological messages” or risk losing state funding.

3. Houston-based Francesca's reportedly closing all stores nationwide

Francesca’s, an apparel boutique chain that was founded in Houston, is planning to close all of its stores across the country, according to reports.

According to Women’s Wear Daily, the shopping mall chain began liquidating its inventory on Friday, a customer service representative told the outlet.

The “new world disorder” is reshaping global priorities, and renewable energy is at the heart of this transformation.","Global stability is fracturing. Economic realignments, geopolitical rivalries, and technological disruption are reshaping the international order. North America—long a pillar of global leadership—now faces pressures to make sustainable, strategic decisions. The clean energy transition is not just environmental—it’s geopolitical, economic, and technological.

Traditional energy markets have long underpinned global stability, but geopolitical shocks—from Middle East tensions to Europe’s reliance on Russian gas—underscore the need for energy resilience. The Trump administration has successfully issued swathes of executive orders and federal directives to support domestication of natural resource supply chains, while limiting reliance and relations with international markets.

Key legislative and executive restrictions that impact renewable energy:

In July 2025, Trump signed an executive order and “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that terminated clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar projects, and directed federal agencies to eliminate preferential treatment for renewables compared to traditional energy sources

The Treasury Department was instructed to implement stricter eligibility rules for tax credits, requiring projects to show significant physical construction progress and limiting safe harbor provisions, making it much harder for developers to qualify

Enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules target supply chains connected to China, further complicating access to subsidies for solar and wind developers reliant on imported technologies

Tariffs have promoted increased domestic oil, gas, coal, and nuclear production, and onshoring of manufacturing, merging domestic and foreign policy

The headlines are overwhelming the wider narrative. Although incentives and support for clean energy technologies have been repealed, renewable energy offers North America a pathway to resilience.

“

Despite shifting geopolitical dynamics, renewable energy projects in North America remain active and robust in the near term. Although the long-term outlook is less certain, the current ecosystem—including insurance—continues to experience strong activity”

Andrew Rubin | Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions

How the One Big Beautiful Bill could accelerate pockets of growth for clean technologies

Pre- and post-the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) predictions for renewable generation index drops from 190 to 140 by 2035 . The speed of growth for renewable energy generation is limited under new regulations, but opportunities endure. “Despite shifting geopolitical dynamics, renewable energy projects in North America remain active and robust in the near term. Although the long-term outlook is less certain, the current ecosystem—including insurance—continues to experience strong activity”, Andrew Rubin, Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions.

Despite the loss of tax credits to solar and wind projects which signal that renewable energy in the U.S. is in a consolidation period, tax credits remain available to emerging renewable technologies.

“Tax credits are available for renewable natural gas, where an uptick in investment is making the technology a competitive opportunity for companies keen to diversify their energy mix”, Alex Forand, North America Renewable Energy Leader, Natural Resources. For business leaders, these opportunities are driving a rethink of procurement strategies and capital allocation. “Previously, the security of government backing gave companies opportunities to invest in clean technologies, but now, profitability is at the top of the agenda and investors and stakeholders are more cautious to spend capital on unknown technologies”, Andreea Merewitz, Managing Director, Resilience Practice, BDO.

Capital-heavy developers will have opportunities to acquire assets—such as wind and solar—that are now less profitable under the OBBBA. Although cutting tax credits could signal less room for innovation, renewable energy remains a way to anchor a strategic advantage. There’s scope for innovation, but the goal posts have moved. Business leaders will need to rethink and realign their strategies.

“As North America reduces reliance on imported oil and gas, renewable infrastructure becomes a strategic asset, particularly as the investment in data centers continues to increase exponentially. Investment in in grids and power will be non-negotiable, it’s inevitable”, Daisy McAndrew, freelance geopolitical and economic radio and TV presenter, reporter and writer.

The accelerator for electrification in North America: Data centers

Renewable energy is a technology race. Advances in battery storage and smart grids will define the next era of economic leadership. While China maintains its position as the renewable manufacturing major, adding over 212 GW of new solar and 51 GW of new wind capacity while the U.S. will add less than 100 GW combined, all while the U.S. is jostling to be the world leader in data centers.

By the numbers: The data center boom in the U.S.

Projections show the U.S. will continue to expand its capacity and market share, with electricity consumption by U.S. data centers set to more than double by 2030. The continued growth of data centers will need powering, suggesting the renewable energy agenda isn’t entirely off the cards.

The future of data centers: Beware the brain drain

The Trump administration’s approach to immigration could reduce the pool of workers available to support the ongoing growth of data centers. “AI isn’t just the tail that’s wagging the dog, it’s the dog. Technology companies are the wealth of the American economy. While data centers are primarily at risk of falling down the brain drain, natural resources companies will need to prepare for escalating demand.

Business leaders will need to bolster their workforce to prepare for the uptick in power demand. Will the tech center burst its bubble? Certainly, we’re poised for corrective measures, but how domestic and foreign policy will adapt, is something to watch”, Daisy McAndrew.

Looking ahead: Building certainty in the new world disorder

Political polarization complicates climate policy, but societal pressure for sustainability is intensifying. The “new world disorder” is reshaping global priorities, and renewable energy is at the heart of this transformation. For North American businesses, the green transition is not off the table. There are pockets of opportunity for emerging renewable technologies, particularly for power generation to support the growth of data centers. While geopolitical headwinds continue to blow, building resilience will be critical to withstand political and economic volatility. Risk management is at the core.

“Over the long term, tax insurance and renewable energy in the U.S. remain interconnected and resilient. Regulatory changes, statutory adjustments, and industry headwinds may pose challenges, but they are unlikely to halt investment, with tax insurance continuing to play a vital role” Andrew Rubin, Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions. Tax insurance covers losses from disallowed credits, penalties, interest, and legal costs, giving investors and developers confidence that expected tax benefits will materialize. By reducing counterparty risk and providing certainty, tax insurance has a role in facilitating project financing and supporting cash flow for renewable energy projects.

But more broadly, tax insurance can support the growing renewable energy sector through intricate partnership structures and evolving tax laws—a critical asset in risk managers’ toolkits in North America for the foreseeable future.

That reality makes one thing clear: grid planning matters more than ever.

Over the past year, state regulators have taken a series of important actions to modernize how the state’s large electric utilities forecast demand and plans to upgrade the grid. Taken together, these decisions move California away from reactive, worst-case planning and toward a smarter, more flexible approach that can support rapid electrification while protecting customers’ bills.

The work is not finished. But the direction is right – and now it is incumbent on the regulators and electric utilities to carry it through.

California is getting grid planning right – now we actually need to build it Share on X

Planning for electric demand that is actually coming

For years, the electric utilities have systematically understated future electricity demand and corresponding grid upgrade needs. That was not because electrification was not happening – it was because the antiquated rules only allowed utilities to plan for loads that were already firmly in hand. Everything else, including electrification projects still under development, was largely invisible to planners.

In December 2025, state regulators addressed this problem by allowing utilities to include pending electric demand in their forecasts – including customer electrification plans that are still being developed and credible, third-party electrification studies. The electric utilities can now plan for electric demand when supported by real-world data. This includes EV charging, building electrification, and other loads connecting to the distribution grid, rather than data centers and other large customers that connect to the higher-voltage transmission system.

In their action, regulators introduced a critical new concept: electrification hot spots. In areas in California where electrification of our buildings and transportation is clearly emerging, the electric utilities now have more discretion to proactively incorporate diverse data sources into their forecasts. That means fewer surprises, fewer last-minute upgrades, and better alignment between grid investments and customer needs. In effect, the regulators are directing the state’s electric utilities to plan for the future that is actually being built.

Moving beyond a single guess about the future

Just as important, California regulators are pushing the electric utilities to confront uncertainty head-on by directing them to adopt scenario-based load forecasting. Rather than anchoring grid plans to a single “best guess,” utilities must now evaluate at least three futures: low, mid and high load growth scenarios.

The electric utilities will pair this scenario planning with innovative decision-tree framework that guides how they should act under different outcomes – when to invest early, when to wait, and how to manage the uncertainty of their load forecasts. For example, California utilities plan for both high and low demand futures, so they can invest early when risks are high and hold back when demand may not actually happen.

This approach reflects a basic reality: overbuilding the grid is expensive but underbuilding it can be even more costly – missing opportunities to connect clean energy and locking in fossil dependence, emissions and reliability risks. Scenario planning, especially when combined with the new pending-loads framework, gives electric utilities a more disciplined way to strike that balance.

Integrating grid work to save money

Forecasting improvements alone are not enough. Execution matters just as much. Last month, the utilities filed a Commission-required proposal describing how they will better integrate capacity-driven grid upgrades with other distribution work. The concept is straightforward but powerful: when utilities are already replacing aging equipment or addressing safety needs, they should evaluate whether modestly upsizing that equipment today can avoid a second, more expensive project tomorrow.

For example, replacing a transformer at the end of its useful life without considering future load growth almost guarantees that ratepayers will pay twice – once now, and again when electrification demand materializes. This kind of integrated planning can reduce duplicative construction, lower costs and make better use of limited utility workforce resources. It also aligns closely with EDF-commissioned research from Black & Veatch showing that proactive grid planning is often the most cost-effective option.

While Environmental Defense Fund is not satisfied with the utilities’ initial proposal – and is actively engaging at the Commission to improve it – the CPUC’s underlying directive is well designed and worth supporting.

Electrification can lower bills if utilities plan for flexibility

In October 2025, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric released draft studies examining how electrification will affect the electric grid – and how much electric demand flexibility can change the outcome. While this work will continue into 2026, the early results are striking.

PG&E’s analysis finds that while enabling electrification will require tens of billions of dollars in distribution investments through 2040, that same electrification could also save customers up to 25% by putting downward pressure on electric rates by improving system utilization. The takeaway is clear: electrification does not have to result in runaway costs to the customer’s electric bill.

When electric utilities actively plan for flexible demand – including managed EV charging, building electrification paired with demand response, and distributed energy resources – the grid can be used more efficiently, spreading the fixed costs of grid investments over more kilowatt-hours, and lowering costs for all ratepayers.

Turning planning into practice

None of these reforms will matter if they remain on paper. California’s regulators have laid out a thoughtful, forward-looking framework for electric demand forecasting and grid planning – one that supports electrification, improves affordability, and manages uncertainty instead of ignoring it. Now the hard(er) work begins.

The electric utilities must implement these tools rigorously and transparently.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//CA-blog.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 00:58:45.618969

The plants would supply electricity to these growing industrial areas, without requiring miles of new transmission lines to deliver the power.

PUD Commissioners received the update at their first workshop of the year.

PUD Staff is focusing on generation technologies that could eventually be converted from natural gas, which produces a relatively small amount of carbon, to a non-carbon-generating fuel, such as hydrogen, to comply with state’s 2045 deadline to remove carbon-producing fuels from the state’s energy supply.

Additional analysis is underway to determine if an investment in an out-of-state natural gas plant, in a state that doesn’t have emissions-free policies, could supply power at a lower cost to Grant PUD customers.

In addition to natural gas generation, staff continues to research investments in battery energy storage systems, geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors to supplement Grant PUD’s portfolio of hydropower, solar and wind energy.

Work also continues to integrate the utility into a new western energy market -- the Southwest Power Pool’s “Markets +” -– that would help Grant PUD get the most value from the surplus power it sells beyond the county’s needs.

Commissioners also reviewed public input received on the proposed 2026 rate package during their workshop on Jan. 13.

Commissioners asked the public for their comments on a proposed increase of 3.5% for residential, general service/small business, and ag customers (core customers). A 9.5% increase is proposed for Tier 1 and Tier 2 (noncore) customers.

The rate adjustment is intended to balance affordability for core customers while ensuring financial stability in a high-inflation environment.

Grant PUD gathered feedback through multiple channels including a Dec. 9 public hearing, Grant PUD's website and social media.

For cattlemen who have access to cropland, winter annuals are a great way to extend the grazing season.
Planning is key for successful grazing at the farm that is located about 60 miles south of the Canadian border.
“We use both unrolling hay and bale grazing in the winter.” A lot of bedding is also provided for the cattle in the pastures.
“The next winter we had snow so deep that we had a terrible time bale grazing,” she said.","RALEIGH, N.C. — Managing an adaptive grazing management system is a thinking person’s game.

“You have to think to do this,” said Johnny Rogers, coordinator of the Amazing Grazing Program at North Carolina State University, during a webinar organized by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

“Carrying capacity is the maximum stocking rate that our land will support to get good performance out of our animals and maintain that grazing resource, good soil health and good water cycle,” said Rogers, who owns Rogers Cattle Company in Roxboro in north-central North Carolina.

Stocking rate is the number of animals that cattlemen put on their land.

“I find it beneficial to stock our land slightly below the carrying capacity because things happen,” Rogers said. “The challenge with carrying capacity is that it changes every couple of weeks.”

Part of finding the correct stocking rate, he said, is stocking the land with the most appropriate beef cattle enterprise.

“Make sure you have the right class and type of cattle that fits your operation and lifestyle,” said Rogers, who owns a Red Angus seedstock herd.

Cattlemen can use a variety of measures to find functional cows.

“You can look at average weaning weight which will give you a picture of milking ability and growth rate of calves,” Rogers said. “Pounds of wean per cow exposed is kind of the gold standard and it pulls in some of the reproductive performance of the cows.”

Another measurement is pounds of calf weaned per pound of female exposed.

“Not every size and not every cow weans the same weight of calves, so this ties in a little bit of efficiency,” Rogers said.

At North Carolina State, researchers weighed calves at weaning and calculated the adjusted 205-day weight and determined the percentage of the cow’s body weight that she weaned in her calf.

“As the cows get bigger, they wean a lower percentage of their body weight,” said Rogers about the study that included seven to eight herds and about 200 cows.

The average cow in the survey weighed 1,380 pounds.

“We talk about 1,200-pound cows, but there is a higher percentage of cows that weigh over 1,400 pounds than under 1,300 pounds in this survey,” Rogers said. “So, know how big your cows are because that affects your stocking rate that you are trying to marry with the carrying capacity.”

In North Carolina, cattlemen are challenged with mud in the winter.

“Our ground can be frozen, but it does not stay frozen like it does in many parts of the U.S.,” the researcher said.

One way to address this, Rogers said, is to unroll hay in the pasture.

“I think that spreads out the impact of the cattle, and to me the hay that is not eaten, there is carbon added back to your farm, so it is not really wasted,” he said.

“I will acknowledge that when it is raining a lot and you unroll hay, especially with younger cattle, they tend to want to just walk through the hay and look for something better,” the cattleman said. “But a brood cow will stop and start eating.”

Bale grazing is an option, where cattlemen place bales in the pasture weeks or maybe months ahead of winter.

“When you are grazing the cattle, you put up a temporary electric fence and as the cows eat the hay, you move the poly wire,” Rogers said.

“One of the advantages is that instead of taking round bales out every day to unroll, you place those ahead of time,” he said. “So, you don’t have the equipment traffic on your fields on a daily basis.”

Rogers’ favorite way to extend the grazing season is stockpiled forage.

“You can stockpile any type of forage, but tall fescue is very special because it is a tough grass that takes the freezing and thawing and holds its quality through the winter,” he said.

For cattlemen who have access to cropland, winter annuals are a great way to extend the grazing season.

“Those are very high-quality crops and the cattle will eat them pretty quick,” Rogers said. “We like to use temporary fence to get the most out of that resource.

“For every $1 that the cow consumes in her mouth, she will deposit about 85 cents of that somewhere on your farm,” he said. “So, the more we can keep the cattle out on the land and grazing, that helps the nutrient distribution on our farms.”

Little Timber Farm

Rachel Gray owns Little Timber Farm near Blackduck in northern Minnesota.

“We are fifth generation here and we started as a dairy farm,” said Gray during the webinar. “My mom and dad were dairy farmers until the early 2000s when they transitioned to beef.”

When Gray took over the operation in 2012, the cow/calf herd included about 180 head of cattle.

“Now we rotationally graze about 500 heifers and a few cow/calf pairs that belong to my son,” she said. “We have small cattle feedlot and we sell some freezer beef.”

In the winter, the Gray family custom calve for some of their customers that purchase heifers from Little Timber Farm.

“We calve about 150 heifers per year, so we bump up to about 700 head in the winter,” the cattlewoman said.

Planning is key for successful grazing at the farm that is located about 60 miles south of the Canadian border.

“If you are going to keep cattle out on pasture in the winter, you have to have a plan and we find a good plan starts in the summer,” Gray said.

“When we develop a winter plan, we find areas that need nutrients and monitor those pastures throughout the summer,” she said. “We use both unrolling hay and bale grazing in the winter.”

A lot of bedding is also provided for the cattle in the pastures.

“We get a lot of wind and we also get very cold,” the cattlewoman said. “November is great, December is nice and in January we are often dipping into 20 to 25 degrees below zero nights, so we want to make sure these cattle are nicely bedded.”

Gray uses portable windbreaks and the bedding pack is placed in front of them.

“We build the bedding pack throughout the winter, so the cattle always know to go to that area,” she explained.

“When we are done in the field for the winter, we pile the bedding pack and let it compost down,” she said. “We spread that out and sometimes we will put that on our corn ground.”

Making grazing plans is important, Gray said, and she always has a Plan B.

“The summer of 2021, we were burning up because it was the driest summer on record,” she recalled. “We had no hay crop, so we had some cake brought in.”

That provided enough feed until Aug. 20, when Gray shipped 600 head of her cattle six hours south so they could stay fed and Little Timber Farm could stay in business.

“That was the Plan B for that year,” she noted.

“The next winter we had snow so deep that we had a terrible time bale grazing,” she said. “All we could do was take equipment out and move snow, so we were breaking trail for most of the winter so the cattle could get to water.”

Gray uses the Pasture Map app daily as a planning tool for her cattle operation.

“I have our permanent waterers marked, it shows where the cattle are right now and I can also add where the hay bales are placed,” she said. “It is really nice because it keeps track of how many days the cattle have been out of a pasture.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/nzsdRV5BXeBNJKjXmNNnRZ7Qafc=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(435x472:445x482)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/QGQJUSULMZBBJBOQQIOWFIPYFQ.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 19:01:02.672920

It's not necessarily a question of full Chinese production in Canada or not.
The investment potential in Canada comes as Chinese firms have increasingly been building capacity outside of their home market.
Speaking in Doha, Qatar, on the weekend, Carney said there is interest in Chinese companies producing “affordable” electric vehicles in Canada.
Fiorani said that while investment in Canada is possible, it's unlikely Chinese firms would partner with the Detroit Three, as they're all unionized and Chinese producers will be looking to be union-free.","TORONTO — The trade deal between Canada and China has experts saying it could lead to Chinese electric vehicle firms producing vehicles in Canada, but much depends on the trade talks ahead with the United States.

Critics including Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Unifor leader Lana Payne panned the deal as an attack on workers and Canadian manufacturing, while Prime Minister Mark Carney said the government has already spoken with Chinese companies interested in investing in Canada.

The deal has the federal government lowering tariffs to 6.1 per cent from 100 per cent on 49,000 Chinese EVs a year, with a ramp-up to 70,000 within five years, while China has agreed to reduce tariffs on a range of Canadian goods.

It comes as Chinese manufacturers are already adapting globally to trade restrictions and are moving toward local production where they sell, said automotive consultant Sam Fiorani in an interview.

""Once they get a foothold in Canada, the idea that they could build plants locally, the odds of that jump dramatically.""

Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Chinese firms need to test the waters first, but once they establish a brand, they look to invest where they sell.

""Build locally is the long-term plan for any Chinese automaker.""

China has been ramping up exports, estimated at around 6.5 million units lasts year, as its domestic industry has capacity to produce millions of more vehicles than it can sell locally, but firms have still been investing heavily abroad, said a report out last November from S&P Global Mobility.

“Along with avoiding tariffs and shipping costs, building close to where you sell improves market potential inherently,"" said S&P analyst Abby Chun Tu in the report.

""In most cases, consumers are more open to automakers who invest locally, regardless of where a brand’s home market is.""

However the chances Chinses firms will set up shop in Canada with out guaranteed access to the U.S. market is unrealistic, said Andrew King, managing partner of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc.

""The Canadian market itself is just too small to justify an assembly plant – which is why the auto industry established an efficient North American assembly system – a system that the current U.S. administration seems determined to destroy,"" he said by email.

It's not necessarily a question of full Chinese production in Canada or not.

Chinese firms could do a less costly modular production, putting together pre-assembled pieces in Canada, if access to the U.S. becomes unlikely, said Ryan Robinson, automotive research lead at Deloitte Canada, but some form of investment is possible.

""I think there's a potential for it, for sure,"" said Robinson.

There's certainly demand potential on the consumer side as buyers confront the reality of current vehicle prices, he said, while noting the policy could also help Canada get closer to emission reduction goals.

The investment potential in Canada comes as Chinese firms have increasingly been building capacity outside of their home market. Chinese EV producers have built at least 15 facilities across Southeast and Central Asia since 2022, the S&P report noted, including in countries like Malaysia that has a vehicle market less than half the size of Canada's.

The wave of investments come as Chinese firms look to expand from an already saturated domestic market, leading to them collectively spend more abroad than at home in 2024 for the first time, according to a report out last year from the Rhodium Group.

Europe has also seen a jump in manufacturing capacity with Chinese giant BYD building plants in Hungary and Turkey, while Chery has entered a joint venture with Spanish automaker Ebro-EV Motors.

Stellantis, meanwhile, has partnered with Leapmotor for the Chinese to firm build its vehicles at Stellantis' Poland plant, and was set to start producing in Malaysia at Stellantis's Gurun facility at the end of 2025, the report noted.

Meanwhile, the future of the Stellantis plant in Brampton, Ont., remains an open question after the automaker moved production slated for it to the U.S. last year.

The Canadian government said in announcing the deal with China that it expects within three years it will ""drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada,"" creating new auto manufacturing career for Canadian workers.

TD chief economist Beata Caranci said in a report last September that Chinese EV production in Canada is unlikely given concerns about market access to the U.S., but that there are still areas for partnership.

""Given the EV technology gaps that remain between China and other nations and China’s desire to expand globally, some form of partnership could aid Canada in improving its EV ecosystem,"" she said in the report.

Speaking in Doha, Qatar, on the weekend, Carney said there is interest in Chinese companies producing “affordable” electric vehicles in Canada.

“We’ve had direct conversations directly from the Chinese companies ... with explicit interest and intention to partner with Canadian companies.""

Ford said it was terrible deal for the auto sector and a miscalculated decision by the Prime Minister, while Unifor national president Lana Payne said it was a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry.

Fiorani said that while investment in Canada is possible, it's unlikely Chinese firms would partner with the Detroit Three, as they're all unionized and Chinese producers will be looking to be union-free.

He said the small volume of low-tariff vehicles will mean producers will, however, want to find some way to invest in Canada if they want to grow in the market.

""It should not take very long for some of those brands to become accepted in the Canadian market, and that will lead to local production of those vehicles as the manufacturers want to expand beyond the current limits.""

Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said.
Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021.
Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program.","In 2012 — when there were about 30,000 electric vehicles on the road in California, Tesla was a small new company that mostly appealed to hobbyists and the hybrid Toyota Prius was still a novelty in many areas — former Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order setting an audacious goal: 1.5 million EVs sold statewide by 2025.

There were lots of skeptics, given that Brown was calling for a 50-fold increase in the status quo. But, as it turned out, California achieved it easily.

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in the state since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121 to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. President Donald Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Joe Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place in 2020.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to the state when Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

In the months since, several large automakers have pulled back on some EV models. In December, Ford announced it would cease production of its all-electric F-150 pickup truck, and would focus instead on hybrid vehicles and a new line of smaller, cheaper EVs.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in an interview.

In California, 408,731 EVs sold in 2025. That’s double the number from 2022, but down 8% from 2024, when 443,374 sold.

Sales surged in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired, and then dropped off in October, November, and December.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of all types in California last year were the Tesla Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the gas-powered Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in the state. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on the vehicles denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

The Trump administration’s fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California during the first year of his second term, along with Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases. The lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and he reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said.

Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program. Details, including how much motorists will receive, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been finalized.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 10%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year, companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The U.S. benchmark price for oil is down about 20% from where it was a year ago, and the average retail gasoline price — the price drivers pay at the pump — is down nearly 10%.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and they predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was reelected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wish list. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost 1 in 3 households, or over 80 million Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

“The Toxic Substances Control Act is the country’s bedrock chemical safety law, and it keeps dangerous chemicals out of our homes, workplaces and communities.
Americans don’t want potentially toxic chemicals fast-tracked into their lives,” said Slaney.
The discussion draft would make sweeping changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act that threaten the public’s health.
This would severely undermine EPA’s ability to protect Americans from the worst toxic chemicals already in use, like cancer-causing formaldehyde and vinyl chloride.","The Toxic Substances Control Act – the primary U.S. chemical safety law – gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority and responsibility to review chemicals for safety, both before and after they enter the market. The law was significantly strengthened in 2016 when Congress passed a bipartisan overhaul of the law. In managing the safety of chemicals, the Toxic Substances Control Act requires EPA to take steps to protect the people most at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals, like children, pregnant women, workers and people living near chemical facilities.

American families should be able to trust that the chemicals in their everyday products have been assessed for safety and won’t cause them serious health problems.

New polling from EDF shows overwhelming support across party lines for the Toxic Substances Control Act. The law is universally popular, with more than four-in-five (82%) favoring it. That support is consistent regardless of gender, race, age, education level or party affiliation.

Despite this popularity, this week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a discussion draft bill that would fundamentally dismantle the core responsibility for EPA to ensure the safety of chemicals in our economy and everyday lives.

“The Toxic Substances Control Act is the country’s bedrock chemical safety law, and it keeps dangerous chemicals out of our homes, workplaces and communities. Americans don’t want potentially toxic chemicals fast-tracked into their lives,” said Slaney.

The discussion draft would make sweeping changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act that threaten the public’s health.

No more scientific process for new chemicals

The proposal to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act would remove the requirement for EPA to follow an independent, scientific process to determine if a chemical can be used safely before it can come onto the market.

In addition to eliminating this requirement, the bill would proactively invite industry to participate in reviewing their own products. This would dramatically undermine EPA’s responsibility and authority to protect Americans from the most toxic chemicals and to adhere to a scientifically robust, independent process that Americans can trust.

Sets up a rubber stamp approval process for new chemicals

Many dangerous chemicals, including many PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” entered the market before a bipartisan Congress strengthened the law in 2016. The current proposal would bring back this process that allowed forever chemicals into the market by flipping the safety standard on its head.

Instead of requiring EPA to prove a chemical doesn’t pose an unreasonable risk as is required under the current law, the proposal makes it EPA’s responsibility to prove that a chemical would likely pose an unreasonable risk. This small distinction would have major impacts – it would shift the burden of proof away from safety, effectively turning EPA’s safety review into a rubber stamp for any chemical the industry wants to bring to market.

Blanket approvals for most uses

In this proposal, once a chemical is rubber stamped for one use, it could more easily be used in additional unapproved ways. In practice, this could lead to a chemical that was approved for use in industrial settings – with proper worker protections in place – potentially being used in homes, schools and daycares.

Puts industry profits over our health

Republicans’ proposal would severely weaken EPA’s ability to regulate existing chemicals that we know are toxic. The Republicans’ proposed requirement that EPA prove a chemical is likely to pose an unreasonable risk to public health is intended to set a nearly unreachable standard for addressing the risks from dangerous chemicals. The discussion draft bill also diminishes what EPA can consider harmful in the first place when evaluating toxic chemicals, requiring EPA to apply a vague and difficult standard of proof, making it harder to regulate toxic chemicals. It minimizes the estimates of the risks to those living near chemical plants, workers, children and pregnant people by failing to consider their full chemical exposure.

This proposal would also limit the tools EPA can use to eliminate unreasonable risks, putting industry profits ahead of people’s health. This would severely undermine EPA’s ability to protect Americans from the worst toxic chemicals already in use, like cancer-causing formaldehyde and vinyl chloride. These chemicals have long devastated the health of workers and communities on the fenceline of industrial facilities.

The bill also allows the chemical industry and manufacturers to delay for months or years the regulation of existing toxic chemicals by challenging in court any scientific finding by EPA that a chemical is harmful. The proposed process changes would prevent EPA from taking actions to reduce the risks to consumers until after the industry litigation is over.

Limits the information that can be required on dangerous chemicals

The proposal would make it significantly more difficult to produce key information on the hazards of chemicals, how people are exposed to them, and how they harm the environment. It even prohibits EPA from requiring testing for whole groups of chemicals, including highly toxic chemicals. This information is key to properly characterizing the risks we face from groups of toxic chemicals, such as PFAS or “forever chemicals.”

Hazardous loophole

This proposal creates a loophole for so-called advanced or chemical recycling – essentially the burning of plastic waste. It would allow harmful products produced through this process to be considered “equivalent” to chemicals already on the market without undergoing a safety review. Despite the fact that the products are contaminated with plastic’s toxic additives and harmful byproducts such as dioxins, these false equivalents would be rubberstamped as safe.

Why now?

The chemicals industry and manufacturers have advocated for most of the proposals in this bill, and according to news reports EPA “keeps adding former industry lobbyists to the office that manages TSCA.” The Trump EPA has made moves to roll back numerous essential Toxic Substances Control Act protections against toxic chemicals, including altering the way the agency evaluates chemical risk and lowballing the risks from cancer-causing formaldehyde.",https://blogs.edf.org/health/wp-content/blogs.dir/11/files//getty-image-room-TSCA-chemicals.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:48.034180

That takes effect immediately and runs through July 19, 2028. ‘Our goal was always to get a contract that supports Ironwood nurses so we can recruit and retain the skilled nurses our community needs,’ said Sarah Trudgeon, RN, and president of the local Michigan Nurses Association union at Aspirus Ironwood. ‘A strong nurses’ contract is a big part of protecting access to health care that we currently have in our area.’”

New Jersey Labor Unions Announce New Coalition Dedicated to Climate Action, Affordability and Union Jobs: “‘New Jersey has a long history of building and innovating, but when it comes to building our own energy, we have lost our way. We import far too much of our energy from out of state, which exacerbates high prices and sends jobs in the energy industry away. With this new agenda from Climate Jobs New Jersey, we can take control of our energy future and get back to building our own energy. This will create local union jobs, bring economic growth to our communities, and give us the clean energy we need to meet rising energy demands and confront the climate crisis,’ said Charles Wowkanech, president of New Jersey AFL-CIO and President of Climate Jobs New Jersey.”

Examining the Rise in Unionization Among Local Organizations: “Employees at the Columbus Dispatch newspaper and the Columbus Metropolitan Library have recently announced plans to unionize. This follows growing unionization efforts both locally and nationally. Places like Amazon and Starbucks have made national news over their unionizing efforts. Locally, everyone from Jeni’s Splendid Ice Cream employees to nurses at Nationwide Children’s Hospital have started a push towards organized labor. We're talking about the factors pushing Columbus employees toward unionizing on this hour of All Sides.”

New Mexico Hospital Nurses Vote to Unionize: “Nurses at San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington, New Mexico, have voted to join the Communications Workers of America in District 7, according to a January 8 union news release. The vote covers about 350 nurses at the nonprofit hospital. CWA said the group will now focus on organizing four smaller satellite clinics and negotiating a first contract. San Juan Regional is a 198-bed, level 3 trauma center. In a statement shared with Becker’s, the hospital said it respects employees’ rights to decide whether to unionize and will negotiate with the union in good faith once a request to bargain is made.”

Providence Portland Medical Techs Unionize: “Around 270 medical techs at Providence Portland Medical Center unionized with the Oregon Nurses Association (ONA) in a 181-49 vote January 7. The new unit includes more than a dozen occupations, including surgical technicians, respiratory therapists, occupational therapy assistants, and technologists who operate ultrasound, MRI and mammogram equipment. Priorities for the new unit include increasing staffing levels and fair wages and benefits, ONA spokesperson Myrna Jensen said in an email to the Labor Press.”

Actors' Equity Praises Gov. Hochul’s Initiative to Invest in Theatre Spaces: “‘NY SPACE is a visionary program that recognizes the importance of the live arts all across New York State,’ said Brooke Shields, president of Actors' Equity Association. ‘For our members, it means greater job opportunities as more employers know they can keep their lights on. For the communities where these theatres operate, this is both a cultural enrichment and a financial investment; the average non-profit arts event attendee spends $38.46 in the local economy beyond tickets on their evening out. Furthermore, when employers can put down roots in a physical space, they can invest in those spaces, making for safer workplaces for our members. Thank you to Governor Hochul for this act of leadership. We look forward to seeing this initiative in full swing.’”

AFGE Urges Appellate Judges to Uphold Injunction Against Trump’s Anti-Union Executive Orders: “The nation’s largest federal employee union on Monday urged a panel of federal appeals judges to affirm a lower court ruling that found that President Trump’s executive orders purporting to strip two-thirds of the federal workforce of their collective bargaining rights amounted to retaliation for protected speech under the First Amendment. Trump’s edicts, signed in March and August, cited a seldom-used provision of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act to exclude most federal agencies from federal sector labor law under the auspices of national security. A federal judge in California in June issued a preliminary injunction blocking the orders’ implementation, but a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that decision last summer, finding that the lower court did not adequately consider whether the president would have taken the same action against labor organizations absent their various legal challenges against the president’s personnel policies.”

U.S. HHS Reverses Deep Cuts to CDC Safety Research Agency NIOSH: “The Trump Administration is reversing its deep staffing cuts to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, reinstating hundreds of employees. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed the reversal in an email Tuesday. NIOSH conducts or funds most research into U.S. workplace health and safety. Among other duties, the agency’s scientists are responsible for evaluating the risks of new chemicals, testing and certifying the effectiveness of N95 masks, monitoring mine cave-in hazards and administering the health-care program for Sept. 11 responders and survivors. Labor advocates and businesses had warned of devastating consequences after the government moved to eliminate most of NIOSH’s staff last year.”

U.S. Teachers Union Says It Is Leaving X Over Sexualized AI Images of Children: “The American Federation of Teachers says it is leaving X, citing the social media site's creation and dissemination of ‘sickening’ images of children in various states of undress. In an interview with Reuters, AFT President Randi Weingarten said that the site had already been degraded by extremists and trolls since Elon Musk's 2022 takeover, before which the platform was known as Twitter. But the recent proliferation of nonconsensual images of women and children in bikinis or underwear generated by X's artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, had made the site unusable, she said.”

Maine Med Nurses Ratify Union Contract with 21% Pay Increase, Workplace Protections: “Nurses at MaineHealth Maine Medical Center in Portland recently ratified a new contract that includes a 21% pay increase over three years and measures to guard against workplace violence. The contract, which runs through the end of 2028, is the second contract for nurses at the state’s largest hospital since they voted in 2021 to join the Maine State Nurses Association and National Nurses Organizing Committee. Nurses at the hospital, MMC nurses, signed their first contract in September 2022 and secured the latest contract after four months of bargaining.”

Streetcar Operators Finalize First Union Contract: “After successfully unionizing in 2024, streetcar workers are close to finalizing a contract. In February 2024, more than two dozen workers who operate and maintain the city of Milwaukee’s streetcar, called The Hop, organized a union with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 998 (ATU), which also represents Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) workers.”

How Vets in Labor Have Joined the Fight Against Trump: “The U.S. is home to 17 million military veterans. About 1.3 million of them currently work in union jobs, with women and people of color making up the fastest-growing cohorts. Veterans are more likely to join a union than non-veterans, according to the AFL-CIO. In half a dozen states, 25% or more of all actively employed veterans belong to unions. In the heyday of industrial unionism in the decades following World War II, hundreds of thousands of former soldiers could be found on the front lines of labor struggles in auto, steel, meatpacking, electrical equipment manufacturing, mining, trucking, and the telephone industry. Many World War II vets became militant stewards, local union officers, and, in some cases, well-known union reformers in the United Mine Workers and Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers.”

Springfield's 3M Workers Vote to Unionize Under United Steelworkers: “Springfield's 3M plant has been a major employer in the city since 1967. Now, the plant's 370 employees will be represented by a union following a successful organization effort. On December 20, workers elected to be represented by the United Steelworkers union, the nation's largest industrial labor union, joining a coalition of employees at other 3M plants across the country in seeking union representation. According to the National Labor Relations Board election results, there were 370 eligible voters, though 332 ballots were counted. Out of those, 233 votes were cast for the labor union and 99 against.”

Kaldi’s Coffee Workers Vote to Form Union, Accuse St. Louis Chain of Union-Busting: “Workers at Kaldi’s Skinker Boulevard location appear headed to unionization. On Friday, workers at the St. Louis specialty coffee chain location voted 7-2 in favor of unionization with the National Labor Relations Board. The results are not yet certified, however, and the union is challenging multiple ballots that it said were from employees who shouldn’t have been eligible to vote. The NLRB and Unite Here Local 74 are accusing Kaldi's of anti-union actions, including bringing in new or transferred employees in order to sway the outcome of the vote.”

Graduate Student Workers Secure First Contract with University of Maine System: “After more than 700 days of negotiations, the University of Maine System reached a tentative agreement with the graduate student workers union for its first-ever contract. ‘It took lot of organizing power for years. Hundreds of grad workers came together for each of the issues, and we fought really hard,’ Andrea Tirrell, a bargaining committee member for the University of Maine Graduate Workers Union, said.”

Science News Media Guild Ratifies First Contract, Securing Major Gains in Pay and Leave: “85% of the 27 members in the Science News Media Guild, workers who publish Science News and Science News Explores, have voted to ratify their first collective bargaining agreement. The historic contract establishes increases in pay, including cost of living raises and equity raises, sick and parental leave and importantly, codifes just-cause protections. The union launched on November 14, 2023, after more than 80% of non-management employees voted to unionize with the Washington-Baltimore News Guild. The ratification follows 625 days of negotiating with the Society for Science, which included a successful 24-hour walkout on November 5, 2025.”

SAG-AFTRA Leaders Sean Astin and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland on Their Negotiating Approach, Disney-Open AI Deal, Chance of Longer Contract Term & More: “The Hollywood labor landscape will have different contours this year as above-the-line guilds try to reach deals with the studios and streamers and avoid a repeat of the damaging strikes of 2023. For one thing, SAG-AFTRA will be the first union to negotiate, taking the spot normally occupied by the Directors Guild. SAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union’s national executive director and chief negotiator, have confidence that their early start (talks kick off February 9) will be a difference-maker. The current contract won’t expire until June 30. ‘Part of the reason we wanted to go first is that we wanted to be able to have the time we feel is necessary,’ Astin told Deadline in an interview during CES in Las Vegas. ‘We appreciate that [AMPTP members] are willing to engage early in order to properly examine each item.’”",https://aflcio.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/working-people-weekly-list.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:31.279846

EPA’s proposal seeks to limit the scope of state-issued water quality certifications (WQCs) under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to water quality impacts associated with discharges authorized by federal agency actions. The Proposed Rule also addresses concerns raised by applicants for federal licenses and permits (including for hydroelectric projects, natural gas pipelines, and other energy and infrastructure projects) that certain states have overstepped their Section 401 authority to impose onerous terms and conditions unrelated to water quality and artificially extended the statutory time limits for issuing WQCs.

CWA Section 401 requires any applicant for a federal license or permit that may result in any discharge to waters of the United States (WOTUS) to obtain a state certification that “any such discharge will comply with the applicable provisions” of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the CWA — all of which relate to effluent limitations. States may impose conditions on such certifications, including to comply with “any other appropriate requirement of State law” as provided in CWA Section 401(d). Over time, however, many states have used this conditioning authority to address issues unrelated to water quality.

EPA’s Proposed Rule, similar to the 2020 Rule, would narrow the scope of WQC conditions and provide predictable timelines for projects to receive their WQCs. In so doing, the Proposed Rule rolls back significant portions of the current rule, issued in 2023 under the Biden administration (2023 Rule).

Following is an overview of key changes in the Proposed Rule:

Scope of Certification – EPA notes the current 2023 Rule “provides States with sweeping authority to decide the fate of nationally important infrastructure projects, such as natural gas pipelines and hydropower dams, based on potentially speculative water quality impacts not linked to a point source discharge into waters of the United States.” To correct this, and consistent with the 2020 Rule, the Proposed Rule would scrap the 2023 Rule’s provision that the WQC can relate to the “activity as a whole” and instead limit state certifications to addressing discharges “from a point source into waters of the United States.” This, in turn, would prevent states from using Section 401 to address nonpoint source impacts, impacts to purely state waters that are not considered WOTUS, and non-water quality policy concerns such as land use, endangered species, and climate change. The preamble to the Proposed Rule describes in detail how limiting WQCs in this way is consistent with the legislative history and plain language of the CWA, relying heavily on the Supreme Court’s landmark 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo curtailing judicial deference to agencies’ statutory interpretations.

Request for Certification – The Proposed Rule would create a uniform, national standard for what a permit applicant must submit in a “request for certification” to establish, with certainty, the start of the one-year statutory period for states to act on a WQC request. Conversely, the Proposed Rule would bar states from imposing their own “completeness” criteria that control when the clock starts — although they may still request additional information from applicants.

Timing of Review – The Proposed Rule reiterates that the failure of a state to act on a WQC request within one year results in a waiver, while imposing several restrictions on states’ ability to extend the one-year certification deadline. Extensions would require the approval of the federal agency and only be allowed for specified reasons, and state certifying authorities would be barred from orchestrating withdrawal and resubmittal of requests to extend the one-year “reasonable period of time” cap — a maneuver that has long been criticized by applicants as gamesmanship that further facilitates the injection of non-water quality policy priorities into the certification process. Notably, the Proposed Rule does not foreclose another form of gamesmanship: denial of WQC applications without prejudice.

Contents of Certifications – Among other changes, the Proposed Rule would require states to explain how each condition of a certification relates to a CWA effluent limitation and would mandate any WQC denial to cite the specific water quality requirement at issue, which may deter certain states’ efforts to prolong the WQC process by denying applications without prejudice. Notably, EPA explains that WQC conditions should be limited to “water quality requirements” defined as applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the CWA, and any applicable and appropriate state water quality-related regulatory requirements for discharges. In explaining what water quality-related requirements are “applicable and appropriate,” EPA expressly provides that it is not limiting state regulatory provisions to only EPA-approved provisions — although it requests comment on this point. The Proposed Rule continues to allow states to incorporate narrative water quality standards and other regulatory requirements that apply to point source discharges, declining to limit conditions to just “numeric water quality criteria.”

Modifications – The Proposed Rule would allow states to modify a previously granted WQC only when the federal permitting agency and the applicant agree to the modification, including the content of that modification.

Neighboring Jurisdictions – The Proposed Rule would streamline the process by which other states may object to a discharge that “may affect” their water quality under CWA Section 401(a)(2), including establishing a 60-day deadline for the other state to file an objection and a 90-day deadline for the permitting agency to act on a valid state objection.

In aggregate, the proposed amendments would create a WQC process that is more predictable, provides long-term certainty for WQC holders, and significantly constrains states’ ability to bootstrap other policy concerns onto their Section 401 authority. However, EPA notes in the preamble that if a state imposes conditions in a WQC that exceed the scope outlined in the 401 Rule, the remedy would be found in court. This means litigation of both the Proposed Rule and individual WQCs is likely to continue.

EPA did not include several regulatory changes suggested by industry during past comment periods in the Proposed Rule, indicating that there are still opportunities for further improvement before EPA adopts a final rule. For example, the Proposed Rule is silent on the issue of who (states and/or action agencies) has the authority to enforce WQC conditions incorporated into the federal license or permit, as well as the extent to which EPA or the federal permitting agencies can serve as a “gatekeeper” for WQC conditions that exceed the scope of CWA Section 401.

They spend on average 20 percent of their income on energy bills — more than three times the average for households above 200 percent FPL spend on energy bills (on average, these households spend 4 percent of their income on energy bills).","Everyone deserves affordable, reliable, safe, and clean energy to meet their everyday needs. But rising energy costs threaten energy access, especially for low-income people and people of color, who experience the highest energy burdens and are also struggling with rising food, health care, and housing costs. Rising energy costs are due in large part to construction cost spikes, reflecting factors like supply chain bottlenecks and tariffs on building materials, and to natural gas price changes as well as increased energy demand, to which data centers are a heavy contributor.

It is clear that capital investments are needed to meet the rising demand for energy. In the face of this, we must find ways to build more resources to reduce energy costs, or at a minimum slow their growth. With the right incentives, investment strategies, and policies, states can harness cleaner energy sources that are less expensive for households and improve people’s health, while helping to ensure the cost of energy is more fairly shared between household and non-household users. This paper describes a range of steps states can take to meet our growing energy needs in a way that works for consumers and helps facilitate the continued transition to clean energy.

States seeking to address energy affordability during 2026 legislative sessions should:

provide direct energy assistance to low- and moderate-income households for short-term relief;

better manage how costs are incurred and allocated to control the rate of medium-term increases; and

facilitate the continued transition to an energy system dominated by clean and renewable sources for long-term affordability and safety for everyone.

The energy transition is necessary, inevitable, and underway. 2025 saw the U.S.’s first month in which clean energy sources surpassed fossil fuels in electricity generation, driven in large part by the increasing availability of low-cost solar and wind. This energy transition, if done right, will create not just cleaner air and a healthier climate, but lower bills for everyone. States should make smart, informed choices to reduce known challenges and speed up the transition to a system that is affordable, safe, and reliable for all.

Rising Energy Bills Are Driven by Higher Demand, Construction Costs, and the Price of Natural Gas

Solar and wind energy generation is cheaper to build and run than fossil fuels, a trend that will likely only continue as renewables technology continues to improve. What’s more, with the energy transition already in progress, infrastructure and fuel from the fossil energy system are becoming more expensive or obsolete.

But to fully reap the cost benefits of clean energy, electric grid infrastructure and state regulatory and policy systems must be optimized for its use. This will create some short-term costs, and it’s important that states implement measures to mitigate those costs when households are already experiencing rising energy prices due to other factors.

Average U.S. electricity prices are rising faster than overall inflation for the first time in 15 years — and are expected to increase by 7.6 percent this winter. While electricity prices are rising, currently the average price is similar to those experienced in 2010 in inflation-adjusted terms. Some families are already experiencing affordability challenges, and if prices continue to rise, more will strain to afford their energy bills.

The Republican budget reconciliation megabill enacted in July 2025 dismantled key policies that would have mitigated some of these increasing bills for households. The megabill made over $300 billion in cuts to clean energy tax credits and rescinded close to $8 billion in funding for grants and loans for clean energy, energy waste reduction, improvements to the electric grid, and energy upgrades in affordable housing enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These investments had been designed to cover some of the transition costs to cleaner and less expensive energy. Some models project that these cuts will translate into higher energy bills for consumers.

Many households were already struggling to pay their utility bills before the megabill was enacted. Our analysis finds that 6.5 percent of households indicated being behind on utility bills in 2023. For renters, the rate was higher, at 10 percent of households. Analysis from the Century Foundation finds that nearly 1 in 20 households have severe past-due utility debt, meaning their accounts were sent to collections or have been delinquent for more than 89 days and will soon be sent to collections. It also finds the average overdue balance on utility bills has increased .

The national average electricity price rose between 2021 and 2024, driven by large increases in California; the Northeast, and Maine in particular; and the Mid-Atlantic. Prices in many Central, Southeast, and Mountain region states remained flat or fell, but experts predict further increases in all regions in 2026. Key factors behind these increases: rising construction costs for maintaining the electric grid and building new energy generation facilities, increased electricity demand, and natural gas price increases, with households served by for-profit utilities experiencing higher increases.

Rising construction costs: Rising construction costs, due to supply chain bottlenecks, permitting delays, and tariffs on building materials, increase the cost of needed upgrades to the electric grid. These upgrades, which are the most significant contributor to rising energy bills, are necessary to protect against climate change-fueled extreme weather events like wildfires and hurricane-force winds; accommodate new demand from data centers and electrification of transportation, heating and cooling, and appliances; and make it possible to connect new resources like wind, solar, and batteries to the grid. The problem exists nationwide but is more acute in places with higher construction costs, like New York and California. It may also be worse in places where investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are responsible for grid upgrades. IOUs receive a guaranteed rate of return for capital investments and are therefore incentivized to increase capital expenditures.

Increased demand: According to an analysis by ICF, after two decades of mostly flat demand growth, U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow 25 percent by 2030 and 78 percent by 2050. Current demand increases are being driven largely by data centers and manufacturing in certain sectors like semiconductors; in the future, building and vehicle electrification are expected to become significant drivers as well, though the Trump Administration has taken steps to slow vehicle electrification by cutting tax credits and withholding electric vehicle charging funding from states. As electric utilities prepare to meet increased demand, they must expand and improve the electric grid, including by building and connecting new sources of energy to it. Backlogs for connecting these new sources are one reason the Northeast, in particular, is experiencing challenges meeting electricity demand, though these challenges aren’t unique to that region. In an ideal scenario, large electricity users like data centers and manufacturing facilities can drive down prices by helping pay for the cost of upgrades. In reality, households and small businesses often get saddled with financially burdensome infrastructure investments. That is because utility companies may offer deals to large users, resulting in those users not paying their fair share, or a new large energy load may so far outstrip current demand that new infrastructure investments can’t be absorbed at a reasonable price. In some cases utility companies may build in anticipation of demand that fails to materialize, with households left to foot much of the bill

Natural gas (also known as methane gas): Over 40 percent of U.S. electricity is powered by natural gas. In contrast to renewables which have no fuel costs, natural gas is subject to price spikes, like the one caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. High natural gas prices are the leading cause of high energy bills in several states, including Maine, where electricity prices are growing at the third fastest rate in the nation. Natural gas prices are rising and are expected to rise further due to increased exports, which increase international demand for U.S. gas, driving up the price for domestic consumers.

Higher Energy Bills Hurt Low-Income People and People of Color Most

Low- and moderate-income households and households of color are disproportionately feeling these rising energy bills. These households are more likely than others to live in homes that are not energy efficient, either because of lack of insulation or inefficient heating and cooling systems, increasing energy costs. Households whose incomes are below the federal poverty level (FPL) are more likely than others to face severe energy burden. They spend on average 20 percent of their income on energy bills — more than three times the average for households above 200 percent FPL spend on energy bills (on average, these households spend 4 percent of their income on energy bills).

Looking regionally, low-income households in the Northeast and Midwest tend to spend the largest share of their income on energy bills. (See Figure 2.) In Maine and Connecticut, for example, low-income households spend an average of 31 percent of their income on energy bills.

Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic households face significantly higher energy burdens than white households, driven by income inequities and the older housing stock and lower homeownership rates in communities of color that are often the result of past and present discrimination in the economy and housing market.

Our analysis finds that 31 percent of Black households, 31 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), and 27 percent of Hispanic households have high energy burdens (energy costs above 6 percent), compared to 24 percent of white households that do so. AIAN households also face the highest frequency of severe energy burden, with 1 in 5 households spending more than 10 percent of their income on energy bills. (See Figure 3.)

Immediate Action: Expand Energy Assistance for Low- and Moderate-Income Households

Low- and moderate-income households have the highest energy burdens and are least able to afford high electricity prices. Energy assistance is a targeted, cost-effective intervention that helps people stay safe in their homes and meet their everyday needs. Energy assistance can be monetary or take the form of prohibitions against shutting off vulnerable households’ electricity.

States can take steps to enact or expand these kinds of vital assistance. Recent threats to federal benefits — like the Trump Administration’s moves to eliminate funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) — make state actions even more important.

Expanding eligibility and enrollment: Energy assistance programs, like LIHEAP, are funded primarily through federal block grants and supplemented by state funds or utility ratepayers. But chronic underfunding, apart from even the Administration’s current funding threats, means these programs only serve roughly 18 percent of eligible households. In some states, like California and Texas, LIHEAP serves only about 5 percent of eligible households. Additionally, enrollment barriers and income thresholds for eligibility mean the program isn’t always serving those with the greatest energy burdens. States can expand supplemental funding, advocate for increased federal funding, and streamline enrollment and documentation processes. For example, a 2024 Michigan law assesses a utility surcharge to expand funding for the state’s program and extends eligibility to over 300,000 additional households.

Enacting moratoriums on utility shutoffs: Many, but not all, states have policies that protect vulnerable households from utility disconnection. States can expand these protections. In particular, they can add hot weather disconnection protections — like those they have for cold — as New Jersey did in 2025.

Some states are providing energy bill rebates to all ratepayers, which can be meaningful for some households. But these small, one- or two-time payments aren’t a reliable source of relief for residents who most need it. Additionally, some states are funding these payments using money allocated to vital clean energy and climate resilience projects, potentially delaying the work needed to move to cleaner, less expensive energy sources and forgoing resilience upgrades that would bring down the cost of future infrastructure repairs. If states do offer these payments, they should look to New Jersey, which provided larger payments for low-income households, and Maryland, which secured the funding from utility companies instead of reallocating state funds.

Short- and Medium-Term Action: Change Utility Incentives, Manage Utility Spending, and Assign Costs Equitably

While energy assistance is important to address immediate needs, states should also enact legislation that helps bring down the cost of household energy bills. Doing so requires that states change regulations so that, as utilities make needed investments, they do so in a cost-effective manner that prioritizes safety and affordability. States should also ensure that equity guides how costs are distributed among ratepayers.

States can achieve this by:

Including affordability in utility regulator mandates. State legislatures have the power to mandate that Public Utility Commissions (PUCs), which regulate utility companies in each state, include affordability as a goal in their regulatory actions. In 2021 Maine tasked its utility commission with mitigating disproportionate energy burdens, and in 2024 Minnesota mandated that its PUC establish standards to fairly share the cost of utility system upgrades between, among other things, residential and non-residential energy users and increase low-income households’ access to energy efficiency programs.

Considering regulatory structures based on utility performance. Performance-based ratemaking (PBR) is the practice of compensating utilities based on their performance against target outcomes — including cost effectiveness and reliability — instead of solely the cost of service, while minimizing the perverse incentive utilities have to overbuild capital-intensive systems. For example, following the 2018 Camp Fire in California, the state and the utility company underwent protracted negotiations to create a grid upgrade plan that balanced effective wildfire protections and consumer protections from rising energy costs. PBR is gaining traction in several states, such as Connecticut, which passed a comprehensive PBR package in 2023 that included social equity and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in its target outcomes.

Making it easier to install and use the lowest-cost sources of energy. Although transmission and distribution costs are the biggest drivers of increased electricity prices, the price of electric generation plays a role as well. Solar and wind are cheaper to run than fossil fuels, a cost advantage that’s likely to only grow as the technology continues to improve and fossil fuels are phased out for economic and environmental reasons. To increase large-scale solar and wind projects, states should:

Remove barriers to building large renewable energy facilities by streamlining siting and permitting processes, creating state-backed project financing such as revolving loans, and upgrading technology and processes for adding energy sources to the electric grid. California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Washington all recently overhauled their permitting systems for clean energy.

Enable more residents to benefit from renewable energy sources by enacting and protecting “net metering” policies and community choice aggregation. Net metering allows residential and commercial customers who generate their own electricity from solar power to sell the electricity they aren’t using back into the grid, significantly improving the economic case for switching to renewable energy. Community choice aggregation (CCA) allows local governments to procure power for residents and businesses from sources outside their utility company. The utility continues to provide energy transmission and distribution services and CCA participants get cheaper, cleaner power.

Require the cheapest sources of energy to provide power first, a practice known as “economic dispatch.” Utilities that own power generation resources sometimes run coal plants even when cheaper power is available because they earn profit not from minimizing fuel costs, but from keeping the plants they own in the rate base, that is, the value of property owned by the utility company on which it is permitted to earn a specific rate of return. If the utility company doesn’t operate the coal plant regularly, regulators may deem it no longer “used and useful,” which can force its retirement and reduce the utility’s earnings. But by running the plant — even at a loss — the utility helps justify keeping it in the rate base, while the higher fuel costs are passed on to customers. Utilities may also run coal plants to satisfy minimum purchase requirements in coal supply contracts, even when doing so is more expensive. State regulators can help end this practice by disallowing utilities from recovering costs that result from uneconomic dispatch, and by rejecting inefficient fuel supply contract terms.

Shifting power from corporations to consumers. Many aspects of utility spending lack transparency. And corporations often have outsized influence in regulatory proceedings due to their large financial, political, and legal resources, resulting in high corporate profits and contributing to inequitable utility rates. Six states have implemented intervenor compensation programs — which compensate consumer advocates for their time and expertise when intervening in electricity rate cases — to level the playing field between investor-owned utilities and consumers. Also, at least seven states have implemented laws prohibiting utilities from recovering lobbying costs from ratepayers. Some, like Maryland, also enhance accountability by requiring utilities to disclose their votes in regional electric grid proceedings.

Regulate data centers and other large energy users. States can study the costs these users impose on the electric grid; enact surcharges on them and use the revenue for electric bill assistance; or direct regulators to require that utility companies more equitably allocate the costs of energy system upgrades that serve them. States can also pass laws requiring large energy users to disclose their energy use, enabling regulators, utilities, and grid operators to better plan for their needs and help avoid price shocks. Requiring aspects of data center deals to be made public helps utilities avoid pursuing upgrades for loads — and paying customers — that ultimately don’t materialize. Texas SB6, enacted in 2025, seeks to protect residential and small business customers from subsidizing speculative large-load developments by increasing visibility into large-load proposals and requiring upfront financial commitments from developers.

States should also be wary of arguments that giving more power to IOUs will lower electricity prices. Measures to avoid include the practice known as “Construction Work in Progress,” which allows utilities to begin recovering construction costs of new energy generation facilities from ratepayers while they are still under construction. This exposes ratepayers to the risk of paying for new energy buildout with long timelines and no guarantee that the project will be completed. This was the case in Georgia, where ratepayers began paying for the Votgle Plant upgrade in 2010, which was $23 billion over budget and didn’t begin coming online until 2023, resulting in the biggest rate hikes in the state’s history. States where the utility industry is “deregulated,” that is, where utility companies are only allowed to own transmission and distribution infrastructure, should avoid “re-regulation,” because allowing utilities to own energy generation infrastructure in addition to transmission and distribution increases their monopoly power and results in poor outcomes for ratepayers.

Positioning For Long-Term Success: Plan for a Phased Energy Transition That Works for Everyone

The energy transition is necessary, inevitable, and underway. If done right, it will create cleaner air, a healthier climate, and lower bills for everyone. However, during the middle of this transition, with fossil and clean energy operating simultaneously, infrastructure and regulatory systems are not optimized for either system. Smart planning to guide the choices states make regarding energy technology, siting, and operations can address the near-term challenges and speed up the energy transition.

The following are some best practices that states can follow:

Accurately forecast energy demand to adequately plan for grid upgrades. By supporting utility companies and grid operators to more accurately forecast demand, states can help create the conditions for adequate generation buildout and grid upgrades, thus avoiding price shocks. States can pass laws that promote the forecasts’ robustness and accuracy by requiring use of multiple forecast timelines and scenarios; consideration of new technologies and policies that may affect demand (such as heat pumps, electric vehicles, and electrified buildings); and estimates for peak capacity. As the energy transition brings more distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar and battery storage online, states should ensure their energy demand forecasts account for how these new, flexible resources impact the electric grid.

Address stranded fossil energy assets. As the energy transition progresses, infrastructure and fuel from the fossil energy system is becoming more expensive or obsolete. This results in utility companies passing on to consumers associated higher operating costs and debt recovery.

For example, many coal plants are no longer economical to run, but utility companies are still using them because it’s easier to pass those costs to customers than replace the asset. New gas plants and gas distribution network upgrades are incurring upfront costs now that corporations will expect to recoup from ratepayers regardless of how much longer those systems remain operational, meaning whoever stays on gas (likely lower-income households that can’t electrify without financial assistance) will experience astronomical prices.

To address these problems, states need to implement a set of policies – ranging from future energy system planning to banning fossil fuel use altogether — to limit or prevent utility companies from building out fossil fuel assets. Several states have begun proceedings to plan for a phased, equitable transition off the natural gas system. And, once implemented, New York’s law requiring new buildings to be all-electric (that is, no oil or gas) will slow the buildout of the fossil gas distribution system. States should also help utility companies responsibly retire existing assets faster, such as by providing low-cost refinancing so they can more quickly pay off the remaining cost of the asset.

Unfortunately, many states are pursuing short-sighted policies that prolong existing — or even build new — fossil fuel infrastructure. These policies are often advanced by groups with ties to fossil fuel corporations, lean on outdated assumptions about the energy system, and ultimately will burden ratepayers with stranded asset costs. The same groups often work to block state progress on this issue. New York paused implementation of its all-electric buildings law in a deal to end litigation brought by industry groups, and the Trump Administration has issued stay-open orders for coal plants in four states, in a questionable use of its power to alleviate electric grid emergencies and at a high cost to ratepayers. States should push back against these challenges and continue to use their authority to halt fossil fuel buildout to avoid even higher future energy costs, to say nothing of the severe impacts to health, safety, and the climate. More than that, states can proactively advance racial, economic, and health justice through climate action.

“We are committed to protecting and preserving our natural resources — and the waterbodies on Cape Cod are some of Massachusetts’ finest,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “Cape residents deserve clean and healthy water, and these grants are essential to addressing nitrogen pollution once and for all.”

The Natural Resource Nitrogen Sensitive Areas (NRNSA) Grant Program, administered by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), helps communities develop plans to comprehensively address wastewater and other sources of nitrogen pollution. Excess nitrogen has been an ongoing problem in Cape Cod, where it has fueled the growth of nuisance plants, weeds, and algae that use up much of the oxygen in the water — harming water quality and forcing out indigenous fish and plant species.

“When people are on the Cape, they want to experience the fresh salt air and enjoy time on the water.” said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. “This funding is a critical step in reversing decades of nitrogen pollution and protecting what makes the Cape so special.”

State regulations allow Cape communities to choose a watershed-wide solution to mitigate nitrogen pollution by applying for a Watershed Permit. Alternatively, a Town may choose to address wastewater solutions, via Title 5, by using improved septic technologies for new construction in areas heavily impacted by nitrogen. MassDEP is supporting the work of towns that choose the comprehensive Watershed Permit solution by providing both technical and financial assistance.

The nine Cape Cod towns receiving NRNSA grants are:

Barnstable — $137,719

State Senator Julian Cyr (D-Truro):

""Nitrogen pollution remains one of the most urgent environmental and public health challenges facing Cape Cod, threatening our estuaries, shellfisheries, and the long-term vitality of our tourism-based economy. These grants will directly benefit towns in my district — Barnstable, Brewster, Dennis, Truro, Wellfleet, and Yarmouth — as they work to meet updated Title 5 requirements and advance smart solutions tailored to local conditions. I'm grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration and MassDEP for investing in practical, science-driven tools that help Cape communities protect water quality, comply with state standards, and safeguard the natural resources that define this special region.""

One early sign that things might not go so smoothly for the U.S. in its quest for Venezuelan oil was how American energy companies responded.

In a meeting between oil executives and President Trump this month at the White House, Darren Woods, head of Exxon Mobil, called Venezuela “uninvestable.” Another oil magnate and Trump ally, Harold Hamm, was more diplomatic, but not exactly enthusiastic. Venezuela has “its challenges,” Hamm said.

Trump has made it clear that he wants to move fast. At that meeting, which he called less than a week after U.S. troops captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump told oil executives to “rapidly rebuild” the South American country’s oil industry.

Last week, exclusive reporting by my colleague Anatoly Kurmanaev found that the U.S. has already begun selling 50 million barrels of the Venezuelan oil that had previously been trapped by a partial U.S. blockade.

There are good reasons for the U.S. administration to prioritize speed, Anatoly told me. The Venezuelan economy was days from collapsing. Oil storage was near capacity. The currency was in free fall. Officials had to get that trapped oil out and dollars in as soon as possible.

“It was a race against time,” Anatoly said. “Trump has no interest in a collapsed Venezuela right now.”

In the longer term, Trump has bigger ambitions. He wants what he calls “energy dominance” — enough weight in the global oil market to curb the power of OPEC countries and gain leverage over China. Venezuela is part of that plan.

But in the weeks since the invasion, these longer-term ambitions to gain effective control of Venezuela’s oil industry have “run headlong into reality,” my colleague Anton Troianovski wrote last week.

Slow and expensive

One problem for Trump is that the U.S. doesn’t have a national oil company. Exxon, Chevron and the like are private corporations that will start projects only when they see a good business opportunity. When they look at Venezuela, they don’t like what they see.

The case for investing in Venezuelan oil isn’t straightforward. The country has a lot of oil, but gaining access to it and turning it into a profitable business would take a lot of time and upfront investment, as my colleague Peter Coy writes. That’s the kind of thing that U.S. oil companies, which have recently sought to economize on investments and cut risk, don’t like.

Low oil prices mean the incentive to invest is limited. “Many analysts believe that a vast oversupply of oil is already sloshing around global markets,” Anton wrote.

Another problem: The U.S. may have removed Maduro, and achieved seeming compliance from his successor, for now, but it’s far from clear that it has achieved long-term political stability in Venezuela. A history of political turmoil, which led to the assets of U.S. oil companies being nationalized in the first place, is part of why executives view the country as “uninvestable” today.

And, as some of my colleagues have been reporting, there are signs that cracks have already begun appearing.

‘Zero oil’

For all the discontent many Venezuelans feel toward their government, oil has been an integral part of the country’s opposition to the U.S.

“For the last three decades, they have been fed an ideology of ‘Chavismo,’ with its goal of harnessing oil wealth to transform the country, empower the poor and stand up to the United States and its imperial ambitions,” writes my colleague Maria Abi-Habib.

And so some Venezuelans find it hard to swallow their new status as a country willing to cooperate — and share oil wealth — with the Americans who just invaded them.

“At this point, we should have cut off the oil, we shouldn’t have sold any oil to the United States. Zero oil, zero oil!” one Venezuelan told Maria.

It’s not clear how long the new government will manage to stave off these forces in order to continue cooperation with the United States. Even if it does, other ingredients for instability abound: The country remains filled with paramilitary groups, Colombian guerrillas and gangs.

It’s not the kind of environment that looks tempting to an oil executive watching from Texas. But Trump is also willing to strong-arm them into submission. “I’ll probably be inclined to keep Exxon out,” the president told reporters after the White House meeting. “I didn’t like their response.” Exxon’s stock slipped in the aftermath, though it has since recovered.

It has overtaken nickel-based packs to become the dominant battery chemistry in the world.

China spearheaded this growth, followed by Europe and some Asian countries.

The rollout of low-cost lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries surpassed deployments of traditional nickel-based chemistries in electric vehicles in 2025 for the very first time, EV Magazine reported, citing data from the research firm RhoMotion. That marks a significant shift for the global battery industry, and its yet another sign of China's continued dominance here.

For years, automakers leaned heavily on nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, largely because they benefited from a mature supply chain and higher energy density that delivered desirable driving range on EVs. (Most U.S.-market EVs use NMC batteries.)

But those advantages have come at a cost. Nickel- and cobalt-heavy batteries are expensive to mine, they’re environmentally intensive and remain tied to controversial supply chains that involve labor and human rights violations, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Ford LFP battery cells

As a result, battery makers have been accelerating their shift toward nickel-free chemistries such as LFP.

Chinese automakers and battery companies have been leading that shift, thanks to LFP’s lower costs, reduced dependence on troubled materials and a narrowing energy-density gap with NMC batteries.

By last year, LFP batteries accounted for more than half of global EV battery deployments, RhoMotion said. NMC batteries still retain an edge on energy density, but automakers have found ways to offset that disadvantage. Cell-to-pack and cell-to-chassis designs allow more cells to be squeezed into similar spaces. Optimized anode and cathode materials are helping close that performance gap even further.

And China is absolutely crushing it when it comes to LFP adoption. Between January and November last year, more than 80% of EVs sold in the country were equipped with LFP batteries. And that dominance is also spilling overseas.

Europe and Asia (excluding China) accounted for roughly 75% of last year’s global LFP growth, driven largely by a surge of Chinese EVs entering overseas markets. In Europe, Chinese automakers accounted for a record 12.8% of the EV market in November, more than doubling their share from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported, citing numbers from Dataforce. BYD, Leapmotor and Chery all posted strong growth across the region in 2025. China's CATL is by far the leading company in the LFP market, and last year, about one-third of all EVs sold had CATL battery cells. You do the math.

Chinese battery giants are pushing aggressively into local LFP production in Europe, both to reduce their exposure to tariffs and also to stay close to automakers. Both BYD and CATL are building battery factories in Hungary. CATL already operates a plant in Germany and has another one planned in Spain in partnership with Stellantis.

North America was the only region to see LFP deployments decline in 2025. The U.S. has effectively blocked China-made batteries from entering the country through tariffs and strict sourcing rules under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, leaving only a handful of LFP-equipped EVs on the U.S. market.

Tesla briefly offered LFP batteries on the base Model 3 in the U.S., but discontinued that trim in 2024 due to tariffs. Rivian and Ford still use LFP packs on base versions of the R1S, R1T and Mustang Mach-E. However, LFP is expected to undergo somewhat of a resurgence in the U.S. thanks to more affordable EVs like the new Chevrolet Bolt and Ford’s upcoming $30,000 electric truck.

LFP is still poised to grow in the U.S., but the path will look different from what’s happening in Europe and China. Much of that momentum is expected to come from domestic production of battery energy storage systems (BESS), rather than passenger EVs alone.

After the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit, several battery makers in the U.S., including LG Energy Solution, Tesla and SK On, adjusted their battery manufacturing capacity for the ESS market, which is growing much faster than EVs.

Last year, Detroiters received hundreds of millions in tax credits through the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit

Increase to Michigan EITC means more money for residents this year

All the information needed is available at getthetaxfacts.org

Today, Mayor Mary Sheffield joined with a coalition of community partners to announce a campaign to help all Detroiters access every dollar of federal and state tax credits they are eligible for by scheduling an appointment for best-in-the-nation, no-cost tax preparation. Through last year’s coordinated outreach in the City of Detroit, thousands of Detroit families were able to take advantage of the Earned Income and Child Tax Credit, bringing millions into their homes. This year, even more money is available in state credits thanks to 2023 legislation that increased the Michigan EITC five-fold.

Mayor Sheffield was joined by United Way for Southeastern Michigan, Accounting Aid Society, and Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency as they kicked off the 2026 income tax season today and outlined efforts to urge residents to claim their credits.

“My administration is intensely focused on getting more Detroit families and children out of poverty and making sure they receive the valuable tax credits is a very easy way to do that,” said Mayor Mary Sheffield. “Through our partners, we have volunteers ready to help residents claim and receive the tax returns they are entitled to, so they can have the money they need to support their families.”

All residents with income less than $69,000 qualify for an expert tax preparation appointment at no cost to them. Last year the coalition partners filed more than 26,000 tax returns in the region. Audits by the IRS find they achieve better than a 98% accuracy rate, making them a leader in the nation. An IRS study of paid tax preparers found they achieve a 40% accuracy rate, meaning that Detroit’s coalition of no-cost tax preparers are far more accurate and their returns are at far less risk of penalties or audit.

As a result of the coalition’s work in 2024, Detroiters claimed more than $450 million in EITC refunds for tax year 2023, plus many millions more in Child Tax Credits. Prior to 2017, EITC-eligible Detroiters left an estimated $80 million of potential tax refunds unclaimed each year.

There are several cash payments available to low-income, working Detroit families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, but you’ve got to file your taxes to claim these credits. Even if you don’t typically file your taxes or didn’t earn much in 2024, you may qualify for these payments.

Eligible Detroiters to receive text message reminders

The City of Detroit and its no-cost tax prep partners are using nation-leading strategies to communicate with low-income families who may be eligible for large tax refunds. This includes evidence-based text messages delivered in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). Analysis by the United Way of Southeastern Michigan finds that on days when text messages go out, use of its online tax prep appointment scheduling tool triples and online bookings jump by 2.25 times. Today MDHHS partnered with the City of Detroit to send a text message about the availability of no-cost, highly accurate tax prep services to over 70,000 Detroit households on food aid.

“Too often, people miss out on tax refunds simply because they can’t afford professional tax prep help,” said Elizabeth Hertel, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services director. “This free service offered by the United Way of Southeastern Michigan and the city of Detroit will help put money back into the pockets of those who need it most. MDHHS is helping to ensure eligible families in Detroit are aware of this opportunity available to them at no cost.”

Starting today, residents can call 2-1-1 or visit getthetaxfacts.org to learn more and schedule an appointment.

EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT – Who is eligible?

For more than 50 years, the Earned Income Tax credit has been providing much-needed extra cash to hard-working families. The EITC is available to working families and individuals who meet certain income requirements. There are actually two EITC credits – a main credit when you file your federal tax return, and an additional credit when you file your state of Michigan tax return. This year is the third year of new state legislation in which the Michigan credit is worth 5 times what it used to be. That means more money in Detroiters’ pockets.

If you worked at all in 2025, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. The Earned Income Tax Credit provides extra income to workers with low to moderate incomes, up to $69,000. The amount of the refund depends on income, filing status, and number of qualifying children claimed on tax returns. For example, a single individual with no children who works and makes less than $19,104 could get back as much as $844. A married couple with three or more children who files a joint return, with a combined income of less than $68,675 could receive the maximum EITC of $10,460 between the federal and state credits. Adults and children must have a Social Security Number to claim the EITC.

MICHIGAN EITC – 5X INCREASE

The Michigan EITC uses the same eligibility criteria as the federal EITC. The amount of the Michigan credit is calculated as a percentage of the amount the family or individual receives from the federal EITC. Previously, the Michigan EITC was calculated as 6% of the federal EITC. For example, if a family qualified for a $3000 federal EITC refund, they received an additional $180 ($3000 x 6%) from the state of Michigan when filing their state taxes.

Under the new law, now in its third year of implementation, the Michigan credit was increased to 30% of the federal credit. In the same example, a family qualifying for a $3000 federal EITC refund will now receive an additional $900 ($3000 x 30%) from the state of Michigan.

CHILD TAX CREDIT – Who is eligible?

The Child Tax Credit provides $1700-2200 per child for qualifying families.

Children under age 17 living in your home.

If you are the child’s primary caregiver, you are likely eligible. You don’t need to be the child’s biological parent to qualify.

You earned at least $2500 from working in 2025.

You (or your spouse, if filing jointly) and the child(ren) must have a valid Social Security Number to claim the Child Tax Credit.

EXPERT TAX PREP AVAILABLE AT NO COST:

All residents with income less than $69,000 qualify for an expert tax preparation appointment at no cost to them. For the 2026 tax season, Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metro will offer primarily in-person tax prep services. Drop-and-go and all-virtual appointments will also still be available.

""The Earned Income Tax Credit remains one of the most powerful tools for helping families build financial stability, and with Michigan’s 30% state match, it continues to create meaningful opportunities for working households,” said Priscilla Perkins, President and CEO of Accounting Aid Society. “As we enter the 2026 tax season, we are grateful for the continued partnership and support of the Mayor’s Office as we work together to provide no-cost tax preparation services and ensure every eligible family receives the credits they have earned. Together, we are strengthening Detroit - one family at a time.""

A communitywide coalition of partners last year helped Detroiters receive more than $450 million in earned income tax credits alone. Detroiter Tiffany Thomas (far right) used her Child Care Tax Credit checks over the years to help put her son through school.

SPREADING THE WORD:

This coalition is working to spread the word to those who are at the greatest risk of missing out, such as first-time parents who may not know they are eligible, non-traditional families where the biological parents are not the primary caregivers, families that don’t make much money and don’t normally file taxes, and families with limited English, limited education, and limited connections to social services.

We are working with community-based organizations to meet families where they are with in-person outreach at community events, flyers at community locations, direct outreach to neighborhood residents, and more. These efforts receive additional funding and support through the generosity of funding partners including Kresge Foundation, Ballmer Group, and Comerica.

The most important thing to know is that most Detroiters are eligible for expert tax preparation at no-cost, thanks to the help of hundreds of staff and volunteers from Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metro. These IRS-certified non-profit partners specialize in helping low- and moderate-income individuals claim the credits they are entitled to. They have a higher accuracy rate than most for-profit tax filing companies.

“Too many Wayne County households miss out on tax refunds simply because they don't know they qualify or they don't have access to trusted tax preparation services,” said Louis D. Piszker, Chief Executive Officer of Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency. “Wayne Metro’s free certified tax services help remove those barriers and ensure that residents receive the full tax credits they’ve earned, putting real dollars back into the family budget.”

Through its extensive network of community resources, United Way will again lead this coalition - making sure Detroiters are connected to the help they need.

“At a time when families are feeling the pressure of rising costs and reduced federal supports, the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit are more important than ever,” said Darienne Hudson, president and CEO of United Way for Southeastern Michigan. “These credits provide real relief—helping families afford basic necessities, catch up on overdue bills, and regain financial stability while building a pathway to economic mobility. Alongside our partners at the City of Detroit, Accounting Aid Society, Wayne Metro, and others, we’re committed to ensuring every eligible household can access the full refund they deserve.”",https://detroitmi.gov/themes/custom/detroitminew/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-20 16:00:41.260252

The West Concord, Massachusetts-based circular economy company said the capital will support expanding operations and deploying additional wasted-food solutions, with a particular focus on completing Integrated Diversion & Energy Facilities in Longview, Washington and Lexington, North Carolina, which are expected to begin operating later this year. Divert converts unsold, non-donatable food into beneficial outputs using anaerobic digestion, producing carbon-negative renewable energy as well as soil amendment and nitrogen-rich fertilizer, while also helping customers comply with organic waste mandates and reduce costs through improved purchasing and merchandising.

Divert highlighted its existing facility in Turlock, California, which it said can process 100,000 tons of unsold food annually, as an example of the infrastructure model it is replicating in new markets. The company framed the expansion against the broader scale of the problem, citing nearly 74 million tons of surplus food generated in the U.S. in 2023 and noting that more than 46% of food is wasted each year in Canada.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – JANUARY 20, 2026 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) alongside Representatives Ro Khanna (CA-17), Mark Takano (CA-39), and Jill Tokuda (HI-02), reintroduced the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act, legislation aimed at ending large institutional investors’ ability to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize the acquisition of single-family homes and drive up housing costs for working families.

Since the 2008 housing crash and subsequent foreclosure crisis, increased investor activity in America’s housing market has normalized excessive fees and abusive practices while artificially driving up housing and rent prices. In Pennsylvania and across the country—particularly in states like California, Nevada, Florida, and Georgia where corporate landlords own large concentrations(link is external) of single-family rental homes—investors are driving up rents and pricing families out of stable housing and homeownership opportunities.

“Here in Pittsburgh and across Western Pennsylvania, I’ve seen too many families living in homes owned by some distant investor who treats them like a paycheck instead of people,” said Rep. Summer Lee. “Investors are buying up single-family homes and affordable buildings and squeezing our communities, leaving families to live in conditions no one should ever have to endure. This is the result of a system that subsidizes corporate landlords while everyday people struggle to find a safe, stable place to call home. The Stop Wall Street Landlords Act is about stopping that exploitation, so homes belong to the people who live in them, not wealthy investors driving up costs and pushing families out of their own neighborhoods.”

“Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans,” said Rep. Ro Khanna. “I’m proud to lead this effort to put affordable housing for families first. If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law.”

Big investors have spent years driving up housing costs,” said Rep. Mark Takano. “I’ve heard from countless constituents who feel the dream of homeownership is now permanently out of reach. I’m proud to co-lead this bill with Reps. Khanna, Lee, and Tokuda to put people over profits and keep corporations out of the single-family housing market while ensuring those creating affordable housing can continue their work.”

“In Hawaiʻi, too many hardworking families are getting priced out of paradise,” said Rep. Jill Tokuda. “They're barely staying afloat working numerous jobs and living in multigenerational homes, but still can’t afford to stay in the communities they grew up in, while Wall Street investors and billionaires buy houses and land they’ll never live in. That's why I’m proud to co-lead the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act with Representatives Khanna, Takano, and Lee because housing should work for people, not corporate profits. This bill takes real steps to keep large investors out of our neighborhoods and make homeownership more affordable so families can stay, put down roots, and thrive.”

“Corporate landlords have priced out an entire generation,"" said Rep. Maxwell Frost. ""The Stop Wall Street Landlords Act is a real step toward restoring fairness in our housing market and making sure families, not Wall Street, shape our communities.”

“For far too long, the American dream has been confined to wishful thinking for millions of hard-working people,” said Watson Coleman. “No one trying to build a life for themselves and their families should suffer from housing instability while corporations monopolize the market. Democrats have been hard at work fighting for solutions to solve the affordability crisis. It’s time for Republicans to step up and work with us to pass this legislation.”

“As people in my district and around the country already know, the rent is too damn high,” said Congressman Jesús “Chuy” García. “Renters are already facing the destabilizing effects of algorithmic pricing schemes, gentrification, and now, here come the Wall Street companies scooping up all the housing stock to jack prices up even higher. I’m proud to co-sponsor the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act because the U.S. government should not subsidize Wall Street landlords, and because we need to invest in affordable housing for those who need it most.”

Specifically, the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act will:

End large institutional investors’ ability to benefit from tax breaks reserved for homeowners – namely mortgage interest, insurance, and depreciation deductions.

Direct the Federal Housing Financial Agency (FHFA) and related agencies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to (a) prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family residential (SFR) homes – or any interest in such a mortgage – and (b) from newly lending on a security or securitizing any SFR mortgage under which the mortgagee meets the bill definition of a specified large investor.

Legislate a federal real estate transfer tax of 100% of the sale value of each SFR in the possession of a specified large investor if SFRs are not sold within 18 months of bill enactment.

Promote the use of transfer tax revenue and deduction tax savings to fund the Housing Trust Fund, which enables affordable housing construction and preservation.

The bill makes exceptions for mom-and-pop landlords, housing providers that participate in federal affordable housing programs, nonprofits and developers committed to building and supplying affordable single-family homes to owner occupiers in the American housing market.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Representative Greg Steube (R Fla.) introduced today the Worldwide Animal Testing Compliance and Harmonization Act or WATCH Act. This bill would prohibit federal funding for foreign laboratories found to be in violation of animal welfare protections.

“Torturing animals in the name of science is both morally wrong and wholly unnecessary,” said Rep. Steube. “The fact that the United States continues to fund foreign laboratories that engage in animal cruelty is indefensible—especially considering the NIH has set clear guidelines for domestic laboratories to follow. Any scientific research involving animals demands proper care and a humane environment for God’s creatures. That is why I am introducing the bipartisan WATCH Act to bar the NIH from funding studies in foreign countries that fail to protect the welfare of innocent animals.”

“American taxpayer dollars should never fund inhumane animal testing in unregulated laboratories around the world,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “This bipartisan bill requires foreign laboratories to meet the same animal welfare standards American-based labs must follow, ensuring animals are treated humanely and strengthening the integrity of U.S.-funded research.”

This bill serves as the House companion to legislation introduced by Senators Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).

“Despite what Communist China may say, it has become clear that the COVID pandemic was the result of risky animal experiments by an unregulated lab in Wuhan that received U.S. taxpayer dollars,” said Senator Schmitt. “Outsourcing animal testing and research to foreign laboratories that do not comply with U.S. standards is dangerous, inhumane, and puts America, and the world, at risk. This bipartisan WATCH Act puts in place strong guardrails to ensure humane and safe research by requiring that foreign NIH-funded studies are subject to the same standards and animal welfare requirements as studies in the U.S.”

“American taxpayers shouldn’t fund animal cruelty, and the WATCH Act puts in place common-sense guardrails to ensure federal funds only go to organizations upholding strong animal welfare standards,” said Senator Jeff Merkley. “Our bipartisan bill is an important step forward to make sure NIH-funded studies meet consistent and enforceable animal welfare protections, regardless of where they are conducted.”

With this grant funding, the Port of Cleveland will implement the next phase of the Electrification and Net Zero Emissions Master Plan by deploying electric cargo handling equipment (including scrapping a portion of the existing diesel fleet), zero-emission vessels, and associated charging infrastructure and battery energy storage systems. Infrastructure for vessel shore power is included as well. The project also includes community outreach activities and workforce development through increased equipment and infrastructure maintenance jobs.

Ports are vital to the U.S. economy and are responsible for moving goods and people throughout the country. At the same time, the port and freight equipment responsible for moving goods including trucks, locomotives, marine vessels, and cargo-handling equipment contribute to significant levels of diesel air pollution at and near port facilities. This pollution is especially harmful to nearby communities’ health and contributes to climate change. These funds will improve air quality at the Port of Cleveland by installing clean, zero-emission freight and ferry technologies along with associated infrastructure.

The Port of Cleveland is one of the largest ports on the Great Lakes. Over 23,000 jobs are tied to the roughly 13 million tons of cargo that move through Cleveland Harbor each year. The Port of Cleveland is the only local government agency whose sole mission is to spur job creation and economic vitality in Cuyahoga County. The Port is an economic engine for our community, a key to Northeast Ohio’s global competitiveness, and a crucial partner in building Cuyahoga County’s future.

The funding for this project is anticipated to replace thirteen pieces of cargo handling equipment, two older generation diesel tugboats, add EV charging equipment and a new Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) with complimentary solar and shore power.

In conjunction with the development of the Master Plan, the Port has invested over $93.8M in infrastructure since 2015, with 75%+ of the cost covered by state and federal grants. Grant funds have supported various projects aimed at modernization, sustainability, and infrastructure development, which align with the broader program goals of reducing Port emissions and transitioning to ZE operations. Several recent coordination efforts are as follows:

The Port has secured $32M+ in federal and state grants for the rehabilitation and modernization of a key warehouse and electrical infrastructure upgrade at its General Cargo Terminal. This project included the development of the Master Plan, which developed the roadmap and project planning for the elements of this application. The grants for this project include $27.2M from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration (MARAD)’s PIDP and $4.9M from the Ohio DOT’s MAP.

In 2021, the Port completed improvements at its main gate to improve the security clearance process and truck turn time via U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Earmark OH302.

In collaboration with the Port, Omnitrax, the provider of switching rail services at the terminal, will deploy a fully Battery Electric (BE) locomotive later this year using Ohio EPA Diesel Mitigation Trust Fund funding. The new locomotive will reduce fuel consumption by 50% and Particulate Matter (PM) pollution by 77%.

In 2020, the Port received a grant from the U.S. DOT Maritime Administration (MARAD) to rehabilitate and improve two cargo docks at the Port on Lake Erie. This project helped improve the efficiency of port operations.

The Port has received two Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) grants to date, one in 2021 to replace tugboats and one in 2017 to replace a loader at the Port’s Cleveland Bulk Terminal. These grants amount to just under $1M.

During the Port’s Strategic Plan development, the Port conducted interviews with over 40 local stakeholder organizations, with specific questions regarding the Port’s community, social, and environmental impacts, as well as its communication regarding issues or concerns. Several themes arose from responses, including the need for additional equipment, namely another crane and reach stacker, concerns over the cost and reliability of electrified equipment, the desire for shore power infrastructure, and the pressure to reduce emissions to aid in companies’ Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Climate Action goals. The Project is expected to address all these themes.

To ensure the voices of all County residents are incorporated within the Project design, the Port has conducted engagement that has consisted of a public board meeting, as well as the distribution of a Project fact sheet through Port newsletters and social media. Additional community engagement will occur throughout Project delivery that will entail regular community updates and opportunities to provide feedback.",https://www.portofcleveland.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/favicon-16x16-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:57.802271

This review examines recent technological, regulatory, and market-driven developments in corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol production, with emphasis on advances realised between 2023 and 2025.

In corn ethanol systems, enzyme-enabled process enhancements have improved starch and fibre conversion efficiency, increasing ethanol yields without additional land use while simultaneously strengthening coproduct markets such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and biochar. Parallel progress in carbon capture and storage has enabled ethanol producers to enter voluntary carbon markets, reducing lifecycle carbon intensity and improving economic resilience.

In sugarcane ethanol, the integration of second-generation (2G) pathways using agricultural residues has expanded operational windows and improved overall resource efficiency, while advances in genetic improvement techniques have accelerated yield gains and climate adaptability.

These technological developments have been reinforced by evolving blending mandates and renewable fuel policies in major markets, including Brazil, the European Union, and emerging aviation and marine fuel sectors.

Collectively, these changes explain the surge in investment and capacity expansion observed globally and signal a transition of ethanol from a compliance fuel towards a strategically optimised, low-carbon energy carrier. Understanding these converging drivers is essential for guiding future research, industrial deployment, and policy design in biofuel systems.

Introduction

The transport industry produces significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as CO₂ and methane.

These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change. As a result, renewable and environmentally sustainable fuels are increasingly important.

Ethanol, derived from corn and sugarcane, is already widely used and, in some cases, mandated in the global fuel industry.

Corn and sugarcane are used to produce ethanol because they are rich in fermentable carbohydrates and have well-established production methods.

A factor limiting sugarcane’s global spread is the climate required for cultivation.

Recent advances in biofuel technology include improved enzymes, higher-yield crops and processes that use crop residues to boost yields.

These developments, alongside renewable energy and carbon-reduction efforts, are strengthening collaboration in the sector.

Despite these developments, there remains a need to examine and consolidate the latest progress in biofuel technologies, particularly over the past three years.

Therefore, this review highlights the major technological and sustainability-driven innovations in ethanol during this period. Understanding these advances is essential for future research, global sustainability, and industrial optimisation in the sector.

Advances in corn-based ethanol

2.1. Enzyme and process enhancement

Over the past three years, significant effort has been directed towards developing techniques to improve yield without expanding land use.

Enzyme technology is a key solution: specific enzymes are now applied directly to the crop or during processing, boosting DDGS (distillers’ dried grains) and ethanol production by facilitating more efficient breakdown of plant material, as shown in Table 1.

This technology is estimated to increase overall ethanol production by 10% [2]. Crucially, these enzymes require only a financial investment, as no additional machinery or space is needed to realise these gains.

2.2. Co-product valorisation

With the rise in biochar production, used in carbon removal technologies, the supply chain was unable to keep pace.

This necessitated expanded intake to support higher production. The expansion focused on residues produced by ethanol plants, which began selling these materials.

Even with ethanol production “waste” being used in biochar production, by 2024 approximately 62% of supply had already been sold, with 28% presold for 2026. This raised prices and generated additional revenue for ethanol producers.

Not only has biochar increased in price, but DDGS has risen as well and is expected to grow by 7.3% from 2025 to 2030, as shown in Figure 1.

This increase in value can be attributed to several factors: governments have begun requiring and encouraging the use of DDGS in livestock nutrition through subsidies and awareness campaigns.

Another factor is price, which is estimated to be 10–15% lower than soybeans, another widely used livestock meal.

To meet this demand, industries have begun investing in machinery upgrades, such as fractionation systems that remove fibre and increase digestibility, now being installed in distilleries [3].

2.3. Carbon intensity reduction

One method for distilleries to offset their environmental footprint is through government carbon credits.

These credits were once considered unattainable due to gas emissions. However, in 2024, the first ethanol plant voluntarily entered carbon markets [4]. Red Trail Energy laid the groundwork for future facilities.

In corn ethanol production, yeast ferments corn starch, producing ethanol, solids, and a high-purity carbon dioxide (CO₂) stream as by-products. The CO₂ that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere is captured.

Exhaust gas from fermentation vessels is directed to a capture facility, where it is purified, compressed into liquid form, and dehydrated to remove impurities.

The liquefied CO₂ is then transported through a flowline to an onsite injection well and injected into the Broom Creek Formation, a secure sandstone layer approximately 6,500 feet below the facility, where it is intended to be permanently stored [5,6].

Advances in sugarcane-based ethanol

3.1. 2G sugarcane

The integration of 2G production facilities with existing 1G mills involves using sugarcane residues, including leaves, bagasse, vinasse, and filter cake [7]. These residues are not fully utilised in 1G processes [8].

Including sugarcane bagasse also reduces the need for additional cultivation areas.

First-generation production occurs for only about nine to ten months per year. Including second-generation residues enables ethanol plants to operate year-round, thereby improving efficiency.

Investments in Brazil are also closely monitoring research into generating electrical energy from bagasse, as shown in Table 3 [9]. This could be essential for reducing future plant costs.

3.2. Genetic improvements

Genetically modified sugarcane traits aim to boost yield, pest resistance, and adaptability to new climates.

Methods such as CRISPR-based breeding and marker-assisted selection help improve traits while minimising unintended outcomes [10]. Classical breeding can take 15 to 17 years [11] and requires large quantities of plant material, much of which is wasted due to genetic or breeding failures.

With modern techniques, researchers can directly modify the genetic code of the plant, reducing the time required to achieve desired sugarcane traits.

Emerging trends and market effects - Laws mandating increased ethanol consumption

More countries, economic groups, and states are opening their energy systems to biofuels. Brazil has approved a law increasing ethanol content in petrol from 27.5% to 35% [12].

Biodiesel is rising from 15% to 25%. The most significant change is in aviation, with a 1% blend starting in 2027, rising to 10% in 2037 and increasing by 1% annually thereafter.

In Europe, the EU is finalising its ethanol blending policies, with a 2030 target of 5.5% renewable fuel [13].

In the US, there is no mandatory ethanol percentage, although financial regulations such as waivers influence consumer behaviour [14]. The transition from E10 to E15, along with expanded availability, further demonstrates growing demand.

Future demand for water and air

Biofuels are commonly used in land transport but less frequently in aviation and maritime sectors. This is beginning to change.

Cargo ships have started blending biodiesel onboard [16], improving fuel properties and usability. Ethanol’s higher solubility in water presents additional handling considerations.

MIT researchers are also developing aviation fuel from biomass [17], creating another pathway for broader biofuel adoption.

Beyond regulatory drivers, expanding use in maritime and aviation introduces challenges related to fuel handling, moisture control, and emissions. Ethanol-based fuels are more hygroscopic than petroleum fuels, requiring improved storage and monitoring systems.

Integrated fuel management strategies, including controlled blending, adaptive combustion tuning, and real-time quality monitoring, will support safe and efficient use. These developments indicate that future biofuel deployment depends not only on chemistry, but also on infrastructure and operational co-evolution.

Market reaction

Biofuel companies are actively positioning themselves for future growth. INPASA, Latin America’s largest biorefinery company, currently produces up to 5.6 billion litres of ethanol annually [19].

It owns the world’s largest biorefinery and plans further expansion, investing nearly one billion dollars into facility upgrades [20].

Their actions demonstrate confidence in the sector’s future. Financial markets increasingly factor carbon intensity and regulatory alignment into investment decisions. ~

Producers demonstrating emissions reductions and coproduct integration are better positioned for favourable financing.

The market is shifting towards scale and integration, with larger facilities benefiting from economies of scale and improved logistics.

As consolidation continues, standardisation and transparency are expected to increase. These trends confirm that biofuels are transitioning from a niche option to a mature component of global energy systems.

Conclusion

Between 2023 and 2025, the corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol sector has made clear progress through increased production, stronger coproduct markets, and supportive policies. Enzyme technologies have boosted ethanol output by approximately 10%.

Biochar accounted for 62% of 2024 supply, with 28% already sold for 2026. DDGS prices remain 10–15% lower than soybean prices and are expected to rise by 7.3% between 2025 and 2030.

For sugarcane ethanol, second-generation processes now enable year-round operation. Policy changes, including Brazil’s ethanol blend increase and the EU’s renewable fuel targets, demonstrate rising adoption.

These developments show that the sector is becoming more efficient, environmentally responsible, and economically competitive. Researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders can use these insights to further accelerate progress towards low-carbon transport. These factors collectively explain the growth in investment observed in the biofuel sector over the past three years.

,EVs,2026-01-20 20:03:23+00:00,Times Herald Online,California hits milestone in electric vehicle sales - Timesheraldonline.com,Paul Rogers,,,,,https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2026/01/20/california-hits-milestone-in-electric-vehicle-sales/,"For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said.
Trump tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021.
Two weeks ago, when he released his proposed state budget, Newsom included $200 million for a new electric vehicle rebate program.
“California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez.","In 2012, when there were about 30,000 electric vehicles on the road in California, Tesla was a small new company that mostly appealed to hobbyists, and the Toyota Prius was still a rarely seen novelty in many areas, former Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order setting an audacious goal: 1.5 million EVs sold statewide by 2025.

There were lots of skeptics, given that Brown was calling for a 50-fold increase in the status quo. But as it turned out, California achieved it easily.

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in California since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121, to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. During the past year, President Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers to drive in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place three years earlier.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to California the previous year when President Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

During the fourth quarter of 2025, Californians bought 79,066 new EVs, representing 18.9% of new-car sales. That was a big drop from the third quarter, when EVs accounted for 29.1% of new car sales statewide. Experts and industry analysts noted the surge in EV sales in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of any kind in California last year were the Telsa Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in California. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on them denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

Trump marked his first year anniversary of taking office Tuesday for his second term. The fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California, alongside Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases; the lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and Biden reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said Tuesday.

Two weeks ago, when he released his proposed state budget, Newsom included $200 million for a new electric vehicle rebate program. The plan still needs approval from state lawmakers. Details, including how much motorists will get, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been drawn up.

For years, the process of installing an EV charger at home was bogged down by red tape.
These practical realities mean that, for some, the path to an at-home EV charger may still require negotiation and patience.
But for the majority, the new rules represent a welcome change, promising both environmental benefits and significant savings.
As the nation continues its drive toward sustainability, these changes may well prove to be a turning point, making electric motoring more accessible and affordable for millions.","England’s drive toward a greener future just got a significant boost, as new regulations making it easier—and much cheaper—for homeowners to install electric vehicle (EV) chargers have come into force. These changes, introduced by the Labour government last May and taking effect in the summer of 2025, mean that drivers no longer need to submit planning applications to install EV chargepoints at home. It’s a move that could save motorists up to £1,100 a year, according to government officials and industry experts, and is already making waves across the country.

For years, the process of installing an EV charger at home was bogged down by red tape. Homeowners were required to apply for householder planning permission, a bureaucratic hurdle that often resulted in months of waiting, additional costs, and, frankly, a lot of headaches. Now, thanks to this regulatory overhaul, any homeowner in England can install a single wall-mounted or pedestal EV charger on their driveway without the need for planning permission—provided the unit doesn’t exceed 0.2 cubic meters in volume and is positioned at least two meters from the public highway.

“We’re cutting down on paperwork to power up the EV revolution so that drivers, businesses and those looking to make the switch will have more chargepoints to power from and less red tape to deal with,” said Lilian Greenwood, Labour Party minister, at the launch of the new rules. She emphasized the government’s commitment to making the transition to electric vehicles easier, cheaper, and better, pointing to over £2.3 billion in investments aimed at supporting drivers and British carmakers, as well as fueling job creation and economic growth through international trade deals.

The impact of these changes is already being felt. Lewis Gardiner, Operations Director at Osprey Charging Network, called the move “a hugely welcome and practical change that will make a real difference on the ground.” He explained, “Removing the need for planning permission for essential electrical infrastructure like substations across the majority of sites will save months of delays, reduce costs and accelerate the delivery of the rapid charging hubs drivers need. It’s the result of months of collaboration between industry and government and we’re proud to have played a key role in making it happen.”

Patrick Dunne, Sainsbury’s Chief Property and Procurement Officer and Managing Director of Smart Charge, echoed this sentiment. “Everyone at Smart Charge knows how important it is to make EV charging simple, reliable and accessible—both to make transport cleaner and to ensure we’re meeting the everyday needs of drivers throughout the UK. We welcome this new streamlined approach to installing charge points, which will help accelerate the nation’s adoption of EVs,” he said.

The government’s hope is that by making the installation process quicker and more affordable, more drivers will be encouraged to make the switch from petrol and diesel vehicles to electric ones. And with the potential to save up to £1,100 a year compared to running a traditional combustion engine vehicle, it’s a compelling case. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the appetite for electric motoring is on the rise: there are now approximately 1.75 million purely electric vehicles in the UK, with 47,000 new EVs registered in 2025 alone—an 8% jump from the previous year.

However, it’s not all smooth sailing. While the new rules remove significant barriers, some restrictions remain in place. For instance, the regulations specify that charging units must not exceed 0.2 cubic meters in volume and must be set at least two meters from public roads. These technical requirements are designed to ensure safety and minimize visual clutter in residential areas.

There are also caveats for certain homeowners. Residents in leasehold accommodation may still face obstacles, as freeholders retain the authority to restrict modifications to properties. Likewise, some newly constructed housing developments have clauses in their title deeds that prevent alterations to a property’s exterior—potentially including the installation of charging points. For those who share driveways or access routes with neighbors, the process could be complicated by legal disagreements or the need for joint consent. These practical realities mean that, for some, the path to an at-home EV charger may still require negotiation and patience.

Despite these challenges, the overall direction is clear: the government and industry are working hand-in-hand to make electric vehicle adoption easier and more attractive. The removal of planning permission requirements is widely seen as a crucial step in accelerating the rollout of charging infrastructure—not just for private homes, but for public and business sites as well. As Gardiner of Osprey Charging Network pointed out, “It’s the result of months of collaboration between industry and government and we’re proud to have played a key role in making it happen.”

Industry leaders agree that the streamlined process will help address one of the biggest concerns for would-be EV owners: the availability and convenience of charging. Patrick Dunne of Smart Charge summed it up: “We welcome this new streamlined approach to installing charge points, which will help accelerate the nation’s adoption of EVs.”

For many, the financial incentive is hard to ignore. With the cost of running an electric vehicle now potentially £1,100 less per year than a petrol or diesel car, and with the process of getting a charger at home made vastly simpler, the barriers to entry are lower than ever. The government’s investment of over £2.3 billion in the sector is also expected to spur innovation and job creation, further embedding the UK’s commitment to a cleaner, greener transport future.

Still, the transition isn’t without its bumps. Leaseholders, residents of new developments with restrictive title deeds, and those with shared driveways may find themselves navigating a maze of permissions and legalities. But for the majority, the new rules represent a welcome change, promising both environmental benefits and significant savings.

With EV adoption climbing steadily—47,000 new electric vehicles registered in 2025 alone, according to SMMT data—the streamlined regulations are set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of transport in England. As the nation continues its drive toward sustainability, these changes may well prove to be a turning point, making electric motoring more accessible and affordable for millions.

As England’s roads quietly shift from petrol power to electric hum, one thing is certain: the journey toward a cleaner, more efficient future just got a little easier for homeowners across the country.","https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/TC1bbgnq3nbWAVJrrxh76NUL-14=/1200x0/filters:format(webp):quality(85):sharpen(0.5,0.5,true)/tpg%2Fsources%2F97a5514d-9a7a-481a-a6e0-69f40c96e036.jpeg",N,,2026-01-20 14:59:49.866538

From supporting energy development and assessing critical minerals potential to expanding scientific understanding of deep-sea environments, BOEM helped shape a more secure and informed offshore energy future.

Take a deep dive into our biggest achievements from 2025:

Oil and Gas Energy

In 2025, BOEM advanced U.S. energy development by conducting a landmark oil and gas lease sale, proposing new offshore lease sales, releasing a new and expansive National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, and updating our Outer Continental Shelf planning areas for oil and gas.

Advancing Offshore Energy Development with a Landmark Lease Sale: We successfully conducted Lease Sale Big Beautiful Gulf 1, which was the first offshore oil and gas lease sale required under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The sale generated $300,425,222 in high bids for 181 blocks across 80 million acres in federal waters of the Gulf of America. Thirty companies submitted 219 bids totaling $371,881,093.

Driving Energy Production with a Proposed Second Gulf of America Lease Sale in March 2026: To strengthen U.S. energy dominance, we proposed a second Gulf of America Lease Sale. This sale is the second of thirty Gulf of America oil and gas lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Expanding Energy Development in Alaska’s Cook Inlet: We published the Proposed Notice of Sale for Big Beautiful Cook Inlet 1 (BBC1), which would make approximately one million acres available for leasing in Alaska’s Cook Inlet. This marks the first of at least six Cook Inlet lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, scheduled annually from 2026 to 2028, and from 2030 to 2032.

Proposing a New National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program: In response to the National Energy Emergency, we released the first proposal of a new, expansive 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. This proposal reflects our continued commitment to restore American Energy Dominance and address the nation’s growing energy needs.

Refining Our Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas for Oil and Gas: We updated our Outer Continental Shelf planning areas for oil and gas management, increasing the total from 26 to 27. This included creating a new High Arctic Planning Area and revising other areas to reflect recent changes in U.S. OCS jurisdictional limits.

Marine Minerals

In 2025, we unleashed America's offshore critical minerals and resources by implementing the directives of Executive Order 14285 . Some examples include:

Taking Action to Unlock Potential Marine Minerals Offshore Virginia: We launched the process for a potential mineral lease sale for heavy mineral sands and other mineral deposits in federal waters off the coast of Virginia. This action—only the third of its kind in more than three decades—represented a significant step toward unlocking the mineral potential of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf and reinforcing the nation’s economic and strategic independence.

Advancing Beach Nourishment and Coastal Protection Projects: BOEM supported the use of Outer Continental Shelf sand in beach nourishment and coastal protection projects in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.

Charting the Future for Potential Offshore Minerals in American Samoa: Offshore American Samoa, we explored the potential for seabed mineral leasing and invited public comments on a possible minerals lease sale—this could be the first mineral lease sale in federal waters in over 30 years! We also completed area identification to determine which specific parts of the Outer Continental Shelf offshore American Samoa will undergo environmental review for proposed commercial leases for critical minerals.

Exploring Potential Offshore Minerals in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands: BOEM invited the public to submit comments on a potential minerals lease sale offshore the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. At this initial stage in the planning process, public input helps ensure that BOEM’s decision-making is locally and scientifically informed.

Renewable Energy

Throughout 2025, BOEM supported efforts to advance the Administration’s offshore wind objectives and enhance oversight of offshore wind activities to promote dependable, American-made energy. We worked to align offshore wind regulations with America’s energy priorities and acted on directives to reduce preferential treatment for unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources. BOEM also supported the Administration’s efforts to ensure that offshore wind projects do not endanger the environment, U.S. national security, and economic interests.

Environment

In 2025, BOEM supported the responsible and innovative management of offshore development by conducting environmental research and analysis for offshore oil and gas, critical minerals, and sand resources.

Conducting Deep-Sea Research Off Hawaiʻi: This past fall, BOEM scientists explored the remote abyssal plains south of Hawaiʻi Island – one of Earth’s least explored environments – with members from the U.S. Geological Survey. During the expedition, the scientists focused on the large, crescent-shaped area of the abyssal plain, known as the “Hawaiian crescent,” mapping the seafloor, studying the deep-sea environment, and exploring for critical minerals, all while honoring the cultural significance of Moananuiākea.

Deepening Our Knowledge of Alaska’s Offshore Ecosystems: This past summer, BOEM researchers joined the U.S. Geological Survey on a deep-sea expedition along Alaska’s Aleutian Arc to gather vital data on critical marine minerals and deep-sea ecosystems. During the expedition, the scientists collected biological samples, high-resolution seafloor maps, and video footage of the seafloor, all helping to fill critical knowledge gaps in Alaska’s offshore ecosystems.

Exploring the Deep: BOEM, USGS and NOAA Join Forces in the Mariana Arc: This past spring, BOEM, USGS and NOAA Occean Exploration came together to support the Ocean Exploration Trust’s Exploration Vessel Nautilus on a mission to study the remote and volcanically active waters around Guam and the Mariana Arc. The 21-day expedition mapped the seafloor, investigated underwater volcanoes, and collected important data on ecosystems found in extreme deep ocean conditions. These unique habitats may hold critical minerals vital for modern technologies, making this research essential in supporting resource management priorities.

Hello, 2026!

As we embark on 2026, we remain committed to managing offshore energy, marine mineral and geological resources in a responsible way, while supporting environmental and economic sustainability.

Building on last year’s momentum, we are looking forward to continuing to strengthen America’s energy future and making a splash in the year ahead!",https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/images/BOEM_Logo_OpenGraph.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:52.398085

But Payne defended data centres’ electricity use, arguing that it provides more “economic output per electron” than industries like steel or oil.","The annual World Economic Forum got underway on Tuesday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, providing a snowy stage for government and business leaders to opine on international affairs. With attention focused on the latest crisis – a potential US-European trade war over Greenland – climate change has slid down the agenda.

Despite this, a number of panels are addressing issues like electric vehicles, energy security and climate science. Keep up with top takeaways from those discussions and other climate news from Davos in our bulletin, which we’ll update throughout the day.

From oil to electrons – energy security enters a new era

Energy crises spurred by geopolitical tensions are nothing new – remember the 1970s oil shock spurred by the embargo Arab producers slapped on countries that had supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, leading to rocketing inflation and huge economic pain.

But, a Davos panel on energy security heard, the situation has since changed. Oil now accounts for less than 30% of the world’s energy supply, down from more than 50% in 1973. This shift, combined with a supply glut, means oil is taking more of a back seat, according to International Energy Agency boss Fatih Birol.

Instead, in an “age of electricity” driven by transport and technology, energy diplomacy is more focused on key elements of that supply chain, in the form of critical minerals, natural gas and the security buffer renewables can provide. That requires new thinking, Birol added.

“Energy and geopolitics were always interwoven but I have never ever seen that the energy security risks are so multiplied,” he said. “Energy security, in my view, should be elevated to the level of national security today.”

In this context, he noted how many countries are now seeking to generate their own energy as far as possible, including from nuclear and renewables, and when doing energy deals, they are considering not only costs but also whether they can rely on partners in the long-term.

In the case of Europe – which saw energy prices jump after sanctions on Russian gas imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine – energy security rooted in homegrown supply is a top priority, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Davos on Tuesday.

Outlining the bloc’s “affordable energy action plan” in a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum, she emphasised that Europe is “massively investing in our energy security and independence” with interconnectors and grids based on domestically produced sources of power.

The EU, she said, is trying to promote nuclear and renewables as much as possible “to bring down prices and cut dependencies; to put an end to price volatility, manipulation and supply shocks,” calling for a faster transition to clean energy.

“Because homegrown, reliable, resilient and cheaper energy will drive our economic growth and deliver for Europeans and secure our independence,” she added.

China pitches itself as clean energy champion

While the US under President Donald Trump doubles down on fossil fuels and retreats from international climate bodies, China is openly pitching itself as the flagbearer of the clean energy transition and multilateralism.

In Davos, the country’s Vice-Premier He Lifeng invited nations and companies from across the world to “embrace the opportunities from the green and low-carbon transition” by working closely with China.

He boasted about China’s dominance of the global cleantech industry where it controls vast parts of the supply chain – from critical mineral processing to the manufacturing of finished products such as solar panels and electric vehicles.

At ‘Davos of mining’, Saudi Arabia shapes new narrative on minerals

At the same time, He Lifeng told leaders in Davos that Beijing wants to share these opportunities with the world and called on partners to “ensure the free flow of quality green products globally”.

Western nations, including the European Union, have imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese cleantech in an attempt to protect their home-grown businesses from what they regard as unfair competition. But there are signs of those trade tensions easing. Canada announced last week it would let 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the country under a much reduced tariff as part of a sweeping trade deal.

He Lifeng also reaffirmed Beijing’s commitment to achieve for the first time an absolute emissions reduction target by 2035 and to peak its carbon emissions by the end of this decade, as laid out in the country’s latest climate plan.

He described this plan as “a testament to China’s firm resolve and maximum efforts”, although climate experts believe Beijing’s promise to cut emissions by between 7% and 10% by 2035 against an unspecified peak level is weak and unambitious.

In the month that saw the US announce its intention to withdraw from the UN climate convention (UNFCCC), He Lifeng confirmed China’s engagement in climate diplomacy. “China will work with all other Parties to fully and effectively implement the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, and uphold the multilateral process,” he said.

AES boss calls for “more technical talk” on supply chains

Earlier, the energy security panel tackled the risks related to supply chains for clean energy and electrification, which are being partly fuelled by rising demand from data centres and electric vehicles.

The minerals and metals that are required for batteries, cables and other components are largely under the control of China, which has invested massively in extracting and processing those materials both at home and overseas. Efforts to boost energy security by breaking dependence on China will continue shaping diplomacy now and in the future, the experts noted.

Copper – a key raw material for the energy transition – is set for a 70% increase in demand over the next 25 years, said Mike Henry, CEO of mining giant BHP, with remaining deposits now harder to exploit. Prices are on an upward trend, and this offers opportunities for Latin America, a region rich in the metal, he added.

At ‘Davos of mining’, Saudi Arabia shapes new narrative on minerals

Andrés Gluski, CEO of AES – which describes itself as “the largest US-based global power company”, generating and selling all kinds of energy to companies – said there is a lack of discussion about supply chains compared with ideological positioning on energy sources.

Instead he called for “more technical talk” about boosting battery storage to smooth out electricity supply and using existing infrastructure “smarter”. While new nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors are promising, it will be at least a decade before they can be deployed effectively, he noted.

In the meantime, with electricity demand rising rapidly, the politicisation of the debate around renewables as an energy source “makes no sense whatsoever”, he added.

BYD exec says EV batteries will make mining CEOs happy

A top BYD executive told the head of a mining company that the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) will make him the “happiest person” because “we’re going to consume a lot of copper, a lot of lithium, a lot of different mining”.

Stella Li, executive vice-president of the world’s biggest electric car company, made the comments to Vale’s CEO Gustavo Pimenta during a panel entitled “Can EVs really dominate?” on Tuesday morning.

EV batteries typically use copper, lithium, nickel and manganese. While these minerals and metals are mined around the world, they are mainly processed in BYD’s home country of China, a dominance that alarms Western powers.

Push for global minerals deal meets opposition, more talks agreed

Climate Home News has highlighted numerous environmental and social problems associated with the mining of these critical raw materials in its Clean Energy Frontier series. Doctors in Chile claim that a copper mine is causing autism, while lithium miners in Nigeria face physical dangers and bad pay.

From the audience, the head of the global IndustriALL trade union Atle Høie said he knows the transition to EVs is “coming” but “mining is still ridden with exploitation” and “minerals are coming from countries where human rights are very poorly developed”.

Pimenta said he wanted mining to be cheap and fast but also ethical, with minerals that can be traced, human rights policies implemented and mines using less land and water. He said Vale was looking at recovering materials from mining waste piles instead of digging new mines.

He added that he didn’t want competitors with low ethical standards because “it’s not a level playing field”, highlighting the need to “rebuild the reputation of the mining industry” in order to convince society to let mining projects go ahead.

He and BYD’s Li played down fears of an under-supply of minerals like copper and lithium, saying sustained and predictable demand would encourage more supply. Li noted there had been a shortage of lithium copper oxide during the COVID-19 pandemic but then the price shot up by a factor of 30 and “suddenly” reserves were found in new countries.

Self-taught mechanics give second life to Jordan’s glut of spent EV batteries

Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan – a major US car-producing state – told the panel that Americans still need both EVs and polluting internal combustion engine vehicles, as seen at the recent Detroit Auto Show.

Whitmer, a Democrat, criticised the US federal government for “back and forth policies” which have made it more difficult for the car industry to go all in and ramp up in the way Chinese firms have been able to.

BYD’s Li said that, unlike China, “some countries” – which she did not name – have gone “back and forth” and “this will confuse manufacturing”.

“Nuclear renaissance” predicted to power AI data centres

The need for clean but reliable electricity to power data centres is likely to lead to a “nuclear renaissance”, according to participants on a panel on artificial intelligence.

Sweden’s centre-right energy minister Ebba Busch told the panel that while Sweden is “still loving renewables”, wind and solar can not provide the kind of power available on demand that is needed to run data centres around the clock because they are too variable. To provide clean, reliable electricity, she said, Sweden is “doing a nuclear renaissance”.

Fellow panellist Joshua Payne – founder of a company called Nscale, which builds and owns data centres – agreed that a nuclear renaissance was “very likely” in the early 2030s. But he also added that northern Norway is the best place to build data centres because it has an oversupply of clean and reliable hydropower electricity.

As Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar noted, data centres often consume more electricity than big industrial users like aluminium smelters or petrochemical refiners. Like these industrial sites, data centres will soon be forced by governments to “bring your own power” rather than continuing to free ride from the grid, Sridhar said.

But Payne defended data centres’ electricity use, arguing that it provides more “economic output per electron” than industries like steel or oil. This means it’s better for the economy to use electricity for data centres than other energy-intensive sectors, he argued.

Panellists discussed whether AI will become more energy efficient in future, perhaps due to shortages of computing memory forcing companies to use memory more efficiently and therefore use less electricity. Or because the theory of artificial general intelligence is flawed and a more energy-efficient model of AI – such as that championed by China – will emerge.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2026/01/55047490036_b2d16c3375_c.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 16:59:13.029011

Gov. Tina Kotek announced the new Data Center Advisory Committee on Tuesday and named seven members, who will provide policy recommendations to her and the Legislature no later than October 2026.

Kotek and state lawmakers will use those to create regulations, most likely aimed at where data centers can be built, according to a news release from Kotek’s office. The regulations would aim to protect energy infrastructure and water supplies from being overburdened by the privately run data and AI processing centers, which require massive amounts of energy to run and water for cooling.

“Oregonians have made their concerns about rising utility bills clear. As our state faces rapid growth of data facilities, we must have frank conversations about the challenges and opportunities ahead,” Kotek said in a statement. “I expect the Data Center Advisory Committee to help ensure economic growth while protecting affordable power and Oregon’s critical water resources.”

Access to relatively clean, cheap hydroelectricity in the region and a lack of sales tax, along with billions of dollars in property tax incentives, helped lure the companies.

But the decision to offer those property tax incentives and site a data center is largely a local one, made at the city and county level. The Data Center Advisory Committee is the state’s first big foray into setting data center policy, following several laws that passed in 2025 meant to curb rising electricity rates driven by data centers.

As the giant data complexes expanded across the state during the last several years, energy rates rose on all customer classes served by the state’s private, investor-owned utilities. For residential customers, rates have gone up an average of 50% in the last five years.

Between 2013 and 2023, Oregon’s overall electricity consumption rose by more than 20%, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

“Data centers undoubtedly drove a major share, if not almost all, of this growth,” analysts wrote.

In the next two decades, demand for electricity in the Northwest could double, and demand from data centers is expected to outpace demand from the growing use of electric vehicles until 2046, according to regional energy experts.

Kotek appointed as committee chairs Margaret Hoffmann and Michael Jung. Hoffman is also a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, former energy policy adviser to Oregon governors John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown and former rural development director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Oregon. Jung is an environmental policy executive and director of the ICF Climate Center, an international tech and energy consultancy.

Other commission members are:

Dan Dorran, chair of the Umatilla County Commission. Umatilla has sited a large number of Amazon data centers in the last decade that have caused 554% demand growth at the Umatilla Electric Cooperative, according to Sightline’s analysis.

Greg Dotson, an energy and environmental law expert at the University of Oregon.

Bill Edmunds, a former private utility executive who teaches energy and business courses at Portland State University and the University of Portland.

Tim Miller, director of the nonprofit industry group Oregon Business For Climate.

Jean Wilson, a renewable energy executive and former president of the nonprofit Oregon Environmental Council.

The group will meet publicly at least once a month and focus on studying data center citing decisions, according to Kotek’s news release. They’ll look at regulations to support how and where data centers could be built to spur “responsible economic development” and job creation, without overburdening local energy and water supplies in the rural communities they tend to be built in.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2026/01/QTS-Data-Centers-in-Hillsboro-on-Oct.-11-2024.-Oregon-Gov.-Tina-Kotek-created-a-new-advisory-co.jpg?w=729,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:44.130106

The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects.","WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for high-impact, local public projects and Michigan priorities in the Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that passed the Senate. The bipartisan legislation includes funding for protecting the Great Lakes, continued construction of the Soo Locks, strengthening our power grid, and flood prevention. The bill now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

“This bipartisan legislation delivers crucial investments that will support Michigan’s economy and help protect our Great Lakes and precious freshwater assets,” said Senator Peters. “I was proud to secure funding in the bill to build more resilient infrastructure, bolster clean energy production, and advance research that keeps our state at the forefront of innovation.”

The bill includes numerous measures led and supported by Peters, including:

Strengthening Critical Infrastructure

Robust Funding for Soo Locks Construction: Peters secured $176.6 million in the bill for the Soo Locks construction project. This funding will support ongoing construction of the new Poe-sized lock. Peters has prioritized securing the funding necessary to build the new lock. Last year, through his role on the Appropriations Committee, he secured more than $264 million through government funding legislation. In 2024, he toured the ongoing construction project after helping to secure $257.4 million for the project. In January 2022, Peters also helped to secure $479 million for modernizing the Soo Locks through the bipartisan infrastructure law.

Brandon Road Lock and Dam Funding: Peters secured $28 million for construction of numerous measures to counter invasive carp at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, a critical choke point for halting the continued spread of invasive carp and preventing them from establishing in the Great Lakes.

Supporting U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The bill provides over $10 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support critical projects that strengthen our nation’s waterways and protect communities from extreme weather events.

Strengthening Michigan Ports and Harbors: The bill provides a historic more than $3 billion, a $702 million increase over fiscal year 2025, to improve navigation and commerce on our nation’s waterways, including the Great Lakes. The bill also includes funding for inland waterway navigation projects, which help improve the transport of important commodities like grain, iron, and petroleum.

Protecting the Great Lakes, Access to Clean Water

Replacing Lead Service Lines in Detroit: Peters secured $9 million in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to replace lead service lines throughout the City of Detroit, helping to ensure safe drinking water and public health.

Great Lakes Authority: The bill includes $5 million for the Great Lakes Authority (GLA), one of ten federal regional commissions that seek to address major economic distress in certain geographic regions. The funding will be used to make targeted investments in economically distressed communities across the Great Lakes Basin, helping to ensure communities throughout the region have access to quality public infrastructure, job training opportunities, and the general tools necessary for economic prosperity. The GLA encompasses counties throughout eight states: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study: The bill provides the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with $3 million to continue conducting its Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study, which is developing a coordinated strategy and identifying aging infrastructure to protect 5,200 miles of Great Lakes coastline against flooding and erosion.

Bolstering U.S. Manufacturing and Innovation, Michigan’s Automotive Sector

Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB): The bill provides $110 million for FRIB operations and $15 million for the construction of the High Rigidity Spectrometer (HRS). The facility is housed at Michigan State University. The rare isotopes produced at FRIB will allow nuclear scientists and researchers to explore a range of potential applications in the fields such as energy, medicine, and national security, including diagnosing and curing diseases, improving next generation nuclear reactors for energy, and finding processes to destroy nuclear waste. Once completed, HRS will enable isotope harvesting and substantially increase FRIB’s scientific reach and productivity.

Supporting Scientific Discovery: The bill provides $8.4 billion in funding for the Office of Science. The Office of Science is the largest federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports 22,000 researchers at 17 national laboratories and more than 300 universities, including in Michigan. The bill will advance research in the highest priorities including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, biology, and clean energy to maintain and strengthen our global competitiveness. The bill also boosts funding for the Office’s work on artificial intelligence and advanced computing to help the Department of Energy implement the Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security, and Technology (FASST) initiative.

Renewable Energy: The bill provides $3.1 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs that support all types of research, including into advanced manufacturing and building and industrial decarbonization. The bill rejects President Trump’s proposed cut of over $2.5 billion for this research, as well as his proposal to zero out funding for critical solar, wind, and hydrogen research programs. The bill maintains vital investments to bolster energy and manufacturing supply chains to help ensure our continued global leadership in energy technologies.

Protecting Our Energy Grid: The bill provides $190 million to help ensure the continued success of the Department of Energy’s programs aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of our energy sector and grid. It also provides robust funding for both the Office of Electricity and the Grid Deployment Office, rejecting President Trump’s proposed merger of the two offices. The bill will also support upgrades to critical electrical grid infrastructure, an essential investment when energy costs are skyrocketing due to President Trump’s policies, including the termination of renewable energy projects across the country.

Tribal Energy: The bill provides funding for the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects. This funding will help electrify the 30,000 Tribal homes that currently do not have access to power.

Trump took the oath of office, becoming the 47th President of the United States. In just one year, his administration has secured the border, unleashed domestic energy, and put America back in charge on the world stage.

Members of the Republican Study Committee (RSC) celebrated President Trump’s first-year accomplishments and the results he has delivered for American families.

""One year in, and President Trump proved what we already knew: weakness invites chaos, strength delivers results. Under his leadership, American workers gained back $1,100 in real wages that President Biden's policies destroyed, manufacturing is surging, and new jobs are going to U.S. citizens instead of illegal aliens. And it's not just our economy that's winning again. Our adversaries are contained and our country is leading from a position of strength again. The world knows America is back. Promises made, promises kept!"" said RSC Chairman August Pfluger (TX-11).

“One year into the Trump 2.0 Administration, we’ve seen bold leadership that has delivered lower taxes, stronger borders, renewed energy independence, and historic support for our military and law enforcement. President Trump has kept his promises to the American people, strengthening our economy, defending our freedoms, and holding the line against radical policies that hurt our nation. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and I look forward to the work ahead to secure a more prosperous future for all Americans,"" said RSC Vice-Chair Ben Cline (VA-06).

“Today we mark year one of President Trump restoring American momentum after years of chaos and decline. Lower costs, unleashing American energy, a secure border, and safer communities prove that real leadership gets real results. America is back!” said RSC Messaging Task Force Chair Mark Alford (MO-04).

“One year ago, President Trump took office with a bold vision to restore economic opportunity for working families and strengthen American competitiveness. That vision is now delivering real results — bigger paychecks, rising wages, and a stronger economy. GDP growth is beating expectations, inflation is moderating, and thanks to pro-working families policies, Americans are better able to afford the essentials of daily life. Republicans in Congress will continue working alongside the Trump Administration to build on this progress by supporting American workers and families, and expanding opportunity across the country,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08).

“In just one year of President Trump back in the White House and working with a Republican Congress, the people of North Texas have enjoyed incredible success with lower costs, rising wages that are beating inflation, and they are looking forward to massive tax refunds to help their families keep $1,000 to $2,000 more of what they earn. The Texas border with Mexico has never been more secure and as we are continuing to deport hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens brought in by Joe Biden's open border policies, cities and communities throughout Texas are safer for our families and small businesses. This past year of responsible governance and conservative reforms has helped us set the stage for a cycle of virtuous economic growth that will strengthen our hardworking families and deliver much deserved prosperity for their futures,” said RSC Budget and Spending Task Force Chair Beth Van Duyne (TX-24).

""One year ago, President Trump returned to the White House with a historic mandate to rebuild American strength at home and abroad. In just 12 months, we've worked with the administration to deliver a secure southern border, the lowest gas prices in five years, historic tax relief for working families, and renewed American leadership on the world stage. The path forward is clear: stay focused on commonsense solutions that lower costs for families and advance peace through strength around the globe,” said RSC National Security Task Force Chair Zach Nunn (IA-03).

“In just one year, President Trump has delivered on the mandate the American people gave on Nov. 5th, 2024. He ended the failed policies from Biden and the Democrats — policies that fueled crushing inflation, allowed millions of illegal criminals to pour into our communities, and pushed radical gender ideology into our schools, sports, and institutions. I am honored to serve with President Trump and to be in the fight to secure our borders, restore prosperity, protect our children, and save the future of our country. AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” said RSC Emerging Technologies Chair Kat Cammack (FL-03).

""One year since President Trump's inauguration and congressional Republicans continue to renew their commitment to putting taxpayers first and restoring fiscal discipline. The One Big Beautiful Bill reflects that effort and shows what can happen when the White House and Congress work together to deliver real solutions. I fought to include priorities that directly benefit hardworking families, including a strong child tax credit and support for rural hospitals. Those provisions matter. They help parents keep more of what they earn and ensure that families in rural communities can continue to access care close to home,"" said Rep. Robert Aderholt (AL-04). ""The contrast after one year is undeniable. We have moved from excuses to action, from chaos to order, and from a Washington that too often protects itself into a government that is being forced to answer to the American people again. This anniversary is more than a milestone. It is proof that leadership matters. When a President enforces the law, defends our sovereignty, stands up for taxpayers, and leads with strength on the world stage, America wins. President Trump’s first year back in office has shown what is possible when we put America first, and we are just getting started,” said Values Action Team Chairman Robert Aderholt (AL-04).

“We can sum up President Trump’s first year in one word: results. From slashing wasteful spending and securing our border to unleashing energy dominance and jumpstarting our economy, the President has delivered with massive tax cuts and a rollback on burdensome red tape. This first year has been defined by historic speed to reverse the failures of the previous administration—promises made, promises kept. I look forward to continue working with President Trump and my House colleagues to keep America moving forward and make our nation great again,” said Rep. Aaron Bean (FL-04).

“In just one year, President Trump has secured our border, eliminated woke DEI ideology from our military, jump-started the economy by cutting red tape and unleashing American energy, and restored America’s leadership on the world stage. It’s an honor to work alongside President Trump to advance this conservative agenda. The best is yet to come,”said Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21).

“President Trump saved this country from a socialist, Marxist left and delivered historic tax cuts for working families, defunded Planned Parenthood, restored Second Amendment rights by zeroing out the NFA tax, and secured our border. Reconciliation 2.0 is the next step, building on those wins by lowering health care and housing costs, unleashing American energy, and making the American Dream real again,” said Rep. Eric Burlison (MO-07).

“In just this first year, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have secured the border, ended tax on tips, eliminated wasteful spending, fought fraud, and in the case of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, brought in more high-paying tech jobs, laying the necessary groundwork to make the American Dream affordable again,"" stated Congressman Abe Hamadeh. ""We have done this despite constant obstruction from Democrats, who repeatedly show they are more interested in exploiting the struggles of hard-working Americans to advance failed policies and fund the livelihoods of illegal immigrants,” said Rep. Abe Hamadeh (AZ-08).

“One year into President Trump’s administration, America is moving in the right direction. Policies that put American workers and families first are delivering results at home, while peace through strength is restoring credibility and stability abroad. The best is yet to come as we continue advancing economic growth, security, and opportunity for the American people,” said Rep. Claudia Tenney (NY-24).

“In the year since President Trump took office, we have seen amazing success at our border. I will continue to push to codify President Trump’s executive orders that have enabled this historic change. Thank you, President Trump, for your leadership and for making the border secure again,” said Rep. Michael Guest (MS-03).

“One year into President Trump’s second term, the momentum is undeniable. With another reconciliation package on the horizon, we’re pushing forward bold, commonsense reforms to strengthen the economy, secure the border, and put American families first. This is how you deliver results and we’re just getting started,” said Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05).

“In just one year, President Trump has undone the damage caused by the Biden autopen presidency and made America respected again on the global stage,” said Rep. Stutzman. “Terrorists are on the run, our economy is on the rise, and there are still three years to go! The Golden Age of America is upon us,” said Rep. Marlin Stutzman (IN-03).

“What a difference a year makes. One year after President Trump laid out a clear plan in his inauguration address, that plan is being executed and delivering results. Under President Biden, the country faced numerous failures, including a broken border, weakened energy production, runaway inflation, heavy regulations, declining military recruitment, reckless spending, and global instability. Under President Trump, the border is being secured, American energy is back, delivering lower gas prices, inflation has decreased, wages are increasing, and families are keeping more of their paycheck. Burdensome regulations are being rolled back, allowing businesses to grow. Military recruitment is surging, wasteful spending is decreasing, and waste, fraud, and abuse are being eliminated. Accountability is being restored. Abroad, the U.S. is once again pursuing peace through strength and restoring credibility. With pro-growth policies, deregulation, and investment, the economy has real momentum, with growth projected to exceed 4%. It has been a strong year, and we are just getting started. My bipartisan message is simple: Democrats must stop the political posturing and focus on governing, because it is time to build a stronger America together,” said Rep. Dan Meuser (PA-09).

“Today marks one year of America’s golden age,” said Rep. Troy Nehls (TX-22). “In just 365 days, we now have the most secure border in history, gas prices are down, taxes have been cut, we are once again respected on the world stage, our communities are safer, and waste, fraud, and abuse have been eliminated. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, our country is doing better than ever before, and I’m proud to stand with President Trump and my House Republican colleagues in working to Make America Great Again.”

“It’s been one year since President Trump’s historic return to the White House,” said Rep. Vince Fong (CA-20). “In record time, he secured the border, lowered costs, spurred economic growth, and rooted out waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal government. For the Central Valley, that means fighting for reliable water supplies and more energy production. Policies that put working families, farmers, and small businesses first. I look forward to partnering with President Trump to deliver real results for California’s Central Valley in the years ahead.”",https://republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/AP-PRESSER_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:32.088859

Josh Siegel: I think energy affordability will be a top-tier issue in terms of electricity prices in a way we haven’t seen before, and the Trump administration clearly is scrambling on it. So we’ll have to see how it actually trickles down to House and Senate races, but it’s definitely going to be a top-tier issue.

Bill Loveless: From the affordability crisis and the data-center boom to the U.S. government’s campaign to reinvigorate the Venezuelan oil market following its arrest of President Maduro, energy is dominating headlines in unusual ways. And that’s all happening against a backdrop of upheaval in federal energy policy, which started on day one of the second Trump administration. As we begin the new year and head into midterm elections, there’s a dizzying number of crucial energy policy issues at play. So how are geopolitics reshaping the context for U.S. energy and climate policymaking in 2026? And how might upcoming court rulings change things? How is the public responding to changes in energy policy as they also face increasing utility bills? And what stories or trends are going unreported or underreported amid all of these important energy storylines?

Bill Loveless: This is Columbia Energy Exchange, a weekly podcast from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. I’m Bill Loveless.

Today on the show, Maxine Joselow and Josh Siegel.

Maxine Joselow is a reporter for The New York Times, where she covers climate policy from Washington, D.C. Before joining the Times, Maxine covered climate change and the environment for The Washington Post. Before that, she was a reporter at E&E News.

Josh Siegel is an energy reporter for POLITICO, where he focuses on Congress. He also hosts the POLITICO Energy Podcast. Previously, he covered the energy beat for The Washington Examiner, where he wrote the Daily on Energy newsletter.

We took stock of the ongoing legal battles over wind power and permitting reform and looked ahead to the bills and court decisions that could make the biggest impact this year. We discussed which climate and energy narratives, particularly around energy prices, are landing with voters today and how those issues are likely to play out in the midterm elections. We talked about how energy markets are responding to major policy changes and to geopolitical pressures, and we talked about the stories they’ll be tracking throughout the year ahead. Here’s our conversation.

Bill Loveless: Maxine Joselow, Josh Siegel, welcome to Columbia Energy Exchange.

Maxine Joselow: Thank you.

Josh Siegel: Thanks for having me.

Bill Loveless: I should say, in your case, Maxine, welcome back to Columbia Energy Exchange. It’s good to have you back. And Josh, an old friend, it’s good to see you as well. We’re here to talk about what’s in store for energy and climate policy in Washington in 2026. We’re only halfway through January, and already there have been some big energy headlines, including a major White House announcement regarding AI data centers and electricity. Josh, you were there. What happened?

Josh Siegel (03:33): As you said, it was pretty unprecedented. We had the Energy Dominance Council chair, Doug Burgum; Energy Secretary Chris Wright; and several governors representing states in PJM, the 13-state power market that stretches from the Midwest to Virginia. They all came to the White House and basically they’re calling on PJM to hold an emergency auction for tech companies to buy power for the next 15 years.

Maxine Joselow (00:04): My colleagues and I are expecting a decision to formally repeal the endangerment finding this month, and that would arguably be the single biggest deregulatory action by the EPA ever.

Josh Siegel (00:17): I think energy affordability will be a top tier issue in terms of electricity prices in a way we haven’t seen before, and the Trump administration clearly is scrambling on it, so we’ll have to see how it actually trickles down to House and Senate races, but it’s definitely going to be a top tier issue from

Bill Loveless (00:35): The affordability crisis and the data center boom to the US Government’s campaign to reinvigorate the Venezuelan oil market following its arrest of President Maduro energy is dominating headlines in unusual ways, and that’s all happening against a backdrop of upheaval in federal energy policy, which started on day one of the second Trump administration. As we begin the new year and head into midterm elections, there’s a dizzying number of crucial energy policy issues at play. So how are geopolitics reshaping the context for US energy and climate policymaking in 2026, and how might upcoming court rulings change things? How is the public responding to changes in energy policy as they also face increasing utility bills, and what stories or trends are going unreported or underreported amid all of these important energy storylines?

Bill Loveless (01:31): This is Columbia Energy Exchange, a weekly podcast from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. I’m Bill Loveless. Today on the show, Maxine Joselow and Josh Siegel. Maxine Joselow is a reporter for the New York Times where she covers climate policy from Washington DC. Before joining the Times, Maxine covered climate change and the environment for the Washington Post. Before that, she was a reporter at E&E News. Josh Siegel is an energy reporter for POLITICO, where he focuses on Congress. He also hosts the POLITICO Energy Podcast. Previously, he covered the energy beat for the Washington Examiner, where he wrote the Dawn Energy Newsletter. We took stock of the ongoing legal battles over wind power and permitting reform, and looked ahead to the bills and court decisions that could make the biggest impact this year. We discussed which climate and energy narratives, particularly around energy prices are landing with voters today and how those issues are likely to play out in midterm elections. We talked about how energy markets are responding to major policy changes and to geopolitical pressures, and we talked about the stories they’ll be tracking throughout the year ahead. Here’s our conversation.

Bill Loveless (02:51): Maxine Joselow. Josh Siegel, welcome to Columbia Energy Exchange.

Josh Siegel (02:56): Thank you. Thanks for having me.

Bill Loveless (02:58): I should say in your case, Maxine, welcome back to Columbia Energy Exchange. It’s good to have you back, and Josh, an old friend, it’s good to see you there as well. Well, we’re here to talk about what’s in store for energy and climate policy in Washington and the year 2026, and here we are just halfway through January, and already there are some big energy headlines in Washington, including a major announcement the other day at the White House regarding AI data centers and electricity. Josh, you were there for the announcement. What happened? Yeah,

Josh Siegel (03:33): As you said, pretty unprecedented. So we had the Energy Dominance Council chair, Doug Bergham, energy Secretary, Chris Wright, and several governors that represent states in PJM, which of course is the 13 state power market that stretches from the Midwest to Virginia. So they all came to the White House and basically they’re calling on PJM to hold an emergency auction for tech companies to buy power for the next 15 years. It’s really designed to motivate these big tech companies to build a fleet of new power plants to serve the rapidly growing AI data centers in this country. And it was really interesting to see Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, who decides to, he’s long been a critic of PJM, he decides to go to the White House for this event. From my understanding, it was sort of last minute as far as the actual invite, this has been in the works for a while as far as governors working with the White House, including Democrats, Wes Moore of Maryland was the other Democrat in attendance, but it was pretty interesting to sort of see them all come together and call on PGM to take action.

Now, PJM doesn’t have to do anything. What’s interesting, I mean, clearly there’s a political element of this. I think the governors and the White House see a reason to be seen as responsive to rising electricity prices, which I’m sure will get more into, has become a really potent political issue. And there’s a lot of questions, I think in talking to experts with some of my colleagues around actually implementing this and what it would take. But to see all these folks at the White House with very disagreements around broader energy policy and the types of generation we should be building, I thought was pretty noteworthy.

Bill Loveless (05:09): Yeah, yeah, certainly affordability, right? That’s sort of the political watchword these days on so many issues. And in electricity, the concerns over rising prices, they’ve gone up, what about 7% in the United States over the past year. And so politically it’s a big issue as well as for the pocketbook. Josh, I know there’s a lot of uncertainty at this point, but I mean, do some see this as what it will take to achieve some sort of breakthrough in terms of providing reliable but affordable sources of electricity for not only data centers, but for the general public?

Josh Siegel (05:45): I mean, I think people seem to think it’s a show of force that really we haven’t seen that’s like, okay, people recognize how big of a problem this is. So in that aspect it’s positive. But as far as any immediate impact, how quickly would PJM act on this, if at all? Would they have a different interpretation of what to do? We know how long it takes to build power plants in this country. Permitting I’m sure we’ll get into is a challenge, so I don’t think you would see any immediate relief for this, but it’s sort of more to show that folks are taking action. There’s bipartisan interest in doing so. I think a lot of questions are around does FERC, so PJM would have to file a filing with FERC. We know that the FERC has been a huge priority of this administration to sort of see FERC as an avenue to move their energy agenda for chair. Laura Swett was in attendance at this event. So I think that was sort of telling to show, okay, they see a need here to maybe act on this if PJM again were to proceed, but a lot of questions as far as how quickly you would see something like this actually be implemented and take effect in time for people to see it and be visible. I think that’s unlikely as far as midterm election season.

It’s designed to motivate big tech companies to build new power plants to serve rapidly growing AI data centers.

It was especially interesting to see Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a longtime critic of PJM, attend the event. From my understanding, the invitation was fairly last-minute, though the effort has been in the works for some time and included Democratic Governor Wes Moore of Maryland. Seeing them all come together to call on PJM to act was noteworthy.

Josh Siegel (04:37): PJM doesn’t have to do anything, of course. There’s clearly a political element. The governors and the White House want to be seen as responsive to rising electricity prices, which have become a potent political issue. There are major implementation questions, and it will take time to build new power plants. Still, given the disagreements among these leaders over broader energy policy, it was striking to see them unified in this moment.

Bill Loveless (05:09): Affordability really is the political watchword right now. Electricity prices have risen about 7 percent over the past year. Josh, do some see this as a potential breakthrough for providing reliable and affordable electricity, not just for data centers but for the public more broadly?

Josh Siegel (05:45): People see it as a show of force and recognition of how serious the problem is. That’s positive. But in terms of immediate impact, it’s unclear how quickly PJM would act, if at all. Building power plants takes time, and permitting remains a challenge. This is more about signaling action and bipartisan interest than delivering near-term relief, especially before the midterms.

Bill Loveless (06:59): Yeah, absolutely. We’ll talk more about FERC at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a few minutes, but because certainly a lot will be happening there, and of course this is happening as we are seeing major geopolitical events around the world. I wonder, are events in major oil producers like Venezuela and Iran reshaping the context for US energy policy making this year, Maxine, are they changing any energy priorities around, I don’t know, production, strategic reserves, sanctions, environmental issues?

Maxine Joselow (07:35): Those are a lot of really big questions, Bill. Let me see if I can take a stab at answering some of them and I’ll let Josh weigh in on some of them too. I think at a very high level, the fact that oil prices are low right now has allowed the administration to have more confidence and to kind of be unfettered in taking these big geopolitical actions because they know that there won’t be repercussions at home. Americans won’t be seeing higher prices at the pump as a result, which is top of mind in this whole question about affordability. People often notice prices at the pump more than they notice their electricity bills going up. And so whether it’s Venezuela, whether it’s Iran, the administration feels like it has room to make these big interventions because of the fact that prices are low, generally speaking right now. But those are some big questions. I don’t know if Josh, you want to jump in on some of those too?

Josh Siegel (08:29): Yeah, I do see it sort of involving the affordability context. There’s some intersection here, and again, my frame is really from the Hill. I do most of my reporting in Congress and when I talk to Democrats, they sort of see this as an opportunity to say, Hey, President Trump’s so focused on these overseas interventions, domestic affordability, what does he really care about? And then there’s this question of the administration is exporting Venezuela’s oil. They say the US government has control over the revenue and it’s going to go to the Venezuelan people. But I think there’s a lot of questions. I think Democrats see an opportunity to use that as like, okay, we’re giving more control to this administration. That obviously has stepped on the power of the purse in lots of ways as far as when it comes to Congress’s prerogative over federal government funds and appropriations. This seems separate from that. This wouldn’t involve Congress from everything that I’ve been told as far as does Congress get a chance to weigh in on what to do with these revenues? But I think they see it as an opportunity to say, oh, the Trump administration, we’re going to trust them to sort of handle this when they’ve intervened in funding matters pretty aggressively across the board on energy.

Maxine Joselow (09:41): And just speaking of Democrats in Congress in Venezuela, I also thought it was notable that the administration appears not to have briefed members of Congress in advance of the strike. And then at the same time, the head executives of major oil companies had a heads up and were brought into these conversations earlier on, and you see Democrats like Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee sending letters to these top oil company executives asking, what did you know and when and did you know it before we did?

Bill Loveless (10:14): So to some extent, it does color some of the discussions that take place, obviously over energy policy this year.

Josh Siegel (10:22): Yeah, no, I think that’s for sure. And again, I think Democrats are already eager to sort of show that the Trump administration is too close to the oil industry. And this is another example, although, I mean that big White House meeting right there was ExxonMobil, a lot of skepticism around whether what it would take to actually go back in Venezuela in a significant way. So I think that’s interesting that there does seem to be division within the industry on how that will play out. But I think Democrats see an opportunity here and it’ll color a lot of what we see the rest of the year.

Bill Loveless (10:56): So let’s go to Congress, go to Capitol Hill. Are there two or three flash points for lawmakers in 2026? Josh, I know you’ve been big in covering permitting reform, so I would hazard to guess that’s one of them, but there’s grid reliability, something else.

Josh Siegel (11:15): I think permitting reform is really, I mean, the top policy issue I’m still watching for, I mean, I know right? Talks are on pause right now. So Senate Democrats have stopped negotiating with Republicans because the Trump administration during the Christmas holiday season basically paused all offshore wind projects that are in construction, five really large projects. And that sort of caught some folks by surprise, given the timing of that — happened right after the house passed their NEPA overhaul bill, which was sort of their imprint on permitting reform was meant to sort of jumpstart negotiations. The Senate was already having conversations, but Senate Democrats were like, look, we can’t do this when it’s very clear that the Trump administration has favorites when it comes to energy, they favor fossil fuels, they favor nuclear. How can they implement any permitting bill that might benefit clean energy or should on a policy basis benefit clean energy?

(12:08): But I mean the outside noise for action is still super significant. Every industry is at the table that you can think of, oil and gas, clean energy, tech, I mean, so I think the noise is going to be consistent throughout the year. There could be opportunities to reopen. We’ll see if, I’m sure we’ll get more into this, but a big question mark going forward is does the Trump administration change their tactic on clean energy at all? They suffered some court losses here last week with three of these projects, three of these offshore wind projects that now can continue construction. Does that change anything from this administration? Is rising prices and sort of what it looks like when they’re taking projects offline and how that might impact things, does that force them to change course at some point? So I think that’s the biggest question hovering over permitting reform, but I expect that to be a constant conversation every week. It feels like there’s an event from some industry group hoping that they return to the table. So we’ll see. But that’s really my big one.

Bill Loveless (13:05): I mean, that’s been the case with permitting reform for several years, right? I mean, it’s constantly chatter over this. There has been more action lately with the passage of the bill by Republican Bruce Westerman and Democrat Jared Golden late last year. But as you say, there’s been these obstacles that have come up more recently over the administration’s pausing again of offshore wind projects. Maxine, you cover Interior. Remind us what’s happened most recently with those offshore wind projects.

Maxine Joselow (13:37): Yeah, so I cover the interior department generally and have been following these offshore wind projects, specifically, including the ups and downs of their various legal battles. And last week, as Josh noted, there was a trio of adverse rulings against the administration ordering all three of these projects to again resume construction and finding that the Trump administration had not adequately explained why these projects needed to stop construction because they pose these unspecified national security risks. And essentially in its abrupt December 22nd announcement, just three days before Christmas, ordering these projects to stop construction, the Interior Department had cited these classified reports by the Defense Department, now called the Department of War, that found that these projects posed security risks and that the turbines could interfere with the radar used by military vessels and other boat captains. And the three judges in these three cases all ruled that those reports which they saw under seal, did not adequately justify stopping these multi-billion dollar projects, some of which are almost near completion and in operation.

Bill Loveless (14:59): Yeah, there’s been a lot of turmoil over these offshore wind projects. A lot of those that were on the drawing board are no longer there because of the administration’s opposition to this form of energy. So yeah, it’s been quite tumultuous and costly certainly for those offshore developers. I just wonder with those actions on the offshore wind happening when they did and how it came at a point when the house had just passed this bill, so there was giving hope to some people that maybe there would be some sort of permitting reform this year if in fact that can be resolved. Josh, as I understand it in the House, there was some stiff opposition to doing anything to stop the White House from stopping wind projects. And they can point to this has happened during the Biden administration when the President pulled permits that had been done for the pipeline from Canada. I mean, is this one of the big stumbling blocks that needs to be resolved if permitting reforms to go anywhere?

Josh Siegel (16:00): I mean, it’s the biggest one for sure. I mean, we saw, as you noted in the House, I mean some of the Freedom Caucus hard right along with more moderate members who just oppose offshore wind kind of banded together and saw this provision that Westerman was able to negotiate in the markup of his bill that essentially put some limits. I mean it was a pretty modest measure, but put some limits around the executive branch’s interference in the permitting process, which has been sort of the biggest hangup in these talks. Westerman knew he was going to have to get at this issue at some point. He negotiated that with Democrats, but the Freedom Caucus got wind of it, and they immediately saw it as a target on Trump policies, even though Westerman really took pains to say this is a technology neutral, as you noted, Bill, we’ve seen it, the Biden administration take actions against fossil fuel projects.

(16:48): So it was meant to really not target any specific technology, but that didn’t stop the Freedom Caucus. They eventually got it through, but Westerman had to water it down somewhat. And yeah, I mean on the Democratic side, the biggest thing they want out of these talks in the Senate, they even thought what Westerman did was not sufficient at all. So they want to see stronger language in this area. They want to see both Trump administration change its behavior as far as how it’s treating these projects. And then they do this exact opposite right after the House passes its bill when they put the halt on these offshore wind projects. But they also want to see a big policy right as this Interior Department memo that interior secretary Doug Bergham put in, that essentially requires him to sign off on routine permits for solar and wind onshore projects on federal lands.

(17:36): But this affects projects on private lands because some of these approvals involve crossing state and private lands, and that policy has really put a hamper on project development in this country. And the Democrats say they want that policy to go away. They want to maybe put in language into a bill that would limit that kind of stonewalling that the administration has been doing. Rather than outright rejecting. They’re just not approving anything. So is there a way to get at that? But we know that any move in this area is going to get backlash on the right. So it’s tricky to see how you get compromise on that.

Maxine Joselow (18:09): Those are great points, Josh. And I would just add, there was I think a lot of speculation in climate and energy circles in Washington about whether these two things were related, whether the collapse of the permitting reform talks on the Hill was related in any way to the Trump administration’s announcement that it was ordering a halt to construction on these five offshore wind projects just a few days later. And my reporting, my colleagues in their reporting have tried to answer that question, and it seems a little unclear, but maybe the answer is a tentative no. I didn’t actually end up including this in my story, but I’ll share it with listeners of this podcast that I had an interview with Congressman Jeff Van Drew, Republican of New Jersey and leading opponent of offshore wind projects, and I asked him: “You along with your colleagues in the Freedom Caucus up in arms over this language in the permitting reform, talks about offshore wind. Did you call President Trump? Did you call the White House and maybe get this issue back on his radar in a way that may have resulted in that stop work order announcement?” And he actually declined to take credit for getting it back on the White House’s radar, which I thought was very telling whenever a lawmaker declines to take credit for something that’s notable, I think when given the opportunity to do so.

Josh Siegel (19:29): Yeah, no, Maxine, that’s a great point. I do think it’s unclear as far as the connection, but you raise a point on, did just sort of the conversation around this put it back into Trump’s radar and like, Hey, why haven’t we done anything lately against offshore wind? So I think that’s a possibility, but it also shows I think, how disconnected the administration is from Congress that maybe there wasn’t a direct connection here, but they clearly were not aware or they didn’t care that what they did here would permeate or affect permitting talks on the Hill. They didn’t make that connection. So it’s sort of unclear how much they actually see a need for congressional action, what their priorities would be. There hasn’t been a great public discussion of that from administration officials other than some NEPA reform, but they’re going to need more than that to get a bill through and then maybe to see some pipeline approvals streamlined through the Clean Water Act. But they’re doing it right. We’ve seen the EPA do regulatory action and that recently, so it’s unclear. I mean, they’re doing a lot on permitting to benefit the projects they want. So how much do they really want Congress to act?

Bill Loveless (20:31): Yeah, and I certainly want to get to EPA in a moment, one of Maxine’s beats. But I think for years we’ve heard about all of the above energy policy, and there’s some controversy over that, some depending on which side of the political spectrum you sit. Some people would prefer more of this than that, but it seems to be there has been more of an acknowledgement that in all the above energy policy is important to consider. And at a time when renewables solar and wind achieving a bigger part of the new generation in this country, IEA just put out a new short-term energy outlook, I believe it was today, that’s saying that solar power is driving electricity generation growth and will do so over the next two years. But there’s a lot of talk about base load too, particularly natural gas and nuclear new to back in the in the mix again, is there, where do we sit with this? It takes some years to get a gas turbine built and operating in this country for baseload. The renewables seem to come on faster. Is there some meeting in the middle among politicians and regulators over where the optimal growth can be in this country for electricity, Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (21:44): Yeah. Well, I think this whole notion of all of the above energy policy has had a really fascinating political realignment attached to it that I’ve observed as a reporter in the space over the last several years. When you think back to the first Trump administration, they used the phrase to describe their energy policy, all the above. And to some extent it was more true in the first Trump administration because you still had offshore wind leasing taking place. You still had interior Secretary Ryan Zinke at the time praising the offshore wind leasing bonanza that had resulted in a bunch of bids. And fast forward to today, and you actually, despite the fact that President Trump issued an executive order on day one of returning to office calling a national energy emergency and saying that his administration was going to take all of these steps to bring new energy sources online faster, you actually see his administration not so much taking in all of the above approach as pushing for fossil fuels like coal, which he calls beautiful clean coal, natural gas oil, and of course, some technologies that energy secretary Chris Wright tends to favor like nuclear and geothermal at the same time as his administration is arguably throttling wind and solar onshore and offshore.

(23:11): And so all of the above has in some ways become an opening for Democrats to attack the administration on and say, Hey, you say you’re all of the above, but in fact you’re throttling these sources of power. And in the case of offshore wind, these five wind farms we were talking about that are stalled or were stalled off the East coast, we’re projected to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses with clean energy at a time that there’s potentially shortages in the northeast.

Bill Loveless (23:40): Well, I mean, we talk about energy all of the above, but I mean this administration came in with energy dominance being the theme, right? Oil and gas and coal. So there’s no getting away from that, and I don’t mean to diminish the significance of that aspect of the administration’s energy policy, but I think out there in the atmosphere when people look at energy, our energy needs, you can’t ignore the fact that the renewables have come on so substantially in recent years and raises the question of what role they could play in combination, say with batteries, for example, which seems to be coming on in greater force these days as well as the fossil fuels. It’s a lot to consider Josh.

Josh Siegel (24:21):

Yeah, no, Maxine is spot on as far as Democrats seeing an opportunity in this, and you are hearing them increasingly talk about wind and solar in the context of being the cheapest quickest to get on the grid at a moment of great energy need out there, less sort of in the climate frame, which is interesting and saying, I mean the administration is preventing that from happening. They’re literally taking projects offline that are ready to go. So it is interesting to see Democrats. And as far as fossil fuels, I mean, I feel like most I talk to on the hill, I mean, you still have maybe the progressive left who would like to see less fossil fuel use even now, but folks seem to say we’re in a different context, a different time with the growing rising demand. We didn’t see that in the last Congress. It wasn’t part of the conversation when we were talking about the Inflation Production Act, which was the big Biden administration climate energy initiative. So Democrats are largely aligned, I think, on we’re really all of the above, not. So it’s been pretty interesting to see that evolution.

Bill Loveless (25:29): Well, we’re talking about Congress, but as I often say, and probably have said it more in recent years, it’s the agencies that seem to matter most when it comes to energy and climate outcomes. And that’s certainly the case here in 2026. And there we’re talking EPA, DOE, Interior, FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Maxine, where do we even begin with EPA? There’s so much that has occurred during this administration regarding regulations and rulemakings, which are the ones that deserve a particularly close attention right now?

Maxine Joselow (26:06): Great question. Where to begin? There’s been such a flurry of news out of EPA under the second Trump administration, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator had this day back in March that I remember because my inbox was just ping, ping, ping where they sent out, I think a total of 30 press releases about each of these new regulatory rollbacks they were undertaking. LeeZeldin called it the Greatest Day of Deregulation in American History and said he was driving a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion, which is a quote that’ll stay with me for a while. And since then there’s just been an onslaught of more news out of the agency. And I think one announcement that deserves a lot of attention and scrutiny is an announcement that I covered last week, it feels like longer ago, but yeah, it was last week. I got my hands on some internal EPA emails and documents that were later posted to their website and formally announced to the public, and they show that the EPA is going to make what I described in my article as a seismic shift to the way that it conducts cost benefit analysis for new clean air rules.

(27:22): And instead of considering both the health benefits of reducing air pollution, including the avoided asthma attacks and avoided premature deaths, the agency is only going to be considering the costs to businesses of complying with the rules. And that’s going to mean that in these cost benefit analysis, the costs of clean air regulations appear to greatly outweigh the benefits, which would be a significant change from the past three decades of EPA rulemakings under the Clean Air Act, where the benefits have typically exceeded the cost by at least a 30 to one ratio.

Bill Loveless (28:00): In the case of that, and there’s so many, as you say, other things going on at EPA right now, I mean, they proposed considering revising the Greenhouse Gas reporting program that could remove reporting requirements for many industry sectors and potentially reshaping how emissions are tracked and regulated in this country. And they’ve more recently proposed limiting the ability of states to block construction of oil and gas pipelines and coal export terminals. And perhaps the biggest thing, in my mind anyway, is that rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding, which provides the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and power plants under the Clean Air Act, there could be some decision on that fairly soon. Right, Maxie?

Maxine Joselow (28:47): That’s right. My colleagues and I are expecting a decision to formally repeal the endangerment finding this month. It might slip to next month, but so far every indication we’re hearing is it could be by the end of this month, and that would arguably be the single biggest deregulatory action by the EPA ever. To be fair to Lee Zeldin, that would probably be an accurate way to describe that action just because of the enormous benefits of climate regulations that have flowed from that Seminole 2009 finding that greenhouse gases do in fact endanger public health and welfare and therefore should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. And that has paved the way for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from car and truck tailpipes, from coal and gas power plant smokestacks. And as part of this proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, EPA is expected to also erase all limits on greenhouse gas pollution from light duty vehicles and power plants could be next.

Bill Loveless (29:53): I mean, this will be challenged in court as are all new regulations regardless of what administration’s in power at the moment, but we’re only entering the second year of the Trump administration. I mean, is it likely that this decision on the endangerment finding as well as other rules that EPA has proposed could in fact take effect within the next couple of years?

Maxine Joselow (30:23): Well, Bill, I’m not an environmental lawyer. I just interview a lot of them, but I think they’re all thinking that the EPA and the Justice Department want this case to reach the Supreme Court within President Trump’s second term and have this issue decided before the next administration comes into office, particularly if it’s a democratic administration. And in an ideal world for them, the Supreme Court would overturn Massachusetts versus EPA, which was the landmark case that found that EPA can regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that would prevent a future Democratic administration from coming in and reestablishing these limits on cars and power plants and other sources of pollution.

Josh Siegel (31:08):

Yeah, it’s been, just from a help perspective, it’s been interesting to hear Republicans universally who I talked to, even ones who were starting to lean in a little bit on climate change, saying that they support what the administration’s doing on the endangerment finding. I talked to Shelly Moore, Capto chair of VPW Committee of West Virginia who can be moderate on certain energy issues, or at least on how she talks about them. And she was saying, I mean, we want the end engagement finding to go away because we don’t want to see another Democratic administration come in and do what the Biden administration did as far as regulating power plants, vehicles in sort of an aggressive fashion. And they actually see that that’s why we need to see something like this. We don’t want ping ponging anymore. We want finality to it. So I think that’s pretty interesting to note, although there has been some pushback on the greenhouse gas reporting program that the administration has moved to undo where there’s a tie in there to carbon capture tax credits and accessibility, so the administration in the fossil fuel industry are aligned and wanting to see maybe that maintained, which is interesting.

Maxine Joselow (32:14): Yeah, I think potentially even more interesting than Congressional Republicans kind of falling in line is, as Josh said, industry pushback to some of these changes out of EPA. And that’s been a trend that I’ve noticed in my reporting on EPA over the past several months is in many cases, the agency is rolling back programs that industries actually like and want to keep around. So the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a great example. It’s just all it requires is reporting, reporting your greenhouse gas emissions. And the oil and gas industry really likes this program because it makes them look pretty good. It shows the progress they’ve made in reducing methane emissions compared to their competitors around the world, and it allows them to market their gas as more clean when they’re selling it abroad. Similarly, the Energy Star program, which we haven’t talked about, the administration said it wanted to eliminate it. There was pushback, and the home appliance manufacturers said, Hey, we actually really like this program. Similarly, it allows us to market energy efficient products like washing machines, dishwashers, et cetera, to consumers who recognize that label. And actually, there was pushback from the Hill too in the latest appropriation bill for the EPA and interior department that would actually provide and maintain funding for that program as well.

Bill Loveless (33:36): Now, you mentioned appropriations, Maxine, I don’t know if you or Josh have been following appropriations closely lately, but it’s my impression, I think there’s a bill moving through the hill right now for appropriations for the Department of Energy and some other agencies, and I may be wrong, but I think that the agency’s on fairing all that badly. I mean, compared to what the appropriations were previously. Right. Do either of you track that at all?

Josh Siegel (34:03): Yeah, so the appropriations bills for Interior and the Energy Department did pass the House and Senate already. So the Senate was last week. So I’m not sure if the President has actually signed those into law at this point. But yeah, these were compromised bills. I don’t have the numbers on top of me, but they definitely rejected some of the Trump administration’s proposed cuts, and you saw great votes from both the Democrats and the Republicans, great amount of votes, which I think was notable in this environment that they were able to get there. Appropriation seemed to be sort of the one thing maybe right now where you are seeing some members assert themselves and say, Hey, we need to claw back some power here.

Bill Loveless (34:40): So the funding is more or less consistent with what the agencies have gotten in the past, Josh?

Josh Siegel (34:44): Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. Comparing it to, I’m sure it’s less than the Biden administration have to go and look at the numbers, but they do reject some of the aggressive cuts that the Trump administration was proposing.

Bill Loveless (34:56): Let’s get back to FERC, and I always hesitate when I bring up FERC. As I recall, my first beat as an energy reporter in Washington many years ago was covering the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And I always said that that was sort of my bootcamp in covering energy in Washington because it’s pretty darn complicated place, but it continues to be important. And we’ve mentioned previously the new chair, Laura Swett, and she said at the first meeting that she chaired that her top priority would be connecting data centers to the grid, along with ensuring grid reliability at reasonable prices. Josh, what’s been happening there and what should we be paying particularly close attention to?

Josh Siegel (35:37): Yeah, the big thing we’re tracking, of course, and our FERC reporter, Isa Domínguez, so I sort of moonlight as a FERC reporter occasionally, but yeah, basically Chris Wright Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, issued this request under section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act for the commission to initiate a rule speeding connection of data centers to the grid, really dealing with this issue of interconnection and gave a pretty fast timeline for FERC to act on that. He wants action by the spring. So yeah, as you said, I mean FERC chair Laura Swett has seemingly leaned in on this area. They seem poised to issue a rule on it, notice of proposed rulemaking, and then there’s actually some bipartisan interest on it on the hill. I reported on energy committee chair Mike Lee and ranking member Martin Heinrich, who have really not gotten along on much on that committee.

(36:29): There’s been a lot of tensions in that relationship, but they actually issued a letter to FERC saying, we want to see you take action in this area while, of course, keeping state’s rights and consumer utility bills in mind. So there does seem to be great interest across the energy industry on action. I think the details will matter a lot. We’ve seen state utility commissioners sort of push back on maybe some move into their authority in a way that we haven’t seen when it comes to the grid, so it’ll be interesting to see what FERC does here.

Bill Loveless (37:02): Yeah, it seems like that would be a big potential source of conflict, right? States because states maintain considerable authority over what’s built when it comes to the electric grid, unlike natural gas pipelines and oil pipelines where FERC has considerably more authority than the states. But it’s a very complex issue, and one, I would think it’s going to take some time to work out.

Josh Siegel (37:27): We’ve seen a former Republican for chair Mark Christie really express that from a state perspective on like, look, we need to build a lot more generation and quickly, but he thinks the proposal from the energy secretary will undercut that goal. He talks about legal risks and just as he put it in an assault on the traditional authority of the states, who as he notes are really the key players in what kind of generation gets built.

Bill Loveless (37:52): Then of course as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there’s renewed interest in building nuclear in the United States, other conventional nuclear new reactors, small modular reactors, restarting reactors that had been previously shut down all of these things, and it’s all before the NRC, which is under a lot of pressure from the White House to act quickly and raising fears among some who follow nuclear regulation closely that maybe they’re going to be sideswiping the close scrutiny that NRC is typically administered in the past. So Josh,we need to keep our eye on NRC as well.

Josh Siegel (38:28): Yeah, we do. I mean, we’ve been watching it here at POLITICO on the energy team, and we’ve seen Trump fire NRC Commissioner, Chris Hanson, we’ve seen others quit, and then he has a new one, Ho Nieh. So this is really one of those independent agencies along with FERC. But I think NRC has even been more glaring of where we’ve seen the Trump administration really try to assert themselves and use it as a vehicle to advance their agenda. And the Energy Department has put some very aggressive goals as far as deploying new nuclear reactors here in the next couple of years. So there’s a bipartisan interest, as you said, so I don’t want to totally say this is going to be a political act that will come out of NRC because of the Trump administration. And Ho Nieh is someone who comes from industry and is seen as having respect. He got bipartisan votes out of the Senate. But yeah, definitely going to be watching what they do in the coming months as far as whether they play much of a role in the Trump administration’s nuclear agenda.

Bill Loveless (39:25): Well, of course, it is an election year. The midterms come up in November and raises the question of how much does the upcoming election cycle affect energy and climate policymaking these days? Maxine, I was just reading Frank Maisano, who we all know, I think at the law firm, very small in one of his weekly emails said, as 2026 unfolds energy policy is shaping up to be a defining fault line in the midterm elections, one that will influence how Republicans position themselves heading into the next presidential cycle. How does the election factor into these activities that we’ve been discussing in the Congress among the agencies, and I guess more importantly among voters across the country?

Maxine Joselow (40:18): Well, we see that poll after poll shows that climate change is not a top tier issue for voters, unfortunately for us climate reporters who it is a top tier issue for in our beats. But energy affordability as part of this broader theme of affordability that we’ve been talking about, I do think will be a big issue in the midterm elections and in those special elections that were held earlier last year for the Governor of Virginia and the Governor of New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill respectively did talk often on the campaign trail about energy and energy affordability, and they both won in those states. And Mikie Sherrill, I think even was talking about PJM and data centers and getting a bit wonky with it. So we’ll have to see how much of a concern it is among the many other concerns for voters right now, Venezuela, immigration, et cetera. The list goes on, but certainly I think both parties are going to be looking to use it as a wedge issue to their advantage.

Josh Siegel (41:23): Yeah, no, I think energy affordability will be a top tier issue in terms of electricity prices in a way we haven’t seen before. And it’s been interesting to see the Trump administration’s evolution on this because I think for a while we saw the president really trying to point voters’ attention to gasoline prices being really low, and how, as Maxine mentioned earlier in our conversation, that’s always the most visible thing to voters when it comes to energy prices and utility rates are utility bills are very hard to unpack. We haven’t really seen a huge political emphasis on it, but now, I mean, the Trump administration clearly is scrambling on it, and we see the president and his true social posts talking about data centers and wanting them to build their own generation announced playing up deals that we’re seeing in the tech space around that area. We saw the White House announcements around PJM that I covered last week, so clearly, and we’ve seen Chris Wright acknowledge that electricity prices, and this is an interview I had with him over the summer, are a vulnerability for them, and they’re the party in power. We know that the incumbent usually gets blamed for these kind of things, so we will have to see how it actually trickles down to house and Senate races, but it’s definitely going to be a top tier issue.

Bill Loveless (42:35): Josh, I saw a former colleague, Callie Patteson of The Examiner wrote the other day that Wright told her that he was willing to put his job on the line over electricity prices.

Josh Siegel (42:47): Yeah, no, I mean, he’s been really out there, but again, I think the Trump administration is hoping they could sort of make this argument that it’s the Biden administration’s fault, that it’s because of renewable energy. I mean, we’ve seen that Chris Wright refers to renewable energy as a parasite on the grid. I mean, he’s really consistent in his messaging saying that that’s what’s been driving up rates in a lot of states. But I mean, that’s just politically right. I mean, we haven’t seen great evidence that blaming a prior administration works out. I mean, the Biden administration faced this problem. They were blamed for inflation that a lot of it was not in their control. There was a result of COVID and returning back from that. But we’ll see if that pays off for them. But clearly that’s the strategy is to say there’s a problem, but it’s not our fault, and we’re trying to do what we can now to keep coal plants online to sper more oil and gas generation, but it might not pay off right away.

Bill Loveless (43:43): Well, we’ve covered a lot. And before we go, what I had like to talk a little bit about covering the beat, you’ve each been doing it for some time now and your experience matters. What do you find the hardest to explain to readers about energy and climate policy in Washington, Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (44:05): Well, one of my goals as a reporter is always to explain to readers how seemingly wonky, arcane policy decisions that get made in DC affect real people, affect their lives, their livelihoods, their pocketbooks. And that’s one of my biggest challenges. But I think one of my greatest opportunities in my reporting too, and when I report on the EPA, I always try to connect it back to what this change to the way they’re conducting cost benefit analysis means for the clean air that we all have come to take for granted when we breathe it as a result of steep reductions in air pollution from the Clean Air Act over the past half century. So that’s something I’m going to be trying to do over this next year, 2026, and hopefully going on more reporting trips and traveling across the country and not just staying chained to my desk in dc but actually getting out and talking to real people about how these moves are affecting them.

Bill Loveless(45:03): Josh?

Josh Siegel (45:04): Yeah, I think just covering this unfolding story around the White House’s attempt to ensure really one of the bright spots in the economy, the surge in construction of data centers devoted to AI and how they’re trying to ensure that isn’t overcome by the rising cost of energy and those two political imperatives, how they clash and just making sure we’re clear to readers on what’s actually behind rising prices, what role data centers are having or not having, could they actually help lower prices? There’s an argument and on that side as well. So just making sure we’re really covering it beyond the political rhetoric, which has been pretty aggressive as far as each side wanting to play the blame game already. So I think there’s a lot of complexity there and just want to, it’s a challenge to be honest as far as being clear about what we’re seeing and what we might see going forward, but we’re definitely trying to do our best on the energy team.

Bill Loveless (45:59): You sort of answered a question that I have in mind, but let me ask it anyway. Is there an energy, or a climate story that you think isn’t getting enough attention right now? Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (46:13): I don’t want to say that in front of Josh and have him steal it before I get to report it out, Bill, but that’s a good question. I don’t know. I think the energy and climate press corps here in DC is doing a great job, but there’s always room to cover more that isn’t necessarily part of the national conversation, but maybe there are local stories on climate and energy that it takes, to my earlier answer, getting out of DC to discover.

Josh Siegel (46:46): Yeah, I mean, I think there’s great coverage being done as far as state and local level. I’m really, as someone who covers permitting, it’s been interesting to see how state and local actions to restrict wind and solar developments or NIMBYism the new frontier on that has been interesting to see some backlash in areas that have openly supported renewable energy in the past, like Iowa, I did some reporting there, but would love to have more opportunity around that as midterms kick in and cover how more states are grappling with this need to build more, which is generally something Republicans want to do, but sort of NIMBYism and how we’re starting to see conservatives really push back on renewable development happening near them. So transmission’s long been a part of this conversation as well. So just continuing to cover that and how it’s actually trickling down at the state and local level. But again, there’s been really good reporting on that from others for sure.

Bill Loveless (47:39): Well, there’s a lot to cover there, and I didn’t mean to try to prompt you to scoop yourself in front of one of your competitors, but you’re both covering a lot of ground and there’s so much for us to keep track of in this year, 2026 in Washington, DC and the United States. So Maxine, Josh, thanks for joining us today on the Columbia Energy Exchange.

Maxine Joselow (48:01): Thank you so much.

EPA Administrator Zeldin at RSC Member Meeting

I hosted EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at this week's Republican Study Committee meeting, where he discussed his conservative vision for the Environmental Protection Agency, after years of Democrat weaponization of it under the Biden administration.

Administrator Zeldin outlined his plan to return the EPA to its core mission of environmental protection while removing burdensome regulations that have driven up costs for families and small businesses. By refocusing the agency on its original purpose, we can protect our natural resources without stifling American innovation and economic growth. It was a productive discussion about how we can achieve common-sense environmental policies that work for everyone.

Mystic Alerts Act Advanced Out of Subcommittee

I am proud that my bipartisan legislation, the Mystic Alerts Act, was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee this week. Since the devastating floods of July 4th, I have been advocating for the strengthening of emergency alert systems, especially in rural or remote areas.

No family should miss a life-saving warning simply because infrastructure went down or service is unavailable. The Mystic Alerts Act is a critical step toward closing the digital divide and strengthening public safety communications. Watch my full remarks in support of the legislation here.

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller in Washington

I had a great time meeting with Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller this week. Texas-11 is home to countless hardworking farmers and ranchers who are the backbone of our state's economy and feed families across America. I'm committed to fighting for our agricultural communities in Congress—cutting burdensome regulations, protecting property rights, and ensuring our producers have the resources they need to thrive. Always great to have a fellow Texan in D.C. Thank you for stopping by my office!

Questioning FCC Chairman Carr and Commissioners

This week, I questioned Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr and Commissioner Olivia Trusty about the monumental wins Republicans delivered to the American people through the Working Families Tax Cut Act, which will support the long-term economic and national security of the United States.

During the hearing, I also highlighted my work on countering the Chinese Communist Party’s influence at the 2027 World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-27) and asked how the FCC is preparing to spearhead these efforts. Additionally, I questioned FCC Chairman Carr on how the FCC is safeguarding public interest and trust in broadcast licensing. Watch my full line of questioning here or by clicking the image below.

Sounding the Alarm on Grid Security

During a House Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee legislative hearing this week, I asked a Department of Energy (DOE) witness for his insight into the growing cyber and supply-chain risks facing U.S. energy infrastructure and what DOE is doing to address them.

With cyber and physical threats evolving quickly, we must zero in on a major vulnerability: foreign-manufactured equipment being embedded in the U.S. supply chain and its risk to the electric grid.

In my questioning, I also referenced a recent report that indicated certain Chinese-manufactured solar and battery inverters used in the U.S. grid contained undisclosed communication devices, warning that these technologies could threaten our grid security and serve as backdoors into critical American infrastructure.

Chris Brown Chris Brown is the Northern District Public Service Commissioner.","Below is an opinion column by Chris Brown:

Northern PSC Commissioner Chris Brown says nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it.

America’s economy is entering a new phase: one that requires enormous amounts of reliable electricity. Artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, military installations, and modern infrastructure all depend on power that is available every hour of every day, no matter the weather.

That reality matters deeply in Mississippi, where families, businesses, hospitals, and military facilities cannot afford rolling outages or skyrocketing power bills. If the United States wants to remain economically competitive and nationally secure, we must be honest about what works, and accelerate investment in advanced nuclear energy.

Much of today’s energy debate focuses on the falling cost of renewable power, especially solar. That progress is real and useful. But it often ignores a critical distinction: cheap power on paper is not the same as dependable power in the real world.

Solar energy can be inexpensive when the sun is shining. But electricity demand does not stop at night, during storms, or during prolonged cloudy periods. To deliver round-the-clock power, solar must be paired with massive battery systems. Those batteries are expensive, wear out over time, and must be replaced regularly. Once those costs are included, the price of “dispatchable” solar power rises sharply.

Once you require dispatchable, 24/7 power, the economics flip.

Cost per kWh (firm power):

• Advanced Nuclear: $0.06–$0.10

• Solar + 4h batteries: $0.09–$0.13 (still not fully reliable)

• Solar + 24h batteries: $0.20–$0.35

• Hardened solar (multi-day): $0.40–$0.80+

Dispatchable solar costs 2–8× more per kWh.

When measured fairly, comparing only power that is available on demand, the difference becomes clear. Advanced nuclear energy can produce electricity for roughly six to ten cents per kilowatt-hour, with plants operating more than 90 percent of the time and lasting for decades. By contrast, solar paired with enough storage to provide continuous power often costs two to four times more, and systems designed to handle multi-day outages can cost even more.

This is not a political issue. It is a matter of physics and engineering. Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel. Solar energy must be generated when conditions allow and stored externally in batteries that require large amounts of land, minerals, and ongoing replacement.

Reliability matters more than ever as electricity demand grows. Data centers, manufacturing plants, military installations, and critical infrastructure cannot simply power down when conditions are unfavorable. A grid built primarily on intermittent generation like solar and wind becomes more fragile, not more resilient, without firm power sources to anchor it.

Advanced nuclear reactors are designed for exactly this challenge. Modern designs rely on passive safety systems, simplified construction, smaller footprints, and decades of operational experience. Unlike other technologies, nuclear power becomes more economical as it runs longer, without requiring massive new infrastructure, and only small amounts of additional fuel.

Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset. Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence. Russia and China understand this clearly and are investing heavily to dominate the next generation of nuclear power. The United States cannot afford to fall behind, or worse, outsource its energy future while competitors lock in theirs.

Nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it. Rather than continuing to funnel billions of dollars into subsidized solar projects that depend on weather and constant backup, America should focus on technologies that deliver reliable power, strengthen national security, protect ratepayers, and secure long-term leadership. When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.

Electricity generation by the U.S. electric power sector totaled about 4,260 billion kilowatthours (BkWh) in 2025. In our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we expect U.S. electricity generation will grow by 1.1% in 2026 and by 2.6% in 2027, when it reaches an annual total of 4,423 BkWh. The three main dispatchable sources of electricity generation (natural gas, coal, and nuclear) accounted for 75% of total generation in 2025, but we expect the share of generation from these sources will fall to about 72% in 2027. We expect the combined share of generation from solar power and wind power to rise from about 18% in 2025 to about 21% in 2027.

In our STEO forecast, utility-scale solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the United States, increasing from 290 BkWh in 2025 to 424 BkWh by 2027. Almost 70 gigawatts (GW) of new solar generating capacity projects are scheduled to come online in 2026 and 2027, which represents a 49% increase in U.S. solar operating capacity compared with the end of 2025.

Much of the utility-scale solar generation capacity additions will come online in Texas. We expect that solar electricity generation supplied to the grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) will grow from 56 BkWh in 2025 to 106 BkWh by 2027. Increasing amounts of battery storage capacity help to support the fluctuations in solar output during the day. The electric power sector plans to expand battery capacity in ERCOT from about 15 GW in 2025 to 37 GW by the end of 2027.

Wind generation has been traditionally concentrated in the central part of the country, such as in the grid operated in the Midwest by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). However, additions of new wind generating capacity have slowed in MISO, and we expect little growth in MISO wind generation through 2027, averaging just over 100 BkWh annually. New solar plant projects are also starting up in MISO. We expect MISO solar generation to grow from 31 BkWh in 2025 to 46 BkWh in 2027.

Natural gas is the largest source of electricity in the United States; however, its contribution to total generation has been declining from a peak share of 42% in 2024. In our forecast, U.S. natural gas-fired generation totals 1,696 BkWh in 2026, about the same as in 2025, and then increases to 1,711 BkWh in 2027 as overall power demand increases. The increase in natural gas-fired generation is slower than the overall increase in total U.S. generation, and so natural gas’s share of total power generation falls to 39% in 2027 compared to 40% in 2025.

Natural gas-fired generation increases 23% in ERCOT between 2025 and 2027 and 5% in the Mid-Atlantic area of the country where the grid is managed by PJM Interconnection. The regional growth in natural gas-fired generation responds partly to the growing electricity demand from data centers.

U.S. generation fueled by coal increased by 13% in 2025 to 731 BkWh due to cold temperatures in some regions and because of relatively higher natural gas prices. With existing policies and scheduled retirements planned by plant operators, we expect that coal plant retirements will lead to U.S. coal-fired generation declining an average of 5% annually over the next two years, producing 661 BkWh in 2027. The share of coal in power generation would fall to 15% in 2027 from 17% in 2025.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-solar-electricity-growth-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 13:59:57.980081

Together with the 5MW solar plant completed in 2023, Kennecott now has 30MW of solar capacity—enough to power approximately 1,026 average American homes annually and reduce Kennecott’s Scope 2 emissions by about 6% (20,000 tonnes CO₂e). This is equivalent to removing 4,400 cars from the road each year.

Construction of the 25MW plant began in October 2024 in partnership with Bechtel, was completed and commissioned in October last year, and energized in December. The new solar array includes over 71,000 panels, containing tellurium produced at Kennecott, a critical mineral for solar technology.

Kennecott began producing tellurium in 2022 as a byproduct of copper refining, making it one of only two U.S. producers of this critical mineral. Tellurium from Kennecott is converted into thin-film semiconductor materials by 5N Plus Inc. in Canada and then supplied primarily to First Solar for the manufacturing of the photovoltaic panels now installed at Kennecott, keeping the entire tellurium supply chain in North America.

Nate Foster, Managing Director of Rio Tinto Kennecott, said: “This new solar plant is more than a source of renewable power for our operations; it’s a demonstration of circularity and supply chain resilience. By mining copper and tellurium, both classified as critical minerals in the United States, here at Kennecott and using that tellurium in the panels powering our site, we’re proving how domestic critical minerals support renewable energy manufacturing. This approach strengthens North America’s supply chain for essential resources, supports national energy security, and reinforces our commitment to a low-carbon future.”

Scott Austin, General Manager of Renewables & Clean Power at Bechtel, said: “Working closely with Rio Tinto, Bechtel is proud to have delivered this project two months ahead of schedule while supporting 200 local jobs, helping bring renewable energy to the mine. We look forward to future projects together.”

Gervais Jacques, Chief Executive Officer of 5N Plus, said: “Our partnership with Rio Tinto helps deliver industry-leading products that support the clean energy transition and advance national energy security. At a time when the security of critical minerals supply chains is under intense scrutiny, we’re pleased to reinforce our position as a trusted partner to deliver the advanced materials this critical and growing sector depends on.”

Note to editors

Copper and tellurium are both classified as critical minerals in the United States, underscoring their importance to clean energy technologies and national supply chain security. Kennecott produces both minerals and operates one of only two copper smelters in the U.S., reinforcing its role as a strategic supplier for the energy transition. Kennecott is also one of only two U.S. producers of tellurium, a key component in photovoltaic solar panels, further strengthening its contribution to domestic renewable energy manufacturing.

The milestone cements the Golden State’s position as the undisputed national leader in clean transportation and proves that consumer demand for EVs remains strong despite federal headwinds.

“No state in the union can match California’s five-year growth in ZEV sales,” said California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “This serves as a reminder of how far we’ve come thanks to historic levels of state investment and Californians’ strong demand for clean cars. Each quarter, even in the face of increasing federal headwinds, tens of thousands of consumers are purchasing a ZEV in the Golden State, enjoying a great driving experience, and knowing they never have to go to a gas station again.”

This remarkable growth has also driven the state’s commitment to building a robust ZEV infrastructure network.

“While the federal government reversed and put up roadblocks, the global zero-emission vehicle market surged ahead last year,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez. “Governor Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message: California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack. It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”

ZEV market demonstrates resilience despite federal policy reversal

During the fourth quarter of 2025, Californians purchased 79,066 new ZEVs, representing 18.9% of new car sales—even after federal tax credits expired on September 30. Ahead of that expiration, sales surged in the third quarter of 2025—accounting for 29.1% of new car sales—likely softening sales in the fourth quarter as a result. While the loss of federal support triggered a nationwide decline in EV sales nationwide—from 10.5% in Q3 to 5.8% in Q4, according to Cox Automotive—California’s market proved far more resilient.

This resilience reflects a market turning point. After decades of strategic state investment in charging infrastructure, consumer incentives, and manufacturer standards, California has built a strong, mature, resilient ZEV ecosystem grounded in policy certainty and sustained investment. Consumers are buying electric vehicles in part because the technology works, the vehicles perform, and the charging infrastructure continues to grow rapidly.

Despite the setbacks from the federal government, sales were still strong in Q4. With 149 ZEV models available in California in Q4 of 2025, consumers are buoyed by the diversity in the ZEV market. Not only do ZEVs produce zero tailpipe pollution, but they are also fun and powerful to drive, and cost less to operate and maintain compared to gas-powered vehicles. Find the right vehicle for you at ElectricForAll.org.

California doubles down on clean transportation investments

California is doubling down on its clean transportation leadership. In his January 9 budget, Governor Newsom proposed a new $200 million incentive program to accelerate ZEV adoption and respond to the loss of the federal ZEV tax credit, while supporting American automotive innovation at a critical moment—just as the Trump administration has abandoned the good-paying jobs of this global market. Less than a year in office, Donald Trump has driven away the United States’ second-largest trading partner, pushing Canada toward deeper economic ties with China while surrendering America’s leadership in electric vehicle manufacturing.

Competing to win the future requires investing in clean energy technologies, strengthening partnerships with allies like Canada, and reducing dependence on China in critical sectors.

Instead, the Trump administration repealed key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and imposed broad tariffs that have raised costs for American consumers while straining relationships with close allies. Despite Donald Trump’s efforts to cede the clean energy economy to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.

The Golden State’s commitment extends beyond consumer incentives. In the latest Clean Transportation Program Investment Plan Update, the CEC allocated $98.5 million in light-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) infrastructure funding for fiscal year 2025-2026 to focus on Level 1 and Level 2 charging in locations with longer vehicle dwell times, including at-home charging with a specific focus on multifamily residences.

The CEC is also continuing to study infrastructure needs across the state, with the following planned for release later this year:

New and ongoing ZEV infrastructure funding opportunities driven by the $98.5 million investment from the Clean Transportation Program.

The third Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Assessment, as mandated by Assembly Bill (AB) 2127, which will assess California’s EV infrastructure needs to meet demand.

The next Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Assessment, as mandated by SB 1000, to assess whether charging infrastructure is disproportionately deployed.

The gold standard for American EV infrastructure

California is tearing down barriers to ZEV deployment, speeding up EV charging station installations, and deploying infrastructure in hard-to-reach and low-income areas.

Becoming an EV driver in California is increasingly getting easier. There are now over 200,000 public and shared EV charging stations statewide. EV chargers can be found at grocery stores, park-and-ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared EV chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared private chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in California homes.

California’s climate leadership in action

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 — even as the state’s GDP increased 81% in that same time period, all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

California also continues to set clean energy records. In 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve this level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day last year.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/At-World-Economic-Forum-Governor-Newsom-announces-California-shattered-clean-car-goal-surpassing-2.5M-ZEV-sales-despite-Trumps-chaos-SEO-GFX-v2.png,N,,2026-01-20 13:59:34.061769

Texas’ grid operator is developing a new process to evaluate multiple large-load interconnection requests at the same time. The question for cryptocurrency miners and data center developers that are already in line is: who gets to go first?

That should hopefully be sorted out by month’s end. That’s when the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) hopes to have criteria announced for which energy-intensive projects could be considered for “Batch Zero,” the first group to go through ERCOT’s revised planning process.

At a Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) meeting on Thursday, Jeff Billo, ERCOT’s vice president of interconnection and grid analysis, said that for “Batch Zero,” the grid operator will consider proposed large load interconnection requests from projects that have been in the queue for some time and don’t need to be restudied. Projects that are less far along will be studied in a later batch, Billo said.

These requests primarily come from data centers, crypto mines, industrial sites and hydrogen projects. Billo also said that just because some existing projects in ERCOT’s queue might warrant another transmission study doesn’t mean they couldn’t still be considered for “Batch Zero.”

“There are a lot of details to fill out there,” Billo said. “We are still really early in the process of designing how that batch study would work.”

The timing of a transmission study matters greatly for companies with billions of dollars at stake in developments requiring grid connection. PUC Chairman Thomas Gleeson said one of the largest points of contention among data center developers has been uncertainty about where their projects stand, despite some having been in the queue for years. Gleeson said it’s important not to leave these companies in limbo while ERCOT sorts out its new procedures for reviewing multiple requests from large energy users together and allocating existing transmission capacity among them. ERCOT previously studied large load users one at a time.

“Transparency around this is going to be critically important to ensuring success,” the chairman said.

The planning around “Batch Zero” comes as ERCOT is well into reforming its transmission planning procedures. With the increasing number of large loads seeking to connect to the grid, ERCOT and utilities cannot keep up with the required transmission planning and end issuing restudies.

The current system, built for a large load queue totalling 40 to 50 projects, is now bogged down by the 225 new interconnection requests ERCOT received last year, according to a December report.

Under its previous planning process, by the time one data center finished planning studies, the results would often have to be reconsidered almost immediately, as more projects joined the interconnection queue and changed the local transmission needs and reliability.

The consensus from early conversations with corporate stakeholders, including Google, Meta, CenterPoint, Amazon and OpenAI—all looking for grid capacity in Texas—was that the uncertainty in the current process creates undue risk for developers with existing interconnection requests.

The proposed batch method aims to ameliorate that.

The outcome of the new process would determine the number of megawatts that Texas’ independent grid could reliably deliver and the additional transmission projects needed to enable full interconnection.

If a developer requested a 500-megawatt project be interconnected in 2028, but the batch study showed that ERCOT could only reliably provide 100 megawatts and would need to undergo a transmission upgrade project in 2030, the developer would be offered an “on-ramp” of 100 megawatts until the transmission upgrade is completed in 2030, Billo said as an example. Then, the developer would receive the full 500 megawatts of grid power.

At the end of the batch study process, developers would have a set amount of time to make a financial commitment, Billo said, to demonstrate they will proceed with the project. After that, ERCOT could begin a transmission project to cover “firm” commitments, which could then be utilized in other batch studies.

The initial sentiment from “hyperscale” data center users like Google, Amazon Web Services, Meta and Microsoft, developers and independent power generators is that a batch-based approach is necessary for large load interconnection, Billo said. “Everyone that we have talked to so far has been supportive of us moving to a batch study process,” Billo said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FT-Template-8.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:41.171455

The funding will help build early-stage enterprises and value chains needed to bring continuous living cover (CLC) crops and cropping systems to commercial scale.

Funding was provided to the MDA by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency under its Minnesota Climate-Smart Food Systems initiative, supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Continuous living cover is one of the most promising strategies we have for building a more resilient agricultural future in Minnesota,” said MDA Commissioner Thom Petersen. “These investments will help farmers, entrepreneurs, and supply‑chain partners bring innovative crops and systems to market, strengthening rural economies while protecting our soil, water, and climate. Minnesota is proud to support the early‑stage work that turns good ideas into real‑world solutions.”

Continuous living cover refers to agricultural systems that maintain living plants and roots in soil year-round. These systems include winter cover crops sown between summer annuals, agroforestry practices, perennial forage crops, perennial biomass crops, and perennial grain production. Examples include regenerative poultry silvopasture systems, Kernza® perennial grain, winter camelina, and elderberry.

CLC crops have been shown to improve water and soil quality, sequester carbon, build soil health, and enhance biodiversity and pollinator habitat. Scaling these benefits requires strong markets and supply chains that support farmers, processors, and end-users.

Delivered through the Employment Advancement Right Now (EARN) Maryland program, the funding will help more than 100 employers connect more than 750 Marylanders to occupational training, industry-recognized credentials, and supportive services.

“You can't have a competitive state without a growing economy, and you can’t have a growing economy without a clear economic strategy,” said Gov. Moore. “Through EARN Maryland, we are aligning government, business, and workers around a shared goal: preparing more Marylanders for the in-demand jobs of today and tomorrow while strengthening our state’s long-term economic competitiveness.”

EARN Maryland is the state’s nationally recognized, industry-led workforce program that brings together employers, training providers, and community organizations to design training that leads directly to employment or career advancement. Known for its strong return on investment, EARN Maryland generates an estimated $19 of economic impact for every $1 of state funding invested.

Under the Moore-Miller Administration, nearly 4,000 Marylanders have been placed into employment through EARN Maryland. The program has also upskilled more than 5,800 incumbent workers, helping an estimated 1,700 businesses train or upskill valued talent.

“Maryland businesses are upskilling their workers to meet evolving industry needs and creating more opportunities for Marylanders to advance into in-demand careers,” said Maryland Department of Labor Secretary Portia Wu. “By investing in these employer-driven efforts through EARN Maryland, we’re investing in workers, strengthening businesses, and helping to grow and diversify our economy.”

The additional investment announced today advances the Moore-Miller Administration’s all-of-government approach to boosting economic mobility and combating childhood poverty. Two-thirds of awardees will target jobseeker outreach to ENOUGH communities and nearly 40 percent will seek to enroll individuals receiving SNAP benefits into training programs. The ENOUGH Initiative is the Moore-Miller Administration's comprehensive strategy to reduce child poverty and increase economic mobility through coordinated investments in communities with high concentrated levels of poverty.

“EARN Maryland is a proven strategy to increase economic mobility in Maryland, and this expansion to serve ENOUGH communities will maximize its impact,” said Governor’s Office for Children Special Secretary Carmel Martin. “For Maryland’s workforce to thrive, every community needs strong pathways to careers. The Moore-Miller Administration’s all-of-government approach is ensuring the State’s investments are directed where they are needed most.”

“New federal laws place unprecedented obstacles between Marylanders and their SNAP benefits,” said Maryland Department of Human Services Secretary Rafael López. “EARN grants will not only fuel Maryland’s workforce and extend opportunity across our state, but will help families overcome federal red tape and maintain access to vital benefits to put healthy food on the table.”

The Ford CEO has positioned the 121-year-old automaker at the forefront of America's EV revolution, reshaping a company that once democratised the automobile through the assembly line into one that could help define the electric future of mobility.

Ford's iconic status in American manufacturing traces back to 1903, when it made cars accessible to the masses through assembly line production and a locally-based dealer-franchise system. This legacy now serves as the foundation for Jim's Ford+ strategy, which centres on transitioning the company into a leaner, technology-driven and electric-focused automaker.

In partnership with Statista, TIME conducted a survey of US residents to rank the 250 American companies that have shaped culture and society. Ford came out on top, with TIME saying: ""Ford transformed the manufacturing process and also transportation for the average American, reshaping the development of cities and suburbs.""

Today, the company recognises it is in the position to ""redefine the future of mobility in the country"" through electrification.

According to TIME, Bill Ford, Ford's Executive Chairman, says: ""Just as my great-grandfather put the world on wheels to give people the freedom of movement, our approach to the modern era is rooted in that same spirit. Innovation is not just about building batteries or technology for its own sake; it is about making people's lives better.

""We are leveraging our position as the largest hourly auto employer in the US to ensure that the future of transportation is built by American workers for everyday American families.""

Restructuring for electric acceleration

Jim restructured Ford in 2022 into distinct units to accelerate the company's electric vehicle ambitions.

The creation of Ford Model e as a dedicated EV division, separated from Ford Blue for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, and Ford Pro for commercial services, enabled the automaker to sharpen its focus on the EV market. This strategic separation could allow Ford to compete more effectively in the rapidly evolving electric landscape.

Amid recent softening demand for EVs, Jim has moved towards a broader electric and electrified mix that includes hybrids, extended-range EVs and smaller, more affordable electric models to compete with Chinese automakers, particularly with the rising success of BYD.

Speaking on an episode of the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast in November 2024, Jim said that he was struck by a ""shocking"" discovery when digging into competitors' vehicles, encouraging him to take action that would allow the automaker to compete with Tesla and the rapidly evolving Chinese EV market.

He says that he knew diving into EV innovation was going to be ""brutal business-wise"", adding: ""My ethos is, take on the hardest problems as fast as you can and do it in public because you'll solve them quicker that way.""

While EV sales jumped in the US in the first quarter of 2025, Jim said in Ford's third-quarter earnings call in October 2024 that EVs will only make up 5% of the US car market in the near term.

Building the electric workforce

As part of Ford+, Jim is heavily investing in new talent, particularly from Silicon Valley, to shift the company culture toward software, connectivity and data-driven capabilities essential for electric vehicle development.

Ford and Carhartt, two Detroit-born companies, have formalised a long-standing relationship through a new multi-year strategic partnership focused on strengthening the ""Essential Economy"", announced at the Detroit Auto Show by Jim and by Linda Hubbard, CEO of Carhartt.

The collaboration focuses on workforce development, training the next generation of skilled tradespeople for the electric era, community building and durable products.

Discussing the partnership on LinkedIn, Jim says: ""Ford and Carhartt have been working together on job sites for 100 years, now we're excited to step into a new partnership that makes sure America's workers have the best equipment and gear they can get.""

This commitment to the American workforce could cement Ford's role in leading the nation's electric vehicle transition.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/388e939b6e37793f5f718ac60c27b174:5b79a7e99dc51ec07fdacf469fcbe752/blue-oval-city-jim-farley-10.JPG.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:01:20.759731

Former Governor Roy Cooper holds a durable 5-point lead over Michael Whatley for U.S. Senate

North Carolina voters remain closely divided on downballot elections

Voters support independent redistricting – unless it might cost their side

As America barrels into a turbulent election year, North Carolina voters are on track for another closely contested, yet potentially pivotal, election year. The January edition of the Carolina Forward Poll finds North Carolina’s voters once again narrowly divided not only about candidates for office, but about the future direction of the state and nation.

Will Roy Cooper break the streak?

North Carolina’s Democrats have not won a statewide federal election in 18 years. Ever since former President Barack Obama and the late Senator Kay Hagan’s wins in 2008, Republicans have won every statewide election since for U.S. Senate and the Presidency. This continues a long tradition of partisan ticket-splitting between state-level and federal races in North Carolina that reaches all the way back into the 1970s.

Yet it appears that former Governor Roy Cooper could very well break that losing streak in 2026. Roy Cooper holds a 5-point lead over his presumptive Republican opponent, Michael Whatley.

This represents a slight dip since the September Carolina Forward Poll, where Cooper held a 7-point lead. Yet that slight narrowing appears mainly attributable to consolidation among Republican voters. The poll shows that former Governor Cooper is gaining among Independent voters. Unless we see a significant reversal, Cooper remains the favorite to be the first Democratic candidate to win a statewide federal race since 2008.

Michael Whatley remains the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate. Even after months of campaigning by candidate Don Brown and a splashy entrance by the ever-peculiar Michele Morrow, neither candidate has managed to crack double digits among Republican primary voters. Even though Whatley himself has still not won over a majority of Republican primary voters, neither of his declared rivals appears to be a legitimate challenge. As the Republican establishment’s preferred option, Michael Whatley will almost assuredly be the Republican candidate in November.

Turning to the North Carolina State legislature, the generic ballot has tightened. Voters are equally split about whether they’d pick the Republican or Democratic candidate for their representative in Raleigh:

Similarly to the U.S. Senate ballot, this tightening mostly reflects consolidation among Republican voters and some movement among Democrats within the margin of error. This poll shows a 17-point net swing towards Democrats among Independent voters since the September poll.

One of the highest-profile races in North Carolina this year will be for the state’s Supreme Court. Democratic incumbent Justice Anita Earls is defending her seat against Republican State House Representative Sarah Stevens. The poll shows the two effectively tied, with Stevens holding a 1-point lead over Earls.

The breakdowns in support are almost identical to the generic ballot, suggesting that the Supreme Court race is still very low-visibility. Most voters have not heard much, or anything, about it.

One of the biggest developments across the United States in the Trump era has been aggressive, militarized anti-immigration crackdowns. Back in November, North Carolina itself saw this close up with ICE’s “Operation Charlotte’s Web” exercise, which focused but was not limited to Charlotte and Raleigh metro areas. In the January poll, we asked voters to indicate their view on the operation. A clear majority was negative, with a plurality saying they thought the ICE crackdown mistreated people and targeted people for their skin color.

As expected, responses to this question are highly polarized by partisanship, with independents strongly siding with Democrats.

One interesting observation about this question is that it references events – “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – that occurred some time ago, just before the holidays. The ICE crackdown mostly concluded before Thanksgiving in November 2025. Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s passed in the intervening 6 weeks before that conclusion and the fielding of this poll on January 5th. Despite that distance, the crackdown retains strong recall and resonance with voters, with only a very small proportion saying they “don’t know enough” about it. Most of that recall is distinctly negative.

(This poll was also out of the field when Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agents in Minneapolis on January 7th.)

Independent redistricting for me – but not for thee

This poll took a new twist on the long tradition of polling North Carolina voters about their appetite for independent redistricting.

For years, polls from different ideological points of view have found that North Carolina voters broadly support the idea of an independent redistricting system which would end partisan gerrymandering. But in this survey, we took the investigation one step further: would partisan voters still support independent redistricting, if their opponents could conceivably benefit? It turns out that many of them would not.

First, voters were asked if they would support a system of independent redistricting. Then, as a follow-up, self-identified Republican respondents were separately informed that “some experts believed” that such a system could benefit Democrats, while self-identified Democratic respondents were told the opposite. This additional piece of information significantly changed responses.

When informed that a system of independent redistricting could result in more Democratic representation, Republican support flips from +19 net support to -46 net opposition – a head-spinning 65-point swing.

Democratic voters, when informed that a system of independent redistricting could result in more Republican representation, flip from +35 net support to -17 net opposition – a similarly dizzying 52-point swing.

While Democrats appear to be modestly less so, both party bases appear to be much more strongly influenced by partisan gain than principle when it comes to ending gerrymandering in North Carolina. To successfully end partisan gerrymandering as Democratic lawmakers in Virginia did in 2019, or as voters in Michigan secured, lawmakers of either party would need ironclad principle to resist the demands of some of their base for partisan vengeance.

The grid is warning Pennsylvania

RealClearPennsylvania

Pennsylvania faces a severe energy crisis as the PJM Interconnection grid reports a large capacity shortfall, threatening power for millions of homes. This deficit, underscored by record auction prices, reflects a failure to build new generation infrastructure amidst rising demand and regulatory hurdles. Coterra’s Bill desRosiers argues that Pennsylvania must leverage its vast natural gas reserves to secure the grid’s future. The article promotes Senate Bill 1106, which utilizes tax credits to incentivize private investment in baseload power. By aligning public goals with private capital, Pennsylvania can ensure energy reliability and affordability while reclaiming its position as a strategic energy leader. [MDN: Our buddy Bill desRosiers is spot on with this article. Only if PA rapidly builds more gas-fired power can it deliver on the promise of Senator McCormick’s $92 billion of promised AI data center investments. The time is now! Don’t blow it, PA!!]

Valero to cut 200+ jobs as California refinery closes

Bloomberg/Rigzone

Valero Energy Corp. is permanently closing its Benicia refinery, leading to the layoff of 237 non-union employees between March 15 and July 1. Representing the bulk of the facility’s staff, these job cuts follow a 2025 announcement that persisted despite unsuccessful intervention attempts by Governor Gavin Newsom and local officials. This closure contributes to California’s dwindling fuel supply and high gasoline prices as more refineries shutter or pivot to biofuels. However, Newsom noted that Valero will maintain its presence by importing fuel to the region, avoiding a complete exit and helping to stabilize the state’s energy needs. [MDN: This is directly due to the policies of Gov. Gruesome Newsom. Facilities closing, jobs eliminated, and less gasoline meaning not only are the jobs gone, but the price of gas is higher in the “Golden” State. Way to go, Gruesome! What a putz.]

Pipeline construction reaches an 18-year high on natural gas demand

Midland (TX) Reporter-Telegram

The United States is entering its most significant natural gas pipeline boom in nearly two decades, with a massive expansion projected for 2026. Approximately 12 projects across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma will increase the region’s shipping capacity by 13%, adding roughly 18 billion cubic feet per day. This surge, the largest since 2008, is primarily driven by soaring global demand for liquefied natural gas exports destined for Europe and Asia. New infrastructure, such as Enbridge’s Rio Bravo and Energy Transfer’s Hugh Brinson pipelines, will provide critical relief for Permian Basin drillers currently facing negative prices due to pipeline congestion. [MDN: This is great for Texas and the southwest, but not so great for the M-U as it means more gas from down there will compete with our gas for LNG exports. American itself wins in the end.]

Michigan to study white hydrogen’s potential

RBN Energy

Governor Gretchen Whitmer has established the Michigan Geologic Hydrogen Exploration and Preparedness Initiative to evaluate the state’s potential for “white” or naturally occurring hydrogen. This initiative aims to decarbonize high-pollution sectors like manufacturing and maritime shipping. An executive order mandates a report by April 1 to assess infrastructure, regulatory readiness, and the feasibility of repurposing existing oil and gas wells. While a 2025 U.S. Geological Survey map identifies Michigan as a high-prospectivity region for these deposits, established extraction strategies are currently lacking. Michigan’s proactive approach seeks to leverage this clean energy resource to bolster its economic and environmental future. [MDN: Again we make this point…it doesn’t matter how the hydrogen is produced, it could come from magical sources like unicorn farts…the issue is, Where are the customers for it? If you don’t have people who want to buy and use it, it’s senseless to find new sources or ways of producing it!]

U.S. natural gas slips ahead of long weekend

Wall Street Journal

U.S. natural gas futures for February delivery settled 0.8% lower at $3.103/mmBtu, marking a 2.1% loss for the week as the market headed into the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. Despite colder weather forecasts for late January, prices failed to rally—a rare decoupling of weather trends and market performance that NatGasWeather.com attributes to significant inventory surpluses, robust production levels, and a recent pullback in LNG feedgas flows. [MDN: Bummer. Let’s hope the price doesn’t continue this downward trend. We NEED to keep it above $3.]

EIA inventory report weighs on futures despite cold forecast

FX Empire

Natural gas futures are facing downward pressure as high inventory levels continue to outweigh the impact of incoming cold weather. Despite forecasts predicting below-normal temperatures across the northern and eastern United States through late January, the market remains in a bearish “sell the rally” mode. Recent Energy Information Administration (EIA) data revealed that natural gas stockpiles are 3.4% above the five-year seasonal average, signaling a significant supply surplus. Prices recently settled near $3.10, with technical analysis suggesting a sustained downtrend unless a solid support base forms near the $3.00 level to absorb the ample supply.

How to add 300 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2050

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)

President Trump’s executive orders aim to spark a nuclear renaissance by adding 300 gigawatts of capacity, viewing nuclear energy as a superior alternative to wind and solar. While Westinghouse plans new AP1000 reactors, Canadian firm AtkinsRéalis is seeking U.S. licensing for its CANDU technology to help meet these ambitious goals. Unlike traditional designs, CANDU reactors use natural uranium, can be refueled during operation, and produce vital medical isotopes. Despite past regulatory hurdles and cost overruns, this cross-border collaboration and focus on large-scale reactors are presented as the primary pathway to doubling America’s energy capacity and achieving long-term energy reliability. [MDN: Maybe there is something worthwhile north of the border besides hockey. Who knew?! We’re all for expanding nuclear energy.]

Should data center companies learn from the fracking boom?

Time Magazine/AOL

To address growing community backlash over massive energy and water consumption, data center companies are adopting strategies from the fracking industry’s playbook. Microsoft’s Brad Smith recently proposed a “social contract” to build local trust, promising that data centers will pay higher electricity rates to shield residents from price hikes. Tech firms also plan to fund community infrastructure—such as schools, hospitals, and parks—while prioritizing local hiring. Advised by the American Petroleum Institute to avoid the negative reputation of hydraulic fracturing, the industry is shifting toward proactive engagement to prove their benefits outweigh the costs through long-term trust and tangible investments. [MDN: Smart move. It’s time to get ahead of anti-frackers-turned-anti-data-center lefties now, while we still can.]

Top 6 American energy trends to watch in 2026

Forbes

In 2026, U.S. energy policy is pivoting toward fossil fuels and nuclear power to bolster national security and support the booming AI sector. Expanding data centers are creating massive electricity demand, straining the grid and prompting regionalized governance. Private capital is increasingly funding small modular reactors to overcome regulatory hurdles and meet energy needs. Geopolitically, potential oil production increases from Venezuela and Iran may contain global prices. Ultimately, the administration is prioritizing domestic production and supply chain resiliency over climate-focused subsidies, treating energy infrastructure as a core strategic asset to maintain a competitive edge against China. [MDN: In other words, common sense is now the governing philosophy of the land under Trump. And it can’t happen soon enough.]

Trump sends a geothermal love letter to coal, oil, and natural gas

CleanTechnica

The Trump administration is championing geothermal energy as a reliable, 24/7 baseload power source, granting it special status alongside fossil fuels and nuclear energy. While traditional renewables like wind and solar are excluded from this preference, geothermal benefits from advanced drilling technologies borrowed from the oil and gas sector. Initiatives like the 13-state Geothermal Power Accelerator and expedited permitting for projects in Nevada highlight this support. Although intended to complement domestic energy, geothermal’s expansion into power generation and HVAC systems poses a long-term threat to coal, natural gas, and oil by offering a clean, constant alternative. [MDN: What the lefties of CleanTechnica get wrong is that geothermal doesn’t “threaten” oil and natural gas. It uses the VERY SAME drilling techniques used by the shale industry. It employs the same companies the shale industry uses. It’s complementary, not competitive. And it exposes the LIE that drilling (and fracking) are somehow environmentally damaging, because it the environment is damaged when drilling for O&G, why isn’t it damaged when the VERY SAME methods are used for geothermal?]

INTERNATIONAL

Crude settles higher after volatile week

Bloomberg/Rigzone

Oil prices stabilized near $60 a barrel following a volatile week, rebounding slightly after a sharp 4.6% plunge. While President Trump’s softened rhetoric toward Iran reduced immediate fears of supply disruptions, a continued U.S. military buildup in the Middle East maintains a lingering risk premium. Additional support came from export issues in Kazakhstan and the North Sea, even as low prices forced Continental Resources to halt drilling in North Dakota. As U.S.-Ukraine talks loom as a potential bearish factor, strategists warn that prolonged price suppression may discourage essential industry investment, threatening future production and economic stability.

You could soon buy a BYD electric car in Canada under a new trade agreement between the nation and China that was announced on Friday, Jan. 16.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into its market, with the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Carney's office said the amount of Chinese EVs it plans to allow to be sold in Canada ""corresponds to volumes in the year prior to recent trade frictions on these imports (2023-2024), representing less than 3% of the Canadian market for new vehicles sold in Canada.""

Carney's office said ""it is expected that within three years, this agreement will drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers for Canadian workers, and ensure a robust build-out of Canada’s EV supply chain.""

""With this agreement, it is also anticipated that, in five years, more than 50% of these vehicles will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000, creating new lower-cost options for Canadian consumers,"" Carney's office said.

What do unions think about Canada allowing Chinese EVs to be sold there?

The Unifor union, which is Canada's largest private sector labor group, panned the deal to allow Chinese EVs to be sold in Canada.

""This is a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,"" Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement. ""Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding, labour violations and unfair trade practices.""

Payne also said the decision will make it harder for Canada to solved problems caused by U.S. tariffs on Canadian vehicles and rollbacks to U.S. EV policies that she said have harmed the nation's autoworkers.

""Finding a resolution to U.S. auto tariffs just got more difficult as Canada has surrendered the leverage of opening our market to China,"" she said.

What do US EV supporters think about Canada allowing Chinese EVs to be sold there?

U.S. electric car supporters blamed President Donald Trump's tariffs for opening the door to the Canada-China deal.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Albert Gore, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association in Washington and the son of former Vice President Al Gore, said in a statement the Canada-China announcement, and also a previous announcement of a similar deal between China and the European Union, ""shows that the global automotive market’s interest in electric transportation remains strong.""

NEW DEP CHIEF — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: In 2023, the head of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters saw the man he’d championed as the nation’s “greenest governor” getting eclipsed by progressive governors in other states.

So Ed Potosnak stripped Phil Murphy of the superlative, publicly airing frustrations with Murphy that had been growing among the state’s environmentalists. A month later, Murphy gave a major speech to unleash a new series of climate change goals that gave New Jersey the most aggressive clean energy target of any large state at the time.

Now Mikie Sherrill has picked Potosnak to lead the Department of Environmental Protection, a move that would put an environmental advocate in charge of regulating a major industrial state.

Potosnak was a former high school chemistry teacher and an education fellow in a congressional office before becoming the executive director of the state chapter of the League of Conservation Voters in 2012. He’s a council member in Franklin Township. He is also a licensed contractor, something both he and Sherrill touted when his nomination was announced last week.

POUND THE TABLE — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: Phil Murphy’s top environmental regulator stayed busy right until the end of the administration to finalize sweeping coastal development rules, advance a massive water pollution settlement and release strict drinking water standards for lead and copper.

During his five years on the job, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette shepherded through complex regulations, including first-in-the-nation environmental justice standards, recovered more than $3 billion in settlement money from industrial polluters and sparred with Republican lawmakers and industry lobbyists.

LaTourette’s advice for his successor — expected to be environmental advocate Ed Potosnak — is to pound the table for money to help pay for water projects because of an approaching “fiscal cliff” for infrastructure funding.

PJM DATA CENTER PLAN — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: PJM, the regional grid operator that serves 13 states including New Jersey, has finally released its proposal for how to handle an influx of data centers driving up energy prices in the region.

“This is not a yes/no to data centers. This is ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’” PJM board chair and interim President David Mills said in a statement.

The grid operator started looking into handling data center demand in August through a process that fast-tracks decision making within the organization. The proposal comes on the same day that the White House convened a meeting with a bipartisan group of governors representing states in the PJM region. PJM itself was not informed or involved in the meeting.

PERMITTING CHANGES SUPPORT: New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s push to change the State Environmental Quality Review Act in order to speed up home building has broad public support, according to a poll released today by Open New York, a pro-development advocacy group.

The poll conducted by Global Strategy Group found 63 percent of likely New York voters would favor overhauling the measure to hasten affordable housing construction. A similar majority of voters, 61 percent, said they would be more likely to vote for a state legislator that supports reforming the law. And 57 percent said they would be “more favorable” toward Hochul if she signed changes into law, the poll found. The survey of 800 likely New York voters was conducted Nov. 4-10 last year, with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.

The survey is being released as Hochul is pressing for the changes in the legislative session as she presses to stifle housing costs.

“The polling is very clear: New Yorkers from every region, age, ethnicity and political party support modernizing SEQRA because they know it’s key to addressing both the affordability crisis and the climate crisis,” said Open New York Executive Director Annemarie Gray. — Nick Reisman

ARMY CORPS FUNDING QUESTIONS: Two New York lawmakers want more information about the status of Army Corps of Engineers funding for the Hudson River after threats by President Donald Trump’s budget director. White House budget director Russ Vought threatened Army Corps projects primarily in Democratic-led states in October, during the government shutdown.

Reps. Ritchie Torres and Adriano Espaillat sent a letter to Vought last week demanding updates about the status of the Hudson Raritan Estuary program given those statements and the lack of subsequent information.

“These projects strengthen ecosystems that mitigate the effects of intense storms, as well as improve connectivity and ecological health in local tributaries,” the letter states. “All of the projects will improve the community, environment, and lives of countless New Yorkers living in and around the Hudson Raritan Estuary.” — Marie J. French

ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING PUSH — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: Gov. Kathy Hochul is seeking a major overhaul of the state’s environmental review law in a bid to spur the development of affordable housing and infrastructure projects.

“We’re taking a hard look at the environmental review processes that have not been updated in half a century,” Hochul said in her State of the State address. “Right now, they slow down the very projects that help us fight climate change, create housing and strengthen our communities.”

Seemingly all corners of New York chimed in to support the proposal, including mayors from across the state, labor leaders, local business groups, homebuilders and environmental advocates. But the exact details of what she’s proposing still remain to be seen and could ultimately prove contentious.

MICRON LAWSUIT — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Micron’s future neighbors are challenging the state’s environmental review of the semiconductor factory that’s expected to create more than 4,000 jobs as Gov. Kathy Hochul and other officials celebrate the start of construction.

The lawsuit filed Friday argues state and local authorities failed to follow New York’s signature environmental review statute in permitting the semiconductor factory in Clay. It raises concerns about the project’s impacts on about 200 acres of wetlands, potential chemicals that will be used at the plant and the emissions from the factory.

The lawsuit was filed by a local resident group and Jobs to Move America, a nonprofit that has organized residents and raised concerns about the lack of enforceable employment commitments, including for local community members.

THE COST OF DATA CENTERS — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Gov. Kathy Hochul is moving to get ahead of a potential wave of large new data centers in New York and address concerns about their potential to drive up energy costs.

Hochul announced plans to require data centers to pay more for energy — or bring their own sources. It’s an approach that’s drawn bipartisan support, including from President Donald Trump and California Democrats.

“Data centers are vital for an innovative future. But they guzzle up tremendous amounts of energy and leave ratepayers footing the bill,” Hochul said during her State of the State address.

New York hasn’t seen major new data center development yet, but there are thousands of megawatts of proposed projects — some speculative, others actively seeking local approvals — looking to connect to the state’s grid. Demand for data centers is driven by the explosion in artificial intelligence usage.

EMPIRE WIND RESUMES — E&E News’ Ian M. Stevenson: A federal judge has allowed an offshore wind project off New York to resume construction, a major reprieve for the multibillion-dollar project that was on the brink of abandoning work after receiving a stop-work order from the Trump administration last month.

TRUMP TO TECH FIRMS: PAY UP — POLITICO’s Matt Daily: President Donald Trump and a bipartisan group of governors will direct the the nation’s biggest grid operator to hold a special auction for technology companies to fund the construction of new power plants needed to supply data centers.

PUSHING PACKAGING REDUCTION: A new analysis of New York’s Packaging Reduction and Recycling Infrastructure Act found that the bill could benefit New Yorkers to the tune of more than $400 million a year.

The PRRIA passed the Senate last session and made it through its Assembly committees, but didn’t get a floor vote.

Advocates point to the financial benefits of the legislation, including fewer waste management costs and new revenue from reimbursements. An analysis of nine municipalities from environmental group Beyond Plastics and Bennington College found that implementing the PRRIA would result in an estimated $411 million in financial benefits, including $380.5 million for New York City, $12.7 million for Hempstead and $2.6 million for Syracuse.

“There’s no good way to dispose of trash as landfills across the state … fill up and close,” said Sam Fein, chief city auditor for Albany. “We need to reduce the amount of trash we create.”

The bill drew intense lobbying last session, with opponents arguing that it would end up increasing costs for consumers.

“This legislation could increase household costs by upwards of $732 per year on top of already high prices for many everyday items,” Ken Pokalsky, vice president of The Business Council of New York State, said in a statement. “There is nothing in this bill that would guarantee that any cost-shifting relief provided to municipalities will actually reduce local tax burdens.” — Mona Zhang

STATE ENERGY LEADERS ON NUCLEAR GOAL: Major questions remain about how New York’s agencies will execute Gov. Kathy Hochul’s 5-gigawatt nuclear goal. The costs could be enormous — the state’s own evaluation found new nuclear to be more expensive in the near term than carbon capture and storage with a wide range of uncertainty. The next large-scale new nuclear plant may take more than a decade to build, according to that state report. But Hochul is betting on new nuclear plants that run almost constantly to provide a baseline of emissions-free energy to bolster the grid, in line with analysis in the state’s recently approved energy plan.

The Public Service Commission will likely start a new proceeding to incentivize the 4 gigawatts of new nuclear Hochul backed during her State of the State address. “We will move as quickly as possible to bring about the governor’s directive,” PSC Chair Rory Christian said. He said that resource diversity is a critical part of the state’s energy mix.

“We have nuclear that can provide a significant amount of baseload, which is generally more affordable and provides more in terms of grid reliability than renewables currently available,” Christian said. “This is not about devoting ourselves to a specific technology — it’s about devoting ourselves to the reliability and affordability of the grid overall.”

The commission has an ongoing process looking at technologies to achieve the state’s 2040 zero emissions electricity target in the climate law. Christian said that’s still being evaluated and the commission will issue its order “in due time.” He declined to commit to any action by the end of this year.

NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen Harris said the governor’s target allows the authority to “solve for the number” as it advances the forthcoming nuclear master plan. That will address issues including community engagement, supply chain investments and workforce needs. “It allows these pieces to come together in a manner that is cohesive,” Harris said. “We will now have a number that the private sector can be solving for and frankly that we can be working toward with the federal government where we see alignment as well as the actions from the state outside of the Public Service Commission that will be necessary.” — Marie J. French

SOLAR COST SAVINGS: Expanding distributed solar and battery storage throughout New York could save $1 billion by 2035, according to a new study by Synapse Energy Economics for the trade group Coalition for Community Solar Access.

While the state is on track to meet its 10 gigawatts of distributed solar by 2030, it could save even more by expanding distributed solar and storage while shoring up reliability.

“Solar energy is the cheapest form of energy to produce and a linchpin for affordability,” state Sen. Pete Harckham said in a statement. Harckham introduced a bill to accelerate distributed solar, which is in the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee.

The report looked at what would happen if the state increased its distributed solar to 20 gigawatts by 2035, a major goal of solar industry groups this session: $1 billion in avoided energy costs, including $542 million in savings upstate and $481 million in savings downstate. It would also save an estimated $947 million in carbon dioxide emissions costs.

It would reduce demand on the grid and lower the market clearing price for the New York Independent System Operator. Storage can also enhance those benefits by charging during low demand and discharging during high-demand periods.

Increasing distributed solar and storage would help insulate consumers from the volatility of gas prices and help the state with electrification as peak demand moves from the summer to winter. — Mona Zhang

HOCHUL FOCUSES ON NUCLEAR, UTILITY COSTS — POLITICO’s Marie J. French and Mona Zhang: Gov. Kathy Hochul is focusing on building new nuclear power plants and reining in rising utility bills as she elevates her focus on affordability in an election year.

The governor’s State of the State proposals include a number of changes to utility-rate setting, an effort to ease permitting rules, particularly for housing, and programs to prepare for the impacts of climate change.

“We can make energy more affordable and reliable while still leading the nation in sustainable investments,” Hochul said during her speech in Albany.

Beyond a long-term effort to build new nuclear, the governor last week didn’t advance any major new policies or funding to reduce emissions from buildings or transportation. That’s frustrating for some environmental advocates who want to see continued progress toward New York’s climate goals, which it is not on track to meet.

DANSKAMMER PLANS TO RETIRE: The rarely needed Danskammer power plant on the shore of the Hudson River in Orange County has filed to retire in August. The 530-megawatt gas- and oil-powered plant once sought to repower with a new combined cycle gas plant, but Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected an air permit for the project in 2021. The New York Independent System Operator posted the deactivation notice with a retirement date of August. This triggers a review by the grid operator to check for any reliability impacts from the proposed retirement. — Marie J. French

MURPHY BPU PICKS GET APPROVED — POLITICO’s Daniel Han: The New Jersey Senate approved two of Phil Murphy’s nominees to the Board of Public Utilities — leaving his imprint on the influential regulator before he leaves office, while undermining a state law meant to prevent the board being stacked with members of a single political party.

KOLLURI TAKES TWO GIGS — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: Even before Mikie Sherrill clinched the Democratic Party nomination for governor last year, she was publicly pressing Kris Kolluri to stay in her administration as president and CEO of New Jersey Transit, one of the nation’s largest commuter rail and bus systems.",https://static.politico.com/3d/ee/f4d549cf4e548af6712990ce5b9e/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 12:01:19.165484

He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 20%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year, companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The U.S. benchmark price for oil is down about 20% from where it was a year ago, and the average retail gasoline price — the price drivers pay at the pump — is down nearly 10%.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and they predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was reelected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wish list. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost 1 in 3 households, or over 80 million Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

Despite overseeing the launch of petrol-fuelled vehicles including the GLC, E-Class (W124) and C-Class (W206/SC06), his focus has shifted significantly.

Since Ola became Chairman of the Board of Management and CEO in 2019, the automotive giant has aggressively expanded its portfolio under the Mercedes-EQ brand, with the aim of achieving up to 50% electrified sales by 2030.

Ola told ABC News about his personal transition from combustion to electric power during an interview released on 20 January 2025.

“I used to work at AMG, I am a petrol head, I love the V8, I was in Formula 1. Nobody needs to convince me about the passion for motorsports and what it’s all about.""

However, he says that his recent experiences behind the wheel have changed his perspective on drivetrain capabilities.

“But the last few years, I have been driving electric vehicles and the power performance, but also the quietness of those vehicles, is unbelievable,” he says.

High-performance electric models

Addressing concerns that electric models might lack the character of their predecessors, Ola points toward future developments for the brand that focus on robust output.

“For the hardcore performance fans, we’re going to launch in 2026 a whole new high-performance, electric AMG car. That will blow your mind,” says Ola.

He also mentions technological features that cater to traditionalists who may miss the auditory feedback of an engine.

“And if you want it to sound like a V8, you can do that too,” he says.

Overcoming market headwinds

The transition to electric mobility faces obstacles, particularly within the US market. Throughout 2025, reports indicated a challenging environment for automakers.

This was driven by slowing customer demand, high production costs and the elimination of federal incentives.

These challenges are expected to continue into 2026 as manufacturers navigate the complex shift from early adopters to the mass market.

The removal of federal tax credits at the end of September 2025, which previously offered US$7,500 for new EVs and a US$4,000 credit for used EVs, took away a major purchasing incentive.

Ola addresses how the company strategy has evolved in this climate since the launch of the EQS, the flagship luxury electric car for Mercedes-Benz.

“Ultimately, all markets will have to find a new equilibrium. The transformation toward zero emissions is not something that happens in a few years,” he says.

He emphasises the global nature of its operations and the varying speeds of adoption.

“We sell cars in more than 150 countries around the world. To expect that transformation to be a straight line where everything happens at the same pace, that is unrealistic.”

While acknowledging that EV makers are in competition, Ola suggests the trajectory is clear.

“We’re going to have different swim lanes,” he says. “We are car companies, we will serve those swim lanes. But the destination we’re ultimately going toward is zero emissions. That I am convinced about.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/01b944256b45031bbe9d8c72c5e3fb9a:179edbc07fa2bb245f939a650b0a9fa1/ola.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 12:00:59.227995

This facility represents the first of several planned storage deployments at the site where the utility retired its legacy coal units. The project utilizes existing transmission infrastructure on Lake Wylie to store electricity for use during peak demand periods on the regional grid.

The four-hour battery system consists of lithium-ion units designed to provide 200 MWH of energy. Duke Energy said it completed the installation ahead of schedule and under budget with an investment of approximately $100 million.

The project qualifies for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act including a 10% bonus for reinvesting in a community formerly dependent on coal production, said the utility.

Storage capacity at this location will help Duke balance the intermittent nature of solar generation, which has seen significant growth in North Carolina. Based on current deployment rates, it is likely that solar will surpass wind as the third-largest source of electricity. And solar may soon topple coal as the second-largest source of electricity generation in the United States.

The batteries can charge using surplus energy from nearby solar farms or the Catawba Nuclear Station during low demand hours. This stored energy is then dispatched to the grid in the morning or evening when residential and commercial usage reaches its daily peaks.

Construction on a second and larger battery project is slated to begin at the same site in May with a capacity of 167 MW. Duke Energy also proposed a third battery installation and a regional operations center for renewable energy at the former Allen plant. These efforts form part of a broader utility plan to deploy over 6,000 MW of energy storage by 2035 to replace retiring fossil fuel capacity.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was reelected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wish list. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost 1 in 3 households, or over 80 million Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 10%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year, companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The U.S. benchmark price for oil is down about 20% from where it was a year ago, and the average retail gasoline price — the price drivers pay at the pump — is down nearly 10%.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and they predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

Please read our guidelines for opinion pieces before submitting an Op-Ed. Submissions that do not adhere to our guidelines will not be considered for publication.

OPINION – The Trump Administration’s raid in Venezuela reveals a dangerous truth about the fossil fuel economy: so long as we remain dependent on dirty expensive fuels – chaos, violence, and corruption will flourish. But it doesn’t have to be this way – the clean energy solutions that can end this pattern are already at our fingertips, and it’s up to California to continue to lead the way out of this mess.

As Trump himself acknowledged, this attack is fundamentally about oil. But an illegal invasion – that has reportedly killed 80 civilians and members of security forces – is an incredible gamble on global security to steal a resource that’s becoming obsolete. All while the rest of the world races ahead on clean energy innovation.

California faces an important choice as we enter a critical election year: We can continue to allow our political processes to be corrupted by an oil industry willing to wage war and risk lives for profit, or we can be emboldened by this moment and elect leaders who are committed to investing in clean energy from renewable resources, prompting peace and prosperity.

We know all too well the costs of fossil fuel dependency. Over just the past three months, more than 200 oil spills have polluted our ports, harbors and waterways. That’s an average of 70 spills per month. As you read this, more than 4,000 gallons of oil and contaminated wastewater spilled from a pipeline in Monterey County near the Salinas River, a key source for drinking water and irrigation. And those are just the costs of transporting oil. Burning it is causing 10,000 premature deaths every year in California, as well as mega-fires and other extreme weather disasters that continue to devastate communities across our state.

The Trump administration will stop at nothing to force fossil fuels onto a public that increasingly is rejecting them. A few days ago, the Trump Administration overrode California safety objections and demanded the state restart a pipeline that ruptured in 2015, spilling over 100,000 gallons of crude oil in Santa Barbara County. And this week, federal officials are suing California cities Morgan Hill and Petaluma to block energy efficient electric building codes that help cities build more housing more quickly and affordably by bypassing polluting methane gas pipelines.

This is fossil fuel dependency in action: chaos and costs passed to communities while oil industry profits flow upward to executives, backed by federal power.

The race for the next governor of California represents a critical battleground in this epic fight of the people vs corporations. Candidates who tackle corporate accountability head-on will win in California. We need a candidate who is up to the challenge of fighting for the clean and prosperous future we know is possible. We cannot afford leaders who will stay on the sidelines or bow down to corrupted special interests. It’s time to kick the oil industry out of Sacramento and follow the will of the people.

And the evidence is clear that there are only benefits ahead. California must stay the course on the state’s significant progress on electric vehicle adoption and efficiency while growing our clean mobility options. County planners in Kern County—the heart of the state’s oil production—recently credited the region’s “vast solar and wind potential” as supporting an emerging energy hub. This represents economic opportunity, not sacrifice.

Rather than giving in to the bullying led by the army of oil and gas lobbyists who flood Sacramento every single legislative session trying to lock us into short-term thinking, it’s time for California leaders to redouble our commitment to ending our reliance on dirty expensive fuels. When we accelerate our transition to clean energy we’re creating good jobs, building clean infrastructure and resilience, and supporting healthy and thriving communities.

Clean energy is affordable energy, and it’s ours for the taking – no military operation needed.

The incentive, unveiled Monday, is part of a renewed push to boost electric-car adoption and support the struggling auto industry after demand slumped when subsidies ended in late 2023. While the government aims to support local carmakers, it will not impose origin-based restrictions.

“I am convinced of the quality of European and German brands,” Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said at a press conference on Monday. “I cannot see any evidence of this postulated major influx of Chinese car manufacturers in Germany, either in the figures or on the roads — and that is why we are facing up to the competition and not imposing any restrictions.”

The decision is a boon for affordable Chinese brands, such as BYD Co., that are gaining ground in Europe. While Chinese automakers already face tariffs on EVs imported to the European Union, they’re still able to sell cars profitably in the region thanks to low manufacturing costs at home. Brussels is considering a minimum price system to replace import tariffs.

Germany’s green light for the Chinese contrasts with approaches taken elsewhere. In the UK, the biggest European market for Chinese-made EVs, grants introduced last year effectively exclude battery vehicles from China, mandating environmental standards including low carbon emissions from the battery and assembly process. France’s so-called social leasing program includes similar stipulations.

Germany’s fresh round of funding, first outlined in October, is expected to support purchases of around 800,000 vehicles through 2029, according to the environment ministry. Subsidies will range from €1,500 to €6,000 depending on household income, family size and the vehicle type, and are aimed primarily at low- to middle-income buyers.

The program is set to benefit manufacturers such as Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV, which are adding more affordable electric models.

EV sales in Germany have fluctuated wildly, recovering last year after a slump in 2024 following the previous government’s decision to scrap subsidies. Germany has repeatedly missed official targets for EV adoption, though prospects are improving as cheaper models reach showrooms. These include Renault SA’s R5 E-Tech and VW’s compact ID. Polo, priced around €25,000.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s ruling coalition has also extended a tax exemption for EVs through 2035, a move the finance ministry estimates will cost about €600 million in lost revenue through 2029. Merz has been a vocal advocate for easing the EU’s proposed phaseout of combustion engines.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/20/PDTN/88264193007-bizautoevchinagermanyfilepicdmt.jpg?crop=2996,1687,x0,y153&width=2996&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-20 11:05:55.657901

,Texas American Energy ,2026-01-20 15:15:56+00:00,Odessa American,"Texas forecast to be top market for data centers in two years, increasing grid demand","Guest Contributor, Paul Cobler, The Texas Tribune, www.oaoa.com, aim-guest",,,,,https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/texas-forecast-to-be-top-market-for-data-centers-in-two-years-increasing-grid-demand/,"Bloom Energy, a California-based company that provides onsite power generation for electricity-guzzling data centers, also found that the grid demand driven by data centers in Texas is expected to exceed 40 gigawatts by 2028.
In 2025, data centers in Texas had a maximum power demand of about 8 GW, compared to the state grid’s peak energy demand of 94 GW, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the grid.
By 2030, one in five data centers are expected to exceed 1 GW in maximum energy demand.
By 2035, that number is expected to be one in three of all data centers, according to Bloom Energy.
“Grid power is not easily available at all and prices have gone up,” said Aman Joshi, chief commercial officer at Bloom Energy.","Bloom Energy, a California-based company that provides onsite power generation for electricity-guzzling data centers, also found that the grid demand driven by data centers in Texas is expected to exceed 40 gigawatts by 2028. The report is based on a survey of both electric utilities and data center developers that was conducted throughout much of last year.

In 2025, data centers in Texas had a maximum power demand of about 8 GW, compared to the state grid’s peak energy demand of 94 GW, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the grid. One gigawatt is enough to energize about 700,000 homes for a year.

Texas currently has about 387 data centers scattered across the state.

Drawn by cheap gas, available land, and a regulatory market more friendly to natural gas power, companies are flocking to Texas to build more data centers that will support the growth of the artificial intelligence industry.

The growth of data centers in Texas is projected to outpace any other state in the country over the next several years, propelling Texas above other top markets with tighter regulations on new gas power generators, like Oregon and California, according to Bloom Energy.

Data centers are also getting larger. By 2030, one in five data centers are expected to exceed 1 GW in maximum energy demand. By 2035, that number is expected to be one in three of all data centers, according to Bloom Energy.

Nationally, the maximum energy demand by data centers was about 80 GW in 2025 and is expected to balloon to 150 GW in 2028, according to Bloom Energy. The rate of growth is causing issues as expectations by developers seeking power for data centers run into limitations by the utilities that provide that power, Bloom Energy found. Developers in Texas that responded to the survey typically expected to be connected to the grid about a year before the utility expected to have that power available.

The company found that disconnect between power providers and data center developers is only widening as demand for the centers increases.

“Power can no longer be treated as a downstream consideration,” read the report. “Operators that continue to plan projects around traditional grid assumptions risk falling behind on both schedule and scale.”

To circumvent those issues, more data centers are relying on power plants developed alongside and attached to new data centers, like the fuel cells Bloom Energy creates or natural gas power plants. About one-third of all data centers are expected to have onsite power generation by 2030, according to the report.

“Grid power is not easily available at all and prices have gone up,” said Aman Joshi, chief commercial officer at Bloom Energy. “As you think about onsite generation, no matter where you are in the U.S., 100% of onsite generation is largely happening with natural gas and Texas certainly has a lot of access [to gas].”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-09-23T212241Z_813534783_RC2SXGAN2MGU_RTRMADP_3_TECH-OPENAI-TEXAS.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:06:02.244393

We’ll be working hard to defend this funding and to pass perpetual, adequate clean water funding through the WATER Act.
In 2026, we’ll also oppose carbon dioxide injection underneath our oceans and the use of carbon dioxide in oil drilling.
We can expect more attacks on independent farmers and ranchers, on climate protections, and on the Clean Water Act.
In 2026, we’re strengthening our Food & Water Watch community, because we know community is how we win these fights.","From fighting data centers to opposing Trump’s rollbacks, here’s how we’ll protect our health, environment, and communities in 2026.

The first year of the Trump administration was hard, to say the least. Trump and his cronies showed their capacity for horrific cruelty and outrageous power grabs. They worked hand-in-hand with greedy corporations to make our lives less healthy, less safe, and more expensive. But this past year also showed what remains possible when dedicated people take action together.

With you, we defended many essential programs and protections. We’ve also won incredible victories at the state and local level. We stopped Congress from rolling back an important lead protection rule, defended funding for school lunches, defeated Big Ag’s Cancer Gag Act in Iowa, stopped data center proposals in Pennsylvania, and more.

Now, as we head into 2026, we’re ready to continue the fight against Trump and win major victories in our communities. Here are our biggest priorities.

Fighting Big Ag Handouts in Congress

Battles over spending bills in Congress — first in Trump’s Big Ugly Bill, and then through the spending bill that led to a government shutdown — have been a central arena for Trump and his cronies pushing their pro-corporate, anti-people agenda. In 2026, we’ll continue organizing people power to oppose this agenda, especially against two particular bills: the EATS Act and the Cancer Gag Act.

First, the EATS Act threatens state and local governments’ authority to enact their own protections for consumers, farmers, and animals. Second, the Cancer Gag Act would shield pesticide corporations from lawsuits alleging health harms connected to their products. The purpose of these bills is clear: let corporations do what they want, no matter the impact on people or the environment. We’ll be opposing EATS and Cancer Gag measures, however they might appear in Congress.

At the same time, Trump and his allies have taken aim at federal food assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Tearing food assistance from families is especially galling at a time when Trump’s deregulatory policies are also handing corporations even more power, which they can use to raise the prices of essentials. We’ll continue to shine a light on these dangerous efforts and build opposition to them.

While we hold the line against the worst of Trump’s agenda, we also know we need massive changes to reach our vision of safe, affordable food for all. We’ll continue working with our allies in Congress to pass bills that will transform our food system, like the Farm System Reform Act and a halt to new Big Ag mergers.

Protecting Clean, Affordable Water

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility to defend clean drinking water, but under Trump, the agency has rolled back protections. In 2026, we will push the EPA to do its job and protect us against toxic contamination of our drinking water.

Last year, Food & Water Watch members won an incredible victory. We pushed seven governors to petition the EPA alongside our legal petition to monitor microplastics in our drinking water! Now, we’ll continue to pressure the EPA to heed that petition and take this important step toward strong regulations.

We’re also opposing efforts to gut protections against lead and PFAS forever chemicals in our drinking water. We’ll oppose Trump’s efforts to roll back important limits on certain PFAS in our water, and keep the pressure on the EPA to defend the Lead out of Water Rule from industry challenges.

Besides reversing protections on clean water, Trump has also threatened federal funding for water infrastructure that is essential for keeping water safe and affordable. We’ll be working hard to defend this funding and to pass perpetual, adequate clean water funding through the WATER Act.

Opposing Fossil Fuel Infrastructure

In 2026, we’re continuing to oppose federal policies that entrench the dirty energy polluting our communities and making our energy more expensive. We’ll also keep pushing to end the billions of dollars in subsidies that Big Oil and Gas receives each year and the wasteful tax benefits lavished on the industry’s carbon capture and storage scam.

At the same time, we’ll continue combating efforts to strip protections against the industry’s dangerous, polluting infrastructure. That includes the hazardous carbon pipelines that are part of the carbon capture and storage boondoggle.

With advocates like you, we blocked Congressional measures that would have allowed corporations to pay for fast-track reviews and measures that would have allowed the federal government to force state and local governments to accept carbon pipelines.

But this fight isn’t over — we’ll continue defending communities’ right to protect themselves from dangerous infrastructure. In 2026, we’ll also oppose carbon dioxide injection underneath our oceans and the use of carbon dioxide in oil drilling.

Stopping Energy- and Water-Hungry Data Centers

The data center boom driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency is one of the defining issues of our time. These facilities are guzzling our water, entrenching fossil fuels, and spiking our energy bills. They’re worsening the climate crisis and affordability crisis — all for Big Tech’s profit.

Last year, we became the first national organization to call for a nationwide halt to all new data centers. We also worked with local communities to successfully stop data centers from being built in their backyards. We’ll expand our work fighting these facilities at the local, state, and national level in 2026 and beyond.

Slowing Trump’s Agenda Through the Courts

The Trump administration is barreling through the law to undo decades of progress that protects communities. We can expect more attacks on independent farmers and ranchers, on climate protections, and on the Clean Water Act.

But we’ll be using the law to stand up for our health and environment against the worst of Trump’s agenda. In 2026, we’ll be defending climate regulation — including Biden-era rules to limit oil and gas industry methane pollution — from Trump’s rollbacks, suing to force Trump’s EPA to update national water pollution limits for slaughterhouses, fighting to maintain clean water protections for streams and wetlands, and appealing a court’s approval of Trump rules that allow factory farms to keep their air pollution secret.

At the state level, we’ll be using the law to fight programs and agency decisions that open the doors for more pollution in our communities. In California, we’re suing the state for its Low Carbon Fuel Standard that incentivizes harmful factory farm biogas nationwide.

In New York and New Jersey, we’re challenging the state and federal approvals of the Northeast Supply Enhancement fracked gas pipeline. And we’ll be continuing our work to rein in factory farm pollution, from Colorado to Minnesota, Montana to Ohio, and beyond.

Winning at the State and Local Level

With Trump in office, state and local organizing are more important than ever. Our victories in 2025 have shown that we win real improvements in people’s lives, despite the chaos and harm at the federal level.

From building support for Climate Superfund Laws in six states across the country , to stopping harmful projects like data centers and pipelines, we’ll continue this work in 2026. And we’re expanding our work in Massachusetts and Connecticut fighting for a Climate Superfund bill and in Michigan fighting factory farms.

In Pennsylvania, the 37th municipality has passed a zoning law to protect their communities from fracking since we started the Municipal Ordinance Project in 2018. In 2026, we’ll build on this support toward a fracking ban in all of Allegheny County. With Pennsylvania in the crosshairs of the Big Tech industry for its data centers, we’ll also build on our successes in 2025 to defeat more local data center projects.

In Florida, where state regulators recently rubber-stamped the largest rate hike in U.S. history, we’re building on our powerful campaign for affordable, clean energy. That includes introducing a bill that would force the state’s electric utility to increase energy efficiency and reduce fossil fuel use.

In New Jersey, we’re gathering momentum behind the state’s Climate Superfund Act; so far, we have the support of more than a hundred New Jersey groups, 60 legislators, and over 65 municipalities. We’re also fighting to get gas hookups out of Jersey City, as we’ve already done in New York City and New York State.

In Oregon, we’ve worked with allies to build grassroots support for factory farm protections and pass a bill that allows local governments to enact setbacks between factory farms and homes, schools, and other buildings. This year, we’ll build on that success to organize support for local setback ordinances in Oregon communities.

In California, we’re working to stop oil and gas drilling statewide and continuing to build support for the state’s Climate Superfund bill. We’re also fighting a compressor station in Ventura, the notorious Aliso Canyon gas storage facility, the Montezuma carbon capture and storage project, and hydrogen projects like Angeles Link and Scattergood.

In New Mexico, we’re working to stop the expansion and entrenchment of factory farms through the state’s Clean Transportation Fuel Program, and we’re advocating for state protections from these polluting facilities. The state must finalize its new surface water permitting program and include strong protections against factory farm waste.

In Iowa, we defeated Bayer’s Cancer Gag Act in the state legislature last year, defending people’s right to sue pesticide companies for alleged harms caused by their products. Now, we’re preparing for a potential Round 2 with Big Ag. At the same time, we’ll fight to pass our Blueprint for Clean Water, a suite of legislative changes needed to rein in factory farm pollution and tackle Iowa’s drinking water crisis.

In Maryland, we’re building on our success overriding Governor Moore’s veto of the RENEW Act study, which will calculate the costs of climate change in the state. This is an important first step for passing a Climate Superfund Law, which we’ll continue building support for. We’ll also make sure the City of Baltimore implements a water bill debt forgiveness program that we won in 2019.

In New York, we’ve built an incredible movement of passionate activists fighting dirty infrastructure across the state. In 2026, we’ll continue our work to get fossil fuels out of New York City buildings, push for statewide halts on all new factory farms and new data centers, and fight data center proposals at the local level.

With You, We Have So Much to Look Forward to in 2026!

Though we’ve seen so many low points and cruelty from the Trump administration, we’re heartened to see our movement grow. In 2025, our community grew to 4,000 volunteers and 2.3 million supporters. From gathering petitions at farmers’ markets to meeting with elected officials, from taking to the streets to making gifts that power this work, our members are the foundation of this movement.

In 2026, we’re strengthening our Food & Water Watch community, because we know community is how we win these fights. Together, we’re building the people power we need to combat corporate greed and Trump’s policies, and to win real protections for our most precious resources.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Summer-Victories-1024x427.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:05:31.088023

The financing will support the development, construction, and operation of commercial and community solar projects spread across multiple U.S. markets. Commercial operation dates are expected to fall between December 2025 and 2026, according to the companies. Some projects are also expected to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act investment tax credit adders tied to domestic content and “energy community” designations.

“In addition to U.S. manufacturing, Fluence is committed to cybersecure products,” Fluence noted in the 2024 press release, with system software being developed solely in the U.S., Germany, and India.","In 2018, Siemens and AES launched Fluence Energy, a joint energy storage product and software company. Today, Fluence has developed 273 energy storage projects across 48 markets and expanded into digital applications for renewables and storage.

In 2022, Fluence announced that it had partnered with a contract manufacturer to open a new manufacturing plant in Utah. That September, the site began shipping out Fluence Cubes to be used in its products across the continent. Those products include the Gridstack, used by utilities, developers, and independent power producers to deploy efficient, cost-effective projects; the Smartstack, which offers greater density and a more intelligent platform; and Ultrastack, the highest-performance tier used by power grid operators for transmission infrastructure. The Utah facility was initially capable of producing 75 cubes per week, but eventually ramped up to 150 per week.

At the time of the 2022 announcement, Fluence’s production presence was heavily concentrated in Asia. In fact, the contracted manufacturing facility in Vietnam continues to provide fully built products for the Asia-Pacific and European markets. As Peter Silveira, then senior director of manufacturing, told Energy-Storage.news, although the Vietnam facility continued to produce the modular base units for American products, the Utah facility would provide final assembly, offering customization, configuration, and more options for local transportation and logistics companies.

The Utah plant is just one example of Fluence’s onshoring manufacturing operations to the U.S. The company also opened a spare parts hub in Utah, specifically chosen for its proximity to major storage markets. This site enables Fluence to provide better support for customers’ operations and projects, while customers avoid the overhead costs and land requirements associated with on-site storage. These spare parts hubs can ship a needed part or component within 24 hours, whereas it would take 2 weeks to arrive from Vietnam.

Also in August 2022, Fluence opened a product testing lab in Pennsylvania, one of only three such sites operated by the company. It was an essential addition to speed up the launch of new energy storage products, and was the first to offer testing at full system, or Core, scale. “Findings at the lab are expected to reduce commissioning times and yield early identification of issues, allowing resolutions to be implemented prior to deployment at customer sites,” the company noted in the press release.

Based on these new sites, it is evident that closer proximity to customers enables Fluence to better serve its customers in North America. As Carol Couch, former chief supply chain and manufacturing officer, explained in the press release, “The markets we serve have unique use cases, customer needs, and regulatory requirements, and these new facilities are an expansion of the ongoing regionalization of our operations.” It makes sense that these moves were mirrored by close competitors. For example, Oregon-headquartered Powin Energy, then ranked the fifth-largest battery energy storage system integrator, contracted with Celestica to produce its storage product at Celestica’s facility in Monterrey, Mexico, around the same time.

Two years later, in 2024, Fluence announced the production of battery modules in Utah, using battery cells from Smyrna, Tennessee, making the latter the first U.S. facility to produce LFP battery cells for utility-scale stationary energy storage. This mission to expand the use of domestically sourced components was prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content bonus tax credit and the growing demand for utility-scale storage. Fluence is also committed to onshoring the production of all major products and components of its energy storage systems to the U.S., with additional manufacturing added in Arizona and Texas. John Zahurancik, currently Chief Customer Success Officer, reflected, “We are moving quickly to deliver domestically manufactured energy storage solutions that meet our customers’ needs, reduce supply chain risks for projects, and support the nation’s energy independence.”

Fluence’s American facilities help the company avoid supply chain issues and control costs, thereby stabilizing costs for customers as well. In 2022, Couch elaborated, “At a time when the energy storage industry has seen increased supply chain disruptions, this production hub will be particularly important in strengthening business continuity and improving flexibility for meeting customer needs.” In 2024, domestic production of battery modules and cells enabled Fluence to respond to increases in tariffs on batteries sourced from China and prepare itself for future trade shifts.

Plus, domestic production enhances national security. “In addition to U.S. manufacturing, Fluence is committed to cybersecure products,” Fluence noted in the 2024 press release, with system software being developed solely in the U.S., Germany, and India.

The economic benefits should not be overlooked, either. The Salt River Project and Ørsted sourced all the enclosures for the Eleven Mile Solar Center, a development in Pinal County, Arizona, featuring 300 megawatts (MW) of solar and a 300 MW battery energy storage system, from Fluence’s Utah operations. That project represents a $1 billion investment that created more than 1,000 construction jobs and will generate about $80 million in tax revenue. It also boosted local energy reliability, with enough capacity to power 65,000 homes and store 1,200 megawatt-hours (MWh) daily. Eloy Mayor Micah Powell reacted, “This energy project is a first of its kind in our region and will have a huge impact on energy reliability for our local area.”

Last year, U.S. Senator John Curtis (R-UT) visited Fluence’s Utah battery module plant. “In Utah, we’ve seen firsthand how smart policies—like energy tax credits—can drive innovation, strengthen our economy, and create real opportunity. I was pleased to visit Fluence’s energy storage operations at the manufacturing facility in Tooele County to see the value of these incentives in meeting both our energy production and economic development goals,” he reflected.

Although some of Fluence’s projects stalled last year due to policy uncertainty, CEO Julian Nebreda told Energy-Storage.news that those projects are once again advancing forward. Zahurancik looks toward the future with profound optimism: “This facility is building the future of energy storage right here in Utah, and we’re helping to build the foundation for the United States to once again be a leader in battery manufacturing.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/smartstack-9-9-announcement-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:05:05.040648

Health care policy dominated the congressional agenda in 2025 and is poised to do so again in 2026. Disputes over health care insurance affordability was a major contributor to the recent federal government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history, lasting 43 days. The continuing resolution agreement that reopened the government in November 2025: 1) extended federal funding through Jan. 30, 2026, 2) fully funded programs within the Department of Agriculture, FDA, and the Department of Veteran Affairs, and 3) secured a vote on legislation to preserve the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) open_in_new enhanced premium tax credits (PTCs).

The Lower Health Care Costs Act (S 3385 open_in_new), which aimed to extend the enhanced PTCs until 2028, ultimately failed to garner the 60 votes necessary to proceed through the Senate. Early in the new year, Congress continues to face the same funding and policy cliff regarding the enhanced PTCs. To complicate matters, in late December, there was a discharge petition open_in_new related to The Health Subsidies Extension Measure (HR 1834) open_in_new, which garnered support from members of both sides of the aisle in the U.S. House of Representatives to force a floor vote on a three-year extension of the enhanced PTCs. On Jan. 8, after a procedural vote the day before, this legislation passed the House open_in_new (230 to 196) and advanced to the Senate.

Lawmakers from both parties acknowledge this bill is likely to fail in the Senate, where previous three-year extension efforts stalled. That said, efforts to reach a compromise are ongoing. A bipartisan Senate group is close to finalizing legislation, the Consumer Affordability and Responsibility Enhancement (CARE) Act open_in_new, to reestablish enhanced PTCs for two years, implement minimum premium payments, and introduce income caps. Additionally, it includes cost-sharing reduction measures and expanded access to health savings accounts.

A Brief History

2014 Launch

When the ACA private health insurance marketplace system open_in_new (also called ACA exchanges) launched in 2014, four years after the ACA was enacted in 2010, PTCs were available to individuals and families earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. They were designed to ensure affordable marketplace coverage based on income by covering the difference between the full premium (set by insurers) and an affordable amount based on income.

While this structure significantly expanded coverage, affordability gaps open_in_new persisted due to high premiums, age ratings open_in_new, and regional cost variations open_in_new — particularly for middle-income households, self-employed and gig workers, small business owners, rural communities, and older adults. This group of 40 to 50 million people fit into what is commonly referred to as the “missing middle open_in_new,” meaning they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, are too young for Medicare, or don’t have job-related health insurance.

2021 and 2022 Expansions

In 2021, Congress temporarily expanded enhanced PTCs through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) open_in_new in response to pandemic-related economic disruption. These changes increased subsidy levels and eliminated the 400% federal poverty level income cap for two years, allowing higher-income households to qualify for assistance if premiums exceeded a fixed share of income, starting at 0% for low incomes and capped at 8.5% (the original range was 2% to 10%).

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act open_in_new extended these enhanced PTCs through the end of 2025, setting up the current expiration cliff and causing subsidies to revert to pre-ARPA levels on Jan. 1, 2026. Since enhanced PTCs began in 2021, health insurance enrollment through ACA marketplaces reached 24.3 million in 2025, more than double the 11.4 million who were enrolled in 2020. About 22.4 million enrollees (92%) received enhanced PTCs in 2025.

Ongoing Proposals

For years, some members of Congress have pushed to make the enhanced PTCs permanent or to extend them further, citing record marketplace enrollment, historically low uninsured rates, and improved market stability (S 3385 open_in_new). Other members, by contrast, have resisted clean extensions without offsets or structural reforms. Recent alternative proposals have included:

Reverting to original tax credit levels combined with consumer-directed health savings accounts (S 3386 open_in_new and S 3362 open_in_new).

Greater reliance on out-of-pocket payment tools rather than premium-based subsidies, market-oriented reforms (e.g., association health plans and regulatory flexibility).

Expanded oversight provisions to address fraud (HR 6703 open_in_new).

In December 2025, the Senate voted on some of these competing approaches. None advanced, leaving the enhanced PTCs to expire open_in_new.

Potential Impacts

Analysts project that the lapse of enhanced PTCs will result in 2026 coverage losses. The Urban Institute estimates that approximately 4.8 million more people will become uninsured open_in_new without the extensions in place, with more than 7 million people losing subsidized marketplace coverage overall. This would add to the already 26 million Americans who have no health coverage, a steady level since 2016. KFF estimates that average net marketplace premium payments would more than double open_in_new without the enhanced PTCs. Early state-level data open_in_new already suggests that higher premiums are leading some households to drop coverage altogether, insure only select family members, skip filling prescriptions, or take on increased medical debt.

For public health systems, higher uninsured rates open_in_new translate directly into delayed or forgone care, which leads to:

Reductions in preventive screenings. Interruptions in chronic disease detection and management.

Decreased access to maternal and behavioral health care.

Worsening outcomes for existing conditions or emergent medical events.

Uninsured populations tend to be diagnosed at later disease stages with more severe disease and face higher mortality rates. These coverage losses increase pressure on local safety net providers open_in_new (e.g., hospital emergency rooms and federally qualified health centers) and expand uncompensated care costs that hospitals and state/local budgets absorb. Hospitals overcrowded with uninsured patients open_in_new are at risk of reduced system capacity during public health emergencies open_in_new.

Going Forward

To date, Congressional efforts to extend the ACA PTCs have stalled, and the path forward is unclear. It’s possible that Congress attaches legislation to a moving vehicle such as an appropriations bill or, alternatively, addresses health care broadly in a reconciliation package later this year.

After the first year of the Trump administration, working Americans are feeling the consequences of the administration’s misguided economic policies. 2025 was marked by chaotic tariff announcements, increasing costs for everyday essentials, and rising unemployment, as well as historic cuts to health care, food assistance, and clean energy that are driving up costs. The Trump administration’s first year of economic turbulence does not leave most Americans optimistic about the year ahead, with almost 70 percent of Americans predicting 2026 will be a year of economic difficulty.

The Trump administration’s tariffs are driving up household costs

Americans are feeling the financial strain of the administration’s economic policies, with two-thirds of Americans expressing concern in December 2025 about the impact of tariffs on their finances. According to the Harvard Business School Pricing Lab, the costs of everyday household items have risen following the Trump administration’s massive new tariffs. Compared with pre-tariff trends from October 2024 to March 2025, the prices of household essentials increased significantly in 2025, including nondurable household goods such as cleaning supplies and toilet paper (up 5 percent), household furnishings (up 8 percent), and clothing (up 14 percent).** The Trump administration’s tariffs are also increasing the costs of big-ticket items such as cars and making it more expensive to build new homes. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the Trump administration’s tariffs will cost the average household $1,700 annually. Despite the Trump administration’s claims that it would end inflation on “Day 1” of the second term, inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2 percent throughout 2025. Two notable studies have attributed elevated inflation to the Trump administration’s tariff policies, finding that the tariffs add as much as 0.7 and 0.5 percentage points to the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures price index, respectively.

Grocery prices are higher

The Trump administration promised to lower grocery prices on Day 1, yet on Day 365 food prices continue to reach record highs. In December 2025, food prices grew at their fastest monthly rate since fall 2022. The price of beef has increased 16 percent and coffee has risen by nearly 20 percent between January and December 2025. American consumers paid more than 6 percent more for fruits, as well as for fish and other seafood, as a direct result of the administration’s tariffs, compared with pre-tariff trends. One analysis of a typical supermarket shopping cart found that prices increased by an average of 5 percent from December 2024 to December 2025. Grocery prices are the top concern for many Americans, as most adults reported feeling stressed about grocery costs in 2025 and nearly half of respondents reported difficulties affording food. This is particularly concerning as cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program go into effect following the Big Beautiful Bill that President Donald Trump signed in July 2025, a law that makes the biggest-ever cuts to people’s pantries.

There are more workers unemployed and fewer job opportunities

Unemployment ticked up to its highest level in more than four years in November 2025, growing from 4 percent in January 2025 to 4.4 percent in December. (Figure 1) While 0.4 percentage points may seem relatively small, that is an additional 638,000 workers without jobs. Job seekers are struggling to find opportunities in the current economy, with the typical person taking 10 weeks, on average, to find a job after becoming unemployed in 2025. People of color, especially Black men and women, are experiencing greater difficulty finding work during the Trump administration’s first year. Additionally, younger workers struggled to find opportunities: The unemployment rate for workers ages 16 to 24 jumped by 1.3 percentage points from January to December 2025

In a Stagnating Job Market, Job Seekers Are Struggling To Find Opportunities

Kennedy Andara, Sara Estep

FIGURE 1

The Trump administration’s first year in office marked the weakest job growth outside of a recession since 2003, with only 584,000 jobs added for the full year, compared with more than 2 million in 2024. Of those jobs, 85 percent were added before the administration announced the “Liberation Day” tariffs in April 2025. Average monthly job growth in 2025 was less than one-third of the 2024 average, at 49,000 jobs per month compared with 168,000 per month in 2024. (Figure 2)

FIGURE 2

Despite the Trump administration’s claims that the tariffs would bolster American manufacturing in 2025, the manufacturing industry lost 72,000 jobs from April to December 2025. Employment was growing slowly before the tariffs, but every month after they were enacted saw job losses for manufacturing workers. (Figure 3)

FIGURE 3

Health insurance is more expensive

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans made deep cuts to health care in the Big Beautiful Bill, and Americans are seeing the costs of health insurance rise in 2026. The Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in significantly higher premium costs for millions of Americans with marketplace coverage. For 2026, net premium payments were expected to increase 114 percent from the year prior. For people with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, premiums are projected to cost over four times more in 2026. In 2025, on average, a 55-year-old couple earning $90,000 a year paid $638 per month, or $7,650 per year, for a silver plan; today that same plan costs $2,179 per month, or $26,153 per year. Some marketplace insurers also raised rates to account for tariff impacts on the industry. As a result, 1.4 million fewer Americans have selected marketplace plans in 2026, and that enrollment decrease is expected to grow as consumers realize their costs have spiked. Americans with employer-sponsored insurance are also experiencing increased premiums, as new Trump administration regulations allow private health insurance plans to charge higher deductibles and cost-sharing this year.

5 Ways the Trump Administration Is Driving Up Health Care Costs for Families

Natasha Murphy

Residents in nearly every U.S. state face higher utility bills

Millions of residents across 49 states and Washington, D.C., will face higher utility bills or proposals for increased rates by 2027—costing consumers nearly $85.8 billion by 2028. In 2025, electricity prices increased by 2.5 times more than the annual inflation rate, which is the highest annual increase since December 2014. *** Average natural gas wholesale spot prices also increased 56 percent in 2025 from the 2024 annual average, despite President Trump’s promise to cut energy prices in half within his first 12 months. Home heating costs are projected to rise in the winter months as a result of higher energy costs, making American households in several states more vulnerable to falling behind on utility bills and facing utility shutoffs. Within the first half of the Trump administration’s second term, an additional 117,000 households went into severe utility debt—now affecting roughly 14 million Americans across the country. The Trump administration’s repeated attacks on clean energy—cutting thousands of jobs in the clean energy sector, gutting renewable energy programs, canceling or delaying private investment, and making the United States more dependent on oil—are directly contributing to rising utility prices.

Conclusion

Despite President Trump’s claims that 2025 was the “greatest first year in history” for an American president, Americans’ attitudes about their economic security and the latest economic data say otherwise. With increased costs of everyday items due to tariffs and fewer job opportunities, families are feeling the direct impacts of the Trump administration’s harmful economic policies.

BMW has long planned to begin producing Neue Klasse models at its US plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, this year. The factory has already been prepared for this transition, and the company has also established a battery assembly plant in Woodruff. Under the “local for local” concept, this facility was intended to be supplied with battery cells from AESC’s new plant in Florence, also located in South Carolina.

With the right policy interventions, shared electric mobility can accelerate sustainable urban transport, reduce congestion, and make clean mobility more accessible and affordable.","India’s urban mobility challenge is reaching an inflection point. Deteriorating air quality and worsening traffic congestion across metro cities are no longer episodic concerns, but persistent structural issues that directly impact public health, productivity, and quality of life. As policymakers sharpen their focus on clean fuels and electric mobility, Budget 2026 presents a timely opportunity to rethink how India approaches urban transport and who it is truly designed for.

Over the past few years, both the Central and State governments have taken commendable steps to accelerate electric vehicle adoption. However, much of this support has been oriented towards personal vehicle ownership, with shared mobility models receiving comparatively limited attention.

Why Shared Mobility Needs Policy Parity

Despite their potential, shared mobility models face structural barriers under current policy frameworks. Incentives and fleet electrification targets often focus on conventional EV ownership and overlook Low-Speed Electric Vehicles (LSEVs) and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) providers. This is despite the critical role LSEVs play in last-mile connectivity, urban commuting and hyperlocal deliveries.

The challenge is compounded by the exclusion of LSEVs from EV fleet-conversion targets mandated for food delivery, e-commerce and quick commerce companies. While these mandates aim to decarbonise last-mile logistics, overlooking LSEVs limits the scale and speed at which meaningful impact can be achieved. As India’s economy expands and personal vehicle ownership rises, this policy gap risks reinforcing congestion rather than alleviating it.

LSEVs and the Realities of Urban Transport

Several states, including Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, have introduced progressive EV policies with incentives for the manufacturing and purchase of two- and four-wheelers. These are important steps. However, large-scale personal EV adoption alone will not solve India’s urban mobility challenge. Road space remains finite; congestion continues to worsen, and concerns around emissions persist as long as electricity generation is not entirely clean.

In contrast, shared LSEVs offer a far more efficient use of urban infrastructure. They enable seamless short-distance movement, strengthen last-mile connectivity from public transport hubs, and reduce reliance on personal vehicles for everyday travel. Crucially, they provide an affordable mobility solution for millions of gig workers and delivery partners who may not have the means to own vehicles of their own.

GST Roadblocks Holding Back MaaS

A critical structural challenge for shared electric mobility lies in the current GST framework, particularly in the differential treatment of battery models. Electric vehicles sold with fixed batteries attract a concessional GST rate of 5 per cent. However, under battery swapping or battery as a service models, which are essential for shared mobility and high utilisation fleets, the energy supplied is taxed at 18 per cent. This disparity creates a cost imbalance that disadvantages swappable battery ecosystems, despite their ability to reduce downtime, improve asset utilisation, and support scalable shared mobility operations.

The impact of this tax anomaly is significant. Shared mobility and MaaS operators function in a capital-intensive and price-sensitive environment, yet they cannot claim refunds on input tax credits for services. This locked capital restricts the sector’s ability to scale fleets, invest in charging and swapping infrastructure, and expand services to new cities, ultimately slowing the growth of shared electric mobility at a time when cities urgently need efficient and low-emission transport solutions.

A Budget Moment to Reset Priorities

Budget 2026 offers a crucial opportunity to recalibrate India’s clean mobility strategy. Rationalising GST for battery swapping, enabling input tax credit refunds for BaaS services, and including LSEVs within subsidy and fleet-electrification frameworks would provide immediate relief and long-term momentum to shared electric mobility.

With the right policy interventions, shared electric mobility can accelerate sustainable urban transport, reduce congestion, and make clean mobility more accessible and affordable. If India’s transport transition is to be truly transformative, it must prioritise shared solutions alongside personal ones. Budget 2026 has the opportunity to make that shift, and shape cities that move better, breathe easier, and work smarter.",https://static.businessworld.in/Budget 2026 Story B_850x600 -2_20260120183005_ogImage_43.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:04:02.869389

Res. 98) that would require the ending of U.S. military force against Venezuela in the absence of authorization from Congress. Risch said the bill was unnecessary because “the recent actions in Venezuela were limited in scope, short in duration and done to protect U.S. interests and citizens. What President Trump has done in Venezuela is the definition of the president’s Article II Constitutional authorities as commander in chief.” The bill sponsor, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), said Congressional oversight was necessary because the U.S. was still taking hostile action against Venezuela, and could seize more Venezuela government officials, as it recently seized Nicolas Maduro.

At the Rochester facility, the company expects to regenerate the equivalent of 300 million articles annually that would otherwise have ended up as textile waste in a landfill. Reju’s plans call for the creation of approximately 70 new jobs, including engineers, technicians, machinists, and a variety of production roles. The company expects to be operational at the site by the end of 2029.

“New York State is committed to creating good paying jobs, and supporting innovative projects and companies that are working to keep materials out of landfills and protecting our planet,” Governor Hochul said. “Reju’s ambitious project will create approximately 70 new jobs at Eastman Business Park, and will show how smart investments can turn waste into opportunity, further supporting our state’s overall green economy efforts and creating a brighter future for everyone.”

Following remediation of the site, Reju will construct a 145,000 square-foot facility where it will use proprietary technology developed with IBM Research to regenerate textile waste, starting with polyester, into high-quality Reju Polyester. This regenerated material has a 50 percent lower carbon footprint than virgin polyester and is engineered to be recyclable multiple times, reducing the industry’s reliance on fossil-based inputs. Through partnerships with global brands, mills, and waste aggregators, Reju transforms garments destined for landfills or incineration into yarns and fabrics ready for consumer use.

Reju is owned by Technip Energies, a leading engineering and technology company with over 17,000 employees across 34 countries. Reju has been operating a pilot facility in Frankfurt, Germany since October 2024, and in May 2025, the company announced the selection of a site for its first full-scale operation in Europe in The Netherlands.

Reju CEO Patrik Frisk said, “As our first Regeneration hub in the United States, this site selection in Rochester, New York is a major leap forward in building a truly global circular system. We are proud to bring Reju’s sustainable manufacturing and jobs to the Rochester community. Reju is investing in a future where post-consumer textile waste becomes a resource, not a liability. It’s a signal to the market that circularity at scale is possible and now is the time to ensure the momentum continues to build”

Empire State Development is assisting Reju with the project through a $4 million capital grant and is offering up to $1 million through the performance-based Excelsior Jobs Tax Credit Program in exchange for job creation commitments. Monroe County, the City of Rochester and Greater Rochester Enterprise are also assisting with the project.

Empire State Development President, Commissioner and CEO Hope Knight said, “Reju’s decision to expand into New York State represents the latest in Governor Hochul’s efforts to promote a circular economy. As we continue to pivot away from the single-use, disposable model, we are supporting new ideas that reduce overall pollution and keep resources out of landfills, while boosting sustainability and generating new economic growth.”

Governor Hochul is committed to improving textile industry sustainability and recycling. In October of 2022, the Governor signed a law aimed at supporting and expanding the state's plant and animal fiber textile manufacturing industry, promoting the use of locally sourced materials in an effort to reduce environmental impact and strengthen the local supply chain. The Governor also announced $10 million in state funding for the Fashion Innovation Center (FIC), which is managed by a consortium of universities, businesses, and non-profits, that is focused on the research and development of sustainable textiles and new recycling technologies. In 2023, the State Department of Environmental Conservation also announced a plan that prioritizes a circular economy, aimed at minimizing waste, ensuring materials are kept in use.

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Under the leadership of Governor Hochul, New York State continues to lead on diverting waste from landfills and returning materials back to productive use, which creates further progress towards our climate goals. Establishing a circular economy is fundamental to reducing pollution and diverting materials from landfills. With nearly 1.4 billion pounds of clothing, footwear, sheets, towels and other textile materials thrown away in New York each year, this major textile recycling facility in Rochester will support our statewide efforts to reduce and divert waste, while creating local jobs.”

The reinvigorated Eastman Business Park, the site where Kodak began manufacturing photographic film and paper more than a century ago, is a top priority of the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council. Today, the campus supports over 100 companies, employing over 6,000 people.

Eastman Business Park President Jim Moran said, “Kodak is thrilled to welcome Reju to Eastman Business Park. We look forward to supporting Reju’s goal of building a system where textile waste doesn’t exist by leveraging the unique infrastructure and capabilities of our park.”

State Senator Jeremy Cooney said, “Today’s announcement means new jobs, new investments, and a new legacy being built in the Eastman Business Park. I want to thank Governor Hochul and Empire State Development for their work to bolster our local economy and continue to cement Monroe County as a place where businesses want to grow and expand their operations.”

Assemblymember Harry Bronson said, “I am proud to welcome Reju to Rochester and thank them for choosing Eastman Business Park for their North American textile regeneration hub. With this significant investment, they are not only contributing to our legacy as a city of innovation in arts and technology but helping to advance NY's green economy. In giving textiles a new purpose, Reju is demonstrating that the future of good jobs in New York is in renewable resources.”

Monroe County Executive Adam Bello said, “Reju’s $390 million investment is a significant milestone for Monroe County, creating high-quality green jobs and positioning our region as a global leader in the sustainable circular economy. By choosing Eastman Business Park for its first North American hub, Reju is building on our community’s rich legacy of innovation and proving that Rochester remains a premier destination for advanced manufacturing. Thank you to Governor Hochul for her steadfast support and continued leadership in bringing transformative projects like Reju to our community.”

City of Rochester Mayor Malik D. Evans said, “I am proud of the City’s Business Development team’s role in bringing Reju to Rochester, which will create good-paying jobs for our residents, power the growth of Eastman Business Park as an international employment center and strengthen our economy’s position as an innovation hub in the growing waste-reduction market. I look forward to welcoming the Reju team to Rochester and seeking opportunities to expand their local presence even further. I am also grateful to Governor Kathy Hochul, Empire State Development Commissioner Hope Knight and all the partners who helped make this tremendous investment in our city possible.”

Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce President and Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council Co-Chair CEO Bob Duffy said, “Thank you to Patrik Frisk and the whole Reju team for this significant and transformative investment in Greater Rochester. Innovations like those pioneered by Reju have always been in our community’s DNA, and we are proud to welcome this cutting-edge global company into our region. Their decision to revitalize and reuse space in Eastman Business Park is representative of a broader transformation happening in Rochester, paying homage to our historical legacy and signaling a bright future rooted in 21st-century jobs and opportunities. Thank you to Governor Hochul and all other partners who helped make this possible. We are excited to welcome Reju to Rochester and continue to support their growth and success.”

Greater Rochester Enterprise President & CEO Matt Hurlbutt said, “We are pleased that Reju chose Rochester, NY for its first North American operation, drawn by the region’s exceptional assets and advantages. GRE played an important role by connecting Reju leadership to state and local partners and identifying regional assets to accelerate the company’s growth plans. The unique infrastructure assets at Eastman Business Park, delivered by Kodak and RED Rochester partners, will support Reju’s technology and future innovations.”

(Madison, WI) — As Wisconsin voters express deep concern about rising energy costs and grid reliability, a newly released statewide survey of 500 likely voters finds overwhelming, bipartisan support for natural gas as a critical part of the state’s clean energy future.

The poll, conducted December 1–2 on behalf of Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, shows Wisconsin voters want an energy approach that lowers costs, keeps power reliable, and accelerates the transition away from coal without sacrificing affordability for working families.

Despite national rhetoric that often frames natural gas as incompatible with climate goals, Wisconsin voters, including Democrats, see natural gas as a necessary partner to renewable energy and a realistic pathway to cutting emissions while protecting consumers.

Key Findings from the Survey Include:

74% of Wisconsin voters say they are concerned about their current economic situation, underscoring the importance of energy affordability.

60% of voters report their electric bills are higher than they were this time last year.

80% of voters say affordability and finances are their top energy concern, compared to just 38% who prioritize low emissions.

69% of voters hold a favorable view of natural gas, the highest positive image of natural gas recorded in any state tested by Natural Allies to date.

78% of voters support expanding natural gas infrastructure to help transition away from coal, including strong majorities of Democrats (78%), Independents (76%), and Republicans (79%).

57% of voters support building more natural gas infrastructure to lower energy prices, compared to just 23% who favor phasing out natural gas even if it leads to higher bills.

73% of voters say residents and businesses should have the freedom to choose the energy that works best for them, rejecting mandates that force electric-only buildings.

69% agree Wisconsin’s energy policy should prioritize affordable and reliable power for the state’s manufacturing and agriculture-based economy, even if it slows the transition away from fossil fuels.

“These results show Wisconsin voters are far more pragmatic than the national energy debate suggests,” said Peter Barca, President, Wisconsin Natural Allies. “Democrats want to cut emissions but also believe in protecting working families from higher costs and unreliable power. This poll makes clear that voters, including Democrats, understand natural gas is a necessary partner to renewables if we’re serious about replacing coal, keeping energy affordable, and maintaining a reliable grid. Supporting natural gas isn’t abandoning climate goals, it’s how we achieve them.”

The survey also finds that voters strongly support using natural gas to replace coal, which still generates roughly 30 percent of Wisconsin’s electricity. By a 66-point margin, voters favor expanding natural gas infrastructure to facilitate that transition, a rare point of consensus across party lines.

“Democrats don’t have to choose between climate progress and energy affordability, voters are telling us they expect both,” said former Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH), Co-Chair of Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future. “This Wisconsin poll confirms what we’re seeing nationwide: natural gas is a proven partner to renewables – lowering emissions, protecting working families from higher energy costs, and keeping the grid reliable. If we’re serious about reducing carbon emissions and winning back the trust of working-class voters, natural gas must be part of the solution.”

While Wisconsin voters broadly support renewable energy, the poll shows that purely zero-carbon mandates without regard for cost or reliability face significant skepticism, particularly among working and middle-class voters. Instead, voters favor a balanced energy mix that keeps power affordable and dependable as clean energy technologies continue to scale.

The findings come as Wisconsin faces growing electricity demand driven by manufacturing growth, data centers, and electrification trends, while voters express low confidence that large corporations will fully absorb the cost of new infrastructure without passing it on to consumers.

The poll was commissioned by Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future and conducted by MAD Global Strategy, a bipartisan public strategy firm. The data is based on a text-to-web survey of 500 likely voters residing in Wisconsin and is part of a broader series of state-level energy polls conducted across the country.",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:04:43.151698

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, TSE:NBM is a Neutral.

The score is held down primarily by weak financial performance (pre-revenue operations, widening losses, and ongoing cash burn with funding dependence). Offsetting this are constructive technical trends (price above major moving averages with moderate momentum) and a strong set of positive corporate developments tied to orders, offtake, and scaling efforts; valuation provides limited support due to negative earnings and no dividend yield.

Since our announcement in July at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, the joint venture has been laying the necessary groundwork to move as quickly as possible to build new, dispatchable generation to serve large-load data centers in Pennsylvania.

In addition, we support legislation that's been proposed in Pennsylvania to facilitate construction of new, dispatchable generation in the Commonwealth. That proposed legislation includes long-term contracting provisions with independent power producers and would also allow regulated utilities, including PPL Electric Utilities, to build and own regulated generation again. We continue to believe that whoever is able and willing to build new generation should be encouraged to do so. And at PPL, we are absolutely willing and able to be part of the solution.

We're committed to bringing our expertise forward to move the President's announcement from concept to reality. And we will continue to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including federal and state leaders and data center developers, to address today's energy challenges and ensure a safe, reliable and affordable energy future for our customers ─ all while enabling the U.S. to win the AI race.""

“From a consumer point of view, I’d say 2026 will be a very positive year,” Sullivan said.
For dealers and consumers, these issues changed some buying patterns and, in many ways, altered the sales calendar.
Sullivan said the stars are aligning as the industry moves into 2026.","Driving Forces

‘Turbulent.’

Of all the single words that could be used to describe what kind of year 2025 was for the auto industry and individual dealers, Peter Wirth believes that one works best.

And it might even be an understatement.

Indeed, a sector that was working itself back to normalcy after COVID, chip shortages, a lack of inventory, scarce supplies of used cars, and inflation was hit with tariffs as well as a seismic shift in priority when it comes to electric vehicles.

This added up to some interesting times — that’s another adjective used heavily to describe the year that was — as well as a roller-coaster year for sales that ended up mostly flat or a few percentage points higher than 2024.

“It wasn’t a bad year; it was just a lot of ups and downs and changes — with tariffs being the obvious one, but there was also the huge change in course as far as electric vehicle adoption, which had a huge impact on manufacturers, but also on us,” said Wirth, owner of Mercedes-Benz of Springfield, referencing the expiration of federal tax credits for new and used vehicles after Sept. 30 and an abrupt U-turn on mandates concerning the percentages of new car sales that had to be EVs.

Carla Cosenzi, president of TommyCar Auto Group, which boasts four stores selling Nissan, Hyundai, Volkswagen, and Genesis, agreed. She said 2025 was a solid year, one that started strong as consumers sought to beat tariffs and ended somewhat sluggishly.

“We started to really see it around October,” she said, adding that manufacturers, perhaps anticipating a slowdown due to factors ranging from tariffs to still-high interest rates, ramped up the incentives to engage consumers, who stand to benefit from higher inventories.

“Overall, it was a really good year for us,” she said, adding that Hyundai and Nissan both posted solid numbers and finished strong, making up for some slower months in the middle.

As 2026 rolls on, the pendulum is shifting even more toward normalcy and perhaps less volatility, although no one can project too far ahead in this business, said Ben Sullivan, chief operating officer for Balise Motor Sales, which owns 26 dealerships across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

Indeed, the focus is shifting back to hybrids and gasoline-powered cars, and manufacturers are providing plenty of incentives to buy and lease them, including 0% financing in some cases, he said, adding that he projects 2026 will be a good year for auto buyers and, thus, a better one for dealers.

“From a consumer point of view, I’d say 2026 will be a very positive year,” Sullivan said. “And from the dealer perspective, we’re actually pretty bullish on where this is going to go. Affordability is such a key part of consumer behavior, and the fact that availability and the incentives are going to be there for the consumers prompts us to believe we’ll be growing by 5% to 7% this year.”

Wirth agreed, noting that Mercedes has rolled out aggressive sales programs for January.

“Mercedes is putting their money where their mouth is as far as being on a growth trajectory,” he explained. “They sold 303,000 units last year, and they want to sell 325,000 to 330,000 this year; that’s a 10% increase, and it’s one of the reasons we’re incredibly optimistic for this year.”

“It wasn’t a bad year; it was just a lot of ups and downs and changes — with tariffs being the obvious one, but there was also the huge change in course as far as electric vehicle adoption, which had a huge impact on manufacturers, but also on us.”

For this issue, BusinessWest talked with area dealers about the turbulence of 2025 and the prospects for more normalcy, probably the most since COVID, in 2026.

Shifting Gears

As he talked with BusinessWest about the year that was and the years ahead, Wirth said he sympathizes with car manufacturers, who have had to cope with many different, and often dramatic, changes to the landscape in recent years, especially with tariffs and changing policy on EVs.

“I don’t envy my colleagues in corporate because it’s really hard to deliver on three fronts at the same time — electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and combustion-engine cars, which is what’s happening right now,” he said. “This significant change in policy — and no one knows how it’s going to change in three years again — makes it really difficult for the manufacturers.”

Sullivan agreed. “For manufacturers, it takes three to five years to develop a vehicle program, and they were all assuming that, at some point, we’d have to be 100% electric, and they put a bunch of their development money down that stream,” he explained. “And now, the federal government is saying that this is no longer what they need to do. So all the manufacturers are trying to adjust and adapt just in the EV market — and that was just one of two large challenges that hit us last year.”

The other factor was tariffs, which hit some makers harder than others, he said, noting, as others did, that these factors are prompting hard decisions, many of which will take years to materialize, about where cars will be made — and what cars will be made.

For dealers and consumers, these issues changed some buying patterns and, in many ways, altered the sales calendar.

Indeed, when tariffs were first announced last March, there was a surge in sales as consumers looked to beat the tariffs, said Wirth and others we spoke with, making March and April better than they normally are and some of the subsequent, normally heavier months lighter.

“When you look at the first half of the year, it shook out the way we expected; it was just more volatile,” he said, summoning another word to describe 2025. “You had a higher high than you were projecting, and then a lower low.”

This was just one of the many intriguing aspects of this past year, said those we spoke with, noting that what is being called a retrenchment on EVs was certainly another. Indeed, sales spiked in the run-up to the end of the $7,500 federal government purchase incentive on Sept. 30, resulting in a record for the third quarter of 2025 (about 12% of the U.S. market), before falling off in the months that followed.

Cosenzi said EVs are still selling, in part due to incentives offered by the state, but they were off by roughly 10% in 2025 over the year prior — better than many other dealers are reporting because the TommyCar dealerships are in Hadley and Northampton, which she described as a great market for EVs — and this pattern is expected to continue into 2026.

The focus is now shifting to hybrids and gasoline-powered cars, with an even greater emphasis on SUVs, said Sullivan, adding that, due to the tariffs and shifts on EVs, makers are doing some model trimming because some offerings are no longer popular, cost-effective, or both.

Drive Time

Looking down the road and toward the year ahead, those we spoke with expressed optimism about the big picture and the manner in which car makers are incentivizing consumers to buy and lease.

As Wirth noted earlier, Mercedes has set ambitious goals for 2026 and is backing them up with programs and incentives that are similar to those intended to drive sales at year end.

“Our January programs are essentially as good as our outgoing December programs were, which is something I’ve never seen before with them,” he noted. “They’re really trying to hit the ground running and maintain and ultimately increase their market share in the luxury market.

“They were all assuming that, at some point, we’d have to be 100% electric, and they put a bunch of their development money down that stream. And now, the federal government is saying that this is no longer what they need to do.”

“And while it’s still very early,” continued Wirth, who spoke with BusinessWest in the first week of January, “they seem to be starting on the right foot.”

Cosenzi and Sullivan agreed, noting that conditions are right for a solid 2026, meaning dealers have inventory (especially for what’s in demand, meaning hybrids and SUVs); they have incentives, including attractive lease deals and financing rates for purchases; and are stocking more used cars, although they’re still in somewhat short supply.

“We’re putting a lot of focus on used vehicles heading into 2026, especially those under that $30,000 price range,” said Cosenzi, adding that TommyCar has created a buying center to maximize opportunities in a still-challenging market and build an inventory.

“We’re really working to have the right-priced pre-owned vehicles that can go through the stringent certified process to give the consumers the confidence they’re looking for,” she explained, adding that there is strong demand for such vehicles, especially SUVs, in the Five College area.

Sullivan said the stars are aligning as the industry moves into 2026. “Interest rates are starting to trend down, and availability of cars is getting better, unlike during COVID,” he noted, adding that the attractive incentives that were being offered to incentivize EVs, back when the pressure was on to sell those models, have been shifted to gas and hybrid models.

“Now that the manufacturers are not under that regulation anymore, you will see in 2026 some better incentives coming back, like attractive lease payments, low APR, and customer cash, because the manufacturers can afford to do that,” he explained. “So I think that will be a very big positive for consumers as we roll into 2026; their affordability matrix will be a lot better than it was in 2024 or even 2025.”

Meanwhile, Sullivan sees some general improvement in used car availability as new car inventories have improved and consumers can replace aging vehicles and enter into new leases rather than buying cars coming off lease, and this is another source of optimism heading into 2026.

As for EVs, dealers still have them, and they’re still selling them, but the pendulum has swung, with those who have been on the fence about such vehicles now more incentivized to stay on the gas or plug-in hybrid side, the latter of which provides some attractive middle ground for those looking to reduce their carbon footprint.

These are just a few of the issues that will shape 2026, a year that will still be interesting, but probably — that’s probably — less turbulent for dealers and consumers.",https://businesswest.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Autos2.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:04:10.275735

Fair value edged down slightly from US$21.62 to US$21.43, which points to a modestly lower central estimate for the units in the updated model.

The discount rate moved marginally lower from 7.90% to 7.87%, a small adjustment to the required rate of return that feeds into the valuation.

Revenue growth was revised from 7.70% to 7.20%, reflecting a more conservative stance on how quickly the top line is expected to expand in the forecast period.

The net profit margin nudged higher from 6.35% to 6.41%, indicating a slightly stronger assumption for how much profit the business could keep on each dollar of future revenue.

The future P/E was adjusted from 14.75x to 14.69x, which is a very small change in the earnings multiple applied to projected results and keeps the overall valuation framework broadly consistent.

The House will vote on H.J. Res. 140 to overturn former President Joe Biden’s block on new mining on 225,000 acres in the Superior National Forest near an area of 1,000 lakes along the border with Canada called the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

Not only would the legislation scrap protections valued by environmentalists, but it would also continue the GOP’s use of the rule-busting Congressional Review Act for actions that have not been traditionally seen as rules.

“Mining is huge in Minnesota. And all mining helps the school trust fund in Minnesota as well. So it benefits all schools in the state,” said sponsor Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), chair of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.

Stauber and the administration are eager to see Twin Metals, a subsidiary of Chilean mining firm Antofagasta, develop a mine in the national forest.

“By locking up the Duluth Complex — the world’s largest untapped copper-nickel deposit — President Biden cemented our nation’s reliance on foreign adversarial nations like China for critical minerals that will be necessary for the United States to compete and win in the 21st Century,” Stauber said in a release last week.

The Congressional Review Act makes it easier for Congress to overturn administration rules by simple majority within a certain timeframe. Because the Biden administration did not submit its Minnesota mining limits as a rule, they remained vulnerable.

Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) is helping lead the opposition and argues the CRA, signed by President Bill Clinton, wasn’t meant to go after the withdrawal of federal lands from new drilling and mining. Democrats are still examining the procedural options if the bill reaches the Senate.

“Pete Stauber is attempting to use a devious strategy to undo what has — after extensive review — been settled policy for years,” Smith said in a statement. “It would set a dangerous precedent. It is also dramatically unpopular. Minnesotans have made it clear they do not agree with Stauber’s efforts to sell out the Boundary Waters to line the pockets of a Chilean mining company. I will fight this effort as strongly as I can.”

Last year the Senate parliamentarian ruled against using the Congressional Review Act against Biden-era EPA waivers for California emissions rules. Republicans then moved to bypass the ruling.

Even though using the CRA against a land withdrawal would be unprecedented, it’s similar to the GOP using the law against land-use plans and development restrictions in several states. Democrats then called it an improper application of the law that left decades of natural resources plans open to being struck.

Ingrid Lyons, executive director of Save the Boundary Waters, said she’s trying to “prevent this dangerous, unprecedented use of the CRA which fundamentally threatens public lands and other land management agency decisions, making them vulnerable to any politicized nullification attempt that anyone in Congress wants to make.”

She added about her opposition to Stauber’s measure: “It’s about the Boundary Waters, but it’s also so much broader.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/70/d7/e6fa143f41c393e5b788580f2d07/u-s-congress-86364.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:58:28.950423

Barrage scheme could play key role in protecting property and wildlife habitats from rising sea levels

Change follows detailed studies using updated Environment Agency flood maps

As work continues on building the business case required for schemes of national public interest, new studies have revealed how the world’s largest tidal power project on the River Mersey would protect communities and wildlife habitats from flooding.

Detailed analysis of updated Environment Agency flood maps shows how the proposed Mersey Tidal Power project would not only provide enough clean energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes for 120 years but would also protect homes and businesses from rising sea levels.

As a result, Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has announced a major evolution of the project – transforming it from a clean energy scheme into a dual-purpose infrastructure project that will offer flood protection.

The change, which the Combined Authority will be asked to approve at its 23 January meeting, follows detailed studies which show the Mersey estuary faces significant risk from sea level rise. A tidal barrage could play a critical role in mitigating these risks, safeguarding homes, businesses, and vital infrastructure across the region.

Originally conceived as a renewable energy project to harness tidal power from the River Mersey, the tidal barrage scheme now aims to deliver a dual benefit: generating up to 1 giga-watt of low-carbon electricity and providing long-term flood protection. This aligns with Liverpool City Region’s Climate Action Plan and resilience strategy.

Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said:

“Mersey Tidal Power has the potential to deliver clean, predictable energy for up to 120 years, create thousands of skilled green jobs and apprenticeships, and cement our place as Britain’s Renewable Energy Coast.

“But as we further shape these plans, we’re also being honest about the reality we face. Rising sea levels are already changing our coastline, and we must adapt. A tidal barrage on the Mersey could become a major line of defence – protecting homes, businesses and vital infrastructure, while setting a new national example for how we respond to climate change.

“The Thames in London already has flood defences, and this is now a consideration for areas the Mersey runs through. Because this is about far more than generating energy – it’s about future-proofing our region. By building flood protection into its design, we’re tackling two of the defining challenges of our time: cutting carbon emissions and strengthening our resilience to climate change.

“Quite simply, the case for tidal power has never been clearer – for our economy, our communities and our planet.”

Councillor Anthony Burns, Cabinet Member for Net Zero, added:

“The Mersey Tidal Power Project is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver clean, affordable energy while protecting our communities from the impacts of climate change. It’s an iconic solution that will benefit our region for decades to come.”

The project, classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project under the Planning Act 2008, is currently in Phase 4 of development, which includes environmental assessments, engineering design, and preparation for a Development Consent Order submission. While the full business case is now expected in 2030, the Combined Authority continues to work with Government and partners to accelerate progress.

At noon ET today, it will have been one year since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term, during which he promised to Make America Great Again, again. That was his high-level pledge to voters, but at rallies and in interviews, the eventual winner of the 2024 election made hundreds of specific promises about what he would do when he returned to office.

Academic research suggests national leaders generally follow through on their campaign platforms—a 2017 cross-national study found governing parties fulfill a “clear majority” of pledges—but has that been true of Trump during the first year of his second term? To find out, TMD analyzed 142 rallies that Trump spoke at in the run-up to the 2024 general election—along with five press conferences, 13 interviews and podcasts, two debates, and 33 other appearances—and broke down hundreds of distinct campaign promises.

Trump and his administration have done a number of things in office that he did not discuss or emphasize on the campaign trail—striking Iran’s nuclear program, capturing Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, dramatically expanding his use of the pardon power—but today’s piece focuses on the promises Trump did make during the 2024 campaign, and whether or not he followed through.

Here’s what we found:

Immigration

Regaining control of America’s southern border and cracking down on illegal immigration more broadly were the most consistent and prominent themes of Trump’s campaign. As he told a crowd in Freeland, Michigan, on May 1, 2024, “On day one of my new administration, I will seal the border, stop the invasion, and send Joe Biden’s illegal aliens back home where they belong.”

More specifically, one of his most frequently made promises was to carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.” As he clarified in Glendale, Arizona, on August 23, 2024, “larger even than President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s.” In his first campaign rally for his re-election, in Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023, Trump promised to “use all necessary state, local, federal, and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”

So, did Trump carry out the largest deportation operation in American history? According to a December 19 Homeland Security Department press release, the agency’s enforcement operations have deported more than 622,000 people since Trump took office in January, in addition to an “estimated 1.9 million self-deportations.” A recent New York Times analysis puts the total number of deportations closer to 540,000, including 230,000 people arrested inside the country by ICE officials and 150,000 people arrested by Customs and Border Protection agents at the border. That’s fewer than the 650,000 total deportations in 2024 and the 590,000 in 2023 under Biden, when border crossings were at record highs.

That said, the Trump administration has dramatically shifted interior enforcement. The Times found that deportations from ICE arrests inside the country during Trump’s first year have already exceeded the total such deportations during Biden’s entire term. The Trump administration also expanded enforcement against illegal immigrants without additional criminal records, with Cato Institute analysis showing that as of late November, 73 percent of ICE detainees had no criminal conviction, and arrests of people without criminal convictions or charges increased more than 1,200 percent year-over-year.

Other specific Trump immigration promises included:

“immediately ban all sanctuary cities in the United States.” (Madison Square Garden, on October 27, 2024).

“will deploy the U.S. Navy to impose a fentanyl blockade ... boarding and inspecting ships to look for fentanyl.” (Dubuque, Iowa, September 20, 2023)

“invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network.” (Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024)

“end catch and release … restore Remain in Mexico. … bring back Title 42.” (Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, on September 28, 2024)

“sign on day one, an executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of illegal aliens.” (Pickens, South Carolina, on July 1, 2023)

“shut down all entries through Kamala’s migrant phone app.” (Saginaw, Michigan, on October 3, 2024)

“demand that Congress impose criminal penalties on any future administration that erases America’s borders.” (Columbia, South Carolina, on January 28, 2023)

“immediately ask Congress for funding to hire 10,000 new border agents.” (Tempe, Arizona, on October 24, 2024)

“ban all welfare and federal benefits from illegal aliens.” (Tempe, Arizona, on October 24, 2024)

How’s he faring on those promises a year later?

Trump announced last week that, effective February 1, the government would suspend all federal funds to 11 states hosting sanctuary cities, in addition to Washington, D.C. He has not attempted to “ban” or “prohibit” them as he pledged on the campaign trail.

The U.S. Navy has not imposed a blockade to bar fentanyl shipments from reaching the U.S., though the military’s dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific in recent months targeted boats that the administration claimed were smuggling drugs.

Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March to deport suspected affiliates of the Venezuelan-based gang Tren de Aragua, though a federal appeals panel issued an injunction in September blocking the move.

Axios reported last February that ICE had released 461 illegal immigrants under “catch and release.” The Trump administration moved to restore the “Remain in Mexico” program but not Title 42 restrictions, which would allow for the immediate expulsion of migrants on public health grounds without permitting them to make asylum claims.

On day one, Trump signed an executive order redefining constitutional birthright citizenship to exclude individuals born in the U.S. to parents residing in the country unlawfully or on a temporary legal status. Courts have blocked the move, but the Supreme Court picked up the case in early December and is expected to weigh in on the merits this year.

On Inauguration Day, the Trump administration terminated CBP One’s asylum appointment function, which had allowed nearly a million migrants to legally schedule their arrival at ports of entry. In March, DHS relaunched the app as CBP Home, retaining some original features—such as Form I-94 access and cargo inspection scheduling—while adding a new function allowing illegal immigrants to register for voluntary self-deportation.

Trump has not urged Congress to pass any legislation penalizing foreign countries for illegal immigration into the U.S. The president did cite such immigration as a reason for placing tariffs on Mexico.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) allocated funding for 3,000 additional customs officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents.

Trump issued an executive order in February stipulating that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens,” and, in April, moved to eliminate all legal pathways for illegal immigrants to obtain benefits from Social Security Act programs.

As with his plans for illegal immigration, Trump has at least attempted to fulfill most of his campaign pledges around legal immigration.

On September 20, 2023, Trump told a rally in Dubuque, Iowa, that he would “bring back the travel ban and expand it even further.” In December, his administration placed complete travel bans on 19 countries and partial travel bans on 19 others, and on January 14, the State Department announced it was suspending all approvals of permanent visa applications from 75 countries. The crackdown also extended to legal refugees. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has moved to end temporary legal status for nationals from 11 countries, although courts have temporarily blocked the administration from immediately revoking legal credentials in some cases.

In Derry, New Hampshire, Trump promised to “implement strong ideological screening of all immigrants,” and in Las Vegas on October 28, 2023, he told the Republican Jewish Coalition that he would “cancel the student visas of Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in a policy alert issued in August, updated its protocol to allow officers, in cases “where an exercise of discretion is required,” to screen applicants for “any involvement in anti-American or terrorist organizations.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that the Trump administration revoked 300 student and other temporary visas, telling reporters at the time, “If they’re taking activities that are counter to our foreign, to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we’ll revoke the visa.”

One notable promise remains unfulfilled. Trump told the All-In Podcast—co-hosted by David Sacks, his current White House AI and Crypto Czar—in June 2024 that when “you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card.” The Trump administration has not created a program to extend green cards or other temporary legal protections for recent college graduates.

Foreign Policy

One of Trump’s other most-repeated campaign promises was to swiftly end the Ukraine war. In 2023, he told crowds in Windham, New Hampshire, that “before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled.” He would repeat this line, verbatim, in Rock Hill (South Carolina), Greensboro (North Carolina), Rome (Georgia), Vandalia (Ohio), Freeland (Michigan), Wildwood (New Jersey), and Green Bay (Wisconsin), among many other places and states.

At some events, Trump changed this deadline to after he entered office. On August 5, 2024, he told livestreamer Adin Ross, “If I win, the first thing I’m going to do is get Putin and Zelensky to make a deal.” He also told a CNN town hall on May 10, 2023, that, upon reentering the White House, he would “have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”

One year later, however, the war is still ongoing. Though negotiations continue, the Kremlin has refused to engage in any ceasefire proposals, maintaining that Russia will only accept a permanent peace deal if that deal provides Russia with the entirety of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, among other stipulations. That’s a nonstarter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who maintains that his country will not cede territory to Russia. Still, Trump has tried to negotiate a deal and has positioned the U.S. as a leading intermediary in the talks. Trump has invited Zelensky and Putin to the U.S. for separate in-person visits, and a U.S. delegation—led by White House special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner—has met regularly with Ukrainian and European diplomats, as well as Kremlin authorities. Most recently, Witkoff and Kushner spoke with Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend, and both sides plan to discuss negotiations again later this week in Davos, Switzerland, ahead of the World Economic Forum. To learn more about the state of the war and negotiations to end it, read the January 9 issue of TMD.

Besides Ukraine, Trump’s foreign policy pledges included:

“build an iron dome over our country, a state-of-the-art Missile Defense Shield, made in the USA.” (January 22, 2024, in Laconia, New Hampshire)

“hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for unleashing the China virus upon the world.” (Manchester, New Hampshire, April 27, 2023)

“ask for the resignations of every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster.” (Asheboro, North Carolina, on August 21, 2024)

“immediately reinstate all sanctions on the murderous Iranian regime” and “shut down Iranian energy.” (Derry, New Hampshire, October 23, 2023)

“demand that Europe pay much more for the cost of defense.” (Freeland, Michigan, May 1, 2024)

“begin the largest peacetime recruitment drive in the history of the Armed Forces.” (Asheboro, North Carolina, August 21, 2024)

On these:

Trump has laid out plans for what he has since referred to as the “Golden Dome” and selected the design for the system’s missile defense shield, hoping that it will be operational by January 2029, a target that analysts say is unrealistic. Last week, Trump posted on Truth Social that acquiring Greenland was “vital for the Golden Dome.”

The Trump administration has not officially cited China’s role in the lead-up to the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification for numerous trade restrictions on China, including tariffs.

Though Trump has called for firing military officers involved in the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal and the Pentagon is conducting a formal review, no officers have yet been fired specifically for their role in the pullout.

The Trump administration has repeatedly issued sanctions on the Iranian regime and its affiliates shipping Iranian oil and other illicit products. Last week, Trump announced in a Truth Social post that he would add a 25 percent tariff rate increase to any country “doing business” with Iran.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member nations in June agreed to increase defense spending from 2 to 5 percent of that country’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035.

Last month, Defense Department spokesman Sean Parnell said that, in fiscal year 2025, the military recorded the largest share of its annual recruitment target in more than 15 years.

“Woke” Issues & Education

Another one of Trump’s most-repeated promises on the campaign trail was to keep biological males out of women’s sports. Transgender policies and other issues related to “wokeness” were a core theme of the campaign, with Trump promising to:

“sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity.” (Concord, New Hampshire, on January 19, 2024)

“not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.” (Doral, Florida, on July 9, 2024)

“create massive incentives for states and school districts to adopt crucial reforms to protect parents’ rights.” (Columbia, South Carolina, on January 28, 2023)

“support universal school choice.” (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 22, 2024)

“sign a law to prevent child genital mutilation in all 50 states.” (Rapid City, South Dakota, on September 8, 2023)

“ban the Department of Veterans Affairs from wasting a single cent to fund transgender surgeries or sex change procedures.” (Windham, New Hampshire, on August 8, 2023)

“restore the Trump ban on transgender in the military.” (Dubuque, Iowa, September 20, 2023)

Trump issued several gender-focused executive orders on his first day back in office, including one that rescinded dozens of orders issued by the Biden administration. One of those day-one orders redefined federal definitions to recognize only two sexes, mandated that government-issued documents and passports “accurately reflect the holder’s sex,” blocked federal funding of “gender ideology,” and required federal inmates to be held in detention centers matching their sex. Trump also targeted federal diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that same day, signing an executive order to end what the Trump administration called “illegal and immoral discrimination programs.” That included revising federal policies and training procedures to end “discriminatory” DEI practices, and terminating all DEI and “environmental justice” positions and programs in the federal government. Shortly after, Trump signed two more orders that:

blocked the federal government from funding surgical or hormone-based gender-transition interventions and research for minors, and

implemented a plan to review and remove “gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology” from public K-12 schools.

Months later, in late September, the Trump administration froze more than $65 million in federal funding to school districts in Chicago, New York City, and Fairfax, Virginia, for maintaining their DEI and transgender policies—including for school athletics and bathrooms—against the request of federal officials. Last month, the administration proposed new rules to pull Medicaid and Medicare funding for hospitals that provide gender-transition surgeries, hormone treatment, or other puberty-suppressing interventions.

On the other promises:

In January, Trump signed an executive order, titled “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” that blocks the beneficiaries of federal funding from promoting “gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology.” That same order also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to coordinate with state attorneys general and local district attorneys to pursue legal action against K-12 teachers and school officials who facilitate a minor student’s social transition.

Trump signed an executive order in February to pull federal funding from universities and local school districts that require students to receive the COVID-19 immunization. The order does not address mask requirements.

Trump’s January executive order targeting “radical indoctrination” in public K-12 schools also directed administration officials to create a plan that ensures school policies protect parental rights.

In a different executive order issued in late January, Trump laid out plans to expand school-choice offerings.

In a January executive order, Trump barred hospitals and medical institutions that provide surgical or hormone-based gender-transition interventions and research for minors from receiving federal funds.

In March, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that, in response to a Trump-issued executive order, it would no longer provide gender-transition hormone therapy for those not previously receiving the treatments.

Trump revoked a Biden-issued order that permitted transgender individuals to enter the U.S. military, and, in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Defense Department to restrict “individuals with gender dysphoria” from joining military service while legal challenges continue.

Economic Policy

On the campaign trail, Trump pitched a renewed American economy built on tariffs, killing the so-called “Green New Deal,” and dramatically increasing American energy production and manufacturing. He told his supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, on October 3, 2024, that “starting on day one of my new administration, we will end inflation, and we will make America affordable again.”

Year-over-year inflation decreased slightly in the first three months of Trump’s term, according to the consumer price index, and in no month was the annual inflation rate higher than 3 percent, the rate when Trump took office. Inflation remains nowhere near its multi-decade peak immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic, but concerns about prices have not been completely alleviated, with annual inflation above 2.5 percent each month since June.

Trump has reversed course on several climate initiatives, though. On his first day in office, he re-withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement and ended federal calculations estimating social costs of greenhouse gas emissions. Earlier this month, the Trump administration withdrew from 66 United Nations entities, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Trump also signed orders to deregulate oil production and fast-track permits for fossil fuel and nuclear power development, and the Interior Department in October opened 1.56 million acres in the tundra of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling. U.S. crude oil production reached an all-time high in October, the last month for which data is currently available, averaging nearly 13.87 million barrels per day—an increase of about 5.5 percent from January.

During the campaign, Trump promised a hardline trade agenda—notably stating in October 2024 that “the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff, and it’s my favorite word”—and planned for the trade restrictions to come in the form of a “Trump Reciprocal Trade Act.” Rather than legislation, however, he instead signed an executive order on April 2, a day Trump deemed “Liberation Day,” only to issue a 90-day pause on the duty hikes one week later.

Trump also promised a number of changes to tax policy. He said that, “when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips” (Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 9, 2024); that there would be “no tax on overtime, and very important for your seniors, no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors” (Greenville, North Carolina, on October 21, 2024); that he would “support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one” (Madison Square Garden, on October 27, 2024); and that he would “make interest on car loans tax-deductible” (Prescott Valley, Arizona, on October 13, 2024). The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that he signed into law last summer allows workers to deduct tips from their federal income in tax filings, allows non-exempt workers to deduct overtime pay, makes certain seniors eligible for additional tax deductions, expands the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and allows owners of certain cars purchased after 2024 to deduct up to $10,000 of their car-interest loan. More generally, Trump promised to “make the Trump tax cuts permanent” (Waterford Township, Michigan, on February 17, 2024)—and the OBBBA permanently extended tax cuts passed in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

On a range of other promises:

“will terminate Biden’s atrocious electric car mandates and rapidly restore American energy independence.” (Council Bluffs, Iowa, on July 7, 2023)

The Biden administration never implemented an explicit electric vehicle mandate, though the EPA finalized emissions standards that critics characterized as a de facto mandate. The OBBBA removed tax credits for new electric car purchases and imposed stricter foreign-entity-of-concern requirements on battery manufacturing credits, while also planning to ease regulations on gas-powered vehicle emissions.

“end Joe Biden’s natural gas export ban on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, who I love.” (Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, April 13, 2024)

In January, Trump lifted a Biden administration pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permit applications, and, one month later, the Energy Department approved its first new LNG export project.

“cut your energy prices in half … in 12 months.” (Traverse City, Michigan, on October 25, 2024)

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the U.S. city average price of gasoline fell 3.4 percent in the 12 months ending December 2025, while the price of electricity rose 6.7 percent and natural gas climbed 10.8 percent over the same period.

“end the Biden assault on ethanol.” (Council Bluffs, Iowa, on July 7, 2023)

While the Biden administration expanded market protections for ethanol, such as issuing temporary summer waivers and allowing sales of higher-ethanol-content gasoline, the Trump administration issued the same emergency waiver in April.

“revoke China’s most favored nation status” and “implement a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods and gain total independence from China.” (Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023)

The U.S. has not revoked China’s “most favored nation” trade status, but Trump issued a presidential memorandum in January directing Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to examine whether China is abiding by trade accords. The U.S. currently charges an effective tariff rate of more than 30 percent for most Chinese imports, down from a brief peak of 145 percent in April. Trump has not announced any four-year plan for trade policy with China.

“ban Communist China from buying up American farmland and other critical infrastructure.” (Council Bluffs, Iowa, on July 7, 2023)

In July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released a national security plan sharing that the agency planned to expand disclosure requirements for foreign owners of U.S. farmland and increase penalties for “late and knowingly false filings.”

“will put 100 or 200 percent tariffs on every car” built in a Chinese-owned Mexican plant. (The Joe Rogan Experience on October 25, 2024)

Trump has not levied new tariffs specifically targeting Mexican-based, Chinese-owned auto facilities.

“create a new Cabinet position for a senior member of my administration, who will be tasked exclusively with doing everything in the federal government’s power to reduce the cost of living.” (Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 31, 2024)

While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in March that Trump plans to appoint an “affordability czar” and advisory council, no such positions have been established to date.

Crime & Law

On the campaign trail, Trump called for many different classes of criminals to automatically get the death penalty. He told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire, on April 27, 2023, that he “will ask Congress to pass legislation ensuring that drug dealers, drug kingpins, and human traffickers receive the death penalty,” then told another crowd in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on April 2, 2024, that he would ask for a bill “ensuring that anyone who murders a police officer will receive immediately the death penalty.“ At many campaign events, he announced, “I’m hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or law enforcement officer.”

In office, Trump lifted the Biden administration’s 2021 pause on federal executions and directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of a law enforcement officer or capital crimes committed by an illegal immigrant—but the president’s order applies only to federal charges.

Trump did fulfill one of his most repeated campaign promises: “to take over the horribly run capital in Washington, D.C.” In August, Trump placed the D.C. Metropolitan Police under federal control and deployed thousands of National Guard troops alongside a surge of federal law enforcement officers. City figures show that violent crime decreased 29 percent in 2025 from the year before, with homicides falling 32 percent, robberies dropping 37 percent, and sex abuse down 29 percent—though crime had already been declining before the federal intervention, and researchers dispute how much credit the National Guard deployment deserves. The administration also cleared dozens of homeless encampments and adopted a no-tolerance policy for street homelessness in the nation’s capital—though critics note that cleared homeless people generally relocate to less visible locations rather than entering housing. Still, the White House’s D.C. agenda has largely focused on security rather than his broader promise to “clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city.” His D.C. rebuilding effort has mostly been isolated to the East Wing of the White House.

Trump also repeatedly promised “to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime.” In office, Trump signed an executive order in April to provide legal assistance and indemnification to law enforcement officers “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”

He also told a crowd in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 3, 2024, that not only would his administration “never defund the police,” but it was going to “overfund the police if we have to.” To date, the Trump administration hasn’t boosted federal funding to local police departments, and the Justice Department terminated 373 grants worth about $500 million, primarily to nonprofits, providing funding for projects such as community violence intervention and victim services.

Trump also promised to “direct the DOJ to investigate every radical district attorney and attorney general in America.” In October, a federal grand jury indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James—who filed a civil lawsuit against Trump in 2022—on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. But a federal district judge dismissed the indictment in November, ruling that acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan, whose office filed charges against James, was improperly appointed.

In August, Trump partially followed through on his promise in State College, Pennsylvania, on October 26, 2024, to “put in legislation immediately upon getting to Washington that makes it an absolute penalty to burn our American flag [of] one year in prison.” He didn’t sign any law on the matter, but he issued an executive order directing Bondi to prosecute individuals who desecrate the American flag and, in doing so, break “applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.” To learn more about the order and its potential legal implications, read Kelsey Dallas’ SCOTUSblog explainer.

Another promise that was partially completed was to pardon January 6 offenders on a “case-by-case [basis],” with a particular focus on those who weren’t violent, as Trump told Time magazine on November 25, 2024. Though he did follow through on this, his eventual pardon was much more sweeping, applying to more than 1,500 January 6 offenders, including individuals charged with and convicted of violent acts.

On unfulfilled pledges, Trump has not made any moves to “establish a federal task force to use every authority that we have at our disposal to end squatting in America” (Green Bay, Wisconsin, on April 2, 2024), nor “appoint a real special prosecutor to investigate every detail of the Biden crime family of corruption” (Pickens, South Carolina, on July 1, 2023).

Other Promises

Trump delivered nearly 1,000 hours of campaign speeches, media appearances, and interviews in the run-up to the 2024 election, and the above focuses primarily on the issues that he brought up most frequently. At points during the campaign, he also promised:

“if I’m elected this November, for the first time ever, your government will pay for or require insurance companies to pay for all costs associated with IVF fertility treatment.” (Johnstown, Pennsylvania, on August 30, 2024)

“will support baby bonuses for the new baby boom that will be coming.” (Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023)

“land an American astronaut on Mars.” (Latrobe, PA, on October 19, 2024)

“ask Congress to put a bill on my desk delivering national concealed carry reciprocity.” (Manchester, New Hampshire, on April 27, 2023)

“will support a constitutional amendment to put term limits on members of Congress.” (Waco Texas, on March 25, 2023)

“will hold a competition to build new freedom cities throughout our country, giving countless Americans a new shot at home ownership.” (Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023)

“will build a full-service VA hospital in New Hampshire right now for your veterans.” (Concord, New Hampshire, on January 19, 2024)

“will once again make stopping veteran suicide a top priority of my administration.” (Windham, New Hampshire, on August 8, 2023)

“abolish every Biden COVID mandate and rehire every patriot who was fired from our military with an apology and with back pay.” (Windham, New Hampshire, on August 8, 2023)

That he would release the Epstein list and UFO files (Lex Fridman podcast, on September 3, 2024)

Release the JFK files (The All-In Podcast, on June 20, 2024)

In office:

In October, the Trump administration announced that the pharmaceutical company EMD Serono would invest in IVF drug manufacturing operations in the U.S. In February, Trump directed his administration to prepare policy recommendations to expand in-vitro fertilization (IVF) accessibility and lower IVF treatment costs.

Trump told reporters in April that a one-time, $5,000 payment for new mothers “sounds like a good idea to me,” though no such initiative has advanced to date. The closest has been the announcement of his “Trump Accounts,” which would give parents who opt in a $1,000 government-funded investment account for their newborn—a long-term savings vehicle rather than immediate cash support.

NASA is continuing with its pre-existing plans to send a crewed mission to Mars by the early 2030s as part of its Artemis exploration program.

Trump has not lobbied congressional members to approve federal concealed carry reciprocity, and while Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina introduced the proposal in Congress, the bill has yet to reach a vote on the House floor.

Trump has not pushed lawmakers to pass a constitutional amendment to implement term limits for congressional seats.

While investors have reportedly met with U.S. officials to discuss establishing deregulated “freedom cities,” including potentially on federally leased public lands or Greenland, the Trump administration has not moved forward with any such plans.

In May, Trump issued an executive order to conduct a feasibility study and action plan for expanding a Veterans Affairs medical center in Manchester, New Hampshire ,to a “full-service” hospital.

Speaking before a Senate committee in May, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said that the agency’s $588 million annually spent toward veteran suicide prevention research had not considerably reduced suicide rates and called for more efficient procedures. In an interview in late March, when asked about the $588 million in suicide prevention research funding, Collins emphasized, “We’ll spend whatever it takes to save a life, but we’re also got to do it in a way that actually shows a return on investment.”

In January, Trump ordered the military to reinstate service members who had been discharged or voluntarily left for failing to comply with COVID-19 vaccine requirements. Trump issued a pardon for former Army Lt. Mark Bashaw, who was court-martialed for refusing to abide by the military’s COVID-19 protocols. In August, the Trump administration wiped personal COVID-19 immunization and exemption-request records for all federal employees.

After initially opposing the public release of the “Epstein Files,” Trump signed a bipartisan legislative measure directing the Justice Department to release unclassified, Epstein-case-related files. The agency began sharing heavily redacted records last month.

Trump in January ordered that case files related to the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy, his brother and former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. be made public. In March, the National Archives released the last round of previously withheld information related to JFK’s assassination.

The politics of natural gas in the age of Trump Connecticut has had its own love-hate political relationship with gas over the last 15 or so years.","Doug Burgum, the U.S. Department of Interior secretary, said the quiet part out loud.

It was a few days before Christmas, an hour or two after he had announced that five offshore wind projects under construction — including Connecticut’s Revolution Wind — was being halted “due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.”

Burgum told Fox News another story: “We have a solution in New England right there, which is natural gas from Pennsylvania, which would generate power five to 10 times more than all these … five projects put together.”

Natural gas.

In some circles it’s viewed as the holy grail of power supply. In others it is one of the worst climate change nightmares imaginable. And then there’s pretty much everything in between.

The U.S. produces more natural gas than any other nation. It also exports more. The Trump administration has clearly said it wants to do more of both. That was a pillar of President Donald Trump’s day one executive order, Unleashing American Energy, which put renewables like wind and solar on notice while creating a glide path for extracting and marketing more fossil fuels.

The general public has many mistaken notions about natural gas. That it is clean. That it will lower energy prices. Even that it occurs as a liquid like oil. And for sure that it is a panacea.

The misconceptions about natural gas extend to its economics and its politics. But they start with what it actually is, beginning with its name.

What’s in a name

Natural gas was given that name more than a century ago to differentiate it from the prevalent form of gas at the time, which was manufactured from coal. That gas was known as coal gas, town gas, coke gas, manufactured gas — among other names.

Natural gas, most often found alongside oil, came out of the ground as gas — so it was called “natural.” It came into wide use after World War II.

These days, some environmental advocates want to change the name to highlight its main component — methane.

“Typically I don’t call it natural gas,” said Deborah Gordon a senior principal at the energy think tank RMI, where she leads the oil and gas solutions initiative within the Climate Intelligence Program. She is an engineer with a deep background in energy and has written specifically on the myths and realities of natural gas.

Underground, Gordon said, natural gas is anywhere from 60% to 90% methane. After it’s processed, the natural gas delivered via pipeline to New England is closer to 90% or more methane, she said.

Gordon is among many who point out that methane is a potent greenhouse gas. And the problems start well before it is burned as a fuel. The biggest of the problems is methane leaks into the atmosphere, Gordon and others say.

In the first 20 years after it is released, methane has more than 80 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide, CO2, which is the most abundant greenhouse gas. After that, methane turns into carbon dioxide, at which point it adds to the long-term heat trapping and greenhouse gas buildup CO2 creates — some of which can last thousands of years.

The 2025 Global Methane Tracker report released in May by the International Energy Agency, IEA, stated: “Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality.”

“The way we often talk about it is, CO2 building up in the atmosphere tells you how much warming the planet is ultimately going to experience over generations,” said Mark Brownstein, senior vice president of energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund, EDF.

He previously worked for the electric and gas utility PSEG, which at one time owned the Bridgeport Harbor power plant.

“Methane in the atmosphere tells you something important about how fast the rate of increase is going to be,” he said. “Reducing methane from the oil and gas industry is the most immediate, impactful and cost-effective thing that we can do to slow the rate of climate change.”

Methane leaks when the gas is extracted, when it moves through pipelines and at many other points as it’s distributed to heat homes, pumped into power plants to generate electricity or super-cooled to convert it to liquefied natural gas for transport overseas by tanker.

Peter Raymond, a professor at the Yale School of the Environment who studies and measures global methane, said the biggest source of leaks is from waste — landfills and wastewater treatment facilities. Close behind are the natural gas leaks. Much farther behind is agricultural methane — mainly produced by ruminants, mostly cows.

“The biggest leak is in exploration,” Raymond said of natural gas leakage. “There’s considerable leaks in the distribution system that you can map and find. There’s efficiency to gain along the whole supply chain,” he said.

“Basically you don’t want it in the atmosphere at all because it has this very high potency over its short lifetime. Stopping it from leaking immediately stops that warming immediately,” said RMI’s Gordon. “CO2 builds up very slowly over time, and so stopping CO2 today, which we want to do, won’t remove all that has been built up over the last 100 years in the planet.”

Natural gas also contains standard pollutants — and those can leak, too. Gordon said they’re a mixture of everything the gas touched while it was underground, plus the volatile organic compounds methane, ethane, propane and butane. All of it can also contribute to smog.

“The whole thing is a combination of air pollution and greenhouse gas,” she said. “If the air pollution was your only issue, [gas] in fact would be a better choice than coal or oil, and it is less carbon intensive than coal or oil. So over the long term, it does have some marginal benefits relative to either one of those fuels. But when there are leaks, it does have this profound impact in the near term.”

The extent of methane leaks from natural gas and its other sources also reflects local regulatory controls, including containment systems to minimize leaks and protocols to find and fix them. Brownstein at EDF said extraction around the Marcellus Shale — the area in the Appalachian Basin that extends through Pennsylvania into New York — has better controls than the Permian Basin, which is largely in west Texas.

He said a recent EDF report showed that emissions on the New Mexico side of the Permian Basin are half of what they are in Texas. “And why is that?” he said. “Because New Mexico has a regulatory framework in place that requires companies to manage their methane emissions, whereas in Texas, they don’t.

“The first question that I would have for anybody championing natural gas coming into Connecticut is, what has the state of Connecticut done to make sure that the methane emissions are managed well within the border?” he said. “And two, what is it that suppliers bringing gas into Connecticut should be doing to manage the methane footprint of the gas that they’re selling into the region?”

A spokesperson for the American Gas Association, which says it represents more than 200 local energy delivery companies, reiterated statements on its website that “emissions from natural gas distribution systems have declined 70% since 1990,” though did not specify which emissions.

She said the group was “committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through smart innovation, new and modernized infrastructure, and advanced technologies.” The site also lists among its commitments to “further reduce methane emissions from natural gas utility systems,” and it notes that AGA has put in place a reporting system for companies to document methane reduction actions. It also states that natural gas is “clean.”

AGA did not respond to questions about whether it supported the Trump administration delay of stricter methane emission standards, but noted the the local distribution companies were already exempt from the tighter standards.

Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP, has a pipeline safety group that monitors and manages leaks. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regulates the gas distribution system within the state.

But all Connecticut’s gas comes from outside its borders, and that interstate movement is overseen by federal entities.

“We don’t have jurisdiction to regulate those activities,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. Producers, she said, have been better about stemming leaks at the wellheads and production facilities. Lost gas is also lost money for them.

DEEP tracks methane emissions in its annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, which monitors the state’s progress towards its emissions goal. “While Connecticut has reduced fugitive emissions from older gas infrastructure by replacing older cast iron gas lines with newer PVC distribution lines, fugitive emissions have risen imperceptibly since the previous year,” its most recent report, released in September, stated.

Connecticut does not include the emissions that occur in the production of gas that eventually comes into the state. “This inventory does not capture the full effect of methane leaks into the atmosphere from the natural gas distribution system because natural gas consumed in Connecticut is produced and stored out of state,” the report also stated. New York, California and Washington do include that in their inventories.

“I think what keeps us up the most [at night] is that policymakers seem to be still reaching for gas as a solution for affordability, despite how much has changed to the contrary about the affordability of gas in the last 10 years,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of clean energy and climate programs at Acadia Center, a regional advocacy group for clean energy and climate change solutions.

He said even though the climate concern is still there, “we still are very concerned that natural gas would actually have an upward impact on energy prices and exacerbate the current affordability dynamics in the region.”

The counter-intuitive economics of natural gas

In certain policy circles, there has been no shortage of discussion, news stories and market analysis about the economics of Trump’s push for more U.S.-produced natural gas. And they all get at a similar idea — as gas production increases, so will the price for U.S. consumers. That may sound counterintuitive.

There are good reasons for it, though.

One is that even if all the gas was destined to be used in the U.S., producers would still need to drill, produce and transport it. Who would pay for that, including new pipelines and all the other construction components? U.S. consumers.

But a lot of the gas is not destined for use here. Much of the Trump administration’s motive for boosting production is to sell it to other countries — especially European countries trying to stop using Russian gas. They’ve been willing to pay relatively high prices, which gas producers certainly like.

If U.S. buyers want some of that gas, in order to be competitive they would to have to match those European prices. Even if you strip out the costs of liquefying it and transporting it to Europe, U.S. buyers would still face higher prices for natural gas, which seems to leave them stuck between a rock and a hard place.

The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, EIA, shows how stark that price increase was in 2025 alone, despite an increase in gas production. Last year, the average wholesale spot price for the benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana increased by 56% compared to 2024, when prices hit the lowest on record when adjusted for inflation. (Prices tend to be higher in winter than summer when gas is used for both electricity and heat.)

The average prices for the two hubs used by the Northeast — one in Boston and one in New York — doubled over that same period.

According to an analysis of EIA data done by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, there were record exports of natural gas — mainly as LNG — over the course of the first nine months of the Trump administration. They went up 22%. Costs for natural gas consumers also went up 22%.

January data from EIA predicts the benchmark natural gas price will decline in the beginning of this year, before rising sharply into 2027.

Michael Oristaglio, senior research scientist and lecturer in earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, and former director of the university’s energy studies program, said that could leave the oil industry in a bind. Since oil and gas often are a two-for-one drilling proposition — with oil prices too low for companies to want to invest and oil demand declining as well — drilling for more gas could go down with the oil ship.

“That is the issue in the Permian Basin,” he said. “The Marcellus is a little different. It’s one of the only shale formations that just produces natural gas.”

Compromising the ability to build new gas infrastructure is a shortage of natural gas turbines that is predicted to last until 2030. And even if the infrastructure could get built, tariffs might raise the cost — again, something that consumers would likely have to bear.

Even so, Connecticut is not ruling out a tilt back to natural gas use, despite years-long efforts to pivot away.

Dykes said DEEP is researching the many factors around fossil fuel use, including the critical cost-benefit analysis, as it develops its next Integrated Resource Plan, IRP, which assesses future electric needs. While she noted that the cost of electricity is highly sensitive to the delivered price of natural gas in New England, she also referenced the marching orders from her boss.

“Gov. Lamont has been speaking for more than a year now about the importance of considering all energy options as a part of an all-of-the-above approach. And he’s been very interested in understanding what the potential benefits might be of expanding gas access, particularly to help make energy costs more affordable and make the grid more reliable,” she said.

At the opposite end, Dykes has to factor in how to meet the state’s decarbonization goals and mandates. She pointed to additional gas as a potential counter-balance to renewable power that may not be available 100% of the time. But she admitted that trying to weigh the many sudden moves by the Trump administration — such as the second shutdown and now court-ordered restart of construction on Revolution Wind — can make that process daunting.

“I think the only thing that anyone really can say with certainty is that the list of uncertainties continues to grow,” Dykes said. “Unfortunately, that doesn’t relieve us of the necessity of making some decisions and making some investments, with the best information we can, to help ensure that we have a reliable and affordable grid that can meet the long term policy goals that the legislature has set here in Connecticut.”

Brad Campbell, president of the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, CLF, and a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator, said that the conventional wisdom for many years was that if you wanted to lower electricity prices in New England, all you had to do was build more infrastructure to get more gas in. But he said that’s a misconception.

“Building more pipes isn’t going to reduce prices for New Englanders when the price of the commodity going into the pipe is going higher and higher,” he said. “Running another pipe — the gas industry expects that to be borne on the backs of ratepayers.”

Brownstein of EDF also pointed out that gas, unlike renewables such as wind and solar, comes with the ongoing cost of having to pay for every unit that’s consumed.

“When you say that a new gas pipeline will be run into New England, or you say that New England will build a whole bunch of new gas plants, ultimately you will pay for that every time you turn on your lights, and every time you turn on your stove,” he said. “It’s very nice for the Trump administration to say that you need all this and you should want it. It’s another thing to say to a homeowner in Connecticut, ‘Guess what you’re going to have to pay for.”’

Brownstein said in recent travels to Europe, he heard worries about the continent becoming too dependent on U.S. gas — namely, if energy prices begin to rise in the U.S., would the Trump administration restrict exports in order to keep energy prices in the U.S. low?

“They see that simply replacing their dependence on Russian gas for dependence on American gas may not be a smart bet either, particularly as the United States has become a less predictable ally,” Brownstein said.

Add to that the current dispute the U.S has with new E.U. regulations for monitoring and tightening methane emissions on oil and gas coming into the E.U. beginning next year. The U.S. has asked for an exemption. It’s unclear how that could play out — but it could push prices higher.

And there are also questions about how to move forward with existing gas infrastructure. Spend the money to repair it when needed? Replace it if necessary? Even expand it?

“We’re not doing the right cost-benefit analysis to determine where the public should be putting its money,” said Noah Berman, senior policy advocate and utility innovation program manager at Acadia Center.

That’s where politics comes in.

The politics of natural gas in the age of Trump

Connecticut has had its own love-hate political relationship with gas over the last 15 or so years. In 2013, in the state’s first Comprehensive Energy Strategy — developed by the then-new Department of Energy and Environmental Protection — converting to natural gas was a go-to strategy.

Its key goal was to take advantage of cheap prices from the fracking boom to convert more than 300,000 homes and businesses from oil to natural gas heat. Gas was touted as cleaner and a bridge fuel from oil to renewables.

Climate advocates were incensed, predicting it would entrench gas for a generation or more. There were also concerns about the lack of pipeline capacity and the cost of building out infrastructure to distribute gas to homes.

While the policy stayed in place for years, the goals were never reached and it quietly vanished as the focus turned to electrification through heat pumps, rooftop solar and storage.

But much of the region did not look kindly on more gas lines or plants. A study done in Massachusetts 10 years ago found that more gas lines weren’t needed until at least 2030. While some gas generation was built, and oil-burning plants converted to gas, local opposition contributed to stopping others — including a plant planned in Killingly.

New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine are, to varying degrees, exploring what are referred to as “future of gas” policies — ways to wean states off using natural gas, from very gentle pushes towards heat pumps to strict rules barring new gas hookups for homes and businesses.

But with Trump’s pro-fossil fuel and anti-renewables policies in place, New York has delayed implementation of its gas bans that would have started on Jan. 1. The state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, is now considering allowing a gas pipeline to be built after years of opposing it. The concession is said to have been the price for restarting Empire Wind construction after the first time Trump ordered it stopped earlier in 2025, though Hochul claims that is not the case. (The project was one of those recently stopped again.)

Massachusetts has recently made moves towards backing off some its climate goals — though a longstanding ruling, which keeps utilities from charging customers for new gas lines, remains in place.

Connecticut has been on the sidelines for much of this — especially cutting back on gas use. Legislation that has promoted future of gas evaluations has failed more than once in recent years, and EIA data shows that gas consumption in the state is rising.

“Connecticut is an outlier on gas consumption rates among the rest of the region,” said Acadia’s Dickerson. “If you isolate just Connecticut, the rest of New England is actually flat or declining gas consumption over the past five to 10 years.”

Acadia supports consideration of non-pipeline solutions — like promoting heat pumps, solar or geothermal energy — to avoid recommitting to natural gas when existing infrastructure has reached the end of its useful life or has safety issues.

The Trump administration has been steadily endeavoring to peel away safeguards against greenhouse gases as well as standard emissions of all sorts. It’s keeping coal plants open past their planned shutdowns. And the administration is close to rolling back more restrictive Biden administration standards for mercury and carbon emissions.

For methane specifically, it has delayed until 2034 stricter emission standards also put in place by the Biden administration. A number of groups, including EDF, are challenging that in court.

“There’s no question that the Trump administration is working to put a thumb on the scale of oil and gas,” said Brownstein of EDF. “Doubling down on natural gas exacerbates a methane problem that they’re taking no action to solve, and, in fact, undoing work that the previous administration did that actually would have made a material difference.”

An open question is whether the Trump administration — through its energy emergency executive order, or any other energy actions including quid pro quos to restart offshore wind and other projects — will be able to force natural gas into or through a state that doesn’t want it.

On Jan. 13, the EPA announced a proposed rule to limit states’ ability under the Clean Water Act to deny federal permits for infrastructure like gas pipelines if the state feels they pose a hazard to water bodies. It follows a proposed rule issued in November that would remove federal pollution protections from many inland waters and most wetlands.

“They are absolutely trying to override state authority. And their theory is that anything states do that burdens the oil and gas industry — anything that burdens big oil and big gas — should be overridden because it interferes with the President’s authority in declaring the energy emergency,” Campbell at CLF said.

“I think at the end of the day, the political pressure on governors to deliver on an affordability agenda is going to drive the same changes in policy, the same changes in the utility model and utility practice that we need to decarbonize the grid,” Campbell said. “But the one thing that seems certain is that deepening our addiction to natural gas for heat and electricity is going to only going to take us in a less affordable direction.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AIM-image1-Cromwell-CT-scaled-e1768910206180.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:01:17.668991

It will fund a greenfield 141 MW/677 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and refinance a co-located 141 MW utility scale solar PV plant, alongside a portfolio of 18 small scale distributed generation (PMGD) solar plants totalling 121 MWp. Together, these assets will enhance grid stability, reduce renewable energy curtailment, and displace carbon-intensive generation, directly contributing to Chile’s ambitious decarbonisation goals.

DNV was engaged by Toesca to provide comprehensive market consultancy for this highly diverse portfolio, spanning multiple technologies, scales, and geographies from the Atacama Desert to the Biobío Region. DNV’s experts conducted detailed market due diligence to evaluate project feasibility and performed quantitative and qualitative reviews of complex power purchase agreements (PPAs), including those with distribution companies. A key component of DNV’s work was optimising the financial viability of the BESS through advanced revenue stacking analysis, power price forecasting, and stabilised price modelling – providing lenders and developers with critical insights into future market risks and revenue opportunities.

Chile’s energy transition is advancing at remarkable speed. The country has already achieved over 60% of its electricity generation from renewable sources in 2025, with solar power alone accounting for more than 30% of total generation capacity. Chile was the first Latin American nation to introduce a carbon tax in 2017, and it is now phasing out coal faster than any other developing economy. In the first 11 months of 2025, renewable curtailments reached 5 TWh (around 15% of the available wind and solar generation), highlighting the urgent need for storage solutions to fully harness the nation’s abundant solar and wind resources. The integration of large scale battery systems such as T Power’s BESS represents the next critical step in ensuring reliability and resilience as Chile moves toward its net-zero target by 2050.

“Securing financing for a multi-technology, multi-site portfolio requires deep market insight and a clear analysis of long-term revenue streams and risks,” said Brice Le Gallo, Regional Director for SEMELA, Energy Systems at DNV. “Our advisory services helped Toesca and its financing partners navigate this complexity, demonstrating how strategic storage deployment is essential for unlocking the full potential of Chile’s renewable energy abundance and supporting its national climate ambitions.”

The successful closure of this financing package, advised legally by White & Case LLP and Claro & Cia on the Sponsor’s side and Milbank LLP and Barros & Errazuriz on the lenders’ side, highlights the crucial role of specialised technical and market advisory in de-risking large scale energy infrastructure investments. DNV’s contribution was instrumental in bridging the gap between the project’s innovative design and the requirements of international financiers, ensuring the bankability of a portfolio that is set to become a cornerstone of Chile’s cleaner energy matrix.

At its center are questions about whether it’s legal for a president to unilaterally leave a treaty approved by the Senate — and if a future president could reenter it without the Senate voting again.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change serves as the foundation for international efforts to address global warming and is the precursor to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Participation in Paris depends on being a signatory to the convention.

President George H.W. Bush ratified the treaty with the Senate’s overwhelming approval in 1992. Trump threw that into reverse two weeks ago when he identified the UNFCCC among dozens of international organizations from which he would cease engagement. It came after he has shuttered climate offices across the government, halted offshore wind projects and urged world leaders to abandon efforts to slow global warming.

Now Trump is testing the reach of his executive authority by exiting the UNFCCC.

According to the treaty’s withdrawal clause, the U.S. can leave the convention a year after notifying the United Nations in writing. (It’s the same timeline for exiting the Paris Agreement, which will take effect for the U.S. next Tuesday.)

Whether a president can unilaterally leave a treaty under U.S. law is not addressed in the Constitution. The Supreme Court declined to answer the question in 1979, in Goldwater v. Carter, when President Jimmy Carter terminated a bilateral defense treaty with Taiwan, in order to establish formal relations with China. Congress opposed the move and Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) sued with other lawmakers. A four-justice plurality determined that while the Constitution outlines the Senate’s role in ratifying a treaty, it is silent on the chamber’s role in abandoning one.

Presidents have unilaterally withdrawn from treaties for decades. Those include the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which President George W. Bush withdrew from in 2002; and a treaty that normalized relations with Iran that Trump quit during his first administration.

“In the last 50 years, almost all U.S. treaty withdrawals have been done unilaterally by presidents,” Curtis Bradley, an international law professor at the University of Chicago, said in an email.

The mainstream legal view is that the president may quit a treaty if it’s permitted under international law and “neither the Senate’s resolution of advice and consent nor a congressional law has put limits on withdrawal,” former deputy climate envoy Sue Biniaz and law professor Jean Galbraith, argue in a recent piece in Just Security.

Some legal scholars argue that just because presidents exercise the practice of quitting treaties, it doesn’t mean the law grants them the power to do it. There have been various attempts in recent years to codify whether the power of withdrawal is exclusive to the president, or if they need help from lawmakers.

So what happens now? And is it likely that Trump’s single-handed withdrawal from the UNFCCC will be legally challenged?

First, a few questions need answers, said Harold Koh, an international law professor at Yale Law School and a former State Department legal adviser.

One is timing.

An opponent of Trump’s move could trigger a lawsuit at any time, but showing standing to sue — which legal scholars say is likely to prove challenging — would be harder if the withdrawal hasn’t been formally instituted.

A White House official said the State Department was preparing the official notification that will be sent to the U.N. Once that occurs, the U.S. would withdraw from the treaty one year later.

Next, who can bring a case?

Lawmakers could argue that the president’s action seeks to nullify a legislative branch vote and legally challenge it using what’s known as congressional standing, said Koh.

Or Congress could pass a bill saying congressional approval is needed before Trump can withdraw. The chances of that are extremely unlikely in a Republican-dominated Congress, where lawmakers have generally shrugged off Trump’s plan to quit the treaty. Even if both chambers passed such a bill, Trump could veto it. Overriding it would require a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate.

It’s also possible that another party could sue Trump, such as an individual, a state or an environmental group. The case might be difficult to bring to court, because they would have to show standing — or that they were injured by the withdrawal, said Koh.

“The standing problem with climate change, obviously, is that everybody is harmed by climate change,” he added. “So it’s hard for one individual to claim an unusual or extraordinary harm.”

A state, such as California or Massachusetts, could argue that global warming leads to a greater chance that disasters, like floods, cause increasingly expensive damage to its infrastructure or economy.

The challenge there is that the UNFCCC doesn’t contain specific obligations to reduce emissions, making it hard to show how a particular state could be harmed in a concrete way by the U.S. leaving the convention.

“I think there are real and serious harms to U.S. withdrawal,” said Galbraith at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, who added that tying those damages to a geographic location, and showing how they could be redressed, would be difficult.

“If there is a party who can sue, my guess is that the courts would either hold that the dispute presents a political question that cannot be resolved by the judiciary or they would side with President Trump on the merits,” said Bradley, from the University of Chicago.

Legal challenges could also await a future president who tries to exert executive power to reenter the treaty.

The main question would be whether Trump’s withdrawal canceled the Senate’s prior consent, requiring new legislative action, said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. That’s never been decided.

“It’s possible the courts would say that’s a political question the courts can’t handle. It’s also possible courts say it’s not a political question, but it doesn’t have standing,” Gerrard said.

Galbraith of UPenn thinks a future administration would be able to reenter the UNFCCC based on the Senate’s 1992 ratification.

To do that, a president might issue a proclamation or memo outlining their decision. Under international law, they would only need to notify the U.N. in writing of their decision to rejoin, Galbraith said. It would take 90 days to become official.

Of course, that could be challenged. And the case could end up at the Supreme Court, which traditionally gives deference to presidents on matters of foreign affairs.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/7f/ec/fde508e34fef8b3dba133873e83a/ee-cw-schonhardt-unfcc.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:58:32.571910

This story, by Elise Plunk, was originally published by Louisiana Illuminator.

Communities around Louisiana, in a bid to get more information about the environmental and health impacts of industrial pollution, are taking data collection into their own hands — despite a law restricting how their research findings can be used to enforce state regulations.

The practice is called community, citizen or participatory science, and it involves data collected from non-scientists that’s passed along to researchers who use their expertise to study and understand what they mean. From air quality to fisheries impacts, the grassroots-gathered information has the potential to inform the public about impacts of nearby industry.

“Our challenge for really a couple decades has been: How can we get something that can empower the communities to be able to speak for themselves, about the issues, with data?” said Marylee Orr, executive director of Louisiana Environmental Action Network.

The Louisiana-based nonprofit, long involved with community air monitoring projects, recently posted on its website an interactive air monitoring dashboard. The site gives continuous updates from air quality sensors placed at four locations along the Mississippi River in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The dashboard also lists locations and readings from Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality monitors.

The system, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, uses stationary air quality sensors to measure spikes in air pollutant levels. Toxic emissions such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds can be detected, recorded and displayed on the online dashboard, providing neighboring communities with information about potential health risks.

Similar efforts to get hard numbers for air and water quality concerns are also happening in Cameron Parish, where community air monitoring and water quality research partnerships are expanding. The area is the site of three liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals, and six more LNG facilities are either under construction or in the planning stages.

Environmental groups, including the Habitat Recovery Project and For a Better Bayou, have been working to secure funding for air quality monitoring equipment and underwater sound research in an attempt to find the source of air pollution and fisheries disruptions in the region.

“Stories hold weight, and science and data holds weight,” said Habitat Recovery Project director Alyssa Portaro. “When we put these two things together, it really gives a robust picture of what’s going on.”

Fishermen and advocates alike suspect air quality and fisheries problems in Cameron have ties to the nearby LNG facilities but have no independent data to back up their suspicions. The environmental groups received grants to buy monitoring equipment and hire fishermen to collect data and partner with scientists for research projects.

“Nobody knows exactly what’s going on out here,” said Sky Leger, a fisherman who works along Cameron Parish’s coast. He and his girlfriend, restaurant worker Karri Hooper, recently got involved with community science monitoring, in part, to help track whether noise from boat traffic and LNG facility construction is impacting adjacent fishing grounds.

Around the country, scientific communities have seen growing acceptance of data collection in partnership with non-scientists.

“There’s been increasing recognition of the power of these types of projects to collect really useful data,” said Bradley Allf, a postdoctoral research associate at Colorado State University who uses participatory science to study urban ecology and conservation.

Allf studied the concept of citizen science data collection for his doctoral thesis, saying the research technique has grown in popularity as well as acceptance within the scientific community over recent decades.

“There was some hesitation around whether we can really trust data collected by people who haven’t necessarily been trained in science,” Allf said. “I don’t think that’s very true anymore.”

Despite its expanding acceptance, the struggle to increase transparency around industry’s environmental impact in Louisiana with community-gathered data faces legal hurdles.

The Louisiana Legislature approved a law in 2024 enacting strict qualitative standards for community air monitoring programs in order to be considered valid data that state regulators could use for oversight or enforcement.

Air-monitoring equipment and analysis must use the most current EPA-approved techniques, and data must be analyzed at labs the Louisiana Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program certifies, according to the legislation dubbed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act.

Environmental groups argue these standards, which can be costly, prices them out of being able to do research. The cost for the state’s preferred monitoring equipment runs up to $500,000, said former EPA official Larry Starfield, an adviser to Orr’s monitoring dashboard project

“That’s not something that is accessible,” said Misha Mayeur with the Habitat Recovery Project.

The equipment her group intends to buy with current grant proceeds costs around $20,000, cheaper than the regulatory monitors that cost more than their entire annual budget to buy.

The sensors the Louisiana Environmental Action Network uses for its stationary air monitoring in Southeast Louisiana, like those in Cameron Parish, aren’t up to the standards for regulatory enforcement in the 2024 state law. The regulatory monitors required in Louisiana to allege pollution violations cost around $500,000, said former EPA official Larry Starfield.

Even if the data can’t be used to enforce air quality standards for Louisiana, Orr said there’s still value in community awareness that could prompt change.

“If the data suggest a problem, it’s an opportunity for communities to invite companies to investigate their concerns,” said Orr.

Starfield said he hopes keeping the community informed could offer a way to let industry prove its willingness to cooperate and improve air quality.

“Many of the workers live in the community. Why wouldn’t you want to have a good relationship?” he said.

President and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association and Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance president David Cresson responded to the launch of LEAN’s dashboard in a statement emailed to the Illuminator, saying the association was reviewing LEAN’s data and methodology.

“We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue,” Cresson said in a statement from the association.

And if industry chooses not to cooperate, Starfield said data can help encourage state and federal entities to get involved.

“The idea is to engage Louisiana [Department of Environmental Quality] and EPA in a situation where there’s a feeling that there’s a problem here, we’re seeing a pattern,” he said. “Certainly bringing in EPA and bringing in LDEQ and asking them to investigate … that’s absolutely a good thing.”

Fishermen in Cameron used their collective voice to engage state enforcement in August when they brought to light impacts to oysters, crabs and fish from dredging spills near the site where Venture Global’s CP2 LNG facility is being built.

Venture Global initially claimed there were no sediment spills or harmed fisheries. But at the urging of fishermen, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries sent a biologist to study the area, and the official later confirmed oysters had been killed.

“The only thing that they’re going off of is by the reports of the people that Venture Global hired,” Leger said. “But we have the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries coming out here and checking the oysters … and they are saying that there is very much so a problem with sediment being on top of those oysters in the lake.”

Portaro said this example is a strong argument for informing the community, as well as involving scientists, in documenting air and water quality issues in places like Cameron Parish.

“The fishermen were able to verify that, document it; then Fish and Wildlife came out and said, ‘Yeah, there is mud in the lake,’” said Portaro. “Sometimes the biologists on the job need the community keeping an eye on them, a well-informed community.”",https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SOS-FB-SIZE.png,N,,2026-01-20 09:59:51.929514

For example, last week, the EPA announced it would stop considering the impact on human health when reviewing power plant pollution emissions.

Still, EPA’s fiscal year 2026 budget will be at an all-time low. The budget also includes cuts that would eliminate the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and defund the Office of Energy Justice and Equity.

At the same time, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is rolling out his promised “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,” aimed at eliminating 31 environmental and public health protections. For example, last week, the EPA announced it would stop considering the impact on human health when reviewing power plant pollution emissions. The EPA will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs avoided and deaths prevented from air pollution rules that curb two deadly pollutants—fine particulate matter and ozone, NBC News reported.

The compromise spending package blocks several anti-environmental riders, though, including one that would have led to the sale of public lands, and sets legally binding spending requirements to help ensure the White House can’t withhold or misuse funds.

The set of bills provides funding at near previous levels for agencies such as the Health and Human Services (HHS), National Park Service (NPS), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that play an important role delivering science, environmental, and energy programs.

According to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate change monitoring service, 2025 recorded as the third-warmest year ever recorded. Last year was only slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024—the warmest year on record. The past 11 years have been the 11 warmest on record, according to Copernicus data.

In 2025, the average global temperature was about 2.65 degrees Fahrenheit higher than from 1850 to 1900—the period scientists use as a reference point, since it precedes the industrial era in which massive amounts of carbon pollution have been pumped into the atmosphere.

Air temperature over global land areas was the second warmest last year, while the Antarctic saw its warmest annual temperature on record and the Arctic its second warmest.

The last three years, 2023-2025, were exceptionally warm for two main reasons, Copernicus explained. The first is the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from continued emissions and reduced uptake of carbon dioxide by natural sinks. Secondly, sea-surface temperatures reached exceptionally high levels across the ocean, associated with an El Niño event and other ocean variability factors, amplified by climate change. Additional factors include changes in the amounts of aerosols and clouds, and variations in atmospheric circulation.

As in 2023 and 2024, a significant fraction of the globe was much warmer than average in 2025. Air and sea surface temperatures in the tropics were lower than in 2023 and 2024, yet still much above average in many areas outside of the tropics. The lower tropical temperatures compared to 2023-2024 were partly due to the persistence of near-average or weak La Niña conditions in the equatorial Pacific throughout 2025. Temperatures over the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean were also less extreme in 2025 than in 2024.

“The fact that the last eleven years were the warmest on record provides further evidence of the unmistakable trend towards a hotter climate,” said Carlo Buontempo, Copernicus Climate Change Service director. “The world is rapidly approaching the long-term temperature limit set by the Paris agreement. We are bound to pass it; the choice we now have is how to best manage the inevitable overshoot and its consequences on societies and natural systems.”

In 2025, half of the global land area experienced more days than average with at least strong heat stress—defined as feels-like temperature of 32°C or above. Heat stress is recognized by the World Health Organization as the leading cause of global weather-related deaths. In areas with dry and often windy conditions, high temperatures also contributed to the spread and intensification of exceptional wildfires, which produce carbon, toxic air pollutants like particulate matter, and ozone, which also impacts human health. These emissions significantly degraded air quality and had potentially harmful impacts on human health at both the local and larger scales in both North America and Europe.",https://cmmonline.com/wp-content/uploads/EPA_thumbnail-4.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 09:59:56.650885

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 20%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising, and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The national average for a gallon of gasoline is down about 20% from where it was a year ago.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says that the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was re-elected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wishlist. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term, and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come, by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost one in three households, or over 80 million American Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear, and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

How long can it last? - Grist,"Katie Myers, Jake Bittle",,,,,https://grist.org/energy/trump-wright-coal-retirement-data-center-mining/,"The combination of federal intervention and rising energy demand may have stalled coal’s decline, at least for the moment.
The nation’s aging coal plants — more than 200 in all — are increasingly expensive to run, even as methane, more commonly known as natural gas, and solar become cheaper and more abundant.
Campbell coal power plant in Michigan.
“If we don’t take care of those miners that’s in there now, we’re not gonna have coal, we’re not gonna have a coal industry,” Robinson said.
Renewable energy generated more electricity than coal power for the first time last year, and Hanson said any effort to revive coal rely less on economics than on nostalgia.","Heading into President Donald Trump’s second term, coal looked like an industry nearing the end of its life. Utilities planned to retire more than half of the nation’s coal-fired power plants by 2028, no new facilities were coming online, and production had been flat for years.

Trump’s first year back in office has given the industry an opportunity to retrench. The president is an avowed supporter of coal, and his Department of Energy has repeatedly intervened to prevent plants from shutting down. At the same time, a Trump-supported boom in the construction of artificial intelligence data centers has led to a surging need for power, prompting many utilities to postpone coal facility closures.

The combination of federal intervention and rising energy demand may have stalled coal’s decline, at least for the moment. Consumption increased 13 percent last year, reversing a long downward slide and causing a bump in domestic carbon emissions. Of the 11 coal-fired plants slated for retirement last year, just two shuttered. But one of them may return: A Utah facility closed in November after losing its primary customer, but the Legislature hopes to save it by finding another buyer. Many of the utilities that committed to shutdowns over the next two years have abandoned those plans.

The administration has combined this effort to prop up coal with delays and rollbacks of rules governing pollution and miner safety, actions central to its heavily pro-coal agenda of “Unleashing American Energy.”

Still, these efforts may not reverse a decline that started nearly 20 years ago. The nation’s aging coal plants — more than 200 in all — are increasingly expensive to run, even as methane, more commonly known as natural gas, and solar become cheaper and more abundant. And although the Trump administration has promised to boost employment, layoffs have continued amid the industry’s ongoing contraction.

Coal may see a short-term reprieve, but experts see little hope of a lasting revival. “When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” said Sean Feaster of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, “it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, has played a central role in this revival by turning the Department of Energy into an industry lifeline. He has issued emergency orders delaying the retirement of at least five of the 11 plants slated for closure, and has renewed them every 90 days. That has sparked legal challenges, drawn scrutiny from regulators, and could saddle utilities and ratepayers with millions in added costs.

Wright argues that keeping them open is necessary to avoid blackouts and price spikes. Few beyond his agency are convinced. Environmental groups, energy experts, and state regulators have accused the department of misrepresenting data in its emergency claims.

“It’s just not justified,” said Michael Goggin, an analyst with Grid Strategies. “They’re grasping at what they can.” He has studied the impact of the emergency orders on behalf of Earthjustice and other groups suing to contest the delay order Wright issued in May for the J.H. Campbell coal power plant in Michigan.

Goggin warns the orders could impose significant costs on utilities. He estimates that keeping all of the various fossil fuel plants slated for retirement through 2028 open could cost ratepayers as much as $6 billion — on top of a $6 billion increase in coal-fired generation costs from 2021 to 2024. He calls the extra expense an involuntary subsidy paid by ratepayers to utilities that neither needed nor requested them.

“You’re making [the utilities] keep these plants that most likely they’re not going to need, and are very likely a waste of money,” he said. While plants like Campbell still generate a positive return from selling power, high maintenance costs make them unprofitable. That’s why many utilities have replaced them with methane or renewables.

Under the DOE orders, plant operators can seek approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover these costs from customers. Campbell’s owner, for instance, will spread the expense across millions of ratepayers in the Midwest. Other utilities, however, may struggle. A representative of Colorado’s Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, a rural co-op, said the organization has no idea how it will pay the expenses associated with a federal order to keep its coal plant in northwest Colorado running.

“We have no information available yet on cost recovery,” the representative said. “At this time, there is not a clear path for doing so.”

The Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment.

Other utilities are postponing closures to meet projected demand from AI data centers. There have been at least half a dozen such delays by investor-owned utilities in the Southeast. The largest of them in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi have retooled their investment plans over the last two years, pushing planned retirements into the 2030s.

Trump and Wright have endorsed this trend, arguing that coal should play a key role in powering these energy-hungry facilities. In an April executive order intended to revitalize the industry, Trump declared, “Our Nation’s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers.”

The situation is most extreme in Virginia, which is home to more than 600 of these operations and handles 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic. Experts believe the surge in power demand will force Dominion Energy to import more energy from fossil fuel plants beyond the state, extending the life of polluting facilities in Ohio and West Virginia.

“That region is pretty constrained in terms of supply, so that additional electricity is coming from … additional coal-fired electricity,” said Joe DeCarolis, former head of the Energy Information Administration and now a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. According to his analysis, “there’s 25 gigawatts of this aging and costly coal capacity that [will continue] to operate to meet the incremental demand that’s coming from data centers” through 2030.

In South Carolina, for instance, the utility Santee Cooper said it would need to push the closure of its Winyah Generation Plant in Georgetown from 2028 to the mid-2030s so it can meet demand from data center development. The plant has received numerous state citations for violating air emissions of sulfur dioxide and has been criticized for operating with expired wastewater discharge permits.

“I think they’re responding to market conditions and political atmosphere, and the political atmosphere is creating the market conditions,” said Marilyn Hemingway, the head of the Gullah Geechee Chamber of Commerce, who lives in Georgetown a few miles from the plant.

Hemingway is a member of a state-mandated transition council overseeing the shutdown of Winyah and Santee Cooper’s other coal assets. She said the utility has repeatedly delayed closing the plant and has yet to decide what energy source will replace coal.

“I’m not naive about this at all,” she said. “I know you have to replace it, but I find it problematic because it’s dragging this transition out.”

Living near coal plants like these may become more dangerous because of Trump’s interventions. Even as the Department of Energy has moved to keep such operations open, the Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back a suite of rules governing their air and water pollution. Over the past year, the agency repealed limits on mercury and other toxic pollutants, scrapped greenhouse gas limits, and extended deadlines allowing coal plants to dump waste, called coal ash, in unlined pits — a move that spared 11 facilities from imminent shutdown. Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior opened 13 million acres of public land for mining.

Emily Arthen, CEO of the American Coal Council, said such regulations were onerous, unnecessary, and contributed to coal’s decline. “Doing the right thing without having to be told is forefront for the industry,” she said, adding that minimal oversight allows the industry to preserve jobs.

Some miners and their families feel the sector hasn’t taken much initiative with regard to worker safety. They are particularly frustrated by the administration’s inaction on a regulation limiting exposure to silica dust, a carcinogen that causes a chronic, fatal condition called silicosis but known more commonly as black lung disease. The rule, finalized during the Biden administration after decades of advocacy, remains stuck in limbo even as the number of cases of the terminal condition skyrockets among young miners.

Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association, said her only option is to keep fighting. She and her husband John Robinson, a retired coal miner, feel betrayed by an administration whose coal production goals they initially supported. Over the past year threats to mine safety offices and layoffs at the federal agency that runs black lung screenings disrupted protections for miners. Vonda Robinson even wrote to Vice President J.D. Vance, urging him to confront the epidemic. She never received a response.

“If we don’t take care of those miners that’s in there now, we’re not gonna have coal, we’re not gonna have a coal industry,” Robinson said. Her husband, who is awaiting evaluation for a double lung transplant, said he felt abandoned by the industry that fed his family.

“The coal miner’s your workhorse,” he said of the industry’s attitude toward men like him. “When you fall over dead, we’re gonna get another horse.”

Efforts to spur new coal extraction, meanwhile, are faltering. When the Interior Department opened public lands to mining, bids came in below market rate, and three projects in the West collapsed within a month. With no new coal-fired plants planned, the market for thermal coal they burn — much of it mined in the West — remains bleak. So does the market for metallurgical coal, used to make steel, which comprises most coal mined in the Eastern U.S.

Coal mining employment held relatively steady in 2025; the mining workforce stands at around 40,000 workers, less than a quarter of its size in the 1980s. But Erin Bates, communications director for the United Mine Workers of America, warned of trouble ahead. China has stopped importing metallurgical coal used to make steel, undercutting demand for ore mined largely in Appalachia. Overall coal exports fell 14 percent between January and September 2025, and international demand is expected to plateau in the coming years as renewable energy continues to expand; coal power generation fell in both China and India last year after rising for decades.

“It’s something that will trickle down,” Bates said. “The end result is, if they can’t export this coal, and the cost of coal plummets because no one’s buying it, that’s going to mean layoffs, that’s going to mean shutdowns.”

Though one stated goal of Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” agenda is to “create jobs and prosperity” in extraction and energy production, Harvard labor economist Gordon Hanson doubts the administration’s moves will deliver. What’s actually being built, he said, are gas plants, along with wind and solar projects approved under, and funded through, the Biden administration. Renewable energy generated more electricity than coal power for the first time last year, and Hanson said any effort to revive coal rely less on economics than on nostalgia.

“Many Trump administration policies seem more symbolic than realistic,” Hanson said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump-coal-order.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-20 05:58:29.938685

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 20%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising, and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The national average for a gallon of gasoline is down about 20% from where it was a year ago.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says that the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was re-elected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wishlist. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term, and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come, by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost one in three households, or over 80 million American Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear, and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

Other sites, like Homes.com, Redfin and Realtor.com, continue to show First Street climate data in their realty listings.
“Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient.
In this way, climate risk models today are better suited to characterize the “ broad environment of risk,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.
Overall, experts tend to agree on the utility of both private and public data sources for climate risk data, even with needed improvements.","Even as exposure to floods, fire and extreme heat increase in the face of climate change, a popular tool for evaluating risk has disappeared from the nation’s leading real estate website.

Zillow removed the feature displaying climate risk data to home buyers in November after the California Regional Multiple Listing Service, which provides a database of real estate listings to real estate agents and brokers in the state, questioned the accuracy of the flood risk models on the site.

Now, a climate policy expert in California is working to put data back in buyers’ hands.

Neil Matouka, who previously managed the development and launch of California’s Fifth Climate Change Assessment, is developing a proof of concept plugin that provides climate data to Californians in place of what Zillow has removed. When a user views a California Zillow listing, the plugin automatically displays data on wildfire and flood risk, sea level rise and extreme heat exposure.

“We don’t need perfect data,” Matouka said. “We need publicly available, consistent information that helps people understand risk.”

The removal of Zillow’s data, which came a little over year after it was first introduced, began when the California Regional Multiple Listing Service questioned the validity of flood modeling completed by First Street, a climate risk modeling company, which provides climate data to Zillow and other realty sites.

“Our goal is simply to ensure homebuyers are not being presented with information that could be misleading or unfair. We have no objection to the display of accurate climate data,” the multiple listing service said in a statement.

In response to pressure from the listing service, Zillow removed all of its climate risk data, including flood, fire, wind, heat and air quality factors. Zillow still hyperlinks to First Street data in its listings, though it is easy to miss.

“Zillow remains committed to providing consumers with information that helps them make informed real estate decisions. We updated our climate risk product experience to adhere to varying MLS requirements and maintain a consistent experience for all consumers,” Zillow said in a statement.

Other sites, like Homes.com, Redfin and Realtor.com, continue to show First Street climate data in their realty listings.

First Street’s flood map shows more properties at flood risk when compared to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps, which have also been criticized for being outdated.

First Street defended its methodology. “We take accuracy very seriously, and the data speaks for itself. Our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes,” First Street said in a statement.

Both independent academic research and research conducted by Zillow has found that disclosing flood risk can decrease the sale price of a home. “Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient. It became harder to ignore in a stressed market,” First Street said.

Home by home climate risk predictions still remain notoriously difficult. A residence may, for example, fall right on a FEMA flood risk boundary. One home might be designated higher risk than its neighbor, either as an artifact of the mapping process or because of a real, geographic difference, such as one side of the street being higher than the other. Fire risk mapping, similarly, does not take into account home hardening measures, which can have a real impact on a home burning.

In this way, climate risk models today are better suited to characterize the “ broad environment of risk,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “ The more detailed you get to be either in space or in time, the less precise your projections are.”

Matouka’s California climate risk plugin is designed for communicating what he said is the “standing potential risks in the area,” not specific property risk.

While climate risk models often differ in their results, achieving increased accuracy moving forward will be dependent on transparency, said Jesse Gourevitch, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund. California is unique, since so much publicly available, state data is open to the public. Reproducing Matouka’s plugin for other states will likely be more difficult.

Private data companies present a specific challenge. They make money from their models and are reluctant to share their methods. “A lot of these private-sector models tend not to be very transparent and it can be difficult to understand what types of data or methodologies that they’re using,” said Gourevitch.

Matouka’s plugin includes publicly available data from the state of California and federal agencies, whose extensive methods are readily available online. Overall, experts tend to agree on the utility of both private and public data sources for climate risk data, even with needed improvements.

“People who are making decisions that involve risk benefit from exposure to as many credible estimates as possible, and exposure to independent credible estimates adds a lot of extra value,” Field said.

As for Matouka, his plugin is still undergoing beta testing. He said he welcomes feedback as he develops the tool and evaluates its readiness for widespread use.

“By the end of the fourth day, we had accounted for all the residents of the Double Island community,” Buchanan said.
But more extreme weather events are all but certain thanks to climate change, and today Double Island is better prepared.
The weekend after Helene hit, she said, ​“Footprint rolled into town with a bunch of solar panels.
From Lake Junaluska to Linville Falls, recipients included fire stations such as the one in Double Island and an art collective in West Asheville.","The Double Island Volunteer Fire Department in Yancey County, North Carolina, is the beating heart of this remote community in the shadow of Mount Mitchell, about 50 miles northeast of Asheville. Once home to a schoolhouse that doubled as a church, the red-roofed building still hosts weddings, parties, and other events.

“It was built to serve as a community center,” said Dan Buchanan, whose family has lived in the area since 1747 and whose mother attended the school as a young girl. ​“A place to gather.”

Sixteen months ago, when Hurricane Helene hit this rugged corner of countryside with catastrophic floods, Double Island’s fire department was where locals turned for help.

“This is [our] ​‘downtown,’” said Buchanan, who serves as the assistant fire chief. ​“In the wake of the storm, people were like, ​‘Let’s get to the fire station.’ That was the goal of everybody.”

Fresh out of retirement and living back in his hometown to care for his ailing mother, Buchanan drew on his long career in emergency response to spring into action. With the station, powered by generators, serving as their command center, he and his neighbors gathered and distributed food, water, and other provisions to those in need. They hacked through downed limbs and sent out search teams.

“By the end of the fourth day, we had accounted for all the residents of the Double Island community,” Buchanan said. And while no one in the enclave died because of the hurricane, some suffered while they waited for medications like insulin.

A lack of drinking water and limited forms of communication were also huge obstacles. ​“When we finally got the roads cleared, and people could get in here, we were literally writing down our needs on a notepad and giving it to whomever, and then they would ferry supplies,” Buchanan said. ​“A carrier pigeon would have been nice.”

Helene was a ​“once in 10 lifetimes” storm, Buchanan said, with devastation he and the community hope to never see again. But more extreme weather events are all but certain thanks to climate change, and today Double Island is better prepared.

The station is equipped with a microgrid of 32 solar panels and a pair of four-hour batteries. The donated equipment will shave about $100 off the fire department’s monthly electric bill, meaningful savings for an organization with an annual operating budget of just $51,000.

When storms inevitably hit, felling trees and downing power lines, the self-sustaining microgrid can provide some electricity and an internet signal.

“We’ll have at least a way to run our radio equipment, run our well and basic lighting and refrigeration,” Buchanan said, adding that the latter was vital for medication. ​“It may not seem like much — but that’s the Willy Wonka golden ticket.”

Communication, he stressed, was key. ​“If you can’t communicate, you can’t get the help you need.”

The microgrid project, called a resilience hub, was made possible by a network of government and nonprofit groups that came together after Helene to help fire departments like Double Island and other community centers with long-term recovery. Now, a state grant program is injecting a burst of funds into their efforts. Using both public and private time, know-how, and money, the program aims to create a model for resilience that can be replicated nationwide.

“We aren’t only preparing for a disaster; we’re also helping utility diversification, cost savings, and normalization of the technology,” said Jamie Trowbridge, a senior program manager at Footprint Project, a leading nonprofit in the initiative. Those benefits aren’t unique to Yancey County, he said. ​“We’d like to see this be a pilot for us on what scalable microgrid technology could be across all of western North Carolina — and maybe the country.”

From disaster response to long-term resilience

The Double Island experience was common in the immediate aftermath of Helene. Across the region, communities isolated by closed roads and mountainous terrain turned to their fire departments for help.

That’s part of how Kristin Stroup got involved in the resilience hub effort. Based in Black Mountain, a popular tourist destination 15 miles east of Asheville, Stroup helped start a corps of volunteers who gathered at the town’s visitor center. In coordination with an emergency operations center based at Black Mountain’s main fire station, she led over 200 volunteers in doing whatever they could, from cooking and doling out food to making the country roads passable.

“People [were] just driving around the town with chain saws,” said Stroup, today a senior manager in energy and climate resilience with the nonprofit Appalachian Voices. The weekend after Helene hit, she said, ​“Footprint rolled into town with a bunch of solar panels. I became an instant part of their family.”

With founders who cut their teeth in international aid, the New Orleans–based Footprint Project had teamed up with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, Greentech Renewables Raleigh, and others to pool donations of batteries, solar panels, and other equipment to deploy microgrids to dozens of sites in the region before the end of 2024. From Lake Junaluska to Linville Falls, recipients included fire stations such as the one in Double Island and an art collective in West Asheville.

By February 2025, Footprint had hired Trowbridge and another staff person to work in the area permanently. Footprint continued to cycle microgrid equipment throughout the region from its base of operations in Mars Hill, a tiny college town 20 miles north of Asheville that was virtually untouched by Helene. It launched the WNC Free Store, which donates solar panels and other supplies to residents still far from recovery — like those living out of RVs and school buses after losing their homes.

From the outset, Footprint had a critical local ally in Sara Nichols, the energy and economic development manager at the Land of Sky Regional Council, a local government partnership encompassing four counties that stretch from Tennessee to South Carolina.

“A lot of the other organizations we saw come through in the same way Footprint did, most of them did not stay. They leverage resources to do really important work, and when that work feels done, they go home,” Nichols said. ​“The fact that Footprint is working thoughtfully to figure out how our recovery and resiliency can be taken care of — while also thinking about their own organizational strategic growth — means a lot to me. They’ve been incredible partners.”

To be sure, assistance and rebuilding in the region are ongoing, and many systemic inequities exacerbated by the storm can’t be solved with a solar panel. But the power is back on. The cell towers are functioning. The roads are open. Piles of debris, from fallen limbs to moldy furniture, have been cleared. In relief parlance, western North Carolina is beginning to see ​“blue skies.”

That’s why it’s all the more important that Footprint, Appalachian Voices, and other local collaborators haven’t let up in their efforts. The web of organizations involved is thick and, seemingly, ever expanding. Last fall, the network announced it was deploying five resilience hubs around the region, including the Double Island project and a permanent microgrid at a community center in Yancey County.

“These projects, driven by a small group of determined partners, have accelerated Appalachia’s long-term resilience and preparedness,” Invest Appalachia, another nonprofit partner, said in a news release.

A burst of state funds to help expand resilience hubs in six counties

Now, the local public-private effort is getting a boost from the state of North Carolina. Under the administration of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat who has made Helene recovery a centerpiece of his first-term agenda, the State Energy Office will deploy $5 million from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to install up to 24 microgrids across six western counties impacted by Helene.

The money will also go to two mobile aid units for rural counties on either end of state — one in the east and one in the west. Dubbed ​“Beehives” by Footprint, these solar-powered portable units will be full of equipment that can be deployed to purify water, set up temporary microgrids, and otherwise respond to storms and extreme weather.

Expected recipients of the stationary microgrids could include first responders like the Double Island Fire Department and second responders like community centers. Peer-to-peer facilities and small businesses are also encouraged to apply.

Land of Sky and other stakeholders are choosing grantees on a rolling basis through next summer. There’s already been an inundation of applicants, and six grantees have been selected, including a community center about a dozen miles up the road from Double Island in Mitchell County. But organizers say they need more interest from outside the Land of Sky region, especially in Avery County, north of Yancey on the Tennessee border; and Rutherford County, east of Asheville, which includes Chimney Rock, a village that was infamously devastated by Helene and is slowly rebuilding.

Geographic distribution isn’t the only problem organizers have faced. Some entities — while undoubtedly deserving of assistance — aren’t appropriate for the government grant because they are located in areas at risk of future flooding.

“A battery underwater is not that useful,” Trowbridge said, ​“so if your site is in a floodplain, maybe this isn’t the right fit for you. But we definitely want you to know about the Beehive.”

“What we’re being tasked with as recipients of this money is to try and figure out how we make this a much bigger project,” she said. ​“That means we’ve brought in other partners like Invest Appalachia. We’ve been seeking other kinds of money. We’re using this state money to successfully build what could be a much more comprehensive resiliency hub model.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Hurricane-Helene-NC_GettyImages-2176579055.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0618e3e51902a58bf47e16c7f3aec3ef,N,,2026-01-20 05:59:18.900399

But in Massachusetts, sky-high bills are colliding with critical questions about the region’s future energy supply.","Just about everyone in Massachusetts agrees: Energy bills are too damn high.

Natural gas prices in the state rose 70% between 2020 and 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and its residential electricity rates are the third highest in the country, behind only California and Hawaii. Some residents are making hard choices between paying their utility bills and buying food or health care necessities.

It is almost inevitable that the issue of affordability rather than climate change will dominate energy-policy conversations in the state — and throughout the high-priced New England region — this year.

“It’s going to be the focus for both Democrats and Republicans, those kitchen-table, pocketbook issues,” said Dan Dolan, president of trade group the New England Power Generators Association. ​“Both on the gas and the electric side, utility bill concerns are going to be front-of-mind.”

Massachusetts isn’t alone in this feeling. Across the nation, utility bills are rising far faster than inflation, and energy affordability is becoming a major political issue, propelling Democrats in several states to victory in last November’s elections. But in Massachusetts, sky-high bills are colliding with critical questions about the region’s future energy supply. The Trump administration has waged an unrelenting attack on the offshore wind developments the region was counting on to deliver new electricity, and has worsened the prospects for solar, too, by slashing tax incentives and grant programs.

“It’s supply and demand, and you’re taking away a lot of the supply that was going to be coming online in Massachusetts,” said James Van Nostrand, policy director at nonprofit organization The Future of Heat Initiative and the former chair of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. ​“How do you solve that?”

While everyone acknowledges the problem, there is far less consensus on what the root causes are or how to fix them. Some on both sides of the aisle blame the cost of building renewable energy and the transmission lines needed to carry it. Others point to volatile natural gas prices and the expense of replacing aging pipes. Third-party electricity suppliers that lure unsophisticated consumers into high-priced power contracts are also exacerbating matters, say many advocates. Utilities’ profit margins are under scrutiny as well.

For elected officials, the timing makes the conversation both more urgent and more complex: All six New England governors’ seats and more than 1,200 state legislator positions across the region will be up for election this fall.

A major part of the challenge is that there are more than two sides to the argument. Almost no one is advocating for a full return to fossil-fueled power plants or for a renewables-only grid. But the spaces in between are filled with permutations and possibilities that are difficult to sum up and sell. ​“Affordability” is being used to justify widely divergent energy proposals, including plans that opponents say could make the problem worse or which trade off climate goals in the name of bringing down costs.

“The long-term solutions are complicated and nuanced, and don’t lend themselves neatly to those political debates,” Dolan said.

Action underway in Massachusetts

Though Democrats control the Massachusetts legislature by vast margins, not everyone is on the same page about how to tackle the affordability crisis.

In March 2025, Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat who is up for reelection, unveiled her energy-affordability agenda. It includes plans to create the state’s first discount rate for moderate-income households, expand tiered rates for low-income customers, and help residents access existing programs that could help them trim their bills. Two months later, she introduced a sprawling energy-affordability bill she said would save residents about $10 billion over the next 10 years through measures like reducing bill charges, making sure utilities don’t pass certain expenses on to customers, and removing barriers for nuclear development.

Last month, state utility regulators, at Healey’s request, opened an investigation into electricity and gas delivery costs, with an eye to determining if any charges can be removed, consolidated, or redesigned to save consumers money.

But in November, Democratic state Rep. Mark Cusack, House chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, countered Healey’s proposal with his own package that included many of the same provisions — alongside several that set off alarm bells in the clean-energy community.

The bill, which was approved by Cusack’s committee on a 7-0 vote, called for making the state’s 2030 emissions target nonbinding, slashing funding for energy-efficiency programming, and limiting climate and clean-energy initiatives that impact customers’ utility bills.

The existence of these provisions signals how far concerns about affordability have shifted the conversation in the state, said Paula García, senior manager of energy justice research and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“This thing of revisiting the climate commitments that the state has in place was not something that was being discussed at the beginning of last year,” she said.

Cusack’s bill, which is widely expected to be the vehicle for energy legislation this session, is now in the House Ways and Means Committee. The measure will be revised there before potentially advancing to a floor vote that could send it to the Senate.

Controlling the narrative

The bill’s final form will depend in large part on who can come up with a clean, compelling narrative to back their position, said advocates and observers. Some worry that efforts to paint energy efficiency and renewable energy as the culprits behind rising bills have gotten a head start.

“We allowed fossil-fuel interests to drive the narrative that it’s all those clean and green things,” Kyle Murray, director of state program implementation at the nonprofit Acadia Center. ​“Unfortunately, that’s what’s taken hold.”

The idea has a sort of commonsense allure: After all, energy bills have risen at the same time as Massachusetts has been increasing its focus on renewable energy development and expanding its energy-efficiency programming, so it’s not difficult to imagine a connection between these trends. The flames have been fanned by federal officials like Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who claims wind and solar are driving up costs for the states reliant on them.

Local renewable-energy opponents continue to push this interpretation of the affordability crisis. Last week, nonprofit Always On Energy Research released a report arguing that a switch to renewable power would cost New England up to $700 billion more by 2050 than leaning on natural gas or nuclear power plants. The analysis was sponsored by right-wing organizations, including the Yankee Institute, Fiscal Alliance Foundation, and Americans for Prosperity Foundation.

Murray called the report’s numbers ​“magical thinking, completely at odds with reality.” Acadia Center is attempting to counter that argument with a new series of explainers outlining its analysis of what is driving volatile energy prices, with a strong emphasis on the cost of natural gas and the benefits of renewables. Other advocates also say they will be working on educating lawmakers about the complex subject and urging them to keep up the push for clean energy.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2172092199.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=e4cc3931781b5cbfee1cc97b2d1eb7e8,N,,2026-01-20 05:58:37.885124

The US 800V electric vehicle architecture market size was valued at USD 1.13 billion in 2025. The market is expected to grow from USD 1.34 billion in 2026 to USD 9.92 billion in 2035 at a CAGR of 24.9%, according to latest report published by Global Market Insights Inc.

The demand for EVs with ultra-fast DC charging capabilities and longer ranges has increased from consumers, resulting in many OEMs implementing the Electric City (800 volts) architecture into their manufacturing processes to allow for less charging time and efficient energy usage. The consumer's need for relieving anxiousness regarding their range and provides convenience, created a push towards High-Voltage Systems and Ultra-Fast Charging stations that will be compatible with Next-Gen Electric Vehicle (NG-EV) products.

In 2025, Lucid Motors began shipping the Lucid Gravity SUV manufactured utilizing an 800-volt or higher electrical system that allows for very fast (i.e., 200 miles added to an EV in about 11 minutes on very fast CCS charging stations) and long-range (450 mile) capabilities. The introduction of the Gravity demonstrates an increasing trend of using high-voltage (800 volt or more) electrical systems in the American market for premium electric vehicles.

The three major manufacturers based out of the US i.e. Lucid Motors, Tesla Corporation, and Stellantis announced or started to introduce and increase production of 800-volt capable electric vehicle models that highlight the attributes of high-performance and the capability of being rapidly charged. In addition to providing consumers and OEM with better acceleration and Thermal Efficiency at 800V, these electric vehicles will support consumers and OEM in differentiating products in premium markets and increasing competitiveness.

In addition to EV market supplies being bolstered by federal government initiatives, such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) and the broader electrification policies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which will support the development of EV's adoption as a whole, there will be an indirect increase in the Number of Manufacturers adopting 800V Systems with Ultra-Fast Charge Stations. The actions by federal authorities serve to eliminate or reduce barriers that prevent OEM's from pursuing high-voltage Electric Vehicle deployment.

By 2025, major automotive manufacturers entered expanded partnerships with manufacturers of Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Wide Bandgap (WBG) Semiconductor manufacturers to develop High-Voltage Power Electronics Together. The collaborations created by automotive manufacturers and semiconductor chip manufacturers has helped facilitate the building of supply chains for 800-V power modules and inverters that enable the support of rapid charging, greater efficiency, and advanced performance of EV powertrain systems.

US 800V Electric Vehicle Architecture Market Trends

Automakers are adopting 800V architectures in their vehicles to provide faster charging, higher efficiency and lower thermal losses for greater range and performance in both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).This trend is growing rapidly with auto manufacturers launching new vehicles and work with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on the development of the next generation of high-voltage components.

Southeast Asia has become one of the most closely watched regions for corporate clean energy deals. As data centers and manufacturing investments spread across the region, global companies are increasingly looking for ways to secure renewable power alongside their expansion plans. The demand is there, but the pathways are still taking shape. Rules differ from market to market, timelines are uneven, and developers often find themselves working with frameworks that are evolving in real time.

These conditions are familiar to Shizen Energy, which has been operating across several Southeast Asian markets after expanding from Japan. Speaking with Rei Ushikubo, Head of Carbon Free Solutions, the focus is on practical considerations: how to gauge the maturity of local regulations, how to work with on-the-ground partners, and how to match project development timelines with corporate demand. That approach is illustrated in Shizen’s first major corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) in the region.

Structuring the Google deal as rules evolve

The PPA between Google and the Consortium formed by Shizen Energy, Solarvest and HSS Engineering in Malaysia offers a close look at how large corporate renewable energy deals are taking shape in Southeast Asia. Signed under Malaysia’s Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP), the agreement covers a 29.99 MW solar project in Kedah state, with commercial operations expected to begin in 2027.

From the start, the project developed alongside a regulatory framework that was still being refined. CGPP was relatively new when discussions began, and several implementation details continued to evolve during negotiations. “We need to keep following those regulations, and then consider the key terms on the buyer side, like Google,” said Ushikubo.

For this type of large-scale solar project, Ushikubo noted that the construction timeline is roughly comparable to that of a data center, allowing the project to be ready to supply power as demand comes online.

While Malaysia’s power system differs from Japan’s, Ushikubo said the core principles of structuring a long-term corporate PPA, such as risk allocation, remain familiar. Where the difference emerges is in how policy frameworks shape cost over time. CGPP was introduced as a capped virtual PPA program, allowing corporate buyers to purchase renewable energy attributes without physical power delivery. The program’s quota was fully subscribed by late 2023, with Shizen’s Google project among the approved capacity.

For future projects, the policy context has shifted with the introduction of CRESS. Following CGPP, the Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme (CRESS) expands access through physical electricity supply via the grid under Malaysia’s third party access framework. While the scheme removes quota limits and supports larger project sizes, wheeling charges are not fixed for the entire contract period and may be adjusted every few years. Ushikubo said this adds another layer of consideration for future projects, requiring both buyers and developers to factor potential cost changes into long-term project planning.

Local partners help bridge government communication

Beyond regulatory design, execution depends heavily on who is involved on the ground. The Google PPA also marks Shizen Energy’s first utility scale solar project in Malaysia. The project is developed by a consortium led by Shizen, in partnership with local renewable energy firm Solarvest and construction firm HSS Engineering. Ushikubo noted that local partners provide essential connections with corporate buyers and government stakeholders, while Shizen contributes experience gained from previous PPA projects in Japan. “From our side, what we can contribute is our track record in PPA, so we transferred that experience to the local market,” she said.

In Japan, Shizen Energy has executed a total of 100 MW of long-term renewable energy PPAs with Microsoft, covering four solar projects.

Aside from partnerships, Shizen’s internal teams also reflect a mix of Japanese and local talent. According to Ushikubo, most members of the Malaysia team are Malaysian. This bilingual and multicultural setup extends to the company’s broader structure as well, with roughly half of the management team made up of non-Japanese executives.

Regional differences and Thailand’s DPPA potential

“We try to expand more, especially in Malaysia, because its regulations are a little bit more advanced than other countries,” said Ushikubo. Resource availability, grid readiness, and regulatory clarity differ from country to country, shaping what types of projects are feasible and how quickly foreign companies like Shizen can move forward. Malaysia stands out for having clearer off-site PPA mechanisms, which has made it a practical entry point for larger corporate deals.

Shizen also has operating assets in Vietnam and Indonesia, including 21 MW of onshore wind and 35 MW of solar in Vietnam, as well as rooftop solar projects in both countries. Across these markets, solar remains the most readily deployable option in the near term, driven by lower costs and shorter construction timelines compared with wind or hydro.

Thailand occupies a slightly different position. Having been based in Thailand five years ago, Ushikubo offered a first-hand perspective on how the country’s corporate green power needs have evolved. From a resource standpoint, Thailand is well suited for solar, and rooftop installations have already been widely adopted by manufacturers. The government is now turning its attention toward off-site procurement, including a planned 2 GW direct power purchase agreement (DPPA) pilot program targeting data centers.

While the pilot DPPA signal could open new opportunities for developers like Shizen, concerns over grid stability and curtailment remain central to policy discussions. Thai authorities have been cautious about balancing variable renewable energy with system reliability, contributing to delays in finalizing detailed rules. For Shizen, this has meant closely monitoring regulatory signals while preparing for clearer frameworks to emerge.

At the same time, Ushikubo noted that corporate buyers are increasingly seeking more diversified power profiles to better align with round-the-clock electricity demand, as solar generation presents challenges related to the power curve. “But it really depends on the timing of the power available and the pricing. It depends on the balance of those factors,” she said, adding that despite these limitations, solar remains the most commonly pursued option due to its cost advantages.

24/7 carbon-free energy becomes realistic in Southeast Asia

As corporate buyers look beyond annual matching, attention is shifting toward hour to hour carbon free electricity. In August 2025, Shizen joined the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact, an international initiative led by the United Nations aimed at achieving clean energy supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For Southeast Asia, Ushikubo said the goal of 24/7 carbon free energy is becoming increasingly realistic as battery prices continue to fall.

Five years ago, Ushikubo recalled, battery systems were still too expensive to be meaningfully paired with most solar projects. As costs have declined, solar plus battery configurations are now being considered for larger utility scale developments, particularly projects in the 20 to 50 MW range. Co-located battery energy storage systems can help smooth output and extend the availability of solar power beyond daylight hours, making them a more relevant option for corporates pursuing 24/7 carbon-free energy commitments.

Recent analysis from energy think tank Ember suggests that battery costs have fallen to levels where dispatchable solar is becoming economically feasible. Across global markets outside China and the United States, the total capital expenditure for a large, long-duration utility-scale battery project now averages around USD 125/kWh.

The cost decline is expected to continue. Core battery equipment prices fell by 40% in 2024 compared with the previous year, reaching a record low of USD 165/kWh, according to BloombergNEF. Over the past decade, installed battery costs have fallen by an average of 20% per year, accompanied by rapid growth in global deployment.

Even so, Ushikubo cautioned that the business case remains selective. “The battery price is coming down rapidly, but I cannot say it is one hundred percent economic yet,” Ushikubo said, adding that deployment decisions ultimately hinge on balancing cost, system design, and customer expectations. In practice, feasibility still depends on how much of a premium corporate buyers are willing to pay, how systems are designed, and whether project timelines align with demand. For now, batteries are not a universal solution yet, but an increasingly viable option under the right conditions.

Playing coordinator role in Southeast Asia green power market

Looking ahead, Ushikubo described Shizen’s role in Southeast Asia less in terms of scale or speed, and more in terms of coordination. As corporate renewable energy demand expands across the region, she sees persistent gaps between global expectations and local market realities, particularly when it comes to contract structures and regulatory interpretation.

Shizen Energy often finds itself operating between different sets of stakeholders. Global technology companies bring experience from more mature PPA markets in the United States and Europe, while local developers and utilities work within regulatory frameworks that are still evolving, said Ushikubo. Shizen’s contribution lies in navigating these intersections. Drawing on its experience in Japan and Malaysia, the company works with local partners to translate corporate procurement requirements into projects that can be structured, financed, and executed within local systems.

Following the Google project, Ushikubo said interest from technology companies continues to build, though timing and regulatory readiness remain key considerations. “If there is any opportunity to collaborate together, we are open to discuss it anytime,” she said.

This outlook mirrors the broader state of Southeast Asia’s clean energy transition. Demand is rising, ambition is clear, but pathways remain in flux. For developers operating across the region, progress is often less about moving quickly than about staying engaged, reading policy signals carefully, and working within systems that are still taking shape. As Shizen’s experience suggests, navigating Southeast Asia’s clean energy markets is not about waiting for perfect conditions, but about learning how to move forward while the rules are still being written.",https://www.reccessary.com/data/features/meta/1768794361955627581.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 05:58:51.689377

The big takeaway for producers is that there is uncertainty in these markets, and input costs are volatile.","*This is the next article in our 2026 Southwest Economic Outlook series. Economists from Texas A&M University and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension, and Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma State University Extension provide a 2026 outlook on various topics and commodities. A digital copy of the Economic Outlook Issue is also available online.

Increasing input costs, along with low commodity prices, proved to be a signifi­cant challenge for producers in 2025. Unfor­tunately, it is likely that we could see some of these challenges continue into 2026.

Last year between April and September, the price of potash and nitrogen fertilizer increased by roughly 15%, and phosphate price increased by almost 19%. Forecasting long-term prices is difficult, but we can look at big-picture issues such as energy costs, tariffs and geopolitical conflicts to get an idea of what might be coming in 2026.

Energy costs are generally a strong pre­dictor for fertilizer prices. The correlation of energy prices with fertilizer prices is not as strong for those that depend more on mining and other inputs, such as phos­phate and potash. However, natural gas is a major input for nitrogen fertilizer pro­duction. When the cost of energy sources like natural gas increase, the baseline cost of producing common nitrogen fertilizers, such as ammonia, urea and urea ammo­nium nitrate (UAN) also increases.

The price of natural gas climbed quite a bit in the final weeks of 2025, which could lead to higher prices for nitrogen fertilizers at the start of the 2026 season. In its November 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected an average Henry Hub natural gas price of $4 per million Btu in 2026, which is about 16% above the pro­jected average price for 2025.

Fertilizer markets (along with other input markets) are directly affected by trade and policy actions. Tariffs and sanctions applied to major fertilizer exporters, such as Russia and Belarus, shifted those supplies to other markets.

China is another major fertilizer sup­plier, exporting more than 30% more fertilizer in the first five months of 2025 compared with 2024. But Chinese restrictions on phosphate and urea exports early last year had an impact on global avail­ability of those products, driving fertilizer prices up. China has since lifted those re­strictions a bit, but one of the uncertainties we face is that these policies can change with very little notice.

Most U.S. nitrogen and phosphate im­ports have been subject to at least a 10% to 15% tariff since April. According to the modified Executive Order 14257, tariffs on key fertilizer imports such as urea and UAN have been lifted, effective Nov. 13, which should alleviate some of the disrup­tion in typical trade patterns.

Suspension of U.S. tariffs on most fer­tilizer imports would likely ease costs for farmers, but further changes in policy and trade war actions would drive prices back up.

Demand plays an important role as well, driven by production and profitability. With producers facing weaker crop revenues and increased input costs, the fertil­izer-to-crop-price ratio is historically high. So not only is fertilizer more expensive, but it is also more expensive relative to the crops it helps produce. This could lead to changes in fertilizer application rates, shifts in crop rotation and, though unlikely, a slight de­crease in fertilizer demand.

One thing to note: Although fertilizer prices are increasing, we are still below the extreme peaks we saw back in 2022. We’re seeing the biggest increase in phosphate fertilizers, while nitrogen prices have been swinging a bit more.

The big takeaway for producers is that there is uncertainty in these markets, and input costs are volatile. It is important to consider long-term effects of changing fertilizer use based on current prices. Additionally, there are benefits to working closely with local retailers, agronomists and other experts who monitor local market conditions.

Profit margins for farmers in 2026 could be tight, and it will be prudent to scrutinize every dollar spent on inputs. But skimping to the point of yield loss is a false economy.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt2845192cd6494af7/67619c1cac78dc476404a1e2/swfp-shelley-huguley-fertilizer-close.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-20 03:58:45.716767

DC, UNITED STATES, January 19, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ -- To reduce and stabilize energy prices for American families that have increased 25% to 30% since January 2021, the Trump Administration has announced a bipartisan agreement urging PJM to implement an “emergency power auction” that would require technology giants to fund approximately $15 billion in new power plant construction across the PJM grid region. This initiative reflects common sense conservative governance: those who benefit from infrastructure should bear its cost.

Energy costs have increased Since 2021 due to Biden era inflation increases in fuel, equipment and labor costs that have been passed on to consumers. In addition, Utilities have faced huge costs to replace aging power plants, transmission lines, new government regulations, and grid components, with supply chain issues making these upgrades even more expensive.

Now with the United States leading the way on Artificial Intelligence (AI), there are major new demands from data centers (AI), electric vehicles, and manufacturing - outstripping supply growth and pushing prices up. President Trump feels those who benefit from this economic boom should cover the costs of energy demands for data centers.

""Energy security paid for by the companies that benefit from it, not hard-working American families, is the premise of the Trump Administrations action last week,"" said Sarah Hunt, President, Rainey Center. She continued, ""We commend President Trump for his leadership in ensuring that companies benefiting from infrastructure contribute to its funding through a competitive auction.”

Not only could this bi-partisan initiative help reduce and stabilize energy prices long term, the initiative aims to result in billions in new domestic power generation, strengthening American energy security and independence.

Sarah Hunt concluded, ""The Trump Administration's direction to PJM to initiate an emergency power auction demonstrates that pro-growth policies and consumer protection are not mutually exclusive. By leveraging market mechanisms, this initiative protects American families from bearing the cost of Silicon Valley's AI expansion while ensuring continued investment in domestic energy infrastructure.

According to The Guardian, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and Food and Water Watch joined a plethora of local organizations around the country in calling for a ban on new data centers, which comes amid growing backlash to the AI boom and soaring energy prices.

""I've been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the U.S.,"" Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food and Water Watch, said, per the publication.

""Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don't see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.

Wurth pointed to ""outrageous utility price rises"" as a major concern, adding that this is ""something Americans really do care about."" Households can guard against rising energy costs by investing in solar energy. The technology can significantly reduce electricity costs, even reaching $0.

TCD's Solar Explorer can help you get started, connecting you with vetted installers and potentially saving up to $10,000 on solar installations.

As the tech industry has pumped more and more money into AI — incorporating their large language models and generative systems into everything from your email account to web searches to home appliances — they've needed to build new, massive data centers that consume incredible amounts of power a day.

That demand for power has increased energy prices by an average of 13% in much of the U.S., and it has forced power companies to rely more heavily on polluting energy sources like oil, natural gas, and coal to meet those needs.

But the impact doesn't stop there.

Data centers run extremely hot and need water to stay operational. According to projections, AI data centers alone will need 6.4 trillion gallons of water to function by 2027, and all of that water comes directly from the stores people rely on in day-to-day life.

The swift increase in data centers could see 44 million tons of carbon pollution added to the atmosphere by 2030, according to The Guardian.

""The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans' economic, environmental, climate and water security,"" the organizations said in their letter.

It's unclear whether the pushback against data centers from these organizations will have a significant impact, but it is the latest sign that people are starting to question their use and the power demands they create, even as they continue to be built around the world.

In the meantime, homeowners can use TCD's Solar Explorer to switch to solar energy and drive down their monthly bills. The upfront costs of solar panels can be prohibitive for some, but Palmetto's LightReach solar leasing program offers $0-down options that can reduce utility rates by 20%.

Over the past year, the Republican president has rolled out numerous pro‑fossil fuel measures and offered strong support for U.S. oil firms abroad, a sharp departure from his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden’s focus on combating climate change.

Within hours of taking office, Trump declared a national energy emergency, opening the way to relaxed environmental rules and expanded drilling permits on federal land and in Alaska. He also quickly lifted Biden’s freeze on permitting new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and sped up project approvals.

The policies are set to reinforce America’s status as the world's largest oil and gas producer. U.S. crude oil and liquids production is projected to hit a record of nearly 24 million barrels per day in 2026, accounting for 22% of global supply, according to the Energy Information Administration, opens new tab.

What’s more, the U.S. in 2025 became the first country to export more than 100 million metric tons of LNG in a single year, powered by production from new plants.

But the industry’s early enthusiasm for Trump’s “drill, baby, drill!” ethos has been tempered by his push for low energy prices and his appeals to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output. OPEC+, which includes Russia, sharply raised production targets throughout the year, sending U.S. benchmark crude to a near five‑year low of $55 a barrel in mid‑December.

The price drop, and expectations of a future global supply glut, pushed U.S. drillers to scale back operations, with the domestic oil rig count falling 15% over the past year, according to energy service provider Baker Hughes(BKR.O), opens new tab . That pullback is set to slow the pace of U.S. output growth this year and next.

ENERGY DOMINO

At the same time, Trump has used America’s oil and gas strength to advance his “energy dominance” agenda and the so‑called Donroe doctrine, his rebranding of a 19th‑century principle asserting U.S. influence over the Americas.

The administration has wielded its oil and LNG wealth in negotiations intended to narrow trade imbalances with dozens of countries. Some counterparties, such as the European Union, have agreed to aggressive and unrealistic supply commitments that risk making buyers wary of depending heavily on the U.S. for vital energy.

The centrality of oil in Trump's strategy was made crystal clear when U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early January on drug trafficking charges, prompting Trump to quickly announce that Washington would indefinitely take control of the oil riches of a country home to the world’s largest proven reserves – some 300 billion barrels.

In a televised White House meeting with oil executives on January 9, Trump declared that his administration would soon name the companies that will be asked to invest a combined $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's derelict oil industry.

But it is far from clear if top companies such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), opens new tab or Chevron (CVX.N), opens new tab would commit to investing heavily in the Latin American country, given immense political and economic risks and long‑standing doubts about the attractiveness of developing its oil resources.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods underscored this at the White House meeting, calling Venezuela “un-investable” and citing the company’s history of being forced out of the country twice in recent decades.

Trump bristled at Woods’s remarks, calling them “too cute,” adding later that he was inclined to keep Exxon out of the country.

Defying Trump therefore risks meaningful backlash.

THE BEAR HUG

Venezuela may become a template for Trump’s broader use of U.S. oil companies as geopolitical instruments.

He could, for example, attempt to draw them into Russia as part of a sweeping deal to end Moscow’s nearly four‑year-long full‑scale invasion of Ukraine.

But deeper government involvement in commercial decision‑making carries major risks for the financial integrity of these firms.

More broadly, the growing volatility of U.S. politics – under both Democrats and Republicans – poses increasing risks for the industry, as successive administrations reverse or discard their predecessors’ policies, particularly those enacted through executive orders rather than legislation.

In short, the more friendly Trump’s policies are towards the oil sector today, the greater risk there is of significant whiplash if an environmentally focused administration comes into office.

Trump’s embrace of the oil industry was widely welcomed after what many companies viewed as Biden’s relative hostility. But his strongman style risks turning that warm embrace into a bear hug.

HMGMA, located in Georgia, sold 62,000 vehicles last year, according to Hyundai Motor Group on Tuesday. The plant began pilot production in 2024 and is the group’s key EV production hub in the United States.

Production and sales began in earnest in December 2024 with 1,006 units, and the plant currently manufactures two models: the Ioniq 5, a compact electric SUV, and the Ioniq 9, a full-size electric SUV. All vehicles produced at HMGMA are intended for the U.S. domestic market.

Industry experts say the figures are relatively strong given shifting U.S. policies on EVs.

In October last year, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration eliminated tax credits for EV purchases, delivering a blow to sales. While some impact was unavoidable, HMGMA still managed to post over 8,000 units in both April and May 2025, though sales dropped to around 3,000 units in December that year.

The Federation of Korean Industries previously projected that the policy change could reduce Hyundai Motor Group’s U.S. EV sales by as many as 45,000 units annually.

To diversify its offerings, Hyundai Motor Group plans to begin producing its first hybrid model at HMGMA — the Kia Sportage HEV — in the first half of this year. The move is part of a strategy to use hybrids as a bridge across the so-called EV “chasm,” a period of demand stagnation.

Starting in 2028, the company also plans to deploy its humanoid robot Atlas — unveiled at CES 2026 — at HMGMA. The robot will begin with relatively simple tasks like parts sorting, gradually expanding into assembly and other manufacturing work.

Hyundai Motor Group aims to expand HMGMA’s current annual production capacity of 300,000 units to as many as 500,000.

Including output from its other U.S. facilities — Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama and Kia Georgia — the group plans to raise total local production to over 1.2 million units in the future.

The administration announced last month it was suspending leases for at least 90 days on five East Coast offshore wind projects because of national security concerns. Its announcement did not reveal specifics about those concerns.

Developers and states sued in an effort to block the order. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first.

In federal court in Virginia on Friday, a judge said he was granting the Richmond-based company’s request for a preliminary injunction, according to the record from the hearing. This allows construction to resume while Dominion Energy’s lawsuit challenging the government’s order proceeds.

In federal court for the District of Columbia, judges ruled last week that construction could also resume on the Empire Wind project for New York by Norwegian company Equinor, and the Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut, by Danish company Orsted.

President Donald Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said last week that Trump has been clear that “wind energy is the scam of the century.” Rogers said the pause is meant to protect the national security of the American people, and “we look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond Law School professor who has been following the lawsuits, said the three judges essentially concluded that the government did not show that the national security risk is so imminent that construction must halt.

“They concluded that Trump’s effort to halt the important, but costly, projects lacked support and would injure the entities building them, so the projects must be permitted to proceed,” Tobias said.

Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, applauded the court rulings, which enable union workers to return to the job sites.

“With energy demand surging and prices spiking, the last thing our government should do is take any form of power generation offline,” McGarvey said in a statement. “The men and women of NABTU are proud to be constructing every offshore wind project in the United States, all under strong project labour agreements. These rulings mean our members can get back to work and keep affordable, clean, reliable power moving to our communities.”

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in East Coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays. Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York.

The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind LLC, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, joined the rest of the developers in challenging the administration on Thursday. They filed a complaint in District Court in Boston.

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind has been under construction since early 2024. It will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines providing enough electricity to power about 660,000 homes.

Dominion Energy argued that the government’s order is “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. It said after the hearing that it will now focus on restarting work to ensure the project can begin delivering critical energy in just weeks. It says the project is essential to meet dramatically growing energy needs driven by dozens of new data centers.

Virginia’s U.S. senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, along with U.S. Reps. Bobby Scott and Jennifer McClellan, said in a joint statement that the ruling is a victory for the state’s residents, who otherwise “would face increased energy costs as a result of the Trump administration’s shortsighted opposition to clean energy.”

Trump has dismissed offshore wind developments as ugly, but the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is about 27 miles (43 kilometers) off the shores of Virginia Beach.

Amount of Driving When considering whether or not to switch to an EV, the first thing to consider is how much you drive, according to Justin Fischer, EV automotive analyst and expert at CarEdge.
“The more you drive, the more you can save with an EV,” Fischer said.
“Renting (or subscribing, through a service like Eon) removes the long-term financial risk of battery depreciation, tariffs or maintenance surprises,” Vardi explained.
“People can experience all the benefits and cost-savings of EV driving without locking themselves into a purchase during an uncertain market.","There’s a lot of reasons to buy a new car, but what are some of the indicators that it is time to change over to an electric vehicle (EV) rather than buying a traditional gas-fueled car? Turns out, there are plenty of clues, most of which include how much money you are spending at the shop and how many miles you are racking up on the road.

Here are five key signs switching to an EV will save you money.

Amount of Driving

When considering whether or not to switch to an EV, the first thing to consider is how much you drive, according to Justin Fischer, EV automotive analyst and expert at CarEdge.

“The more you drive, the more you can save with an EV,” Fischer said. “This is especially true for urban commuters, who stand to benefit from greater fuel savings in stop-and-go traffic. For drivers who either spend excessive time in traffic, or drive at least 10,000 miles per year, an EV will save you much more money, making it more likely that the math will work out in your favor.”

Charging Locations

Fischer highlighted that another key consideration is where you’ll be charging your electric vehicle.

“If you’ll be able to charge at home or work, it’s very likely that you’ll save money with an EV,” Fischer explained, adding that public fast charging is expensive, with prices ranging from 35 cents per kiloWatt-hour (kWh) to north of 65 cents per kWh. “Per mile driven, public charging is often more expensive than gas, depending on your local gas prices.”

Maintenance Costs

If your car is prone to needing repairs and costly maintenance, an EV’s maintenance costs provide even more savings, according to Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing at CFR Classic.

“Over three years, an owner could save between $500 to $700 by not having to pay for oil changes, transmission servicing and exhaust repairs,” Giranda explained. “EVs stay longer on the road with fewer maintenance requirements, fewer moving parts, and the absence of a combustion engine.”

Societal Benefits

Government incentives and rebates can lower the upfront cost of EVs pointed out Rei Vardi, CEO and founder of Eon, sustainability-focused platform for EV car-sharing and rental space

“Consumers are also increasingly motivated by sustainability, and driving electric is one of the most impactful choices for reducing personal carbon emissions,” Vardi added.

Flexible Usage

Even with shifting incentives and rising costs, Vardi noted that many drivers are realizing that owning a car outright isn’t the only way to drive electric.

“Renting (or subscribing, through a service like Eon) removes the long-term financial risk of battery depreciation, tariffs or maintenance surprises,” Vardi explained. “People can experience all the benefits and cost-savings of EV driving without locking themselves into a purchase during an uncertain market. Flexibility is becoming its own form of savings.”

As a clean and reliable resource, nuclear energy aligns well with carbon-neutral objectives and the significant load requirements of data centers and other energy-intensive users.

Combined with vocal federal support and access to federal tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and extended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), nuclear power is well positioned to play a larger role in the US energy market. Following a series of strong federal policy signals, market confidence in nuclear offtake has increased, with renewed interest in long-term procurement emerging from technology companies scaling data centers.

Headlines have focused on the life extension of existing light-water reactor (LWR) nuclear plants and the commercial advancement of small modular reactors (SMRs). Such projects are often supported by long-term data center offtake agreements or federal guarantees, and economics have been further strengthened by the availability of production tax credits (PTCs) and investment tac credits (ITCs) enacted under the IRA.

In Depth

Existing nuclear plants: Section 45U PTC

To discourage retirement of existing nuclear facilities, the IRA added Section 45U (the zero-emission nuclear power PTC) to the Internal Revenue Code.

Section 45U provides an income tax credit for electricity that is (i) produced at a qualified nuclear power facility and (ii) sold to an unrelated person during the period from December 31, 2023, through January 1, 2033. A ""qualified nuclear power facility"" is one that was placed in service before enactment of the IRA and uses nuclear energy to generate electricity.

The credit is calculated by:

Multiplying the number of megawatt-hours of electricity produced and sold during the taxable year by 0.3 cents (as adjusted annually for inflation)

Subtracting the applicable ""reduction amount""

Multiplying the result by five if prevailing wage requirements are satisfied.

The reduction amount is the lesser of (i) the total credit amount otherwise available or (ii) 16% of the excess (if any) of gross receipts from electricity sales over a benchmark price of 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (adjusted for inflation). As a practical matter, no credit is available when the electricity sales price equals or exceeds approximately $43.75 per megawatt-hour.

New nuclear projects: Sections 45Y and 48E

The IRA also introduced Sections 45Y (the clean electricity PTC) and 48E (the clean electricity ITC) for electricity-generation facilities that achieve a zero-greenhouse-gas emissions rate. For facilities to qualify, they must be placed in service after December 31, 2024.

Proposed US Department of the Treasury regulations confirm that facilities using nuclear fission or fusion technologies are eligible for either the PTC under Section 45Y or the ITC under Section 48E (but generally not both). Project owners must elect which credit to claim.

If prevailing wage requirements are satisfied:

The Section 48E ITC equals 30% of a project's qualified basis.

The Section 45Y PTC equals $15 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated, subject to annual inflation adjustments.

Both credits may be increased through additional ""adders"" if the facility is located in an energy community and/or meets domestic content requirements.

Importantly, ITCs under Section 48E and PTCs under Sections 45U and 45Y may be transferred for cash to unrelated taxpayers, providing flexibility for developers that cannot fully utilize the credits themselves.

Financing outlook

Public sentiment toward nuclear power has shifted meaningfully in many regions, with increasing recognition of (and enthusiasm for!) its potential to meet growing electricity demand. While significant hurdles remain, particularly development and construction capital intensity, the availability of federal tax credits for existing facilities and new SMR projects materially improves project feasibility.

As the policy landscape continues to evolve, the OBBBA's enactment in July 2025 stands out as a pivotal moment for the nuclear sector. US Congress ultimately chose not to alter the Section 45U PTCs, a notable decision given earlier legislative drafts that sought to accelerate its repeal. While this inaction may appear uneventful, it is telling: The decision to leave nuclear untouched, even as wind, solar, and hydrogen incentives were substantially pared back, signals a firm and deliberate endorsement of nuclear energy's long‑term role in the US energy mix. The legislation goes a step further by introducing a new nuclear‑specific energy community bonus for facilities located in metropolitan statistical areas with historical ties to nuclear employment, underscoring policymakers' intention to support the technology and the communities that have sustained it. Together, these measures position nuclear power to play an increasingly consequential role in US energy's future.

In the near term, LWR projects benefiting from long operating histories and proven technology are likely to remain the most financeable component of a nuclear resurgence. At the same time, interest from offtakers in advanced reactor technologies, including SMRs, continues to grow.

Any large-scale nuclear development will require innovative financial structures. These projects are likely to involve a combination of common equity, preferred equity, multiple debt tranches, and tax credit monetization, all within a complex regulatory framework that demands careful and sophisticated structuring.

The ASEAN Power Grid represents more than an techno-economic solution to pressing power market challenges.","Southeast Asia is entering a decisive stage in its energy transition. As energy demand grows, governments are looking for ways to deliver affordable, reliable and clean electricity to homes, businesses and industries. One long-standing initiative offers a practical path forward: the ASEAN Power Grid (APG).

Energy connectivity is an important part of decarbonizing the region’s power systems. The International Energy Agency estimates that countries around the world need to double investments in power grids to meet climate targets. The APG aims to link all ASEAN Member States into a single, integrated system by 2045. By facilitating cross-border electricity trade, this will strengthen energy security and reliability, maximize renewable energy potential and, and create a larger and more stable market for power in the region.

The idea of a regional power grid first emerged in the mid-1980s. Since then, ASEAN has taken a phased approach, beginning with bilateral and sub-regional connections. These links provide the foundation for more advanced, multilateral electricity trade in the future.

A key example is the Lao PDR–Thailand–Malaysia–Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP), which sends hydropower from Lao PDR to its neighbors. In 2023, ASEAN announced another initiative, the Brunei–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines Power Integration Project (BIMP-PIP), linking the eastern sub-region. Singapore has also signed agreements to import 7.3 gigawatts of clean energy from neighbouring countries in the region.

These initiatives show that the benefits of power trade are well recognized. Countries with limited renewable resources can buy clean electricity, while those with an abundance can earn from exports. Regional connectivity also makes it easier to balance variable sources like wind and solar across wider areas.

Recent studies suggest that linking power systems could cut the cost of Southeast Asia’s decarbonization by US$800 billion. Shared infrastructure means countries would need to invest less in local generation and storage capacity, which is valuable in a region where financing remains a challenge.

Beyond the financial case, there is a broader story to tell. “To encourage stakeholders to look beyond the techno-economic advantages of the APG, it's essential to highlight the long-term sustainability and just transition benefits that a more integrated grid can offer,” shares Matthew David Wittenstein, Chief of the Energy Connectivity Section at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

Matthew further points to the importance of showing how the APG can help deliver Sustainable Development Goal 7 in the region as well as address the energy trilemma: affordability, reliability and sustainability, especially for underserved communities in the region.

This broader view is being built into regional planning. ESCAP’s Green Power Corridor Framework offers principles and metrics to align projects with the Sustainable Development Goals. A new “Green Power Corridor Playbook” is also being developed to provide a practical guide for putting energy connectivity into action in ways that promote inclusive growth, social equity and climate resilience. It will include tools for assessing economic, environmental and social impacts, along with recommendations for policies and best practices.

Progress toward cross-border power integration is not without challenges. Many countries still focus on national energy priorities. Some place the greatest importance on security of supply, while others focus on affordability or sustainability. Ensuring that the benefits are fairly shared is essential, particularly for smaller economies. Regional cooperation could help with investment access and technology transfer so that all countries can participate fully.

The ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) guides regional efforts. Its next phase, starting in 2025, will place stronger emphasis on energy connectivity. Combined with ESCAP’s Regional Roadmap for Power System Connectivity and the ASEAN Centre for Energy’s (ACE) Roadmap for Multilateral Power Trade, these present an opportunity to outline crucial steps forward and better align national plans with regional and global goals.

Building the skills and knowledge to support integration is another priority. ESCAP is partnering with ACE, Clean, Affordable and Secure Energy for Southeast Asia (CASE) and the Southeast Asia Energy Transition Partnership (ETP-UNOPS) under the ASEAN Power Grid Advancement Program, which will aim to roll out sub-regional pilot projects for multilateral power trade in 2026 and beyond.

ESCAP is also working closely with the ASEAN Energy Regulators’ Network (AERN), the ASEAN Secretariat, and ETP-UNOPS to establish the ASEAN School of Regulation. The school will offer structured training, peer learning and research to support power system integration and regulatory harmonization. Its first summer programme in September 2025 involved both policymakers and young professionals, with a focus on increasing the participation of women in the energy sector.

The long-term value of the APG lies in its ability to deliver a range of benefits beyond the energy sector. New transmission corridors can bring development opportunities especially for rural areas, improve access to markets, education and health care, and support local economic growth. Adding 30 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity could create around 182,000 jobs in manufacturing, installation and maintenance. Cleaner power would help reduce air pollution, with studies suggesting power connectivity could prevent up to 15,000 pollution-induced deaths every year .

“By framing the APG as a regional development tool, rather than just a technical infrastructure project, we can expand its appeal to a broader group of stakeholders,” adds Wittenstein. He notes that this approach makes it easier to link energy connectivity with inclusion and sustainability, which in turn can increase both public support and investor interest.

The ASEAN Power Grid represents more than an techno-economic solution to pressing power market challenges. It is a platform for regional cooperation, inclusive growth and a just energy transition. As ASEAN prepares to adopt the next APAEC and renew the Memorandum of Understanding on the APG, decision-makers have a chance to shape a new narrative and turn energy connectivity into a powerful tool for transformation.

Across the United States, employees working in sterilization facilities, medical supply warehouses, and industrial operations are inhaling a toxic substance that could threaten their long-term health. Ethylene oxide (EtO) plays a crucial role in sterilizing approximately half of the nation’s medical equipment. Its importance to modern healthcare is undeniable, yet the escalating health risks associated with exposure can no longer be dismissed.

Although research spanning decades has linked EtO to life-altering illnesses, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not revised its worker exposure limits since the early 1980s. Government agencies understand the severity of the threat. Still, the safety standards remain locked in the past.

EtO is particularly valuable because it helps sterilize medical equipment that cannot be treated with high heat or steam. In many cases, it has replaced other methods such as gamma radiation, electron beam processing, X-ray sterilization, and hydrogen peroxide plasma. The efficiency, however, carries a steep human cost.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies EtO as a known human carcinogen, and even small, repeated exposures over time can cause cell DNA damage. Moreover, short-term contact with concentrated EtO emissions may trigger breathing difficulties, headaches, and neurological problems. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and EPA acknowledge links between long-term workplace exposure and cancers, including leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer. Its inhalation carcinogenicity in humans is highlighted in an EPA evaluation from 2016 that underpins all modern EPA cancer-risk estimates for EtO.

Communities across the country are already living with the consequences. In Willowbrook, Illinois, risk modeling data from 2018 showed cancer dangers more than 4.8 times higher than acceptable levels near a Sterigenics sterilization facility that uses EtO. The plant was closed in 2019, but right before, an EPA report acknowledged cancer risks of up to 500 to 1000 per 1 million at the site.

In Laredo, Texas, and Jackson, Missouri, the same projection map revealed cancer risk 18 times and 11 times higher, respectively, than EPA’s threshold for acceptable risk near Midwest Sterilization Corporation facilities. Other pollution projection data revealed several EtO facilities in California with elevated cancer risks around neighboring communities.

Even if these data are a few years old, they remain relevant because many of the cancers associated with EtO exposure have long latencies, spanning even 15 years after the initial exposure.

According to a 2023 study, 31 out of 654 EtO-emitting facilities in the United States have an estimated cancer risk of over 100 per 1 million. Despite this alarming evidence, many facilities continue to operate within OSHA’s outdated regulatory framework.

OSHA’s standards are stuck in the last century. OSHA’s permissible exposure limit for EtO has not changed since 1984, a time when the full extent of its toxicity was not understood. EPA now considers the chemical up to 60 times more dangerous than previously estimated, and recently adopted stricter controls intended to achieve a 90 percent reduction in hazardous EtO emissions. The agency also signaled its intention to reduce allowable workplace exposure levels to 0.1 parts per million by 2035.

Yet, OSHA’s current limit for an eight-hour workday remains at 1 part per million, 10 times higher than what other federal environmental regulators believe is safe. This disconnect leaves people closest to the hazard—such as warehouse technicians, sterilization line operators, and maintenance workers— without adequate protection.

EPA has made the first move, but if OSHA continues to delay updating its regulations, responsibility falls on state governments, labor organizations, and environmental justice advocates to demand stronger protection.

Workers deserve exposure limits supported by modern science and real-time monitoring of emissions inside and outside sterilization facilities. Thanks to the new EPA regulations, we should see more impact studies and projections that were previously halted after 2018, when EPA released its National Air Toxics Assessment.

Furthermore, companies should be required to install effective ventilation and leak detection systems, provide comprehensive protective gear, and ensure that employees undergo regular medical evaluations. These are not radical requests. The technology exists, the data are clear, and the stakes are measured in human lives.

OSHA must recognize that safeguarding workers is its core mission and not an optional set of policies. No individual should have to decide between financial security and personal health. The nation relies on a steady supply of sterile medical equipment, but that need must never justify preventable illness among those who help produce it.

The crisis is already unfolding. Now is the time to move worker protections into the modern era and ensure that the people supporting our health care system are not sacrificing their health in the process.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cade1.20.2026-962305570.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 00:59:39.247945

The team of researchers, with support from the North Carolina Renewable Ocean Energy Program, conducted an analysis for the North Carolina coast, focused on wind turbines and marine hydrokinetic kites.
Researchers will pair the portfolio optimization framework with another model known as Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis, commonly referred to as Temoa, which produces long-term analyses of energy systems.
“We are going to combine analysis from this offshore portfolio with the long-term energy planning for the Eastern Interconnection,” de Querioz said.
“Fused Portfolio Optimization for Harnessing Marine Renewable Energy Resources” was published in the journal Energy earlier this month.","A group of North Carolina State University researchers has created a model that simulates wind, waves, tides and currents to help pinpoint areas that are likely best to install offshore energy facilities.

The model, called a portfolio optimization framework, also identifies what combination of wind and marine hydrokinetic technologies, which capture energy through water flow, may work together in an area to produce the greatest amount of power.

“It’s not about only one type, but multiple sources of generation that can somehow work together to generate a more stable output of your portfolio,” explained Dr. Anderson de Queiroz, co-author of the study and associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering. “For example, if you think about the single source, let’s say offshore wind or wave energy, they have lots of variability with respect to their supply because it depends on natural conditions. It depends on wind speed or the ocean heights and in periods, so it’s variable.”

By locating areas where different offshore energy technologies can work together, a phenomenon researchers refer to as “complementary behavior,” power companies can get the most bang for their buck.

For context, picture an offshore field of 50 wind turbines. Within that field are marine hydrokinetic devices such as wave energy converters or underwater kite turbines that generate electricity from ocean currents and tidal streams.

“When you’re collecting the electricity, instead of collecting only from wind with transmission lines, you can also collect electricity from this other source. So, the electricity that you’re bringing to shore in that situation will be more stable because of the complementary behavior between the sources,” de Querioz said.

For the developer trying to explore and analyze where they can get the most power output possible, this model could help reduce their financial risk.

“For government analysts and planners, they can also see strategically where there are regions that would be beneficial in terms of most electricity that they are able to get to at a reasonable cost and that’s away from, for example, protected habitat areas or away from strategic areas” used by military forces, de Querioz said.

The team of researchers, with support from the North Carolina Renewable Ocean Energy Program, conducted an analysis for the North Carolina coast, focused on wind turbines and marine hydrokinetic kites.

But de Querioz points out that the model they have developed can be used globally and with any combination of technologies. And, he said, it may be applied onshore.

The research team is in the process of expanding its analysis to other regions, including the coasts of New Jersey and Virginia.

The project, which is through the Atlantic Marine Energy Center and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, will use the portfolio optimization model to support bringing electricity to the East Coast through the Eastern Interconnection.

The Eastern Interconnection spans from central Canada east to the Atlantic Coast, south to Florida and west to the foot of the Rockies. It is one of two major power grids.

Researchers will pair the portfolio optimization framework with another model known as Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis, commonly referred to as Temoa, which produces long-term analyses of energy systems.

“We are going to combine analysis from this offshore portfolio with the long-term energy planning for the Eastern Interconnection,” de Querioz said. “Basically, we’re looking at the entirety of the Eastern Interconnection, and then deploying not only offshore energy, but also looking at natural gas potential, new nuclear or the potential to have energy storage, onshore solar, and things like that.”

The team is also working with the North Carolina Renewable Energy Program this year to develop an adapted design for a wave power buoy called Reference Model 3, or RM3, that converts wave energy into electrical power.

“On these, we’re going to do more specific and detailed analysis for the North Carolina coast with this new design of wave energy converters,” de Queiroz said.

He is extending an invitation to collaborate with industry, government and other scientists with an interest in the model. The model is expected to be released sometime this year. Anyone interested may contact de Queiroz by email at ardequei@ncsu.edu.

Recent Catalysts and News Recent headlines around Louisiana-Pacific have focused less on splashy product launches and more on operational follow through.
In that sense, Louisiana-Pacific stock now embodies a classic market tension: the tug of war between fear of missing further gains and fear of buying too close to the peak.","Louisiana-Pacific is not the kind of stock that usually dominates trading screens, yet its recent price action has been anything but dull. After a brisk rally fueled by resilient U.S. housing demand and optimism around repair and remodeling, the share price has cooled over the past few days, giving traders a reminder that this is still very much a cyclical name tied to lumber prices, mortgage rates and homebuilding sentiment.

Across the last week of trading, LPX has drifted slightly lower from its recent highs, with a mild pullback rather than a dramatic selloff. The tone is cautious rather than panicked: volume has been moderate, intraday swings contained, and the stock is consolidating just below its recent peak while investors reassess how much future growth is already priced in.

According to real time data from Yahoo Finance and Reuters, the last close for LPX was approximately 88.50 dollars per share, with intraday trading recently hovering close to that level. Over the past five sessions the stock has slipped a few percentage points from just above 90 dollars, reflecting a short term loss of momentum but not a breakdown in trend. Over the last 90 days, however, the trajectory is unambiguously positive: the stock has advanced strongly from the mid 60s, tracking a firm uptrend that mirrors improving expectations for construction and building products.

That medium term strength is underscored by the 52 week range. Data from Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance shows a 52 week low around 47 dollars and a recent 52 week high near 92 dollars, placing the current quote in the upper band of that channel. For anyone who lived through the stock’s slump when lumber prices normalized and housing cooled, trading close to the high end of that range is a powerful signal that sentiment has swung back toward optimism.

One-Year Investment Performance

Step back twelve months and the picture becomes even more striking. Historical price data from Yahoo Finance and Google Finance shows that LPX closed at roughly 64 dollars per share one year ago. Measured against the latest price around 88.50 dollars, that implies a gain of about 38 percent for investors who simply bought and held during a period that still felt deeply uncertain for the housing complex.

Put in practical terms, a 10,000 dollar investment in Louisiana-Pacific stock a year ago would now be worth roughly 13,800 dollars, excluding dividends. That 3,800 dollar profit is not the stuff of speculative tech legends, but for a mid cap building materials name tied to a choppy macro backdrop, it is a quietly impressive performance. The move also handily beats most major equity benchmarks over the same stretch, reinforcing the idea that disciplined investors who were willing to look through near term rate jitters have been rewarded.

The emotional journey, however, has been anything but linear. Over the past year LPX has endured spells of volatility as markets whipsawed between fears of a housing recession and hopes for a soft landing. The fact that the stock still delivered high double digit percentage returns despite those mood swings says as much about management’s execution and margin discipline as it does about the macro environment.

Recent Catalysts and News

Recent headlines around Louisiana-Pacific have focused less on splashy product launches and more on operational follow through. Earlier this week, investor attention circled back to the company as traders digested the latest housing and lumber data, with LPX trading in sympathy with homebuilders and other building products peers. The modest pullback that followed looked like classic profit taking after a strong advance rather than a reaction to company specific disappointment.

Within the last several trading days, financial media outlets including Bloomberg and MarketWatch have highlighted LPX in the context of the ongoing rotation into cyclical names that benefit from easing rate expectations. As bond yields softened, investors revisited the entire housing ecosystem, and LPX was often mentioned as a levered play on oriented strand board pricing and siding demand. No major management shake ups or abrupt strategic pivots surfaced in this window, which suggests that the stock’s short term volatility has been macro driven rather than the result of internal surprises.

Scanning company communications and news aggregators, there has not been a flurry of fresh corporate announcements in the very latest sessions. Instead, the trading pattern resembles a consolidation phase with relatively low volatility, where prior gains are being digested. In that kind of environment, even minor beats or misses in economic data can nudge LPX up or down a couple of percent, which is exactly what the market has been witnessing recently.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

On Wall Street, sentiment on Louisiana-Pacific is constructive but not euphoric. Over the past month, analyst updates captured by sources such as Reuters and Investopedia show a tilt toward Buy and Overweight ratings, with a minority of firms urging more caution. For example, Bank of America maintains a Buy stance and has nudged its price target into the low to mid 90 dollar range, effectively signaling limited but still positive upside from current levels. Morgan Stanley, by contrast, leans closer to Equal Weight, arguing that a good portion of the cyclical recovery story is already embedded in the valuation.

Other coverage from firms such as J.P. Morgan and UBS broadly echoes this balanced tone. Consensus compiled by Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg indicates an average target price clustered in the low 90s, with the highest targets stretching toward the upper 90s and the more conservative estimates falling back into the high 70s. Taken together, that mix translates into an overall rating profile that is slightly bullish: Wall Street does not see LPX as a screaming bargain at present levels, but it also does not view the stock as overextended enough to warrant aggressive Sell calls.

Investors should read this verdict as a nuanced message. The analyst community is effectively saying that LPX has earned its recent rerating through earnings resilience and capital discipline, yet future returns will depend on whether housing activity and commodity input costs cooperate. In practical terms, that means the easy money of the recovery phase may already be behind the stock, while the next leg up will require continued execution and at least a benign macro backdrop.

Future Prospects and Strategy

At its core, Louisiana-Pacific is a building solutions company focused on engineered wood products, particularly oriented strand board, siding and related structural components that feed into residential construction, repair and remodeling. It has carved out a niche by pushing higher value, branded siding systems and specialty panels that can command better pricing and stickier demand than pure commodity lumber. That strategic tilt toward value added products is central to how the company plans to navigate the inevitable ups and downs of the housing cycle.

Looking ahead to the coming months, several factors will likely dictate how LPX trades. First, interest rate expectations remain paramount, because they directly influence new home sales, renovation budgets and builder sentiment. Any renewed spike in yields could cool demand and pressure oriented strand board pricing, which in turn would challenge margins. Second, supply chain normalization and input cost dynamics matter; if raw material and freight costs stay contained, the company has more room to protect profitability even if volumes wobble.

On the positive side, structural housing undersupply in North America and the aging stock of existing homes continue to underpin long term demand for the kind of products LPX sells. Even if the near term macro environment becomes choppy, the backlog of repair, remodeling and new construction activity does not disappear, it merely shifts in timing. That is why many analysts still see Louisiana-Pacific as a credible way to express a cautiously optimistic view on housing over a multi year horizon.

For now, the stock sits at an interesting junction: near the top of its 52 week range, digesting solid gains, and facing a market that has become more selective about cyclical exposure. If management can deliver steady earnings, keep leverage in check and continue mix shifting toward higher margin siding solutions, the current consolidation could eventually resolve higher. If not, any disappointment in macro data or company guidance might spark a sharper correction from these elevated levels.

Investors considering an entry today must therefore decide whether they believe the recent 90 day rally is the prelude to a longer structural uptrend or the late stage of a cyclical bounce. The one year track record suggests that patient capital has been rewarded, yet the current valuation near the top of the 52 week range demands clearer conviction.

This move could significantly benefit Tesla, which previously shipped from China. However, a price cap on half the quota might favor Chinese brands like BYD and Nio, offering more affordable options for Canadian buyers.

Canada has decided to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. According to a Reuters report, this policy change could benefit Elon Musk's Tesla, which is positioned to be among the first electric carmakers to take advantage of the new arrangement. Under the deal announced last week, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually from China, with a 6.1% tariff on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently visited China, also said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years. The Reuters report cited experts who claimed that Tesla's early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant to Canada and its established sales network in the country give the company an advantage. However, under one of the clauses in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles priced under 35,000 CAD (roughly $25,000). It's important to note that Tesla model prices are all above that number, and this could limit the company's ability to fully utilise the quota.

How Canada’s Chinese EV policy change can help Elon Musk’s Tesla

While many Chinese automakers are eager to take advantage of this opportunity as they increase exports, Tesla has a head start. In 2023, the company already set up its Shanghai plant, which is its largest and most cost-effective factory worldwide, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.

The US automaker started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada that same year, increasing Canadian automobile imports from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023. However, Tesla was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its US and Berlin factories after Canada imposed 100% tariffs, saying they wanted to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity. Currently, Tesla ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants, such as cheaper Model 3s, are mostly built in China.“This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,” Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions told Reuters. Tesla has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, while Chinese competitors such as BYD and Nio do not yet have a sales presence there. Tesla can also likely move faster with marketing plans since it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors, the report adds.“Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any market to achieve the best cost efficiency,"" Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight, told Reuters. Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo and Polestar, which are both owned by China's automaking group Geely.

How the price clause in Canada’s new EV policy is ‘good news’ for Chinese brands

However, the price limit will likely give Chinese brands some room to compete with Tesla. “The beneficiaries are likely to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,” Fiorani added. John Zeng, head of market forecast for China at London-based consultancy GlobalData, said that the quota would also likely give Chinese carmakers a chance to test the market in Canada, where there's a large Chinese Canadian population. Canada wants to explore joint ventures and investments with Chinese companies within the next three years to build a Canadian electric vehicle using Chinese expertise, the public broadcaster CBC reported, citing a senior Canadian official. China's top EV maker, BYD, currently has an electric bus assembly plant in Ontario, Canada. Meanwhile, Trump administration officials have criticised Canada's decision. The former Biden administration also increased tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024, essentially blocking such exports to the US.

By the end of last year, the Washington permitting process was underway with a Washington Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council hearing in Washougal.
Marching forward Hocker said he’s happy the project is continuing to move forward through the Corps’ permitting process.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced last week it will hold two online public meetings later this month to get feedback on a $1.5 billion project to run a 100-mile-long high-voltage power line under the Columbia River.

The announcement closely followed a notice from the federal agency earlier this month that it will do its most thorough type of environmental assessment into the project, which would connect power generation infrastructure east of the Cascade Mountains to where electricity is consumed along the Interstate 5 corridor.

The meetings about the Cascade Renewable Transmission project will focus on problems the project may cause and identify alternatives to the project.

“Public input is crucial to ensure we consider all potential impacts and alternatives,” Joe Brock, a project manager with the Corps’ Portland District, said in the press release. “This process helps us better understand community concerns and make informed decisions.”

The Corps’ two virtual meetings are 1-3 p.m. Jan 28 and 6-8 p.m. Jan. 29. The agency asks people to email CRT_EIS@usace.army.mil by Jan. 23 to preregister.

The agency said its forthcoming review will look at the potential environmental, ecological, aesthetic, historical, cultural and social impacts of the project, which has faced wide-ranging opposition.

In December, key shipping groups expressed alarm about a lack of information on the project’s potential impacts to routine barge shipments of crucial fuels from Portland to the Tri-Cities.

Environmental advocates and Native groups have also fought the project. They argue it may harm endangered species in the river and undermine Native nations’ treaty-reserved rights.

“It’s death by 1,000 cuts,” Julie Carter, a lawyer and longtime policy analyst for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission, said last summer. “They want to dig into critical habitat — habitat that’s needed for … salmon and steelhead, for Pacific lamprey.”

Opponents like Carter worry in particular about lamprey, a species Native nations in the Columbia Basin have worked hard to save. So little is known about lamprey that the project could dig its channel right into the middle of their migration route, compounding significant harms caused by the federal hydropower dam system.

Critics also argued last year the project had not put out enough public information to be properly assessed.

Permitting slog

The Corps echoed that sentiment last spring when it said the project’s permitting applications didn’t have enough information.

But Chris Hocker, the project lead for its developer, PowerBridge, said the company has been sending the Corps all the information it wants. He takes the agency’s latest move as a sign the project’s permits are being officially considered again.

Over the summer, PowerBridge turned down expedited federal permitting from the Trump administration.

In addition to permits from the Corps, the project also needs a green light from Washington and Oregon before it can start. PowerBridge’s choice was partly due to still having to navigate the states’ long permitting processes either way, and partly to stay in the good graces of the two Democrat-controlled states.

By the end of last year, the Washington permitting process was underway with a Washington Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council hearing in Washougal.

Marching forward

Hocker said he’s happy the project is continuing to move forward through the Corps’ permitting process.

“We expected that they would require an EIS (environmental impact statement),” he added, “so that’s not a surprise and we’re anxious to go through that process.”

Hocker said federal permitting timelines vary but in general he expects the process to take about two years. The Corps’ webpage for the project says the process should be done by next winter.

In the meantime, the region faces a power transmission crisis of its own making as growing regional power consumption — especially from power-hungry data centers — blows up old demand projections, threatening to take Washington and Oregon’s climate goals with them.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47634/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/columbiagale_14-1024x6831768852561.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=7ZPfHqVs,N,,2026-01-19 22:58:19.774746

But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

Rep. Rob Wittman, R.-Va., introduced the House version of the bill.

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

On Wednesday, Trump announced in a proclamation that the U.S. is “too reliant” on foreign-sourced critical minerals and directed his administration to negotiate better deals. He said possible remedies would include minimum import prices for certain critical minerals.

“Reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security is a top priority for the Trump administration,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

Companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

Author Bio Dr. Sarah Jenkins is a Senior Lead Researcher at MyAssignmentHelp.com, where she oversees the Sustainable Tech and Public Policy department.","The global transition to electric mobility has moved past the “early adopter” phase and into a high-stakes regulatory era.

As of January 2026, the divergence between the United States and the United Kingdom offers a masterclass in how different policy levers—one driven by manufacturing incentives and the other by strict sales mandates—affect infrastructure and grid stability.

The Policy Engine: Mandates vs. Incentives

In the United Kingdom, the conversation is currently dominated by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. For 2026, this landmark legislation requires that 33% of all new car sales from manufacturers must be zero-emission. This is a significant jump from previous years and represents a non-negotiable “floor” for the industry.

In contrast, the United States continues to leverage the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Rather than a nationwide sales mandate, the US utilizes a “carrot” approach—massive tax credits for consumers and production credits for manufacturers who localize battery supply chains in North America.

Navigating the complexities of these differing policy landscapes can be challenging, especially for students undertaking comparative studies in energy policy. Understanding the nuanced impact of such regulations on market dynamics requires detailed research. For those grappling with the intricacies of such assignments, seeking assistance to do my coursework can provide invaluable support, ensuring a thorough and well-researched understanding of these critical global shifts.

Visualizing the 2026 EV Landscape

To understand the scale of this transition, we must look at the data. Below is a comparative snapshot of where both nations stand at the start of this year.

Metric (Jan 2026) United Kingdom United States ZEV Target 33% (Mandatory) N/A (Incentive-based) Public Chargers ~87,800 ~68,000 (Fast Stalls) Smart Tariff Adoption ~300,000 households Regional VPP Pilots

Charging Infrastructure: The 2026 Landscape

Infrastructure development has hit a milestone in both regions this year. The density of charging networks is no longer just a luxury but a prerequisite for compliance with the aforementioned mandates.

United Kingdom: As of early 2026, the UK has surpassed 87,000 public chargepoints, a massive increase driven by the Rapid Charging Fund and local authority grants. The focus has shifted to “hub” density, ensuring that high-power (150kW+) ultra-rapid chargers are accessible every 20 miles on major A-roads.

United States: The US has crossed the 68,000 public DC fast-charging stall mark. While the raw number of total ports is higher due to a vast Level 2 network, the geographical challenge remains. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program is finally seeing widespread project completions.

Grid Readiness and Intelligent Flexibility

The “grid challenge” has evolved from a fear of total failure to a sophisticated management task. In 2026, the focus is on Demand Side Response (DSR).

In the UK, Octopus Energy’s Intelligent Octopus platform has become a critical tool for the National Grid. By 2026, over 300,000 UK households are estimated to be on “smart” tariffs. This is supported by the National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios (FES) 2026 update, which prioritizes “Pathways to Net Zero” through localized battery storage.

The US grid is testing similar Virtual Power Plant (VPP) models. However, the fragmented nature of US utilities means that “grid readiness” is often a patchwork of high-tech smart grids in some states and aging infrastructure in others. Mastering the technical documentation of these systems—specifically how they interact with broader fleet logistics—is a hurdle for many engineering and logistics students. For example, analyzing the OMGT 707 Transportation Systems and Logistics Processes coursework reveals the sheer mathematical complexity required to optimize these networks.

Modern EV policy isn’t written in a vacuum. The 2026 ZEV Mandate targets and the US IRA revisions were informed by peer-reviewed research on battery lifecycle assessments and consumer elasticity. Academic institutions act as the “R&D” arm for government policy-makers. By bridging the gap between theoretical energy models and real-world grid data, students and researchers are directly shaping the laws that govern the roads today.

Key Takeaways

UK ZEV Mandate: 33% of new car sales must be electric in 2026.

US Strategy: Continued reliance on the IRA for domestic manufacturing and tax incentives.

Smart Grids: Solutions like Intelligent Octopus are proving that EVs can support the grid via DSR.

Infrastructure Growth: The UK has passed 82,000 public chargers; the US is focusing on highway corridors.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Q: What is the UK’s ZEV Mandate for 2026?

A: It requires 33% of all new cars sold by a manufacturer to be zero-emission, with heavy fines for non-compliance.

Q: How many public chargers does the UK have now?

A: As of early 2026, there are over 82,000 public chargepoints across the UK.

Q: What is “Intelligent Octopus”?

A: It is a smart charging tariff that automatically charges EVs when the grid has excess renewable energy, helping stabilize the National Grid.

DETROIT — Federal and state leaders took to the stage at the Detroit Auto Show to talk about policy whiplash creating instability for manufacturers, stalling innovation and risking job losses as debate continues over how much government should shape the auto market.

In a fireside chat held at the auto show Jan. 14, former Democratic Party presidential candidate and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said rapidly changing federal policy is causing a potential setback to the industry.

“The other thing that I saw and heard speaking to each of the manufacturers who were displaying their incredible products was how much industry has had to contend with this whiplash from the policy side,” he said.

While every administration will have its own priorities, the changes in policy and how the industry has reacted to it has been a setback, he said, in particular referencing how administrations have handled electric vehicles.

“When you have a technology that is ultimately more advanced, policymakers cannot just put the toothpaste back into the tube,” he said. “There is no question about whether this technology will be the future of the sector.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who appeared via prerecorded responses during a panel Jan. 15, stated that policy uncertainty is creating problems for the industry. Things remained consistent until the Biden administration tried to make a push toward electric vehicles, he said.

“Nobody needs to be pro or against electric vehicles. The consumer is ultimately going to be the judge and jury on that. They make millions of decisions with their pocketbooks that drive car companies to decide what kind of vehicles to make. That was our mantra for a long time,” he said.

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, who appeared with Moreno, said the government should support innovation, safety, emissions reduction and mobility, but not dictate consumer choices.

“That’s a very different government ambition and partnership with industry than having the government tell customers what they can and cannot buy,” he said.

Bozzella said that a degree of certainty and clarity is also needed.

“One person’s clarity could be another person’s EV mandate,” he said.

Regulations need to be able to outlast changes in presidential administrations, he said. While the president is entitled to appoint cabinet secretaries to make market adjustments, “there’s a difference between making adjustments based on market conditions, the state of technology, the cost of those types of things and tearing the entire playbook up and starting off again,” he said.

These kinds of changes are what create a problem across the industry, he said.

Additionally, Bozzella said regulation around electric vehicles needs to stay at the same pace as the demand for the vehicles to help keep investments from becoming “stranded,” he said. While there is still a demand for EVs, it’s moving at a “more realistic” pace, he said.

“Those policies are important for the development of the market over time, but we are where we are right now,” he said. “So, I think you’ll see continued investment, but it’s going to be a slower pace.”",,N,,2026-01-20 04:59:56.917644

Original article source: US power crunch looms as OKLO CEO says grid can’t keep up without new investment","The U.S. is running headlong into a power crunch driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence — and the nation’s energy grid is not ready for it, an executive behind a major new nuclear partnership warned recently.

Jacob DeWitte is CEO of OKLO, a California-based advanced nuclear company focused on helping large energy users add grid power through private investment rather than traditional utilities. He joined Meta executive Joel Kaplan and Energy Secretary Chris Wright for an announcement in Washington.

The Meta partnership will go a long way to add much-needed power to a key regional component of the national grid, DeWitte said, citing OKLO’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW installation in Pike County, Ohio, near the Hocking Hills.

""I think one of the really exciting things about today is announcing the fact we're going to be building a lot more power generation capabilities,"" he said, quipping that southeastern Ohio used to be an ""industrial cathedral"" and now can see new commercial rebirth for the digital and AI age.

""Smaller [nuclear] plants can be built more quickly and come online faster – then you shorten the learning curve. You reduce the cost both in time and money of iteration cycles to drive technological progress and bring these technologies that have huge promise forward in terms of cost reduction… energy dominance and energy reliability and energy abundance,"" he said.

Wright and President Donald Trump have helped companies like OKLO and Meta unleash this new energy potential, to not only increase power capacity and amend structural issues but also greatly reduce the regulatory burdens private companies tend to face from Washington, DeWitte added.

With the advent of AI and its power needs, DeWitte said the U.S. energy system as it stands has ""absolutely"" not been able to keep up.

DeWitte warned that the U.S. needs to build out the power grid and invest in new installations like the Pike site:

""We are going to run out of power capacity in this country in the next several years, especially in critical industrial markets like sort of the Midwest and Northeast. The PJM interconnection [which supports the Mid-Atlantic region] is going to be undersupplied with power generation in just a matter of a few years.""

""The steps taken today are going to help alleviate that, but there's going be a lot more that's needed.""

DeWitte also addressed what he described as a common misconception surrounding the rise of data centers, which have sparked NIMBY backlash in parts of the country.

""I think sometimes people conflate [that] building these data centers [will] drive prices up – that's a scarcity mindset. We're in a world of an abundance mindset, right?"" he said.

He said Meta is committing to a total of 6.6GW of new power, calling it a ""huge amount of capacity"" to fuel the needs of decades to come, and that nuclear is a very reliable energy source.

DeWitte said one of the biggest structural choke points in bringing new energy online, and why the nation is running out of power, leading to price inflation, is the regulatory environment that has stymied growth for many years.

That dynamic, he said, has been ""fundamentally anti-energy.""

But, DeWitte said, that dynamic is changing: ""The unfortunate thing is we have to undo decades of... damage [from] not doing things to then overcome that inertia.""

""Look at the states that have the worst energy… They're largely states that have had the heaviest-handed anti-energy policies, and they're the ones that are now facing some of the biggest challenges on that point, and they are also responding, which is encouraging.""

OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.

""Our view of that, though, is changing a couple of things, including the business model, [and the] deployment model, including how we think about size and technology. We see opportunities to go invest in and build significant generating capacity in areas that need it and have significant development opportunities around it,"" he said, noting that brings the conversation full circle regarding its investment in the Ohio site.

When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.

""We, as a country, decided that we didn't need to build new power capacity and instead masked the challenges it imposes on industrial and economic growth by shipping jobs and production overseas,"" he said.

""Then you're just having those countries build power plants to power it. We need to bring that capability-set of manufacturing back to the country, but we need the energy to do it, and we don't have it today.""

New poll has Talarico leading, Cornyn tied with Paxton

A new poll of the state’s U.S. Senate primaries shows state Rep. James Talarico, D-Round Rock, leading U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas by 9 percentage points, 47% to 38%, among likely Democratic voters, The Texas Tribune reported. The Emerson College poll indicates a significant shift since a Texas Southern University poll in December showed Crockett with a similar-sized lead.

In both polls, Talarico leads among white and Latino voters, while Crockett has a commanding lead among Black voters.

On the GOP side, the latest polls show U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton deadlocked, with Paxton at 27% and Cornyn at 26%. U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, trailed with 16%. If those margins hold, that race would head to a runoff.

The survey also found Gov. Greg Abbott with a sizable lead over his main Democratic challenger, state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, 50% to 42%.

Solar power surpasses coal in feeding ERCOT grid

For the first time, solar power supplied more electricity in 2025 to the state’s main power grid than coal-fired power plants, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Solar farms provided 67,800 gigawatt-hours of electricity last year, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which is the power grid operator for most of the state. Power plants burning coal supplied 63,000 gigawatt-hours of power to ERCOT last year.

The Chronicle report notes that in 2019 solar supplied so little power to the ERCOT grid that it wasn’t even included as a separate category in its annual pie chart of where the grid’s power comes from. It is now the third-largest supplier to ERCOT, behind second-place wind and first-place natural gas. Coal has dropped to number four.

“It’s a remarkable milestone,” said Daniel Cohan, a Rice University professor who studies the state’s energy transition. “I don’t think anyone 10 years ago would have thought that solar would have surpassed coal this quickly.”

Texas set to ban smokeable cannabis this month

Smokable cannabis products currently sold legally in Texas could disappear by Jan. 25 under new rules proposed by the Texas Department of State Health Services. According to the Texas Standard, DSHS has drafted new regulations for the hemp industry, “including child-resistant packaging, stronger warning labels, expanded testing, recall procedures and fee increases of roughly 10,000% for manufacturers and retailers.”

Annual fees for hemp manufacturers would rise from $250 to $25,000 per facility, while retailers would see their registration fees jump from $150 to $20,000.

The proposed regulations would effectively outlaw most smokable hemp products.

DSHS last week heard from dozens of small hemp business owners and cannabis users, many of whom said they support stricter packaging rules and age limits but oppose the ban on smokable products and the steep hike in licensing and registration fees.

“These proposed fees don’t regulate small businesses, they eliminate them,” Estella Castro, owner of Austinite Cannabis Co., told commissioners. “This proposal would force me to close, despite doing everything right.”

Some speakers spoke in support of the proposed regulations, including a mother who said her son developed psychosis from using cannabis and required medial treatment.

DSHS expanding anti-rabies program to El Paso area

DSHS is expanding its 32nd annual Oral Rabies Vaccination Program to the El Paso area while continuing its aerial bait distribution along the Texas-Mexico border. The rabies vaccine baits will be distributed by hand in targeted areas around El Paso.

“Our mission is to vaccinate wildlife along the borders of Texas to maintain herd immunity against rabies and keep new or previously eliminated rabies variants from becoming established in any part of Texas,” said Kathy Parker, ORVP Director. “However, we continue to monitor all the counties of Texas for outbreaks and/or potential areas of rabies interest.”

The baits do not pose threats to livestock, wildlife or pets. The project costs $2 million annually and is funded by both state and federal agencies. Since the program began, no human cases of rabies attributable to the rabies variants found along the border have been confirmed in Texas.

The program covers 19 Texas counties: El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Presidio, Brewster, Pecos, Terrell, Val Verde, Kinney, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit, Webb, Zapata, Starr, Hidalgo, Cameron and Willacy.

Texas most popular state to move to

Texas is back on top of U-Haul’s list of “growth states,” according to the Austin American-Statesman. The company determines each state’s net gain or loss by recording how many customers used one-way equipment in 2025.

This is the fourth time the state has topped U-Haul’s rankings in five years. In 2024, South Carolina topped the list but fell to No. 5 last year. In second place is Florida, followed by North Carolina and Tennessee.

Coming in dead last in U-Haul’s ranking was California.

Correction: An item in the Jan. 4 Capital Highlights reported the Texas business inventory tax exemption has been raised to $125,000. That exemption applies to all business personal property accounts, not just inventory.

On Thursday, Alito recused himself, citing financial interests in ConocoPhillips, the parent of Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Co., a party in a related case.
Justice Clarence Thomas asked about the practical effect of having the case heard in state versus federal court.","Lawyers for the oil giant Chevron and a small Louisiana parish squared off Monday in a case that could have major consequences for how local communities can rectify environmental damage that may have been caused by oil company operations going back decades.

In April, a Louisiana state court jury ruled that Chevron must pay almost $745 million to help restore coastal wetlands in Plaquemines Parish that were damaged as far back as World War II. Chevron is asking the Supreme Court to order the case moved to federal court, where it could get more favorable terms.

The ripple effects could be large: If the justices rule that the company can move the case to federal court, the hefty award for Plaquemines Parish could be wiped out, legal experts say. Moreover, the case could affect the outcomes of nearly a dozen other lawsuits that make similar allegations about the oil and gas industry.

The justices on Monday questioned Chevron’s arguments that it should be allowed to take the case to federal court even though its federal contracts did not squarely deal with oil drilling, which Plaquemines Parish says caused the coastal damage. Chevron’s attorneys argued that the oil production was “related to” the production of aviation fuel for World War II, which they say should be enough to meet the test to have the case heard in federal court.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked whether there was a “butterfly effect problem” with their argument — a reference to the concept that a butterfly flapping its wings could set off a chain of causation that could eventually lead to a tornado — suggesting that he thought almost anything could be considered “related to” a government contract.

“It’s hard to see where you stop,” he said.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch likewise referred to the butterfly effect issue.

“The Big Bang is ‘related to’ you being here today, counsel,” he told Aaron Z. Roper, an attorney with the solicitor general’s office, which is supporting Chevron.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was not present for arguments. On Thursday, Alito recused himself, citing financial interests in ConocoPhillips, the parent of Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Co., a party in a related case.

Although the case focused on a narrow legal question, experts highlighted its importance in how companies fight claims of environmental damage.

“The stakes are higher than just where this one case is going to be heard,” said Mark Davis, director of the Center for Environmental Law at Tulane University.

If the company prevails in having the verdict thrown out and the long-running case moved to federal court, other companies that do business with the federal government are likely to pursue similar arguments in the future, Davis said.

At the heart of Chevron’s case is the argument that during World War II, the firm’s predecessors played a key role in helping to expand oil extraction to meet the demands of the war. Because they were working on behalf of U.S. government interests, the company and its backers have argued, claims regarding the actions at the time should be heard in a federal court rather than at the state level.

Judges and juries in federal courts are less inclined to have a bias toward local interests, experts say. But John Carmouche, an attorney representing Plaquemines Parish, said that if his side loses at the high court, he would confidently litigate the case in federal court and seek an even higher sum.

“All they’re doing is playing the delay game, which they’ve played for 13 years,” Carmouche said in an interview.

Justice Clarence Thomas asked about the practical effect of having the case heard in state versus federal court.

Ben Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, which argued on behalf of Plaquemines Parish, replied that state courts were far better equipped to interpret state law.

“We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get to the Louisiana Supreme Court, on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope,” he said.

But cases of national importance should be argued at the federal level, lawyers for Chevron argued in response to a question from Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

“If they can prove their case in federal court, then everybody’s going to accept the outcome and they’re not going to view it as something that’s a product of local prejudice,” said Paul D. Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general who represents the company.

Plaquemines Parish filed its lawsuit in 2013 alongside five other coastal parishes. It alleged that oil companies had caused environmental damage in violation of a 1978 state law aimed at conserving the imperiled coastline.

The case in front of the high court holds particular relevance in Louisiana, where the oil and gas industry remains a massive employer and the coastal region has steadily vanished in recent decades.

One 2017 analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey found that the state had lost about 2,000 square miles of land along its coast from 1932 to 2016. That equates to losing about a football field’s worth of coastal wetlands every 34 minutes during periods of most rapid loss.

The authors called Louisiana’s wetlands “one of the most critically threatened environments in the United States” and detailed how the state had lost more wetlands than all other states in the Lower 48 combined. Those losses are projected to persist in the years ahead.

Scientists have documented how oil and gas extraction has played a significant role in the degradation of such landscapes over time. Oil spills have stressed vegetation and wildlife. The dredging of canals and construction of pipelines have altered natural hydrology, increased saltwater intrusion and undermined wetlands.

But the fossil fuel industry is hardly the only threat facing the coast, where humans have built levees that have changed the flow of the Mississippi River and constrained its historical ability to deposit sediment and build land. The process of sinking land, also known as subsidence, has continued to affect the coast.

After the $745 million verdict in April, oil industry figures sharply criticized the decision.

The verdict “not only undermines Louisiana’s position as an energy leader but also threatens our country’s trajectory to America-first energy dominance,” Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association, said at the time.

“These lawsuits were never about restoring the coast,” he said in a statement. “As the number-one private investor in our working coast, the energy industry is already doing that. Instead, this is deep-pocketed trial lawyers driving baseless lawsuits, hoping to make millions in legal fees.”

When the Supreme Court later agreed to take up the case, Faucheux said the decision presented “an opportunity for the high court to uphold fair and consistent application of the law and to help preserve legal stability for the industry that fuels America’s economy.”

The issue on the flip side, Davis of the Tulane Center said, is the question of what obligations oil and gas firms have to rectify environmental damage caused by their operations.

“What obligations do you have to fix what you broke?” he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Coastal-Damage.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 17:00:06.896111

New Point of Departure: 0.3 ppm

The draft introduces a new Point of Departure (POD) of 0.3 ppm, representing the threshold from which EPA begins determining risk. This revised value could influence future exposure limits, risk assessments, and workplace mitigation strategies.

Revised Conditions of Use

The updated draft removes five previously evaluated conditions of use from the “unreasonable risk” category. EPA notes that these specific scenarios no longer exceed benchmark levels based on improved data and updated analytical methods.

Replacement of the January 2025 Evaluation

This proposal is intended to replace the risk evaluation finalized in January 2025. The updated draft reflects new modeling, additional exposure data, and a refined methodology.

Ongoing Work on Risk Management

EPA emphasizes that it is still revising its formaldehyde risk management rule. That process will continue even as the revised evaluation moves through review and comment periods. For industrial hygienists, this means requirements may shift again as EPA aligns the risk evaluation and risk management components.

Timeline and Opportunities to Comment

Stakeholders—including industrial hygienists, manufacturers, healthcare facilities, laboratories, and building-material producers—can provide input on the updated draft.

Public comment deadline: February 2, 2026

What It Means for Industrial Hygiene Programs

While the updated draft does not immediately change compliance obligations, IH practitioners should begin reviewing potential impacts:

Assess whether current monitoring strategies align with the new POD.

Re-evaluate exposure scenarios previously considered low-risk.

Prepare for future adjustments to engineering controls or administrative practices once EPA finalizes its approach.

Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., on Jan. 13 met with officials from Growth Energy, the nation’s leading biofuel trade association, to underscore her support for ethanol production, as well as her commitment to helping strengthen our national and energy security, expand year-round E15 sales, drive down gas prices, support our farmers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and drive rural economic opportunity in Illinois and across the country. Photos from the meeting can be found on the Senator’s website.

“Investing in clean energy has a positive ripple effect for our nation,” said Duckworth. “When we prioritize homegrown biofuels and year-round E15, we’re encouraging job growth, prioritizing our national security, reducing gas prices, protecting our environment and securing Illinois’s leadership in the energy sector for years to come.

Duckworth met with a variety of renewable energy leaders today, including Illinois-based companies such as Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) of Chicago and John Deere of Moline.

In the Senate, Duckworth has been a leader in advancing biofuels. As a founding co-chair of the Senate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Caucus, she has been a strong advocate for expansion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by utilizing the domestic biofuels and agricultural sectors. To help increase the availability of E15 biofuels, Duckworth helped introduce the bipartisan Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025 and the bipartisan Next Generations Fuel Act to allow the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10 percent.

January 19, 2026 – Regina, Saskatchewan – PrairiesCan

As Canada’s energy needs evolve, communities across the country are seeking innovative solutions that deliver clean, affordable power. In Saskatchewan, small modular reactors can deliver reliable, low-emission power to meet the needs of the future while driving economic growth—but further research and testing is needed to unlock their full potential.

Today, the Honourable Buckley Belanger, Secretary of State (Rural Development), on behalf of the Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan), announced federal support for the University of Regina to build the Small Modular Reactor Safety, Licensing, and Testing centre (SMR-SLT).

The new testing facility will ensure that Canadian researchers and businesses are equipped to safely develop and deploy these next-generation nuclear technologies. It represents a Government of Canada investment of $1.96 million through PrairiesCan, alongside $4 million from the Government of Saskatchewan.

The SMR-SLT will provide industry and academic partners with access to the first modern SMR test loops in Western Canada and will enable the testing of components under conditions that replicate operating reactors. This will support innovation, workforce development, and the safe deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies.

Canada generates 15 percent of its power from nuclear energy, but none of it is produced in Western Canada. Saskatchewan has the largest high-grade uranium deposits in the world and provides almost a quarter of the world's uranium supply for electrical generation. SMR deployment in Saskatchewan and across Canada will harness more value from our natural resources, meeting Canada’s energy production needs while driving down emissions.

The project will create 18 direct jobs, support 10 small businesses, and train a highly skilled workforce, while advancing Saskatchewan’s preparation for the estimated 2,500 to 3,500 jobs required to build and operate nuclear power plants by the mid-2030s.",https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/pedc-decp/images/news/NR - SK - U of Regina SMR - en - 960x550.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:58:54.165596

Developed by researchers at Texas A&M University in partnership with ExcelThermic Enterprises, the PICC system skips over the expensive solvents and high-temperature regeneration used in traditional amine-based capture technologies. Instead, it applies a basic physical principle—CO₂ dissolves in water under pressure, and escapes when that pressure drops.

In effect, PICC mimics the release of fizz from a soda bottle, but at industrial scale. The result is a system that can reportedly capture up to 99% of carbon dioxide emissions using only water, standard equipment, and pressure differentials. The same water can be recirculated, further minimizing operating costs and maintenance overhead.

From Exhaust to Storage: How PICC Works

Rather than relying on chemical reactions, PICC uses a sequence of physical steps to isolate and collect carbon dioxide. Emissions from sources like power plants, cement kilns, or hydrogen production are first cooled and compressed. This compressed gas enters an absorption unit where it meets a downward flow of cold water inside a packed column designed for maximum gas-liquid interaction.

As the CO₂ dissolves into the water, the treated exhaust exits with minimal carbon content. The now CO₂-rich water is then sent through a series of lower-pressure tanks where the gas gradually bubbles out and is collected for compression and either permanent storage or industrial reuse.

In some configurations, the process can be enhanced with small amounts of lime to improve CO₂ removal, especially from combustion air—pushing capture rates to 100% and enabling net-negative emissions when paired with biomass.

What makes this model noteworthy is its simplicity. Unlike solvent-based systems that degrade over time, require chemical handling, and involve complex thermal regeneration steps, PICC leans on well-understood physical laws and modular hardware. That translates to faster permitting, easier retrofits, and lower long-term operational risk.

A Cost Curve Shift for Heavy Industry

While carbon capture has long been seen as essential to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, it remains constrained by high costs. The standard amine-based systems typically capture about 90% of CO₂ at a cost between $50 and $100 per metric ton.

In contrast, early economic models for PICC suggest capture and compression at around $26 per ton. Even with added lime for full carbon removal, costs stay below $28 per ton on average—making it a compelling option for industries confronting emissions mandates and carbon pricing.

By focusing on pressure and water instead of heat and chemicals, PICC offers a scalable, infrastructure-compatible bridge for legacy assets in power, cement, and manufacturing. It won’t replace the broader need for clean energy, but it could buy time—and reduce emissions—while the transition unfolds.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260119-102337-b1e-engin-akyurt-C0MyvY65vgY-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:59:56.415705

According to data analytics and Bitcoin tracking platform Bitcoin Treasuries, the LASERS fund holds $15.6 billion in total value with Strategy stock ($MSTR) making up about $3.2 million.

Government Exposure to Bitcoin Continues Trending

The LASERS fund joins a litany of other state programs, including numerous pension funds, around the US who have exposure to Bitcoin either directly or through ETFs or proxy stocks.

While the Louisiana fund’s exposure might be relatively small, at $3.2 million, it represents a continuation of this trend and the tacit endorsement for Bitcoin as a treasury asset from yet another state-level government entity in the US.

As Coinspeaker reported in June 2025, Texas became the first US state to approve adding Bitcoin to its treasury later purchasing $10 million BTC directly. Numerous other states followed suit with proposals for their own Bitcoin treasuries, including Arizona, Michigan, Montana, and Tennessee.

Pension Funds Usually Avoid Direct Exposure

Funds such as LASERS have a mandate to increase their treasuries coupled with a strict fiduciary duty to limit exposure to volatility.

As a result, a litany of state pension funds have limited their exposure to Bitcoin to ETFs or investment in crypto-adjacent financial firms. Examples include the New York State Common Retirement Fund, California State Teachers’ Retirement System, and Florida Retirement System, each of which have significant investments in $MSTR.

In the realm of direct exposure, numerous state pension treasuries, such as the Michigan and Jersey City retirement funds, have invested heavily in Bitcoin ETFs. But very few have purchased BTC directly. The Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRR) made headlines back in 2021 when it announced a $25 million investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As of January 2026, the HFRR appears to be outperforming nearly all other similar pension funds in its financial class with Bitcoin hovering above $90K against the fund’s initial purchase price of around $65K.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/coinspeaker_us_106/94573145d6cda866ec0026111e902386,N,,2026-01-20 05:00:05.930904

She said the Ohio EPA approached them and was willing to “fully fund” the project.
“It got funded in the controlling board meeting on Monday, so the money is allocated toward the site,” Wagner said.
He then said they will be opened on Thursday, Feb. 19, at the land bank meeting.
The land bank board approved Terry Britton as president of the board.","The involvement of the Ohio EPA in a Brownfield Remediation Grant Program (BRGP) site caused the removal of the project at the monthly meeting of the Highland County Land Reutilization Corporation (land bank).

Jason Johansen, land bank administrator, said the land bank will “possibly” need to pull its application for the Bell Foundry site due to the City of Hillsboro’s intention to use a different source of grant funding for the project.

Johansen said that Lauren Walker sent an email saying that the Hillsboro Community Improvement Corporation decided to pull its involvement from this specific project so it can pursue funding from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Division of Environmental Response and Revitalization (DERR) program. She said the Ohio EPA approached them and was willing to “fully fund” the project. Walker said they “would be honored to work with them directly” and obtain the No Further Action letter and Covenant Not to Sue.

“It got funded in the controlling board meeting on Monday, so the money is allocated toward the site,” Wagner said. “The recommendation would be to, and they obviously are doing that, is to withdraw it from ODOD, letting them know, and by doing so, that allows and frees up roughly $400,000 for this board to look at other projects within the county for the best interest of the land.”

The land bank board then approved the removal of Bell’s Foundry from the BRGP.

For other BRGP projects, Johansen said the East Monroe tank farm, the former machine shop and the former East Main gas station are all complete for the 2024/25 BRGP cycle. He said all reporting has been approved and he is now waiting for the final reimbursements.

At the Rocky Fork Truck Stop, he said that he “believes” that the 90-day waiting period is over and that Tetra Tech did some samples for the monitoring wells last week.

Matt Wagner, a certified professional at Tetra Tech, said the company was out doing sampling on the wells to make sure the injections worked. He also said he anticipates having the analytical results next week and will give an update to the board on the next steps.

“But, the project obviously is under budget, still committed to the June 30 deadline for the project,” Wagner said. “You know, we’ve kept the owners as well informed in terms of what we’re doing and they’ve been cooperating since they’ve been utilizing the lot for some storage. So, with that being said, we’re just in the throes of it as we speak for actual remediation.”

Concerning the Building Demolition and Site Revitalization Grant Program, Johansen said he is still waiting for approval from the Ohio Department of Development (ODOD) for the additional projects of the 2024/25 leftover round. He said that if any of those projects cause the funds to go over the $131,140.30 leftover funds, the projects that can’t be done will be moved to the 2026 version of the (BDSRGP).

He also said his plan is to release the bids after the meeting, after which he will set the due date for Feb. 18, 2026, at 4 p.m. He then said they will be opened on Thursday, Feb. 19, at the land bank meeting. He then highlighted that the contractors do not need to be present at the meeting to be awarded any of the projects.

He said more projects can be added until April 30, 2026, with those additional projects likely to need an extension approved by ODOD because those projects would need an asbestos inspection, a possible abatement and then a demolition by June 30 if there is no extension.

The land bank board approved asbestos abatements by Industrial Installation Specialists (IIS) at 21 S. Fairfield St., Leesburg; 226 S High St., Hillsboro; 237 East Lilley Ave., Hillsboro; and 6539 Spring Hill Dr., Hillsboro, for $3,395. Johansen said the abatements would be complete and the documentation submitted to him by 4 p.m. on Feb. 18, 2026.

Johansen also gave an update on the demolition of 133 and 137 S. Washington St. in Greenfield. He said those properties are related to the former Elliott Hotel, which was included in a previous BRGP cycle. He also said 137 S. Washington is owned by the Village of Greenfield and it is being held up structurally. Greenfield is currently looking to purchase the other property from a private property owner because the property it owns has “unaffordable” renovation costs.

“This is very similar to the downtown Lynchburg buildings, where it was very difficult to tear down one without possible structural damage to the other, and I just don’t think the land bank should take on the liability, unless the adjacent property owner is willing to sign a release, which is highly unlikely, as we saw in Lynchburg,” Johansen said. “So the village would like to put these into the demolition program. I think they’re going to get ownership of that adjacent structure next to them, and really, what they want to know right now is how much would that commitment be.”

The land bank board approved the two properties to be considered two structures, and the maximum demolition price-matching cost would be $5,000.

Johansen also delivered updates of multiple other properties, which are as follows:

*Regarding 222 McClain Ave. in Greenfield, Johansen said the property was listed at $20,000 in August, but the land bank has not received any offers other than someone who said they would make payments on it until it was paid off. However, he then said the land bank received a $3,000 offer, with that offer coming from someone who also made an offer for 216 McClain Ave. in Greenfield. Following multiple members of the land bank saying they wanted the organization to recoup more of its costs from the property than $3,000, the board approved lowering the price of the property to $10,000.

The land bank board approved Terry Britton as president of the board. However, it tabled a discussion on vice president due to neither of the possibilities, Randy Mustard and Lauren Walker, being present at the meeting.

Randy Mustard and Lauren Walker were also nominated as representatives of the Paint Township Trustees and the City of Hillsboro, respectively, on the land bank board.

In a fireside chat held at the auto show Jan. 14, former Democratic Party presidential candidate and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said rapidly changing federal policy is causing a potential setback to the industry.

“The other thing that I saw and heard speaking to each of the manufacturers who were displaying their incredible products was how much industry has had to contend with this whiplash from the policy side,” he said.

While every administration will have its own priorities, the changes in policy and how the industry has reacted to it has been a setback, he said, in particular referencing how administrations have handled electric vehicles.

“When you have a technology that is ultimately more advanced, policymakers cannot just put the toothpaste back into the tube,” he said. “There is no question about whether this technology will be the future of the sector.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who appeared via prerecorded responses during a panel Jan. 15, stated that policy uncertainty is creating problems for the industry. Things remained consistent until the Biden administration tried to make a push toward electric vehicles, he said.

“Nobody needs to be pro or against electric vehicles. The consumer is ultimately going to be the judge and jury on that. They make millions of decisions with their pocketbooks that drive car companies to decide what kind of vehicles to make. That was our mantra for a long time,” he said.

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, who appeared with Moreno, said the government should support innovation, safety, emissions reduction and mobility, but not dictate consumer choices.

“That’s a very different government ambition and partnership with industry than having the government tell customers what they can and cannot buy,” he said.

Bozzella said that a degree of certainty and clarity is also needed.

“One person’s clarity could be another person’s EV mandate,” he said.

Regulations need to be able to outlast changes in presidential administrations, he said. While the president is entitled to appoint cabinet secretaries to make market adjustments, “there’s a difference between making adjustments based on market conditions, the state of technology, the cost of those types of things and tearing the entire playbook up and starting off again,” he said.

These kinds of changes are what create a problem across the industry, he said.

Additionally, Bozzella said regulation around electric vehicles needs to stay at the same pace as the demand for the vehicles to help keep investments from becoming “stranded,” he said. While there is still a demand for EVs, it’s moving at a “more realistic” pace, he said.

“Those policies are important for the development of the market over time, but we are where we are right now,” he said. “So, I think you’ll see continued investment, but it’s going to be a slower pace.”",https://www.candgnews.com/storage/cache/articles/10003/800t653c9182fa497a38b03bc89eba496a4a.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 23:58:38.415023

We are working to protect the Gulf from pollution and industrial expansion that threaten its ecosystems, its wildlife, and its future.","From the Piney Woods of East Texas to the desert canyons of West Texas, from the rolling Hill Country to the marshes and bays of the Gulf Coast, Texas is defined by its extraordinary natural diversity. As Davy Crockett once put it, “Texas is the garden spot of the world.”

Soon spring rains will bring bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush, refilled creeks and rivers, and wildlife stirred back into motion. Migratory birds will return to coastal marshes and urban greenbelts, while paddlers, hikers, and anglers rediscover Texas’s rivers, lakes, and trails.

Throughout the year, Texans seek out wild adventures – pondering the starry skies of Big Bend, floating clear Hill Country rivers, fishing along the coast, and walking shaded trails in city parks from Dallas to Houston to the Rio Grande Valley. These places support wildlife and the quality of life that makes Texas home.

Each year, we stand shoulder to shoulder with Texans across the state to protect the “garden spot” we all love by protecting parks and wildlife, expanding clean energy, keeping our water safe to drink and swim in, reducing waste and expanding recycling and repair opportunities, and holding polluters accountable for harmful air pollution. In 2026, we will continue advancing practical solutions that protect both people and the places we love.

In 2026, our priorities include:

Safeguarding parks, open spaces, and wildlife habitat

Texas’ parks and natural lands provide places to explore, recharge, and connect with nature, while also supporting wildlife and ecological health. We are working to protect what we have and expand access to nature for a growing state.

Supporting the creation of new and expanded Texas state parks through the Centennial Parks Conservation Fund

Connecting landscapes through wildlife corridors, including wildlife crossings that protect animals from vehicle collisions, to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem health

Advancing clean energy

Texas leads the nation in renewable energy and we can continue to power our state while cutting pollution and protecting the landscapes and communities Texans care about.

Speeding up rooftop solar and home energy resilience through streamlined permitting

Reducing pollution and strain on the electric grid by improving the energy efficiency of, and ending taxpayer subsidies for, fast-growing data centers

Pushing back against discriminatory barriers to renewable energy development while ensuring projects are responsibly sited and built to protect land, water, and wildlife

Protecting clean water and the coast

Clean water is fundamental to public health, outdoor recreation, and thriving ecosystems. We are working to stop pollution at its source, invest in modern infrastructure, and protect Texans’ drinking water from toxic contaminants.

Stopping plastic pellet (“nurdle”) pollution before it reaches rivers, bays, and the Gulf

Fighting fecal bacteria pollution in rivers, lakes, and swimming holes by securing funding to repair and upgrade broken wastewater infrastructure that contaminates waterways and drinking water supplies

Protecting drinking water from lead, PFAS, and other toxic pollutants that threaten public health in communities across Texas

Stop oil companies from dumping fracking wastewater into the Pecos River and other waterways

Save the Lavaca River from a proposed dam which would threaten oyster reefs and fish populations

Improving recycling systems and reducing waste

Texas’s waste system is a major and often overlooked source of pollution. Landfills, trash incineration, plastic waste, and so-called “chemical recycling” contaminate air and water, drive climate change, and harm wildlife and human health — even as valuable materials that could be reused or truly recycled are thrown away. We are working to modernize recycling, cut waste at the source, and give Texans more control over the products they buy and use.

Leading the campaign to improve recycling and reduce waste in Houston

Opposing chemical recycling schemes that burn plastic, release hazardous pollution, and lock Texas into continued plastic production instead of real waste reduction

Expanding Right to Repair so Texans can fix their own products, waste less, and keep usable materials out of landfills and waterways

Protecting birds, bees and butterflies

Bees, butterflies, and birds are part of the quiet beauty of the natural world – the flicker of wings over a meadow, the hum in a garden, and the ancient migrations that return life to our landscapes. Many of these species are now in steep decline. We are working to protect them and the places they need to exist, not only for what they do, but because they belong.

Expanding pollinator-friendly habitat along roadsides, in parks, and in communities

Reducing the use of harmful pesticides that threaten bees, butterflies, birds, and other wildlife

Advancing bird-friendly design practices in buildings in Dallas and across the state

Holding polluters accountable

Air pollution is linked to asthma attacks, heart disease, premature deaths, and other serious health harms — and in Texas, much of it comes from oil and gas operations, refineries, and chemical plants. We are working to reduce dangerous air pollution, enforce existing laws, and protect public health across the state.

Reducing methane and other air pollution from oil and gas operations

Preventing harmful emissions from refineries and petrochemical plants

Expanding transit and building bikeable, walkable communities

Texas communities are stronger, healthier, and more connected when people have safe, clean and convenient options for getting around. We are working to expand public transit and create bikeable, walkable places that give Texans more freedom in how they travel and more access to jobs, schools, and everyday destinations.

Supporting the successful build-out of Project Connect to expand high-capacity public transit in Central Texas

Advancing improved service, reliability, and expansion at Dallas Area Rapid Transit and other transit systems across the state

Promoting bikeable and walkable community design, including safer streets, connected trail networks, and infrastructure that protects people walking and biking

(RFD NEWS) — U.S. agriculture is entering 2026 with a noticeably tighter credit environment, requiring producers to be more deliberate with business planning when it comes to operating loans, refinancing, and land purchases. AgAmerica Lending says higher interest rates, compressed margins, and uneven income performance are converging just as many operations rely more heavily on financing to maintain cash flow.

Despite those pressures, balance sheets across agriculture remain relatively strong, supported by resilient farmland values. That equity has helped cushion recent volatility, but lenders are becoming more selective. According to AgAmerica, lenders are placing greater emphasis on liquidity, repayment capacity, and documentation, signaling a shift from readily available credit to more disciplined underwriting.

Crop producers face the most strain. Lower grain and fiber prices, paired with elevated input and labor costs, have tightened working capital and increased dependence on operating credit. A Farmer Mac survey cited by AgAmerica shows nearly 70 percent of ag lenders now view grain and cotton operations as their top risk concern, up sharply from two years ago.

Delinquencies remain contained, but scrutiny is increasing.

Earned Income Tax Credit: This is a refundable credit for working filers.
Education Expenses Tax Credits: • American Opportunity Tax Credit, or AOTC: Up to $2,500 per eligible student per year.
See more details and find other tax credits and deductions at IRS.gov/credits-and-deductions.","LITTLE ROCK — The passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act last year will mean significant changes for some taxpayers this season.

Laura Hendrix, extension associate professor of personal finance and consumer economics for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, said the changes include no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and an enhanced deduction for seniors age 65 and older.

Hendrix said some of the new changes include the following:

Increased standard deduction amounts for tax year 2025:

• $31,500 for married couples filing jointly.

• $15,750 for single filers and married individuals filing jointly.

• $23,625 for heads of household.

Elimination of taxes on:

• Overtime (for qualified overtime income up to $12,500 or $25,000 for joint filers).

• Tips (for tips totaling up to $25,000).

• This phases out for incomes above $150,000 (or $300,000 for joint filers).

Deduction for seniors:

• Effective from 2025 through 2028, individuals age 65 and older may claim an additional $6,000 deduction.

• This is in addition to the standard deduction for seniors available under existing law.

• This applies per eligible individual (or $12,000 for a married couple if both spouses qualify).

• This phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $75,000 (or $150,000 for joint filers).

• Filers must be 65 or older on or before the last day of the tax year.

• This is available for both itemizing and non-itemizing taxpayers.

Increased State and Local Taxes, or SALT, cap:

• The maximum itemized deduction for state and local taxes is temporarily raised to $40,000 (or $20,000 for married filing separately), with a phaseout for high-income earners.

1099-K and 1099-DA:

• “Taxpayers who received more than $20,000 in payments for goods and services in more than 200 transactions through an online marketplace or payment app in 2025 should expect to receive a Form 1099-K in January 2026,” Hendrix said. “The IRS will also receive a copy of your Form 1099-K. 1099-DA is used for reporting digital assets.”

Hendrix said taxpayers should use the new Schedule 1-A to claim recently enacted tax deductions.

Some energy-efficient deductions and credits are being eliminated or capped in 2025, Hendrix said, including the following:

• Home improvements, such as energy-efficient windows, doors and solar installations, sunset after 2025.

• Electric vehicle credits (up to $7,500) go away for EVs purchased after Sept. 30, 2025.

Start Early

The Internal Revenue Service announced it will begin accepting and processing 2025 tax year returns on Jan. 26, with a deadline of April 15. Hendrix recommends preparing early for a smooth tax filing process. Hendrix said consumers should gather the following documents and information to prepare for filing:

• Bank account information for returns via direct deposit

• W-2s from employers

• 1099s from banks and other payers

• Records of digital asset transactions

• Other documents as needed to verify qualifying tax credits or adjustments

Failure to pay taxes by the deadline can result in penalties, but filing extensions are available.

“If you can’t file by the due date of your return, you can request an automatic six-month extension of time to file,” Hendrix said. “However, it’s important to note that an extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay. You should pay any owed taxes by your original due date to avoid the penalties.”

Those who wish to file an extension should file Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, by the original due date of their return.

Optimizing Filing Status

Hendrix said that for most married people, filing jointly has benefits, but that is not always the case.

“The best way to find out if you should file jointly or separately is to prepare your tax return both ways,” Hendrix said. “Some couples may prefer to keep their finances separate. Filing separately can limit your liability for your spouse’s tax obligations or debts. Some couples may qualify for more tax credits by filing jointly.”

Major life events can also impact taxes, including marriage, divorce, a new job, having children or buying a home, Hendrix said. Visit irs.gov/individuals/managing-your-taxes-after-a-life-event to learn more.

Taxpayers should also be cautious of calls and emails, as scams are rampant during filing season. To learn more about tax-related scams, visit irs.gov/help/tax-scams.

Tax Credits for 2025

Hendrix said a few common tax credits for the 2025 tax year include the following:

Child Tax Credit: Up to $2,200 per qualifying child under age 17. Income limits and other qualifications apply.

Child and Dependent Care Credit: For the care of a qualifying child under age 13 or a dependent who cannot care for themselves.

Earned Income Tax Credit: This is a refundable credit for working filers. The maximum amount of credit is as follows:

• No qualifying children: $649

• One qualifying child: $4,328

• Two qualifying children: $7,152

• Three or more qualifying children: $8,046

Adoption Credit: This is for qualified expenses paid to adopt an eligible child. For 2025, the maximum credit is up to $17,280.

Education Expenses Tax Credits:

• American Opportunity Tax Credit, or AOTC: Up to $2,500 per eligible student per year. Up to 40 percent (or $1,000) of the credit may be refundable, meaning you can get money back even if you owe no tax.

• Lifetime Learning Credit, or LLC: Up to $2,000 per tax return per year, non-refundable. The LLC is nonrefundable, meaning it can reduce your tax bill to $0 but won't result in a cash refund.

“You cannot claim both credits for the same student in the same year, but you can claim different credits for different students in the same year,” Hendrix said. “For example, you could claim AOTC for one child and LLC for another. You also cannot claim these credits if you are claimed as a dependent on someone else's return.

“Visit IRS.gov to see details of expenses that qualify for each type of education tax credit and income limits,” Hendrix said.

Filing Resources

Depending on an individual filer’s circumstances, Hendrix recommended several filing resources.

“AARP is for filers age 50 and older, and MilTax is for military service members,” Hendrix said. “Income limits apply for most types of free filing.”

Other recommended resources include:

That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.
The direction includes: Providing long-term certainty for new power generation: Provide 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants to accelerate the development of reliable power generation.
Protecting residential electricity rates: Protect ratepayers by limiting the amount existing power plants can be paid in the PJM capacity market.
The measures will also help keep electricity prices affordable for residential customers, while addressing rising demand from data centers.","U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, vice-chair and chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC), respectively, joined Mid-Atlantic governors urging PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), to temporarily overhaul its market rules to strengthen grid reliability and reduce electricity costs for American families and businesses by building more than $15 billion of reliable baseload power generation.

The initiative calls on PJM to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The action follows a series of PJM policies over the years that have weakened the electric grid, including the premature shutdown of reliable power generation.

President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency on his first day in office, warning that the previous administration's energy subtraction agenda left the country vulnerable to blackouts and soaring electricity prices. During the Biden administration, PJM forced nearly 17 gigawatts of reliable baseload power generation offline. For the first time in history, PJM’s capacity auction failed to secure enough generation resources to meet basic reliability requirements. If not fixed, it will lead to further rising prices and blackouts.

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “The Biden administration’s forceful closures of coal and natural gas plants without reliable replacements left the United States in an energy emergency. Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM. That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again. Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom. President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first. This plan keeps that promise.""

""For too long, the Green New Scam has left Mid-Atlantic families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Today, under President Trump's leadership, the National Energy Dominance Council has come up with a solution to end these high costs, roll back the Biden administration’s policies of energy scarcity, and ensure we are powering the Mid-Atlantic and part of the Midwest’s future without charging its citizens a cent. This initiative will ensure we usher in the age of artificial intelligence with new power plants funded by the technology companies, not taxpayers, securing the steel of Pennsylvania, the manufacturing of Ohio, and the ships of Virginia. The Trump administration is keeping the lights on, the factories humming, and the American Dream affordable.""

The direction includes:

Providing long-term certainty for new power generation: Provide 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants to accelerate the development of reliable power generation.

Protecting residential electricity rates: Protect ratepayers by limiting the amount existing power plants can be paid in the PJM capacity market.

Ensuring data centers pay their fair share: Make data centers pay more for new generation than residential customers by allocating costs for any new generation procured to data center customers that have not self-procured new capacity or agreed to be curtailable.

Prioritizing immediate grid stability: Take other steps to ensure more affordable, reliable, and secure electricity for the American people.

The recommendations propose temporary but critical measures to ensure American businesses, especially those in some of the nation’s most manufacturing-intensive regions, have the reliable power they need to operate. The measures will also help keep electricity prices affordable for residential customers, while addressing rising demand from data centers.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/25968/download/HTVIL74PMNNGJNBJCB52DLTTE4.jpeg?cb=9a02004506a3c358255f4efd53f06326&w=960,N,,2026-01-19 17:58:50.876415

While additional details for the hearing are not yet available at this time, the release of the Discussion Draft marks a notable milestone in Congress’s increasingly vocal promises to address perceived shortcomings in both the landmark 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) nearly ten years of implementation that followed. This is the first time that many of the contemplated legislative changes have been shared publicly.

The Discussion Draft would impose sweeping changes to many of the key sections in TSCA, including those pertaining to definitions, testing authorities, review of new chemicals, review and management of existing chemicals, TSCA Inventory nomenclature, relationship to other federal laws, citizens’ petitions, TSCA fees, and more. Although Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. (B&C®) will continue to review carefully this text and its potential implications, we are pleased to share the following highlights and initial observations.

Definitions

Changes to the statutory phrase “conditions of use” that limit EPA’s discretion to identify reasonably foreseen circumstances to those “more likely than not to be” and, in turn, narrow the scope of risk evaluations.

New Chemical Reviews

A narrowed scope of new chemical reviews, limiting the assessment to just the conditions of use “identified by the submitter of the notice” — rather than the current requirement that EPA consider known, intended, and reasonably foreseen circumstances;

A qualifier on how EPA can determine a new chemical may present an unreasonable risk, in that it must be “more likely than not that such unreasonable risk will occur”;

A nondelegable requirement for the EPA Administrator personally to issue a statement for each premanufacture notice (PMN) review that EPA fails to review timely;

A new requirement that EPA make “best efforts” to prioritize review of certain new chemical notices, including those that a submitter identifies as offering specified risk reduction benefits, eligible for Safer Choice program inclusion, or are necessary to “improve the security and resiliency of … domestic critical material supply chains” as identified by the Secretary of Commerce;

Limitations on voluntary suspensions of the new chemical review period;

Changes making EPA’s requirement to address identified risk through Section 5(e) orders now discretionary instead of mandatory; and

New authority for EPA to exempt new chemicals from the review process upon a showing that the activity has been approved by another Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member country.

Existing Chemical Risk Evaluations

New emphasis on the likelihood of exposures/hazards, directing EPA to consider only those that “are more likely than not” to result in unreasonable risk;

Explicit direction to consider the impact of existing federal regulatory limits, and not to assume noncompliance — including noncompliance with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards;

Change to make all final risk evaluations “final agency action” and thus immediately judicially reviewable, rather than the current requirement that limits judicial review of an unreasonable risk determination until after the promulgation of a final TSCA Section 6 risk management rule;

New compensation process and provisions to address the TSCA fee issue of reliant parties that do not fairly contribute to the risk evaluation fee for the particular chemical;

Extension of TSCA fee authority for another ten years from date bill is signed into law, that would allow EPA to continue to collect fees for risk evaluation activities; and

Further direction to prioritize actual information on the chemical versus analog or modeled data.

Existing Chemical Risk Management

Change to the risk management standard, from requiring EPA to eliminate the identified unreasonable risk to a requirement that EPA “minimize, to the extent reasonably feasible” such risk; and

Amendments to TSCA Section 9 that prohibit EPA from issuing risk management rules that are “inconsistent” with other existing federal requirements.

TSCA Inventory Nomenclature

New requirements for EPA to consider the equivalency of certain Unknown or Variable Composition, Complex reaction products or Biological materials (UVCB) chemical substances, such that they would not be considered new chemical substances and not subject to PMN and review requirements in TSCA Section 5.

Citizens’ Petitions

Removal of authority for citizens to petition EPA for issuance of a TSCA Section 6(a) risk management rule — replaced with new authority for citizens to petition EPA to consider designating a chemical as a high-priority substance for risk evaluation.

TSCA Fee Collection

A ten-year reauthorization of EPA’s authority to collect fees to help defray the costs of its implementation efforts, currently set to expire at the end of Fiscal Year 2026.

Commentary

The Discussion Draft is a culmination of nearly a decade of pent-up frustration with EPA’s efforts to implement TSCA and its perceived failure to live up to the bipartisan expectations and over-brimming optimism of 2016. Nonetheless, the scope and extent of the proposed changes are surprising and begs the question of who exactly the target is of the desired “discussion.” B&C reported last year on cautious agreement by key Senate Democrats that TSCA could benefit from improvement around the edges. Some public health and environmental organizations, to the contrary, have taken the public position that legislative amendments are unnecessary. While many of the ideas outlined in the Discussion Draft are interesting and laudable, this 37-page rewrite of many of the major compromises in the 2016 TSCA amendments is not likely to gain much traction with those constituencies. In the meantime, the clock continues to tick on EPA’s TSCA fee collection authority, the expiration of which B&C believes could exacerbate the TSCA program’s ongoing resource and workload challenges. The forthcoming hearing should shed some light on initial reactions to the Discussion Draft and perhaps set the stage for another round of bipartisan debate leading to addressing the shortcomings of the 2016 amendments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15432_3114.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:51.227913

For decades, Canada’s economic survival has relied on a single, unshakeable truth: our proximity to the United States is our greatest shield. However, as we enter 2026, that shield has begun to feel more like a cage. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s recent pivot toward China—marked by his historic January visit to Beijing—is not merely a sudden change in trade policy, but a calculated response to an increasingly transactional and unpredictable Washington. With President Trump openly musing about Canada as a “51st state” and threatening broad tariffs on continental trade, the Carney administration appears to have concluded that the “fortress North America” ideal is crumbling from within. This pivot is a “strategic realism” born of necessity, signaling that Canada can no longer afford to be a passive bystander in a trade war it didn’t start.

The immediate tension of this strategy lies in the trade-off between the $19.2 billion automotive sector and the $14.5 billion canola industry. By slashing EV duties to 6.1% for a 49,000-unit quota in exchange for China dropping its 80% punitive tariffs on Canadian seeds and shellfish, the government is making a clear choice to rescue the Prairies at the potential expense of Ontario’s industrial floor. Yet, the math suggests this is less of a “flood” and more of a managed experiment. A 49,000-unit cap represents only about 3% of the total Canadian vehicle market—essentially restoring the 2023 import levels that were largely dominated by Chinese-made Teslas. By framing this as a “stabilization effort” rather than a broad liberalization, the administration is attempting to provide a vital lifeline to farmers while keeping the actual displacement of domestic manufacturing to a minimum.

This high-wire act faces its greatest test with the looming July 1, 2026, CUSMA review. The initial analysis rightly identifies the risk of American retaliation, as Washington could view the EV quota as a “backdoor” for Chinese influence. There is a real danger that the U.S. might invoke Section 301 investigations or apply 40% “transshipment” tariffs on any Canadian-made vehicle containing Chinese components. However, Carney seems to be building a different kind of leverage. By diversifying Canada’s trade portfolio now, he is signaling to Washington that Ottawa has other options. If the U.S. demands extreme concessions during the summer review, Canada now possesses a “snap-back” chip: the ability to return to a hardline stance against China in exchange for ironclad guarantees on North American market access.

Ultimately, this shift represents Canada’s transition from a junior partner in a continental alliance to a multipolar player in a fragmented global economy. Even as the government lowers financial barriers for Chinese imports, it is simultaneously fortifying “regulatory moats” through strict cybersecurity and national-security screenings for connected vehicles. These measures allow Canada to remain technically aligned with Western security standards while reaping the economic benefits of reopened Eastern markets. It is a gamble, certainly, but it is one predicated on the belief that in 2026, the only thing more dangerous than breaking ranks with an unpredictable ally is having no rank to stand in at all.

USD: Tariff certainty is a myth

Global shocks keep piling up — Venezuela, Iran, Fed independence — and now the Greenland dispute has opened a fresh front. US President Trump has threatened a 10% tariff, rising to 25% in June, on eight key European allies for opposing US control over Greenland. The move effectively torpedoes the US‑EU trade truce agreed only six months ago and has forced Brussels to prepare retaliatory tariffs on €93bn of US goods.

The episode has re‑inflamed NATO tensions, blindsided EU leaders, and ensures Trump dominates the agenda at Davos this Wednesday. It also signals that anyone expecting a calmer second year on trade policy may need to rethink — this is starting to look a lot like last year all over again.

The tariff threat injects another layer of uncertainty into an already crowded geopolitical landscape, raising the risk of a broader risk‑off turn if rhetoric escalates. For markets, the immediate pressure point is Europe: EUR and NOK look most exposed to headline risk, while the Swiss franc looks to be the stand-out winner, acting as a natural hedge against geopolitical stress. European equities — particularly exporters and industrials — face renewed vulnerability. Industrial commodities would likely soften on tariff‑driven demand concerns, while gold and silver stand to benefit if tensions spill over into a wider volatility bid.

The US dollar reaction is likely to remain mixed and relatively contained. A modest bout of USD weakness is logical as markets price a more isolationist US stance, briefly reviving the ‘sell America’ narrative and stirring de‑dollarisation chatter, with the country’s sizeable external liabilities back in focus.

Still, investors have grown increasingly numb to tariff headlines, which tempers the downside, and some investors will likely lean into the ‘TACO trade’ — viewing Trump’s tariff threats as a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy path — offering the dollar a degree of support. Even so, the latest developments serve as a reminder that the US economy is not immune to the uncertainty generated by Trump’s policy shifts, while lingering concerns over Fed independence — amplified by the delayed nomination of a new chair and the ongoing probe into Jerome Powell — add another layer of caution around the US currency.

Emerging Markets: Rally resumed

The global financial landscape in early 2026 is defined by a sustained period of suppressed currency volatility that has paved the way for a highly profitable regime in the foreign exchange carry trade. Following a structural shift in market dynamics during the second quarter of 2025, the inverse relationship between market turbulence and yield-seeking behavior has become more pronounced, allowing the carry index to climb steadily as investor confidence returns. This environment of relative calm has fundamentally lowered the risk premium required for cross-border investments, encouraging a broad-based migration of capital toward high-yielding assets as the fear of sudden exchange rate swings continues to dissipate.

This macro-level stability has acted as a powerful tailwind for emerging market equities, which are aggressively outperforming global benchmarks in the opening weeks of the year. Capital flows are concentrating in regions that offer the most attractive combination of yield and growth potential, with Latin American and Emerging European markets leading the pack and delivering returns that significantly outpace the broader world index. The synergy between a maturing carry trade and surging local equity valuations indicates a robust “risk-on” cycle, where the convergence of currency stability and high-growth prospects is currently rewarding investors who have pivoted toward developing economies.

The Mexican Peso is staging a surprising technical breakout, slicing through key psychological support levels near the 17.60 handle to mark its most significant weekly advance since November last year. This move has effectively invalidated several bearish divergence signals from late 2025, reclaiming momentum with enough conviction to suggest the 50-day moving average, a level it has respected for months, is no longer a ceiling but a launchpad. With USD/MXN now trading at its lowest levels since July 2024, the path of least resistance appears skewed toward further appreciation. However, sustaining double-digit returns remains a high bar for Latin American currencies as they contend with the gravity of a firming Greenback. Should 2026 see even a modest recovery in the US Dollar Index, the Mexican Peso’s yield advantage will likely struggle to drive further spot appreciation.

Muscat, Oman, January 19, 2026 – IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, announced an investment to help United Solar Polysilicon (FZC) SPC, United Solar, finance its greenfield polysilicon plant in Oman’s Sohar Freezone. The financing aims to boost the manufacturing of polysilicon, creating nearly 3,000 direct and indirect jobs, helping attract foreign direct investments, and advancing Oman’s vision for economic diversification and reduce reliance on oil.

Polysilicon is a key ingredient for the global solar photovoltaic (PV) value chain. At full capacity, the plant is expected to enable the production of approximately 40 gigawatts of solar modules annually, enough to power up to 12 million homes. It will also contribute to the avoidance of 8.8 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year. The polysilicon plant aims to strengthen the resilience and diversification of the global solar PV supply chain and expand energy access. The polysilicon produced from the plant will also be fully traceable, enhancing transparency, and competitiveness.

""The successful financial close reflects a true team effort, supported by the Omani government's agility and strong international confidence in Oman's economy, OIA as the largest shareholder, and United Solar Polysilicon's ability to deliver a world-class project responding to the global energy transition,"" said HE Mulham Al Jarf, OIA's Deputy President for Investment. ""This project will create employment opportunities for Omanis and enable SMEs, while establishing a foundation for future upstream projects and downstream renewable energy integration. It underscores the Authority's commitment to diversifying funding through partnerships with leading institutions such as IFC, and will drive expansion into solar cell and module production, amplifying its long-term economic impact.""

“This is a transformative moment for United Solar, Oman, and the global solar industry,” said Sam Zhang, Founder and Chairman of United Solar. “With OIA and IFC's support, we are building the infrastructure needed to strengthen the global solar supply chain and ensure manufacturers have reliable access to high-quality, traceable polysilicon that meets the world's most rigorous standards.”

“This financing reflects the OPEC Fund’s commitment to supporting low-carbon industrial growth and to strengthening renewable energy value chains in partner countries. By participating as a parallel lender alongside IFC and other partners, the OPEC Fund is supporting the delivery of a project that advances Oman’s economic diversification objectives, strengthens local manufacturing capacity and job creation,” said, Tareq Alnassar, OPEC Fund Vice President for Private Sector.

“Together with USP, Oman Investment Authority, and our international partners, we are committed to strengthening Oman’s export capacity, diversifying the global polysilicon supply chain, and enabling pioneering projects such as this one,” said Ashruf Megahed, IFC Regional Industry Head for Manufacturing, Agribusiness, and Services in the Middle East and Central Asia. “By reinforcing industrial capabilities, the project will significantly expand polysilicon exports, contribute to the growth of global energy production, and support Oman’s long-term economic diversification and industrial transformation.”

Once complete, the $1.6 billion plant, with several investors, will be the Middle East’s largest and only operational polysilicon manufacturing facility, with a planned annual production capacity of 100,000 tons. Oman is United Solar’s largest shareholder.

Globally, about 1,100 gigawatts of new renewable capacity must be added each year, more than double the current expansion rate. Yet renewable energy growth remains concentrated in advanced economies, leaving the vast majority of developing countries behind despite significant economic and development needs, according to a 2024 IFC report.

Xinjiang Daqo is Daqo New Energy’s major polysilicon production subsidiary. The company began producing polysilicon in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China in 2013, having previously operated in the Chongqing region. Polysilicon and other industries in Xinjiang have been associated with alleged forced labour practices by the Chinese government against the region’s native Uyghur Muslim population.

Polysilicon sector shifts

China’s polysilicon industry is in a state of change as the industry and government pursue ways to counteract the low prices and oversupply, which have caused problems for the sector’s biggest players.

Last year, the government unveiled a number of “anti-internal competition” laws across various industries, in order to curb the low prices and fierce competition which had emerged between Chinese firms. The polysilicon industry has seen that “cutthroat” dynamic play out over the last two years, leading to massive industry overcapacity and ensuing low prices which saw the sector’s major players post regular financial losses.

More recently, the major polysilicon industry firms, led by Daqo, Tongwei and GCL Technologies, established a RMB3 billion “inventory platform” company designed to manage the flow and level of polysilicon capacity and inventory. This would mark a significant change, from harsh competition to a more managed price and supply environment.

The nearly 1.2 GW of carbon-free energy announced for U.S. data centers supports this approach.
Broader Clean Energy Strategy Google’s clean energy purchasing strategy goes beyond these 1.2 GW agreements.","Google has agreed to buy nearly 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of carbon-free energy to power its data centers across the United States. The tech company signed a set of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Clearway Energy Group (Clearway). These deals will deliver clean electricity from new wind and solar projects in Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia.

The energy will support the electric grid regions where Google’s data centers are located. The agreements are a big step for the tech giant. They help meet its rising electricity needs and cut carbon emissions from its operations.

Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google, stated:

“Strengthening the grid by deploying more reliable and clean energy is crucial for supporting the digital infrastructure that businesses and individuals depend on. Our collaboration with Clearway will help power our data centers and the broader economic growth of communities within SPP, ERCOT, and PJM footprints.”

How Google Secures Carbon-Free Power

A Power Purchase Agreement is a long-term contract between a power buyer and a clean energy producer. In Google’s case, these contracts ensure that the projects Clearway builds will sell electricity to the grid. In return, Google pays for the energy produced over many years.

Clearway agreed to provide Google with 1.17 GW of new carbon-free energy. This energy will support regional grids like SPP, ERCOT, and PJM. The total partnership includes a 71.5 megawatt (MW) clean power deal in West Virginia. This brings the total to around 1.24 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy for Google’s use.

These projects will generate wind and solar power and deliver it into U.S. grid systems that serve Google’s data centers. The total investment in the new energy infrastructure tied to these deals exceeds $2.4 billion.

Construction for the new wind and solar assets is expected to begin soon, with the first facilities planned to start operations in 2027 and 2028.

The states involved are Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia. These states cover parts of major grid regions like SPP (Southwest Power Pool), ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas), and PJM Interconnection, which deliver power to millions of customers and data centers.

Why Google Is Investing in Clean Power

Google has set clear climate goals tied to its fast-growing energy use. In 2020, the company became the first major corporation to match 100% of its annual electricity use with renewable energy purchases. This means Google buys enough clean power each year to equal all the electricity its operations consume. However, this approach does not guarantee clean energy at every hour.

To address this gap, Google launched a more ambitious target. The company aims to operate on carbon-free energy, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by 2030. This goal goes beyond traditional renewable matching. It requires clean electricity to be available every hour in the same regions where Google uses power. This makes energy sourcing more complex and increases the need for new clean generation near data centers.

Google has also committed to reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. This includes direct emissions, purchased electricity, and indirect emissions from suppliers and construction.

The tech company does not plan to rely heavily on carbon offsets for this goal. Instead, it focuses on cutting emissions at the source, mainly by cleaning up the electricity supply.

Progress so far shows both gains and challenges. In 2024, Google reported net emissions of about 18 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent, up from 14.3 million in 2023. The increase came largely from data center expansion and higher electricity demand from artificial intelligence workloads.

At the same time, Google reduced the carbon intensity of its electricity use by about 12% compared with the previous year. This shows efficiency gains, even as total energy use rose.

Clean energy purchases play a key role in this strategy. By signing long-term power purchase agreements, Google helps bring new wind and solar projects online. These projects add clean power to local grids and lower emissions over time.

The nearly 1.2 GW of carbon-free energy announced for U.S. data centers supports this approach. It increases clean supply in regions where Google’s power demand is growing fastest.

Broader Clean Energy Strategy

Google’s clean energy purchasing strategy goes beyond these 1.2 GW agreements. The company continues to enter renewable contracts around the world. For example:

Google and TotalEnergies signed a 15-year PPA to supply 1.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) of certified renewable electricity from the Montpelier solar farm in Ohio. This power will help support Google’s data centers in that region.

Google is also active in international renewable power agreements. It has signed a 21-year PPA with TotalEnergies. This deal provides 1 TWh of solar power for its data centers in Malaysia.

In India, Google made a deal with ReNew Energy. They will build a 150 MW solar project in Rajasthan. This project will generate about 425,000 MWh of clean electricity each year, which is enough to power more than 360,000 homes.

These deals illustrate how Google is diversifying its clean energy supply by securing multiple sources and technologies across continents.\

Impact on Data Centers and Regional Grids

Data centers use large amounts of electricity. U.S. data centers’ electricity consumption reached 183 TWh in 2024, accounting for more than 4% of the nation’s total power demand amid surging AI workloads. ​This marked a continued rise from 176 TWh (4.4%) in 2023. Projections suggest 5% or higher in 2025 as hyperscale facilities expand rapidly.

When powered by fossil fuels, they also produce high carbon emissions. Clean energy purchases help reduce the carbon footprint of these facilities over time.

As data center demand continues to grow, companies like Google are adding new clean power to the grid. Long-term power purchase agreements support the construction of new wind and solar projects. These projects supply clean electricity to regional grids and benefit all users, not only data centers. This helps lower the overall carbon intensity of power systems.

What This Means for Corporate Renewable Leadership

Google’s nearly 1.2 GW clean energy purchase reflects a wider industry shift. Large technology firms are becoming some of the world’s biggest buyers of renewable power. As artificial intelligence and cloud services expand, long-term clean energy contracts help companies secure a stable power supply and manage energy costs.

These corporate agreements also play a key role in the U.S. energy market. Long-term PPAs give developers the financial certainty needed to build new renewable projects. Supported by policy incentives and rising corporate demand, U.S. wind and solar capacity continues to grow. This makes large clean energy portfolios increasingly viable for companies like Google.

The Clearway deal adds to Google’s global portfolio of renewable energy contracts. This portfolio spans multiple regions and energy technologies. By securing large volumes of clean power, Google is strengthening the sustainability of its data centers as digital demand continues to rise.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2401582411.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:59:32.961948

A national study finds that more than half of those facilities may already be at risk as soon as 2050, turning future storms into potential toxic events rather than just high water.

These sites store or handle sewage, trash, oil, gas, and other materials, and many sit next to neighborhoods that already live with heavy pollution. The research, led by Lara J. Cushing at the University of California, Los Angeles and funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, concludes that low-income communities and communities of color are more likely to live close to facilities projected to flood.

Thousands of coastal facilities already on a ticking clock

To map the danger, Cushing’s team examined more than 47,600 coastal facilities, then combined their locations with sea level projections for 2050 and 2100. They focused on floods with about a one in one hundred chance of happening in any given year, a standard often used for insurance and building rules.

Under a high-pollution path, the study projects that 5,500 sites could face that level of flooding by 2100 and nearly 3,800 as soon as mid century. About 44 percent of the at-risk facilities are fossil fuel ports or terminals, with 30 percent power plants, 24 percent refineries, and 22 percent sewage treatment plants, largely in seven states including Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts.

How rising seas can turn industrial sites into toxic floods

Sea level rise might sound slow, but it changes the starting point for every storm and high tide. As oceans warm and expand and some stretches of coastline sink, water can reach farther inland, overtopping defenses that once felt solid and pooling in low-lying industrial zones.

So what happens when floodwater moves through facilities that store fuel, chemicals, or waste? It can pick up those substances and carry them into nearby streets and homes. Public health experts such as Sacoby Wilson at the University of Maryland warn that people near sewage plants or large animal farms could encounter bacteria such as E. coli, while those near refineries face metals and chemicals tied to stomach illness, rashes, breathing trouble, and in the long run higher risks of organ damage or cancer.

Who lives closest to the danger?

The researchers then asked who lives within about two thirds of a mile of facilities that are expected to flood and compared those neighborhoods with other coastal areas that do not have an at-risk site. They found higher shares of renters, households in poverty, seniors, people who identify as Hispanic, and residents without cars near the hazardous sites.

That pattern echoes broader research on environmental injustice and earlier mapping of toxic flood risks in coastal California.Derek Van Berkel at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the new study, said the most “alarming” part is the feedback loop as repeated floods spread contamination and make it harder for residents to recover before the next disaster.

Limits of the analysis and what could still change

Like any model, the analysis has blind spots. It leaves out some risky infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines and does not estimate how future storms will change flooding, so the real-world threat could be higher.

The future is not fixed, and the authors say their flood model is best used as a screening tool rather than a precise forecast. Under a lower-pollution path, the study estimates that over 300 sites could avoid serious flood danger by 2100, and Thomas Chandler at Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness calls this “a really important study” for planners trying to prevent disasters where damaged facilities spread toxins into floodwater. Cushing said “we do have time to respond and try to mitigate the risks and also increase resilience,” but that will only happen if officials, companies, and residents start planning before the next big flood arrives.

The study was published in “Nature Communications.”",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/us-coast-toxic-flood-hotspots-5500-hazard-sites-sea-level-rise-map.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:59:44.979324

A New Approach to Power Efficiency

Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed a new silicon carbide based power module designed to dramatically improve how electricity is converted and delivered. A power module is the housing that contains power electronics, which regulate the flow of electricity between systems. This new design delivers record-breaking efficiency, higher power density, and a manufacturing process that keeps costs low.

The technology is known as NREL's Ultra-Low Inductance Smart power module, or ULIS. By using silicon carbide semiconductors, ULIS can achieve five times the energy density of earlier designs while taking up less space. That combination allows manufacturers to build equipment that is smaller, lighter, and more energy efficient. The 1200-volt, 400-amp module is well suited for data centers, electrical grids, microreactors, and heavy-duty platforms such as next-generation aircraft and military vehicles.

Why Ultra-Low Inductance Matters

A key advantage of ULIS is its exceptionally low parasitic inductance, which refers to resistance that slows changes in electrical current and limits efficient power conversion. ULIS reduces this resistance by seven to nine times compared with today's most advanced silicon carbide power modules.

Because the system can switch electrical current extremely quickly and efficiently, it converts more of the available electricity into usable power. That capability allows ULIS to extract significantly more value from the same energy supply, making it a strong candidate for addressing growing global energy needs.

""We consider ULIS to be a true breakthrough,"" said Faisal Khan, NREL's chief power electronics researcher and the principal investigator for the project. ""It's a future-proofed, ultrafast power module that will make the next generation of power converters more affordable, efficient, and compact.""

Built for Reliability in Extreme Conditions

ULIS is designed not only for efficiency, but also for reliability in demanding environments. According to Khan, the lightweight yet powerful module can monitor its own condition and anticipate component failures before they happen.

This feature is especially critical for high-risk applications such as aviation and military operations. For aircraft operating at 30,000 feet or vehicles navigating combat zones, early failure detection can be the difference between mission success and catastrophic loss.

""ULIS was a truly organic effort, built entirely in-house here at NREL,"" Khan said. ""We are very excited to demonstrate its strengths in real-world settings.""

A Radical Redesign for Lower Cost Manufacturing

Many of ULIS' performance gains come from a completely new physical design.

Traditional power modules stack semiconductor devices inside box-like packages. ULIS instead arranges its circuitry in a flat, octagonal layout. This disk-shaped structure fits more components into a smaller footprint, reducing both size and weight. At the same time, its innovative current routing minimizes magnetic interference, which helps deliver cleaner electrical output and higher overall efficiency.

""Our biggest concern was that the device switches off and on very quickly, and we needed a layout that wouldn't create a chokepoint within the design,"" said Shuofeng Zhao, an NREL power electronics researcher who designed ULIS' flux cancellation architecture.

Early concepts explored complex three-dimensional shapes, including designs resembling flowers or hollow cylinders. However, these ideas proved too expensive or difficult to manufacture. The breakthrough came when the team simplified the concept into a nearly two-dimensional structure. Sarwar Islam, another NREL power electronics researcher, proposed the flattened design that balanced performance, cost, and manufacturability.

""We squished it flat, like a pancake,"" Zhao said, ""and suddenly we had a low-cost, high-performing design that was much easier to fabricate.""

Joshua Major, also part of the NREL power electronics team, developed new fabrication methods that allowed the intricate structure to be produced using only in-house tools and facilities. The result was a design that combined the electrical advantages of three-dimensional systems with the practicality of flat manufacturing.

Flexible Materials and Wireless Control

ULIS also departs from conventional materials. Traditional power modules bond copper directly to rigid ceramic bases to conduct electricity and manage heat. While effective, this approach limits flexibility.

Instead, ULIS bonds copper to a flexible polymer called Temprion. This change produces a thinner, lighter, and more adaptable structure. The material bonds to copper using only heat and pressure, and its components can be machined with widely available equipment. As a result, manufacturing costs fall into the hundreds of dollars rather than the thousands.

Another major advance allows ULIS to operate wirelessly. The module can be controlled and monitored without physical cables, functioning as a self-contained unit. This modular, Lego-like design allows it to be integrated into a wide range of systems, from data center servers to advanced aircraft and military vehicles. A patent for the low-latency wireless communication protocol, led by Sarwar Islam, is currently pending.

Designed for Future Technologies

While ULIS currently relies on advanced silicon carbide semiconductors, the design was intentionally built to evolve. The module can be adapted for future semiconductor materials, including gallium nitride and gallium oxide, which has not yet reached commercial use.

Together, these innovations support a central goal. As societies become increasingly dependent on reliable electricity, ULIS is designed to deliver efficiency without sacrificing dependability.

Where ULIS Could Make the Biggest Difference

ULIS is expected to have broad impact across multiple sectors.

In the U.S. power grid, electricity must be converted into usable forms before it reaches consumers. This process often depends on large, low-frequency equipment that wastes energy. ULIS' fast switching improves efficiency while its ability to tolerate high temperatures may reduce long-term maintenance costs.

In aviation, the module's ability to move electricity quickly and conserve energy enables lighter and more powerful converters. This could help make electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft more practical and commercially viable.

ULIS could also play a role in future fusion energy systems. Although commercial fusion remains under development, these systems will require compact and reliable pulsed power components. ULIS' ultralow inductance and durable design make it well suited for that challenge.

As industries pursue more reliable electricity, advanced artificial intelligence, and next-generation vehicles, ULIS is now available for licensing.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/nrel-ulis-power-module.webp,N,,2026-01-19 13:58:48.087637

CONTACT: John Peevers Bruce Power 5193863799 john.peevers@brucepower.com","Kincardine, Ontario, Jan. 19, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) independent economic impact analysis final report confirms a proposed new large-scale Bruce C nuclear project would deliver lasting job creation, stimulate Ontario’s economy, and reinforce Canada’s long-term energy security for decades to come.

The economic analysis – Bruce C Economic Impact Assessment – Summary of Findings — conducted by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and Prism Economics and Analysis for the Nuclear Innovation Institute — finds that the Bruce C Project would generate major economic benefits locally, provincially and nationally, driven by both its construction and operating life.

The Bruce C project’s direct benefits would be concentrated in Ontario, contributing more than $217-billion to Ontario’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during its 80-year lifespan; and would contribute $2.3 billion to the Clean Energy Frontier (Bruce, Grey and Huron Counties) regional GDP on an average annual basis.

“Ontario’s nuclear advantage is powering our future and showcasing the very best of Canadian technology, resources, and workers,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “Bruce C represents one of greatest drivers of economic growth in Canada, creating 18,900 jobs and $238 billion lift to Canada’s GDP over its 80-year lifespan. It is clear that Bruce Power’s C is essential to Ontario’s energy and economic future, as we build on-time and on-budget.”

The proposed addition of up to 4,800 megawatts (MW) of energy production through the Bruce C Project, currently undergoing a federal integrated Impact Assessment, would make Bruce Power the largest nuclear generator in the world with a capacity of 12,000 MW. The company is Canada’s largest public-private partnership and its Life-Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project is the country’s biggest privately financed electricity infrastructure project in Canada.

“The Ontario Chamber of Commerce independent economic impact analysis confirms what our communities already know — Bruce C has the potential to be a once‑in‑a‑generation economic engine,” said James Scongack, Bruce Power’s Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President. “From job creation and economic growth to long-term energy security, the benefits will be felt in the Clean Energy Frontier region, as well as across Ontario and Canada.”

Of the nearly $238-billion contribution to Canada’s GDP, approximately $61 billion would be generated during the site preparation and construction phase, and more than $176 billion during the operations phase.

“The Bruce C Project would be an investment in strengthening our communities and the economy, while empowering skilled workers and innovation across Ontario,” said Pat Dalzell, Bruce Power’s Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and Market Development. “Bruce Power is committed to creating lasting prosperity while delivering the reliable, carbon‑free electricity and cancer-fighting medical isotopes to power the next century of Canadian innovation and opportunity.”

During the proposed site preparation and construction phase, an estimated annual average total of 18,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs would be created or supported nationally, of which nearly 15,900 jobs would be created or supported in Ontario.

The subsequent operations phase would result in an annual average of over 6,700 FTE jobs nationally, with nearly 5,900 jobs in Ontario. Overall, more than 10,100 total FTE jobs would be created or supported in Canada each year over the Project’s entire lifespan, of which approximately 8,700 would be in Ontario.

These jobs would provide average annual labour income (including wages and benefits) of approximately $1 billion at the national level, of which nearly $900 million would be earned annually by those employed in Ontario.

Aside from employment benefits, tax revenues of $55-million annually for municipal governments within the Clean Energy Frontier would help spawn growth in Bruce Power’s surrounding communities.

“As the host community, we’re proud to work with Bruce Power to advance the Bruce C Project and understand the significant economic impact it would bring,” said Kenneth Craig, Mayor of the Municipality of Kincardine. “Our region has long been a leader in clean energy and this project ensures we remain at the forefront of Canada’s clean-energy future.”

“This project represents a transformational opportunity for Bruce County,” said Luke Charbonneau, Bruce County Warden and Mayor of the Town of Saugeen Shores. “The economic benefits, training opportunities, and long-term jobs will make life better for families and businesses throughout our region for decades.”

Bruce Power’s current Life-Extension Program and ongoing operations create and sustain 27,000 direct and indirect jobs annually.

With 95 per cent of Bruce Power’s current spend in Canada through a robust and long-standing made-in-Ontario supply chain, the Bruce C Project would build on Bruce Power’s Canadian at our Core campaign, which hinges on commitments to provide safe, reliable power to Ontario and cancer-fighting medical isotopes globally, drive the economy and strengthen partnerships with Indigenous communities.

The companies on January 7 noted that the transaction, first announced as a $16.4-billion deal a year ago, unites Constellation’s nuclear power fleet with Calpine’s natural gas-fired and geothermal generation. The cash-and-stock deal, when including debt, has a total value of $26.6 billion.

The groups said the merged company will power data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, and critical infrastructure.

“This isn’t just about two great companies coming together—it’s about strengthening America’s future,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, in a statement “Constellation is stepping up to power America’s growth when our nation’s demand for energy is surging, and our global competitors are racing to capture AI leadership. By uniting Constellation and Calpine, we’re providing the reliable, clean energy that keeps our communities strong, our businesses competitive and our nation secure.”

‘Exciting Day’

Andrew Novotny, president and CEO of Calpine, said, “This is an exciting day for both our companies and for the customers and communities we serve. We have the assets that power America today and meet the needs of tomorrow. Our expanded capabilities will allow us to better serve customers and communities, enable investment in critical infrastructure and support national priorities for energy security, economic competitiveness and technological leadership. Our teams share a relentless commitment to safety, sustainability and operational excellence, and I’m excited about what we will accomplish together.”

“As a decades-long investor in power generation, ECP aims to unlock value, drive long-term growth opportunities and strengthen asset reliability—often serving as a bridge between public and private markets,” said Tyler Reeder, president and managing partner of ECP. “We are proud to have achieved those goals in partnership with Calpine’s management team and believe this combination validates that vision, setting the company up for future success while meeting the evolving needs of its customers, communities and the U.S.’s electrical grid.”

The combined company will serve 2.5 million retail and business customers nationwide. The groups said the acquisition also strengthens Constellation’s footprint in high-demand regions, including Texas and California, while maintaining significant operations in Illinois, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania.

Constellation and Calpine together have 55 GW of generation capacity. The company will maintain headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, along with a significant presence in Houston, Texas.

Antitrust Settlement

The U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, together with the attorney general of Texas, on December 5 said it would require divestiture of six power plants in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Texas to resolve antitrust concerns arising from Constellation’s acquisition of Calpine. The Antitrust Division had filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed acquisition. At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that it said, upon court approval, would resolve the Division’s competitive concerns.

“The price of electricity is a pocketbook issue to American consumers working hard to afford their monthly utility bills. When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “This settlement includes a six-plant divestiture to an acquisition that risked harming tens of millions of electricity consumers in the mid-Atlantic and Texas. I am appreciative of the partnership with our co-plaintiff, the State of Texas, to secure relief for consumers.”

The DOJ said the divestitures “resolve the Division’s concerns that the acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices on consumers reliant on the ERCOT and PJM electricity grids.” Specifically, the settlement requires the companies to divest their ownership interests in four electricity plants serving PJM and two electricity plants serving ERCOT. The divested plants are:

Bethlehem Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

From the iconic date palms of Basra to the wheat fields and vegetable farms of Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna, farming has never been simply an occupation. It is a living inheritance. Today, that inheritance is under pressure, but a new generation of farmers is reshaping its future through science, renewable energy, and climate-resilient practices.

Inheritance Under Pressure

For decades, traditional agricultural systems provided stability in southern Iraq. However, accelerating climate pressures have begun to erode these foundations. Farmers are facing chronic water scarcity, rising soil salinity, saltwater intrusion into rivers, and widening energy gaps that undermine productivity and sustainability. Practices such as flood irrigation, once effective, are increasingly incompatible with declining water availability and degraded land.

Field assessments revealed the scale of the challenge. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed farmers still relied on flood irrigation, while soil and water salinity testing remained limited. Financial constraints, lack of technical knowledge, and unreliable access to energy were consistently cited as barriers to modernization. Dependence on diesel fuel and unstable electricity supplies further increased costs and vulnerability. Without timely intervention, agricultural systems that had endured for centuries risked becoming unsustainable.

Recognizing this urgency, the Government of Japan and UNDP Iraq launched a targeted programme under the initiative “Strengthening Conflict-Sensitive, Peace-Positive Climate Action in the Southern and Euphrates Region of Iraq.” The objective extended beyond introducing new technologies. It aimed to enable farmers to transition toward low-emission, climate-resilient practices capable of protecting land, livelihoods, and social stability for future generations.

A Scientific Awakening Rooted in Local Reality

The transformation began with evidence. Prior to implementation, the project conducted surveys, land assessments, and market studies across Basra, Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna. More than 250 farmers were consulted to identify constraints, priorities, and realistic entry points for change. The findings shaped a practical, context-specific curriculum designed to address salinity, inefficient water use, energy insecurity, and limited exposure to climate-smart agriculture.

Learning was grounded in practice rather than theory. In late 2025, intensive three-day trainings were delivered across the four governorates, engaging over 185 farmers in a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach. Abstract concepts were translated into tangible skills that could be applied immediately in the field.

Farmers strengthened their ability to manage land under saline and water-scarce conditions by improving drainage, increasing irrigation efficiency, and adopting measures to reduce soil degradation. They deepened their understanding of how salinity affects crops, explored salt-tolerant varieties, and learned how informed water management can restore productivity rather than exhaust resources.

For many participants, science became tangible for the first time. Farmers tested their own soil and water, measured electrical conductivity, learned by the word of mouth of peers. Knowledge shifted from distant theory to practical decision-making embedded in daily agricultural work.

The training also extended to livestock management. Improved feeding practices, manure handling, and hygiene measures demonstrated how animal health, environmental protection, and productivity are interconnected.

From Knowledge to Confidence and Action

The results were immediate and measurable. Pre- and post-training assessments showed significant gains in technical knowledge across all governorates. More importantly, these gains translated into confidence. Farmers reported a stronger ability to understand, adapt, and apply modern practices within their own constraints.

Across Basra, Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna, the majority of participants expressed readiness to implement at least one new practice immediately, while others indicated strong intent to adopt changes in the near term. Improved irrigation scheduling, modern irrigation systems, and renewable energy solutions consistently ranked as top priorities.

At the center of this shift was a growing commitment to solar energy. Farmers identified solar-powered water pumping as a viable alternative to unreliable electricity grids and costly diesel fuel. Solar power offered stability, reduced emissions, and long-term affordability. When combined with improved irrigation management, it enabled farmers to reduce water loss, stabilize production during peak seasons, and protect soil and income from climate and energy volatility.

Sustainability, once perceived as an abstract concept, became a practical strategy grounded in everyday choices. Cleaner energy, smarter water use, healthier soils, and lower operating costs formed a pathway toward resilient livelihoods.

Safeguarding Heritage Through Adaptation

This transition from awareness to action signals the emergence of a new generation of agricultural stewards in southern Iraq. Farmers are no longer positioned solely as those affected by climate change. They are increasingly acting as agents of adaptation, using science and renewable energy to preserve their heritage through transformation rather than resistance.

By anchoring traditional knowledge in evidence and pairing ancestral practices with modern tools, these farmers are doing more than sustaining production. They are protecting a way of life. Fields are becoming spaces of experimentation and resilience, where solar energy replaces uncertainty, irrigation is guided by data rather than guesswork, and stewardship is measured not only by harvests, but by the long-term health of ecosystems.

They are not merely enduring the climate crisis. They are shaping its outcome and ensuring that agricultural heritage in southern Iraq remains productive, resilient, and alive for generations to come.

About the Project

The project “Strengthening Conflict-Sensitive, Peace-Positive Climate Action in the Southern and Euphrates Region of Iraq” is implemented by UNDP Iraq with the support of the Government of Japan through the Japan Supplementary Budget. It responds to intensifying climate pressures in southern Iraq, particularly water scarcity, soil salinity, land degradation, and energy insecurity, which threaten agricultural livelihoods, food security, and community stability. The initiative promotes scalable, evidence-based solutions that link climate resilience with peacebuilding and sustainable development.",https://www.undp.org/themes/custom/undpglobal/images/meta-undp-logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:43.467317

The Trump administration initiative calls on PJM Interconnection, which serves 67 million customers in 13 states, not including South Carolina, and Washington, D.C., to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region.

PJM later on Friday unveiled its own plan, which called for big data centers to voluntarily bring their own new generation or face the potential of having their power supply curtailed during peak demand periods. The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.

At a White House event, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum joined several state governors to discuss initiatives to speed the construction of more than $15 billion in new power generation on PJM, which has been criticized for being too slow to build a cushion against rotating blackouts as demand rises.

Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids. President Donald Trump is seeking to combat consumer price inflation that risks undermining support for Republicans ahead of November's midterm elections.

The White House is seeking caps on the amount existing power plants can charge in the PJM capacity market. A recent PJM capacity market auction set record-high prices for power generators that were more than 800% higher than the previous year, increasing electricity prices for homes and businesses.

The agreement would also require data centers to pay for the new generation built on their behalf – whether they show up and use the power or not - rather than buying up existing power. The concept is called BYOG, or ""bring your own generation.""

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. PJM was not invited to the event, a PJM spokesperson told Reuters.

PJM has forecast that the grid's peak usage in the summer will climb by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts over the next 15 years. The record summer peak for PJM was 165 gigawatts in 2006.

Since 2023, PJM says it has processed more than 170 gigawatts of new generation requests. Nearly 60 gigawatts of projects have completed PJM's study process and have either signed or been offered generation interconnection agreements.

Rising power bills in PJM's region have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid. Last summer, nine state governors wrote an open letter to the PJM board of managers criticizing the grid operator for not doing enough to address an escalating electricity affordability crisis.

""Unfortunately, what we have seen in our region is that PJM has been too damn slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time where energy demand is going up,"" Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at the White House event on Friday.

Burgum said PJM has been lucky so far in avoiding widespread blackouts.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/d0/4d062032-0238-4d7f-b0ed-c71a5acb313b/66b22c3870bb0.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-19 13:59:09.816180

25%: Canada’s EV Tariff Deal With China Puts The U.S., Auto Industry On Alert

As we reported on Friday, the China-Canada deal is small for now—it’s capped at 49,000 cars for its first year, with expansion to 70,000 within five years. But it’s a start (or rather a restart, since it returns Canada to its pre-2023 tariff deal) to something potentially big: the growing expansion of Chinese EVs into North America. And as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney explicitly said, most of these imports will cost under $25,000 U.S. (about $35,000 CAD).

Naturally, not everyone is happy about what could be a threat to automotive jobs in North America. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, blamed the Trump administration’s strained relations with Canada, reports The Hill:

“We just got absolutely rolled in this Canada – China deal. A stark foreign policy failure with domestic economic consequences,” Schatz wrote in a post on social platform X.

“The most basic principle in politics and geopolitics is loyalty to friends. And we weren’t just disloyal – we were hostile. So here we are,” he added.

President Donald Trump, for his part, appeared to give the deal a thumbs-up: “If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,” Trump told reporters. Other U.S. economic officials said Canada will ultimately regret the deal.

My colleague Kevin Williams has a good story about what’s at stake, and why leaders in the auto-producing parts of Canada are especially unhappy about the deal. And it brings plenty of concern among U.S. auto industry observers as well. From the Associated Press:

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful—standards that are similar to those in the U.S.—which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Emphasis mine above, because that is indeed a scary outcome for the U.S. auto industry.

Then again, if it brings more affordable hybrid and zero-emission options to North America—and the way things are potentially going, the U.S. included—and is that such a bad thing? Ultimately, North Americans will have to make a choice: affordability or loyalty to local production.

Unless, of course, our automakers can meet people halfway and get that $50,000 average new car price down considerably.

50%: The Canada-China Trade Deal Is Good News For Tesla

Tesla had a bad year in Canada in 2025, with sales dropping nearly 64% amid the U.S. trade war and CEO Elon Musk’s multiple controversies. But the China trade deal could be good news for the electric automaker: it builds a ton of cars in China, including ones it exports to Canada (unlike the U.S.)

And now, those just got a whole lot cheaper, potentially. Here’s Reuters with more:

While many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.

The U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.

But it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.

""This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Now, to see if Canadians actually line up to buy those cars.

75%: Affordability Anxiety Will Define 2026’s Car Market

But all of this, I’d argue, isn’t even a technology issue or a geopolitical one: it’s an affordability issue. The appeal of Chinese imports is that they’re good and they’re cheap—a combination that feels in short supply in the North American car market.

According to Automotive News, affordability anxiety was the overwhelming vibe at the 2026 Detroit Auto Show. And while carmakers may breathe a sigh of relief that they’re no longer under a regulatory gun to make tons of EVs now that fuel economy requirements have been eased, they can’t lean on super-expensive gas trucks to save the day like they used to:

“What’s holding the market back is certainly affordability and really the lack of low-priced vehicles,” said Michael Robinet, executive director of automotive consulting at S&P Global Mobility. “Not only in the United States, but around the world, this is a problem.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer and member of the committee working to reschedule testimony from the Detroit 3 CEOs, said the Trump administration is easing regulations to help bring down vehicle costs and that automakers also have a role to play. The government is rolling back emissions standards and in September eliminated a $7,500 tax credit that had greatly fueled EV demand.

It now takes about 36 weeks of median income to buy an average new vehicle, according to Cox Automotive data. That’s down from 42 weeks three years ago but not necessarily a sign affordability has significantly improved, Cox Executive Analyst Erin Keating said.

“Even with affordable vehicles out there, fewer buyers are buying. The consensus is that this shift isn’t temporary. ... That’s one reason dealer sentiment reflects concern. The missing customers aren’t sidelined. They’re essentially excluded.”

So how do they plan to meet the moment? According to that story, Jeep and Ram parent company Stellantis is preparing more models priced under $40,000 and even $30,000 (though I’ll believe the latter when I see it) and even Ford said it might consider making sedans again after canceling all of them in 2020.

One bright spot for EV fans: the falling costs of batteries should make electric power more affordable. But clearly, the demand is there for new cars that won’t break the bank. And if the familiar automakers won’t deliver, it seems China Inc. is ready to.

I have owned Toyotas made in the United States, a Chevrolet and a Mazda made in Mexico, and a Kia made in South Korea (that's now made in Georgia instead), among other things. I can't say that production origin means all that much to me in a globalized world.

So is that a priority for you when you buy a car? Sound off in the comments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 introduced comprehensive foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules that prohibit taxpayers considered “prohibited foreign entities” from claiming clean energy tax credits.

The FEOC rules apply to the following clean energy tax credits:

Section 45Q: Carbon oxide sequestration credit

Section 45U: Zero-emission nuclear power production credit

Section 45X: Advanced manufacturing production credit

Section 45Y: Clean electricity production credit

Section 45Z: Clean fuel production credit

Section 48E: Clean electricity investment credit

The FEOC rules are designed to prevent entities subject to certain foreign ownership, control, or influence – primarily from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea – from benefiting from these tax credits. The rules also include restrictions based on material assistance from such entities for Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E, which took effect on January 1, 2026.

What Is a Prohibited Foreign Entity?

A prohibited foreign entity is any “specified foreign entity” or “foreign-influenced entity.”

Specified Foreign Entity

Generally, a specified foreign entity is:

any designated terrorist organization; specially designated national or blocked person identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); entity alleged by the Attorney General to be involved in violations of certain federal laws relating to espionage, arms exportation, or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA); or entity determined by the Secretary of Treasury to be engaged in conduct detrimental to US national security or foreign policy;

any Chinese military company, entity subject to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act or certain entities that are ineligible for Department of Defense contracts or funding;

the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea (including any agency or instrumentality thereof); any entity or business incorporated, organized, or having its principal place of business therein; or any non-publicly traded entity that, taking into account certain constructive ownership rules, is more than 50 percent owned (by vote or value, capital or profits or otherwise by beneficial interest) by any such government, entity, or business; and

any other entity identified under designated federal statutes.

Foreign Influenced Entity

Generally, a foreign influenced entity is:

any entity with respect to which, during the taxable year:

a specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer (e.g., board member, CEO, CFO);

a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent, or multiple specified foreign entities own 40 percent; or

at least 15 percent of its debt is issued to one or more specified foreign entities; and

an entity that, during the prior taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity under a contract or arrangement that gives the specified foreign entity (or any person related to the specified foreign entity) “effective control” over any qualified facility, energy storage technology or eligible component (including the production thereof, or the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral with respect thereto) of such entity (or any person related to such entity).

What Is Effective Control and How Does It Impact Clean Energy Tax Credit Eligibility?

Effective control refers to any contractual or licensing arrangement that gives a specified foreign entity authority over key aspects of a project or component, such as the ability to:

determine quantity or timing of component production or electricity output or storage;

direct sales or usage of output;

restrict access to any critical data, site of production, or part of a facility;

maintain or operate, on an exclusive basis, any plant or essential equipment; or

with respect to licensing agreements, direct sourcing, operations, or certain service arrangements or receive royalties beyond 10 years.

If a taxpayer makes a payment under such an arrangement, and such arrangement is not a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property, it may be classified as a foreign-influenced entity that is not eligible to claim tax credits under Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E. Effective control limitations do not apply under Sections 45Q, 45U or 45Z. For Section 48E, there is a 10-year recapture period for tax credits if such payments are made after the project is placed in service.

When Do FEOC Restrictions on Clean Energy Tax Credits Take Effect?

The effective dates for FEOC restrictions vary by tax credit type and taxpayer status, as outlined below:

Sections 45X, 45Y, 48E and 45Q

The specified foreign entity and foreign-influenced entity prohibitions apply to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., starting January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers).

Sections 45U and 45Z

The specified foreign entity prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., starting January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers).

The foreign-influenced entity prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (i.e., starting January 1, 2028, for calendar-year taxpayers).

What Are the Material Assistance Rules and to Which Clean Energy Tax Credits Do They Apply?

The material assistance rules are additional restrictions imposed under Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E that disqualify a project or component from tax credit eligibility if it receives “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” The material assistance rules apply with respect to any project the construction of which begins in 2026 or later (for qualified facilities and energy storage technology) and any components sold in 2026 or later (for eligible components).

Material assistance is measured by the “material assistance cost ratio” (MACR), which is the percentage of total direct costs (for qualified facilities and energy storage technology) or direct cost of materials (for eligible components) that are not attributable to a prohibited foreign entity.

Sections 45Y and 48E (qualified facilities and energy storage technology):

The MACR is calculated at the project level, with required threshold percentages that increase over time (e.g., for 2026, 40 percent for qualified facilities and 55 percent for energy storage technology).

Section 45X (eligible components):

The MACR is calculated for each component sold in a given year, with thresholds varying by component type and year (e.g., for 2026, 50 percent for solar components, 85 percent for wind components, 60 percent for battery components and 50 percent for inverters).

If the MACR falls below the applicable threshold, the tax credit is denied for that project or component.

How Is Material Assistance Determined, and What Can Taxpayers Do to Comply?

Material assistance is determined by calculating the MACR:

MACR = ((T – P) / T) x 100%

T = Total direct cost of all manufactured products or components

P = Total direct cost of all manufactured products or components from a prohibited foreign entity

Taxpayers must maintain documentation and, until Treasury issues new safe harbor tables (by December 31, 2026), may rely on the tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to the domestic content requirements) and supplier certifications. Suppliers who provide false certifications may be subject to penalties.

Can Clean Energy Tax Credits Be Transferred to Specified Foreign Entities?

No. The OBBBA prohibits the transfer of any portion of the tax credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z or 48E to specified foreign entities under Section 6418.

What Should Taxpayers and Project Developers Do Now?

China is also Canada’s second‑largest customer for agriculture, forest products and seafood products, with sales of about $13.4 billion in 2024.","Canada’s newly announced strategic partnership with China, including a reduction of surtaxes on Chinese‑made electric vehicles (EVs), is drawing criticism from labour groups which warn the move could put thousands of Canadian manufacturing and auto jobs at risk.

According to the Office of the Prime Minister, the government is responding to “a more divided and uncertain world” by “building a stronger, more independent, and more resilient economy” and “working with urgency and determination to diversify our trade partnerships and catalyse massive new levels of investment.”

Energy, clean tech and EVs

A central feature of the agreement is expanded collaboration in energy, clean technology and climate competitiveness. Both countries are described as energy “superpowers” focused on “expanding two-way energy cooperation – reducing emissions and scaling up investments in batteries, solar, wind, and energy storage.”

To support this and build up the domestic manufacturing sector, Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) into the Canadian market at the most‑favoured‑nation tariff rate of 6.1%. This volume corresponds to import levels in 2023–2024 and represents less than 3 per cent of new vehicles sold in Canada.

The Office of the Prime Minister says the arrangement is expected, within three years, to drive “considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners” to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers and “ensure a robust build-out of Canada’s EV supply chain.” Within five years, more than 50 per cent of these vehicles are anticipated to be priced below $35,000, potentially accelerating EV adoption and demand for skills in production, battery technology, infrastructure and after‑sales service.

Workers ‘more vulnerable’: CLC

However, the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) said the deal “represents a sharp and concerning shift in Canada’s trade and industrial strategy,” and contends that “no sector truly wins, and workers in every industry are left more vulnerable.”

According to the the group, the agreement “drastically reduces Canada’s surtax on Chinese‑made electric vehicles (EVs), creating a pathway for tens of thousands of inexpensive, state‑subsidized vehicles to flood our auto market.” The organisation says this could undermine Canada’s domestic auto industry, jeopardize jobs, suppress future investment and “erode the independent supply chain that sustains thousands of Canadian workers.”

Meanwhile, Unifor issued its own statement, warning that opening the door to China‑owned EV imports “poses extreme risk to Canadian auto jobs and the future of our entire auto sector.”

“This is a self‑inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding labour violations and unfair trade practices.”

Unifor said it has “long warned about the risks of letting Chinese EVs flood the North American market,” arguing that if such imports are left unchecked they will cost Canadian jobs, stall domestic investment and increase imports from low‑cost jurisdictions. The union noted that there is “virtually no Canadian content in Chinese vehicles,” and warned that “our independent auto parts supply chain would also be hard hit.”

Previously, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, “this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination, which would hurt our economy and lead to job losses,” according to the National Post.

According to two legal experts, as Canada pushes toward an ambitious 100-per-cent zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales mandate by 2035, a vital question is emerging - are we truly prepared for the labour market shock this transition may bring?

Auto leverage for farm and fish gains

The CLC similarly questioned the government’s willingness to exchange leverage on industrial and auto tariffs for short‑term agricultural gains. It said “the Government’s willingness to trade hard‑earned leverage on issues like auto tariffs and North American cooperation for temporary tariff reductions on canola and some seafood products is deeply troubling,” calling the relief for agriculture and fisheries “time‑limited, uncertain beyond this year, and insufficient compensation for exposing strategic industries to global competition fueled by massive state intervention.”

This target comes against a backdrop in which China is already Canada’s second‑largest single‑country trading partner, with two‑way merchandise trade totalling $118.9 billion in 2024. Canadian merchandise exports to China reached $30 billion, while imports were $88.9 billion. China is also Canada’s second‑largest customer for agriculture, forest products and seafood products, with sales of about $13.4 billion in 2024.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/chrr/jimw_639044334202413092.png,N,,2026-01-19 16:59:01.654847

With a commitment of C$10 million, BMI has reaffirmed its dedication toward the development of the Espanola biocarbon project.
The Espanola project is expected to produce up to 50,000 metric tons of biocarbon per year, representing five times the production capacity of the partners' Thorold Renewable Energy Facility.
""BMI acquired the Espanola site to bring it back to life and return it to productive industrial use,"" said Paul Veldman, CEO of The BMI Group.
This progression is expected to be illustrative of how CHAR Tech and BMI intend to continue to move a growing pipeline of projects forward.","CHAR Technologies Ltd. on Jan. 14 announced that the Espanola project engineering and design study continues to advance with The BMI Group. With a commitment of C$10 million, BMI has reaffirmed its dedication toward the development of the Espanola biocarbon project.

The project will be located at Bioveld North, the former pulp and paper mill site in Espanola, Ontario, which BMI recently acquired with a focus on putting wood back to work in Northern Ontario.

The Espanola project is expected to produce up to 50,000 metric tons of biocarbon per year, representing five times the production capacity of the partners' Thorold Renewable Energy Facility.

The project's final scope and BMI's final capital allocation will be determined through completion of the engineering and design study.

The proposed facility would convert locally sourced wood waste and forestry residuals into low-carbon biocarbon and synthetic gas, with the potential to valorize the gas, including either direct use on site by the broader Bioveld North facility, or upgrading the synthetic gas to renewable natural gas (RNG) in a later phase.

The engineering and design study is expected to be completed in calendar Q1 of 2026, and will define the technical scope, assess and secure available feedstock supply, and confirm the integration requirements of CHAR Tech's high-temperature pyrolysis platform into the Espanola site's existing industrial infrastructure, including utilities, biomass handling, logistics, and production scaling.

Northern Ontario's substantial forestry residual supply, combined with the site's existing infrastructure, provides a clear pathway to rapid redevelopment at scale.

""The Espanola site, with significant access to biomass materials, wastes and residuals, gives us the opportunity to scale our technology well beyond what was possible at Thorold,"" said Andrew White, CEO of CHAR Tech. ""This study is about defining the details needed to move from development into construction on a larger, more integrated facility located within one of Canada's most significant forestry regions.""

""BMI acquired the Espanola site to bring it back to life and return it to productive industrial use,"" said Paul Veldman, CEO of The BMI Group. ""Partnering with CHAR Tech allows us to move quickly into detailed planning and construction. This project is a cornerstone of our vision to put wood back to work through innovation, full-fiber utilization, and clean-energy production. Espanola is a long-term asset with the potential to create durable jobs, strengthen forestry supply chains, and anchor a new generation of low-carbon industry in the North.""

The project reflects BMI's strategy of pairing proven clean technologies with irreplaceable legacy industrial infrastructure to enable scalable, full-fiber utilization. This progression is expected to be illustrative of how CHAR Tech and BMI intend to continue to move a growing pipeline of projects forward.

The Espanola redevelopment is intended to re-establish the site as a major industrial employer and clean energy anchor in Northern Ontario, demonstrating how existing industrial assets can be repurposed to support sustainable forestry, create high-value jobs, and put wood back to work for the next century of Northern growth.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Char_Tech_Jan26_7d00bbec60.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:59:47.542100

Investment in clean technologies has overtaken investment in fossil fuels and clean energy is reshaping demand fundamentals.
Electric vehicles are displacing millions of barrels of oil demand per day - with that figure set to multiply by 2030.
Given that road transport accounts for around half of global oil demand, electrifying this segment has significant impacts in the long-term role and value of oil.
Within this evolving context, several trends for 2026 are plausible: Oil demand plateau becomes mainstream: financial markets will increasingly treat oil demand growth as limited or declining, not simply cyclical.","In the past weeks, markets have delivered a clear signal: even as geopolitical tensions have flared, global oil prices have remained anchored near the low-$60s per barrel. Brief price increases over Iran have reflected geopolitical risk, but they faded quickly.

That muted reaction speaks not to the irrelevance of geopolitics but to a deeper shift in the global energy landscape that will define 2026: the transition from fossil-fuel dominance toward clean electrification and resilient energy systems.

To many market observers this might look counterintuitive. Historically, supply disruptions - whether from conflict, sanctions, or domestic instability - immediately tightened global oil markets. But today, diversified supplies and weakening demand growth are dampening price sensitivity. The disruption isn’t gone, it’s just less determinative than it used to be.

Venezuela, for the record, is a red herring in this specific debate. Despite renewed attention on its oil sector – crude quality, production constraints, infrastructure decay and sanctions mean Venezuelan oil is not a market-shifting supply source. And by the time meaningful volumes could return, the market itself will have changed. Demand growth for heavy, high-sulphur crude is structurally weaker in a world moving toward electrification.

Investment in clean technologies has overtaken investment in fossil fuels and clean energy is reshaping demand fundamentals.

Clean electrification makes economies more competitive because it delivers cheaper, more stable, more efficient, cleaner and more innovative energy systems while reducing geopolitical risk. According to recent analysis, clean energy - defined broadly to include renewables, electrification technologies, efficiency measures and storage - have the potential to replace three-quarters of existing fossil fuel demand globally.

This reflects rapid deployment and sharply falling costs for renewables and electrification, especially in transport and power. Electric vehicles are displacing millions of barrels of oil demand per day - with that figure set to multiply by 2030. China sold 11 million EVs in 2024, which led to the displacement of 0.43 million barrels per day of gasoline in 2024 (this is 12% of Chinese annual gasoline consumption) and this displacement could quadruple by 2040.

It also aligns with the latest IEA World Energy Outlook cycle, which shows that oil demand peaks at around 102 million barrels per day around 2030 before entering gradual decline under current policy trajectories as well as more ambitious scenarios.

Strategic models increasingly project that electricity - mostly clean - will become the dominant energy carrier in the decades ahead.

Given that road transport accounts for around half of global oil demand, electrifying this segment has significant impacts in the long-term role and value of oil.

This structural shift has profound implications for energy security. For decades, energy policy was synonymous with oil geopolitics. Today, it’s increasingly about electricity resilience, grid flexibility, supply chain robustness and critical minerals security. Governments and businesses alike are wrestling with how to tap domestic clean resources, secure supply chains for clean energy supply technologies, batteries and grid equipment, and manage system risks caused not by single events but by cascading and compound shocks - extreme weather, cyber threats and infrastructure stress.

These trends also shape the politics of climate engagement. At COP30 in Brazil last year, leaders acknowledged the urgency of accelerating clean energy deployment, even in the absence of a globally binding fossil fuel phase-out timeline. Consensus is growing on the need to manage transition pathways, especially given the economic impact in some countries.

Looking ahead, 2026 offers a packed calendar of political and business momentum that could cement this transition:

International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels hosted by Colombia and Netherlands: This gathering aims to accelerate just and practical pathways for emissions reduction and cleaner energy deployment. If outcomes align with evidence on electrification and demand peaking, it could bridge policy gaps between ambition and implementation.

COP31 (Turkey/Australia): As host and partner, these governments have signalled an intent to advance implementation agendas that prioritize energy systems transformation - grids, electrification and industrial decarbonization - rather than headline emission targets alone. The focus is shifting toward real-world policies that enable transformation at scale.

Other global dialogues are increasingly shaping the direction of economic and energy policy - including the G7, G20, BRICS, APEC and related forums. Taken together, these platforms reflect a shifting centre of gravity in global decision-making, with growing influence from the Global South on questions of development, energy security, industrial strategy and transition pathways.

Within this evolving context, several trends for 2026 are plausible:

Oil demand plateau becomes mainstream: financial markets will increasingly treat oil demand growth as limited or declining, not simply cyclical. This will tighten capital for high-cost fossil projects and elevate electricity and storage sectors as primary investment destinations.

Electrification as a driver of competitiveness drives policy action: governments will shift rhetoric and policy incentives toward end-use electrification - buildings, industry, transport - recognizing that electricity offers greater energy security and long-term economic competitiveness.

Energy security debates further reframe: security discussions will continue to centre less on crude supply routes and more on grid resilience, semiconductor and battery supply chains, and critical mineral partnerships, with discussions potentially broadening into the security implications of winding down of fossil fuels.

These shifts don’t negate the risks ahead. Gas retains a longer runway in parts of the system, coal demand remains in some regions, and fossil infrastructure persists. But the signal in prices combined with the momentum in clean deployment reveals a deeper reality: energy transitions are no longer aspirational - they are structural and investment-driven.

For business leaders and policymakers alike, the imperative in 2026 will be clear: align strategy with the realities of clean electrified economies - not because of ideology, but because economics, resilience and security demand it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/696df644b3a2acf77a23b275/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-19 11:59:52.203219

Successful state leaders know that energy policy is economic policy, and clean energy must be central to addressing economic challenges and opportunities, even as federal progress stalls.

Take Virginia, where Governor Abigail Spanberger was sworn in last Saturday. She won in a landslide victory with a commitment to lower energy costs, modernize the electricity grid and expand clean energy and transportation programs. These are investments that can strengthen reliability and affordability for households and businesses alike.

As Virginia’s General Assembly convenes this month, here are three strategies that lawmakers can pursue to turn her commitments into action:

Build more clean energy, fast

Demand for electricity is surging, driven by electrification, manufacturing and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Solar and wind have quickly become the cheapest and easiest energy sources to deploy. Without action to remove barriers to clean energy deployment, energy costs will continue to rise.

Virginia policymakers should reinforce the state’s clean energy goals through the Virginia Clean Economy Act, streamline permitting processes to quickly get affordable energy projects online, and invest in battery storage to keep power flowing when and where it’s needed.

Other states are also moving in this direction. Massachusetts is weighing legislation to boost distributed energy resources, while Michigan is making it easier to build transmission along existing infrastructure such as highways or pipelines.

Get more out of the system we have

America’s aging grid is a bottleneck, requiring massive investment. Grid-enhancing technologies can unlock hidden capacity and improve resilience against extreme weather. While they don’t eliminate the long-term need for new transmission lines, policymakers should prioritize these types of high-value, no-regrets investments that save costs in the long run.

Virginia could build upon its existing virtual power plant program, linking solar panels, batteries and smart thermostats to boost capacity and reliability while keeping costs down. Virginia leads in these types of forward-thinking initiatives with fellow states across the South, including North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.

Remove barriers to clean transportation

Businesses and consumers recognize the benefits of electric vehicles, most notably lower fuel and maintenance costs. Yet limited access to charging infrastructure remains a major barrier, especially in rural areas. Virginia can lead by expanding charging access, giving businesses and consumers the freedom to choose cost-saving, low-maintenance vehicles that meet their needs.

The benefits will ripple outward, delivering cleaner air, reducing health care costs, and creating thousands of new jobs.

In 2024, the clean vehicle sector supported 400,000 jobs nationwide, including 8,000 in Virginia. With federal support waning, states must keep driving this economic engine forward. Many states are doing just that already with the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition, a group of 13 states committed to making electric vehicles more affordable and practical to drive.

The path forward for states in 2026 is clear: treating affordability as an energy challenge – and acting accordingly – is the best way to deliver lower bills, strengthen local economies and secure energy system for all.

By mid 2027, AM Green expects to begin producing 0.5 mtpa of green ammonia ahead of reaching full production.

At full capacity, the project will comprise 1.95GW of alkaline electrolysers, 7.5GW of renewables, and 2GW of pumped storage. It has lined up John Cockerill electrolysers, and “round-the-clock” renewable energy power purchase agreements.

Chief Minister of the state of Andhra Pradesh, Nara Chandrababu Naidu, said the first equipment installations at the site moved the state closer to becoming a “net exporter of green energy.”

AM Green has inked a firm to supply 500,000 tonnes of Kakinada-made green ammonia to German energy firm Uniper, with first deliveries expected by 2028. The firm is also exploring shipping the green molecules to chemicals major BASF, as well as power firm RWE.

These deals could be the first examples of large-scale green hydrogen trade between Europe and India.

AM Green said the project was creating “real economic impact” by reviving legacy industrial infrastructure, creating jobs, and building a new “clean energy ecosystem in the region.”

India has increasingly been positioning itself as a major green hydrogen supplier for regions like Europe, by leaning on its strong renewables potential.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/1768709742251-e1768813868462.jpeg",N,,2026-01-19 13:58:58.817950

The collaboration is positioned as a response to widening readiness gaps as AI adoption accelerates. Citing Kyndryl’s 2025 Readiness Report, the company said most leaders expect AI to reshape jobs within a year, but far fewer believe their workforce is prepared—an imbalance the initiative intends to address through practical training and real-world demonstrations. Wayne State and Kyndryl plan to use the lab environment to train teams in agentic AI for manufacturing and to replicate customer challenges on a mock assembly line, with the goal of advancing from theoretical prototypes to deployable solutions.

In its initial phase, IntelliMake will pair advanced computing with modular orchestration to show how intelligent agents can identify disruptions, adapt to changes, and recover operations. The autonomous manufacturing and assembly line is intended to reduce scrap and rework, improve quality outcomes, and provide workers with more responsive tools and real-time operational insights. Kyndryl said it will support system orchestration by integrating technologies, including Kyndryl Bridge, to monitor and manage the end-to-end infrastructure powering the lab’s simulated production environment.

The partners framed the hub as part of a broader ambition to position Detroit and Michigan as leaders in smart manufacturing, citing a projected $10 trillion opportunity driven by AI agents, robotics, and digital twins that enable factories to self-optimize and reconfigure dynamically. Wayne State said the initiative leverages its location in a major manufacturing region and its industry relationships to address manufacturing modernization and workforce development challenges, while aligning university research with scalable industrial applications.

With the advent of AI and its power needs, DeWitte said the U.S. energy system as it stands has ""absolutely"" not been able to keep up.
OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.
When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.
""Then you're just having those countries build power plants to power it.","NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

The U.S. is running headlong into a power crunch driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence — and the nation’s energy grid is not ready for it, an executive behind a major new nuclear partnership warned recently.

Jacob DeWitte is CEO of OKLO, a California-based advanced nuclear company focused on helping large energy users add grid power through private investment rather than traditional utilities. He joined Meta executive Joel Kaplan and Energy Secretary Chris Wright for an announcement in Washington.

The Meta partnership will go a long way to add much-needed power to a key regional component of the national grid, DeWitte said, citing OKLO’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW installation in Pike County, Ohio, near the Hocking Hills.

""I think one of the really exciting things about today is announcing the fact we're going to be building a lot more power generation capabilities,"" he said, quipping that southeastern Ohio used to be an ""industrial cathedral"" and now can see new commercial rebirth for the digital and AI age.

WE'RE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE. BUT WE KNOW AMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE, OR ELSE

""Smaller [nuclear] plants can be built more quickly and come online faster – then you shorten the learning curve. You reduce the cost both in time and money of iteration cycles to drive technological progress and bring these technologies that have huge promise forward in terms of cost reduction… energy dominance and energy reliability and energy abundance,"" he said.

Wright and President Donald Trump have helped companies like OKLO and Meta unleash this new energy potential, to not only increase power capacity and amend structural issues but also greatly reduce the regulatory burdens private companies tend to face from Washington, DeWitte added.

With the advent of AI and its power needs, DeWitte said the U.S. energy system as it stands has ""absolutely"" not been able to keep up.

MORNING GLORY: A PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP-BRANDED ENERGY DRINK?

DeWitte warned that the U.S. needs to build out the power grid and invest in new installations like the Pike site:

""We are going to run out of power capacity in this country in the next several years, especially in critical industrial markets like sort of the Midwest and Northeast. The PJM interconnection [which supports the Mid-Atlantic region] is going to be undersupplied with power generation in just a matter of a few years.""

""The steps taken today are going to help alleviate that, but there's going be a lot more that's needed.""

TRUMP SAYS EVERY AI PLANT BEING BUILT IN US WILL BE SELF-SUSTAINING WITH THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY

DeWitte also addressed what he described as a common misconception surrounding the rise of data centers, which have sparked NIMBY backlash in parts of the country.

""I think sometimes people conflate [that] building these data centers [will] drive prices up – that's a scarcity mindset. We're in a world of an abundance mindset, right?"" he said.

TRUMP ADMIN'S ENERGY AGENDA HAILED FOR CRUCIAL 'WINS' AS GREEN ACTIVISTS LASH OUT

He said Meta is committing to a total of 6.6GW of new power, calling it a ""huge amount of capacity"" to fuel the needs of decades to come, and that nuclear is a very reliable energy source.

DeWitte said one of the biggest structural choke points in bringing new energy online, and why the nation is running out of power, leading to price inflation, is the regulatory environment that has stymied growth for many years.

That dynamic, he said, has been ""fundamentally anti-energy.""

BURGUM CALLS CALIFORNIA A ‘NATIONAL SECURITY RISK’ AS ENERGY CHIEF WARNS BLUE STATES ARE SKEWING COST AVERAGES

But, DeWitte said, that dynamic is changing: ""The unfortunate thing is we have to undo decades of... damage [from] not doing things to then overcome that inertia.""

""Look at the states that have the worst energy… They're largely states that have had the heaviest-handed anti-energy policies, and they're the ones that are now facing some of the biggest challenges on that point, and they are also responding, which is encouraging.""

OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.

""Our view of that, though, is changing a couple of things, including the business model, [and the] deployment model, including how we think about size and technology. We see opportunities to go invest in and build significant generating capacity in areas that need it and have significant development opportunities around it,"" he said, noting that brings the conversation full circle regarding its investment in the Ohio site.

When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.

We’ve neglected the power of carbon-sucking fungi. Meet the scientist determined to change that

An “invisible” key to tackling the climate crisis has taken centre stage after evolutionary biologist Dr Toby Kiers was named the winner of the 2026 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement.

The Laureate, which is often touted as the ‘Nobel Prize’ for the climate, recognises “outstanding” scientific work in environmental science, health and energy that benefits humanity. It comes with a $250,000 (around €215,000) cash prize.

How the oceans’ coral reefs could be a secret weapon to tackle food insecurity around the world

Coral reefs could become a crucial part of the pathway to help fight global hunger and improve nutrition around the world.

New research from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) says that rebuilding coral fish stocks and managing them at a “sustainable level” is still feasible and may be a solution to tackling malnutrition. In some places, this could be achieved in as little as six years.

But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced.
These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable.","Despite strong global momentum to accelerate decarbonisation, fossil fuels still have a strong hold of the energy use across most sectors. The IEA reports that industrial energy consumption is still dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal; and transportation relies on oil products for nearly 91 percent of its energy. As of the first half of 2025 however, the global energy supply shows a more positive picture as renewable energy overtook coal as the leading source of energy for the first time in history. But that was no miracle; that is market logic in action. The environmental commodity markets have played the role of scaffolding by providing the framework and support on which the energy transition can be built.

To explain the concept of environmental commodity with a simple analogy: If a homeowner wants to lower his or her carbon footprint, they might install some solar panels. But presuming they live in a block of flats, they might ask a friend to put solar panels on their roof instead. The flat owner helps the friend to finance that and in return can claim that they have neutralised the carbon output of their flat. What those homeowners are doing is creating a marketplace for decarbonisation opportunities, which is exactly what is happening at a macro-level between energy producers, corporates and major industry. It allows people who want to make moves to decarbonise, but who might be constrained. It allows them to invest in the move to decarbonise elsewhere. Similarly, it also enables people who have the opportunity, but not the finance, to get their projects off the ground.

The levers of transition

Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) that put a price on emissions were first launched in 2005. In addition, renewable energy certificates (GOs, IRECs, RECs) that link clean energy generation with consumer demand and fuel mandates (LCFS, REDIII) that reward low-carbon alternatives have gained their importance as tools to put a price on emissions and address environmental impact. These markets exist not to virtue-signal but to account for the cost of emissions and make decarbonisation bankable. Just as in other markets, traders, like us at STX Group, come in to facilitate pricing structures and climate solutions that simplify sales and manage risk for both the buyer and the producer. This market mechanism brings more investment to the market and is therefore an essential part of the commodities markets.

Carbon is finally being priced appropriately — and investment is following

The energy transition is ultimately executed through three levers: efficiency, switching towards renewable fuels and feedstocks, and carbon capture. But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced. The good news is, carbon is being appropriately priced and, as a result, environmental commodity markets have been growing rapidly over the last 20 years. New regulations are also taking effect, especially in Europe, across multiple industries. In shipping, FuelEU Maritime is reshaping fuel demand. In aviation, ReFuelEU mandates are driving uptake of sustainable fuels. RED III is pushing EU member states to increase renewables in power and heat. CBAM is levelling the playing field between domestic and foreign producers in the EU. All these regulations put more pressure on European refineries to ramp up their production of clean energy products. These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable. The future growth of the ‘sustainable economy’ is driven largely by the widening net of regulatory compliance but also has become a lifeline for energy companies operating on markets rapidly shifting towards renewables.

While the pace of change to decarbonise the global economy is arguably still slow, we cannot ignore the emissions that have been capped and addressed because of market schemes like the ETS and a large variety of environmental commodities. To give a sense of the scale, the global EAC market has grown to over 2,400 TWh annually since its formalisation in the early 2000s, representing a size equal to more than 60 percent of the total electricity demand of the European Union. It now covers approximately 40 percent of the EU’s total GHG emissions and generates €38bn in revenues in 2024.

By my latest count, more than 70 countries now operate carbon pricing systems. Clean fuel mandates and schemes are spreading across North America and Asia. In Europe, numerous clean energy policies and regulations are making carbon a balance-sheet cost for major heavy industries including aviation, shipping and manufacturing. There are plenty more schemes similar to the existing regulation that we expect to see make a big impact in the coming years, such as sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc), white certificates to drive energy efficiency and biofuel mandates. One thing is clear: emissions now carry a price, and that price is rising.

I strongly believe that market mechanisms are the most efficient way to align political ambition, corporate obligation and consumer demand to decarbonise, at an affordable cost. Without them, the transition risks becoming slower, costlier and more divisive.",https://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marketdriver-600x450.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 13:59:04.838463

The plan subsequently aims to expedite the construction of new power plants, especially natural gas-powered ones, to supply power directly to the data center sector.
This has led to more novel natural gas solutions emerging from the woodwork, such as Boom Supersonic and ProEnergy’s plans to repurpose airline jet engines to power data centers behind the meter.
Overall, residential bills across the 13 states within the network are expected to grow significantly next year, with data centers the main culprit.
""This is not a yes/no to data centers,"" PJM board chair and interim president and CEO David Mills said in a statement.","The emergency auction would be unprecedented, but it isn't surprising given the skyrocketing capacity-addition projections across the region. In its latest annual capacity auction, which closed in July, wholesale electric capacity grew 22 percent compared to last year. The Trump administration, alongside the governors, argued that the issues are compounded by the fact that large amounts of firm capacity are slated for retirement by 2030, which it argues would put increased pressure on the grid to meet the growing demand.

Therefore, to accommodate this growth, utilities across the PJM grid have announced massive increases in generation. However, due to the oft-arduous approval process and construction lag times, there has been a growing call for a more streamlined service for the data center market. The plan subsequently aims to expedite the construction of new power plants, especially natural gas-powered ones, to supply power directly to the data center sector. At the start of last year, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found that utilities across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia plan to build more than 20GW of natural gas power plants by 2040 to meet energy demand from the data center sector.

""Under President Trump's leadership, the administration is leading an unprecedented bipartisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.

However, concerns remain over the gas turbine supply chain, with its heavily constrained nature and a stuffed order book likely a bottleneck in the drive to bring more generation online. This has led to more novel natural gas solutions emerging from the woodwork, such as Boom Supersonic and ProEnergy’s plans to repurpose airline jet engines to power data centers behind the meter.

In addition, with the repeal of many tax credits for new renewable projects, there will be increased pressure on the natural gas supply chain to meet demand.

While the plan may lead to some more generation coming online faster than expected, it is still beholden to global supply chains and may not have an immediate impact. As a result, Advanced Energy United, which represents energy companies and corporate buyers across clean-energy sectors, said the approach doesn't address core challenges such as making PJM's grid-connection process more efficient.

The clearer aim of the initiative, it seems, especially in the short term, is to assuage growing political angst over who is responsible for the costs of the new generation needed for the growth of AI.

We have already seen large bill increases in data center hubs such as Columbus, Ohio. In the city, the average residential bill is set to increase by $27 a month. Overall, residential bills across the 13 states within the network are expected to grow significantly next year, with data centers the main culprit.

In response to cost increases, legislators across several of the 13 states have seen new ratepayer rules approved by their political and regulatory bodies, which have set guidelines for who is responsible for the costs of constructing new generation and transmission infrastructure. Ohio was one of the first to enforce new rules, with new data center customers on the hook for a minimum of 85 percent of the energy they say they need each month, even if they use less. A few months after the approval, AEP Ohio, the state's largest utility, announced that it had seen its pipeline of large load capacity additions shrink as a result. The state utility said in a statement that it was the direct result of the new rules, which had culled many speculative and zombie projects.

The new auction resembles some of the aspects of the new ratepayer class approved in places like Ohio, and proposed in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Subsequently, it could be the first step towards a universal requirement that data center developers play an integral role in financing the new capacity additions needed to power the planned facilities. President Trump has not been afraid to dictate the pace of investment within the tech market, and with so many within the sector avowed allies of the President, this could make them more amenable to breaking out their checkbooks to pay for the new generation.

As of yet, it is unclear whether the new generation capacity would feed data centers via a private wire or through the grid, but it is increasingly clear that something needs to be done about the spiraling costs across the region.

An interesting wrinkle of the announcement was the fact that the RTO itself was not invited to participate, which raises serious questions about the support of the plan. However, with bipartisan backing, it seems likely that PJM will have to oblige and hold the auction as planned to avoid the wrath of an increasingly assertive President.

Following the announcement, PJM released a statement outlining a set of board-approved actions aimed at accommodating data centers and other large new electricity users.

The measures include the immediate launch of efforts to secure additional power supplies. PJM also said it will enhance load forecasting, expand the role of states, and explore options that would allow large customers to supply their own generation or participate in a connect-and-manage approach. Additional steps include establishing a fast-track interconnection process for state-backed generation projects and beginning a backstop procurement to address near-term reliability risks.

""This is not a yes/no to data centers,"" PJM board chair and interim president and CEO David Mills said in a statement. ""This is, 'How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?'""

While the plan’s ability to materially lower prices or accelerate near-term capacity additions remains uncertain, it has already prompted a more proactive response from grid operators, utilities, regulators, and data center developers grappling with the pace and cost of AI-driven load growth.

The reaction to the news has been mixed. Amazon responded to the news with a positive spin. In a statement, the company said: “We share the goal of ensuring affordable, reliable energy for American families and our economy, and we applaud the bipartisanship emerging to tackle America's outdated grid challenges. Amazon is paying our full energy costs and is committed to ensuring our data centers don’t increase consumers’ electricity bills, and we've been clear that every major energy user should do the same.”

In contrast, environmental groups, such as Earth Justice, argued that the move could have drastic impacts on carbon emission levels. “If the Department of Energy were serious about affordability, it would be greenlighting clean energy, not taking extraordinary, unlawful measures to stop the quickest and cheapest solution we have. The auction proposed today might help protect consumers - but only if it’s designed and implemented right. If the auction is badly designed, it could lock in dirty, expensive infrastructure and harm already overburdened communities–even where states, citizens, and tech companies all want clean energy,” said Nick Lawton, Earthjustice attorney.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/IMG_0064_1_1.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:05:47.448190

Geopolitical twists and turns are straining long-established relationships and upending deeply held assumptions. The World Uncertainty Index, devised by economists from the IMF and Stanford University, has hit unprecedented levels in recent months.

But in this time of flux, there are still some important trends that we can identify with some confidence. Here are seven that can help us keep our bearings:

Oil and gas will still be widely used for many years to come, but the use of electricity is growing twice as a fast as overall energy demand. It’s the key energy input to the most dynamic parts of the global economy – such as AI, data centres and high-tech manufacturing – and is increasing its share of major sectors like road transport and heating through technologies such as EVs and heat pumps. Already today, more than half of the investment going into the global energy sector each year is going to electricity.

Despite some headwinds, in many countries around the world, renewables are meeting much if not all of the rising demand for electricity, often because they are the most competitive option. Solar is leading the way, as the countries that are increasingly driving energy demand, such as India, have a very high-quality solar resource, but other technologies are in play, too, including new ones coming through such as next-generation geothermal energy.

After a series of setbacks in the 2010s, nuclear is on the rise again, generating more electricity than ever before last year. Today, more than 70 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity is under construction, one of the highest levels in the past 30 years. Soaring electricity demand from data centres means tech companies are also turning to nuclear, attracted by its promise of low-emissions, round-the-clock power supply.

Traditional hazards affecting the security of oil and gas supplies are now accompanied by vulnerabilities in other areas, including electricity security, as highlighted by the recent major blackouts in Chile and Spain, and critical minerals. A single country, China, is the dominant refiner for 19 out of 20 energy-related strategic minerals, with an average market share of around 70%. More than half of these strategic minerals are subject to some form of export controls. Rising energy security risks from climate change are now also a certainty, intensifying the need to make energy systems more resilient to extreme weather events, as well as to cyberattacks and other malicious activity targeting critical infrastructure.

As energy is elevated to a matter of economic and national security, so governments are increasingly intervening to shape outcomes, rather than leaving them to the market. This is visible in energy technology supply chains, especially for critical minerals, as countries seek to counter the risks associated with China’s high market share. Trade in oil and gas is also increasingly subject to political considerations and government-to-government negotiation – or to sanctions.

Oil prices have already come under pressure because of relatively abundant supply, and the same will soon be true in natural gas markets, as the wave of new LNG export projects start operations. There is also ample manufacturing capacity for batteries, solar panels and other technologies. These trends can benefit fuel and technology importers, but they should not get too comfortable: this period of plenty and potentially lower prices could lead to reduced investments in energy, with implications for subsequent years.

The centre of gravity in the world’s energy markets is shifting as a group of emerging economies, led by India and Southeast Asia and joined by countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa increasingly shape energy market dynamics. They are taking up the baton from China, which accounted for more than half of global demand growth for oil, gas and electricity since 2010. That said, no other country on its own will come close to replicating China’s extraordinary energy trajectory of recent decades.

Amid today’s turmoil, focusing only on uncertainties can lead to indecision and paralysis. A wait-and-see approach on energy by governments, companies and investors risks storing up trouble for the future, given the world’s thirst for energy and the continuous need for investment. There are still some certainties that decision-makers can rely on: let’s not lose sight of them as we plan for the future.",https://iea.org/assets/front/images/iea_open_graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:00:09.290671

HaloCell Energy has established itself as a leader in Australian perovskite development, launching Australian-made perovskite modules optimised for low-light conditions and partnering with the University of Queensland to advance record-breaking tandem heterojunction perovskite solar cells.

The company’s printed modules target applications where traditional silicon panels face limitations, including aerial systems, space-based installations and indoor sensor networks.

Paul Moonie, CEO of HaloCell Energy, highlighted the partnership’s commercial significance.

“At HaloCell, we’re creating the next generation of solar solutions – lightweight, printable and tuned for real-world conditions,” Moonie said.

“To gain scale, we need access to fit-for-purpose materials at the right cost. That’s why this partnership with Lava Blue is so important.”

The agreement encompasses the development and supply of scalable perovskite precursors, the evaluation of potential offtake arrangements and joint project opportunities and engagement across the broader perovskite value chain, both domestically and internationally.

This collaboration builds on Lava Blue’s Australian Research Council-funded research into refining high-purity materials from mine waste for clean technology applications.

Lava Blue operates the Centre for Predictive Research into Specialty Materials in Brisbane, featuring demonstration-scale processing capabilities for producing 4N and 5N high-purity alumina.

The company’s technology platform addresses growing demand for speciality materials, with global high-purity alumina requirements forecast to exceed 240,000 tonnes annually by 2030, while 75% of the current supply remains concentrated in China.

Perovskite solar cells offer advantages including high efficiency, potential for low-cost manufacturing, and strong performance in low-light conditions, making them suitable for specialised applications where conventional silicon photovoltaics face constraints.

However, commercial deployment has been limited by material costs and supply chain challenges that this partnership aims to address.

The memorandum of understanding establishes a foundation for deeper collaboration as perovskite markets evolve, with both companies committed to intellectual property protection and science-based development approaches.

McCann noted the partnership’s broader significance for Australian industrial positioning: “This partnership is a signal.

Moreover, during daytime hours, solar PV has matched the rise in US electricity demand, while the technology also met some of the electricity demand growth during the evening hours, helped by energy storage.
According to Ember, the rise of batteries in the US is changing solar PV from cheap daytime electricity to dispatchable all-day electricity.
Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember, said: “Solar growth was essential in helping to meet fast-rising electricity demand in 2025.","The growth of solar generation was the highest in regions where electricity demand grew the most, such as Texas, the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic. Solar growth met 81%, 81% and 33% of electricity demand growth, respectively, in these three regions.

Other states or regions also saw a growth in solar PV, such as is the case of Florida, where solar growth exceeded demand growth “by a large margin” and contributed to a fall in fossil fuel generation. This is in contrast with the rest of the US, where the majority of new solar generation met increased electricity demand rather than displacing existing generation.

However, the continued growth of solar PV in the US remains limited to a few states, with 37 states having less than 10% of their electricity from solar PV in the last 12 months.

California remains the leading state in terms of the highest solar share with 37%, followed by Nevada with 34%. Both states, along with Arkansas, Arizona, Maine and New Mexico, have seen their solar share rise by more than five percentage points in the 24 months to October 2025. New Mexico has had the fastest increase, rising ten percentage points from 7% to 17% during that period.

Moreover, during daytime hours, solar PV has matched the rise in US electricity demand, while the technology also met some of the electricity demand growth during the evening hours, helped by energy storage.

According to Ember, the rise of batteries in the US is changing solar PV from cheap daytime electricity to dispatchable all-day electricity. A clear example of this is California, where in the last six years, the state’s utility-scale solar PV and battery generation grew by 58%, despite electricity generation only rising by 8% during the sunniest hour of the day.

Dave Jones, chief analyst at Ember, said: “Solar growth was essential in helping to meet fast-rising electricity demand in 2025. It generated where it was needed and – with the surge in batteries – increasingly when it was needed. Solar has the potential to meet all the rise in electricity demand and much more. With electricity demand surging, the case to build solar has never been stronger.”

Furthermore, utility-scale solar PV remains the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the US, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). It forecasts up to 70GW of new solar additions between 2026 and 2027, which represents a 49% increase in US solar operational capacity compared with the end of 2025.

Most of that utility-scale capacity addition in the coming two years will come online in Texas. Battery storage will also see a fast increase in operational capacity in the coming years with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market rising from 15GW in 2025 to 37GW by the end of 2027.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Andreas-Gucklhorn.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:59:43.555918

LOS GATOS, Calif., Jan. 19, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing is flourishing across California, as more cities and counties adopt the innovative home‑improvement funding model that has helped homeowners upgrade their properties with clean energy, climate‑resilient, and water‑saving improvements. Home Run Financing (HRF), the state's leading PACE provider, announced today that it now operates in more than 360 California jurisdictions, with recent expansions into Lawndale, Hawthorne, and Calabasas in Los Angeles County; Mountain House in San Joaquin County; Willows in Glenn County, Lincoln, Rocklin, and, most recently, Loomis in Placer County.

The PACE financing model – developed more than 15 years ago – has become an important component of California's clean‑energy and climate‑resilience strategy. The program allows homeowners to finance critical upgrades such as roofing, efficient windows and doors, HVAC systems, insulation, EV charging stations, solar installations, and more. In California, PACE has been further customized to support earthquake safety, and water‑efficiency projects, helping entire communities adapt to the state's evolving climate challenges.

""I'm truly excited to see the Town of Loomis offering the PACE program to our community, empowering homeowners with new opportunities to invest in energy efficiency and a more sustainable future,"" said Amanda Cortez, Town Councilmember of Loomis when the Town approved PACE in December. ""I believe our residents will appreciate having this option at their fingertips.""

A Public‑Benefit Model with Local Control

PACE financing in California is facilitated through the California Statewide Communities Development Agency (CSCDA) , a joint‑powers public benefit entity that enables member governments to opt in voluntarily to their Open PACE Program.

A Program Built on Strong Consumer Protections

Once the subject of debate, PACE in California has operated under the strict regulatory oversight of the California Department of Financial Protection & Innovation (DFPI), the state's consumer watchdog agency, for the past six years. Today, PACE is widely recognized as offering some of the strongest consumer protections in the home‑improvement financing industry nationwide.

Major Environmental and Economic Impact

Since launching in California ten years ago (under its previous name, PACE Funding Group), Home Run Financing has delivered more than $641 million in PACE financing for almost 20,700 home‑improvement projects statewide.

These upgrades have generated significant environmental benefits, including:

261,300 metric tons of lifetime greenhouse gas reductions, equivalent to removing 60,950 cars from the road for a year or powering more than 35,000 homes for a year.

301 million gallons of water saved, enough to fill more than 14,600 backyard pools or avoid 11.9 million five‑minute showers.

HRF PACE‑financed projects have also created more than 5,000 good‑paying jobs across California, supporting a network of more than 2,000 contractors who rely on PACE to help homeowners access essential upgrades.

""PACE has proven itself again and again as one of California's most effective tools for empowering homeowners, strengthening communities, and accelerating our transition to a cleaner, safer future,"" said Bob Giles, CEO of Home Run Financing. ""The renewed demand we're seeing from cities and counties across the state shows just how essential this program has become. PACE is strong in California, and it's only getting stronger.""

PACE: A Proven Tool for California's Future

With climate change accelerating and the need for resilient infrastructure growing, PACE remains one of the most flexible and impactful financing tools available to California homeowners and local governments.

""PACE is working exactly as intended,"" Giles added. ""It's helping families afford improvements that make their homes safer, greener, and more efficient. It's supporting local jobs. And it's giving communities the power to choose the solutions that fit their needs. That's why PACE continues to thrive in California.""

MASON COUNTY, W.Va. – Governor Patrick Morrisey today announced that Frontieras North America has closed on 183 acres in Mason County, where the company will build a flagship $850 million advanced coal reformation facility that is expected to create more than 2,000 construction jobs and over 200 full-time positions once operational.

“We are excited to welcome Frontieras North America and its state-of-the-art project to Mason County. This investment demonstrates that West Virginia’s workforce and business climate can attract world-class companies and investments,” said Governor Morrisey. “Frontieras is completely aligned with our 50 by 50 energy plan and our red tape-cutting strategy. This terrific announcement for West Virginia will create so many high-paying jobs and economic growth.”

The Mason County facility will be the first commercial-scale deployment of Frontieras’ patented FASForm™ process, which converts coal into fuels, fertilizers, and industrial carbon products with zero waste. The site offers more than a mile of Ohio River frontage for barge transport, Class I rail access via CSX, and close proximity to Appalachian coal reserves and a skilled regional workforce.

“West Virginia gave us every reason to build here—natural resources, world-class logistics, and a government that understands the importance of industrial growth,” said Matthew McKean, CEO and Co-Founder of Frontieras North America.

When that happens, Hood River, and subsequently the Columbia River, get less cold mountain runoff that might otherwise cool their waters.","Oregon Public Broadcasting first published this article.

The Dalles is trying to expand its water reservoir — and it’s turning to Congress in a quest to acquire part of the Mount Hood National Forest to do so.

That’s prompting concerns from environmental groups and local residents. They’re worried both about the ecological cost to fish and wildlife, and about whether the extra water will really go to local homes and businesses — or if The Dalles wants to draw water from the Mount Hood forest to slake the tech industry’s growing thirst for data centers.

“The notion that this water is somehow for drinking water for residents of the city, it’s just a fallacy,” said John DeVoe, senior advisor at WaterWatch of Oregon, an environmental nonprofit. “Obviously, the great driver of demand for water in The Dalles is Google.”

The city’s elected officials have repeatedly denied that they are seeking more water to serve Google. They say they need to expand The Dalles’ reservoir because the city in north-central Oregon is growing.

But The Dalles’ population hasn’t grown much this past decade. It has added about 1,700 people over the last 15 years, bringing its population up to about 16,200 people, according to Portland State University estimates.

What has grown: Google’s size and water use.

Google built its first data center in The Dalles in 2006. In 2012, the tech giant used 12% of The Dalles water supply. By 2024, a third of The Dalles’ water went to Google’s three local data center sites. The multitrillion-dollar tech company just built a data center building in 2025, and plans to complete another one this year.

Officials with Google say they are not behind the push to transfer federal land to The Dalles so the city can expand its reservoir. And The Dalles city officials insist the city isn’t expanding its reservoir to meet Google’s growing need for water.

“Google is really not a factor in this at all,” said The Dalles Mayor Richard Mays. “We were planning on doing this without Google.”

Yet The Dalles’ 2024 master water plan projects the city will need at least a million gallons per day specifically for an unnamed industrial user. That’s the same amount Google is using in The Dalles.

The Dalles’ request to use more water from the Hood River Basin comes as tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft increasingly draw scrutiny for consuming massive amounts of water to cool servers in their data centers.

Data centers are a backbone of the technology that underpins much of modern life. They host websites, business applications, social media platforms and streaming media. While these centers have existed for decades, companies are rapidly constructing more to accommodate the nation’s growing demand for artificial intelligence.

Data centers have proliferated in rural areas like The Dalles, where land is vast and cheap. These systems come with some economic benefits: Google has invested almost $29 million into updating The Dalles’ water system, albeit in exchange for tax breaks.

Google’s property taxes for its data centers are discounted by 92% through its agreements with The Dalles and Wasco County. In 2025, it paid $7.3 million in property taxes, including a community service fee.

Tech companies like Google can bring promises of jobs and expanded industry in areas that feel forgotten by modern urbanization. Google employs about 200 people in The Dalles.

But the benefits data centers might bring to rural areas can come at a cost to the environment, the electrical grid, and water resources. It’s up to local leaders of small cities and counties to decide which they value most: an economic boost and funds for public services like health departments and water infrastructure, or natural resources that people and wildlife need to live.

The Dalles seeks a piece of Mount Hood National Forest

The Dalles gets almost 85% of its water from the Dog River, a low-flowing river that drains down the eastern Mount Hood foothills. The city has a pipeline that diverts water from the river into a stream that empties into the city’s reservoir.

The forests surrounding The Dalles’ reservoir are owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. If the city pursues a project that could affect that land — like by expanding the reservoir — it needs to get a federal permit. As part of that process, federal agencies would analyze whether the project could harm the environment and sensitive species. That analysis would likely take multiple years.

“When it’s owned by someone else other than us, we can’t control it,” Mays said. “We have to go through all sorts of red tape and special use permits with the Forest Service in order to be able to expand that reservoir.”

To cut through that red tape, including environmental reviews, The Dalles hopes to acquire the federal land immediately surrounding its reservoir, so it can raise its dam — necessary to expand the reservoir so it can hold more water — by roughly 2040.

The city is trying to acquire the federal land through a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Cliff Bentz, a Republican representing most of Eastern and Southern Oregon. If the bill makes it through Congress, The Dalles will take ownership of the land. That will allow it to raise its dam and to expand its reservoir’s capacity from 900 acre-feet to about 3,000 acre-feet, more than triple its current size, without Forest Service oversight. For context, an Olympic-size swimming pool holds about 2 acre-feet of water. The city expects raising the dam and expanding the reservoir to cost about $70 million.

Bentz said he does not know if The Dalles’ reservoir expansion is needed specifically to fulfill Google’s water needs.

“Did I ask them how they were going to use the water and who was going to get it? No,” Bentz told OPB. “The focus here is on how can we do things more efficiently at the governmental level to make it more likely that we can offer services and utilities to business so that we can get better jobs for higher pay to people.”

Bentz’s bill has passed through the House, and is now in the hands of a Senate committee on which U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, sits.

In a statement to OPB, Wyden remained noncommittal.

“I am listening to the interests and concerns of all parties as the Senate considers the bill,” Wyden said in a statement to OPB.

In addition to its reservoir, The Dalles gets water from groundwater wells. Those wells pull from an aquifer, an underground layer of porous rock and water. Other people and businesses with their own wells in the area, including ranchers, farmers and residents, also draw water from the same source.

Because aquifers have a limited amount of water at any given time, Oregon law limits how much people can pull by allocating water rights.

When Google purchased a defunct aluminum smelter in The Dalles, it also acquired the right to pump massive amounts of water from underground — up to 3.88 million gallons a day. That’s almost as much water as the entire city averaged per day in 2024.

The corporation transferred those water rights to the city in 2021, Bentz noted, allowing The Dalles to pump more water from underground.

But groundwater is limited — there is only so much available before it’s replenished by rain or snowmelt. Oregon is one of many states that have allocated more water rights than the earth can provide at once, causing groundwater wells for residents, farmers and other businesses to run dry — particularly in Eastern and Central Oregon.

When the smelter was in operation, it pumped so much water that it strained groundwater resources, which helped put The Dalles on state regulators’ map of “critical groundwater areas.” It wasn’t until the early 2000s, when the water-intensive smelter closed, that groundwater levels began to stabilize.

Now, The Dalles has the right to pump the same amount of water, potentially straining The Dalles’ groundwater resources again. And it can provide a large portion of that water to Google.

In an interview with OPB, Google representatives said the company has made up for its heavy water consumption by investing in watershed projects, including planting trees in burned areas and rebuilding a canal.

“We’ve made a lot of investments in the watershed in Oregon that we think ultimately has improved that watershed significantly to the benefit of the entire community,” said Ben Townsend, global head of infrastructure strategy and sustainability at Google.

In the end, Townsend said, Google is all about transparency.

“We want to tell a community why we’re using water,” Townsend said. “They deserve to know. We want to tell a community how much water we’re using.”

Google’s track record in The Dalles tells a different story. In 2021, the company tried to prevent the public from knowing how much water it was using in the city, arguing its water use was a “trade secret,” according to reporting by The Oregonian/OregonLive. The newspaper sued The Dalles for public records, arguing that information must be made public. The Dalles eventually settled with The Oregonian/OregonLive and released the records.

Google paid the city’s attorneys fees in that lawsuit.

OPB pressed Townsend about the lawsuit and how it relates to his goal of transparency. He said the company was trying to protect “physical security of assets that are critical to operations.”

“It’s a little hurtful to hear it implied that there is any attempt by myself or others on the team to obfuscate or hide what would be meaningful environmental footprint data to the community,” Townsend said, adding later, “It hurt my feelings a little bit.”

Diverting river water from Mount Hood

Environmental groups worry that enlarging The Dalles’ reservoir would divert too much water from the Dog River and ultimately harm fish and wildlife.

The Dog River is filled with snowmelt. It flows into the Hood River and, from there, into the Columbia River. As climate change increases global temperatures, river systems like these need all the cool mountain water they can get.

The Dog River has run dry before. When that happens, Hood River, and subsequently the Columbia River, get less cold mountain runoff that might otherwise cool their waters.

Warm water holds less oxygen, making it difficult for fish and other aquatic life to breathe. Harmful bacteria and other microbes also thrive in warmer temperatures, potentially leading to algal and bacterial blooms, and degrading overall water quality.

The Hood River Basin is already stressed by drought. It’s historically been an important cold-water refuge for migrating salmon, providing the cool water they need to move between freshwater rivers and the ocean. The coho salmon, Chinook salmon and steelhead that swim through this basin are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

“Every unit of water you take out of the system over time eventually results in probably higher water temperatures, less spawning and rearing habitat for fish,” said DeVoe, the advisor with WaterWatch of Oregon. “Many of these rivers just have nothing left to give.”

The Dalles is limited by how much water it can pull from the Dog River between August and November, when streamflows are usually lowest and most threatening to fish survival. The city needs to leave a minimum flow of 0.5 cubic feet per second — usually about 3 to 6 inches of water.

That’s generally too low for salmon and steelhead to survive. But city leaders say even when the river is too low for these species to reach some areas, it is deep enough for them to survive farther downstream.

“Dog River’s never going to be dry because you have contributing factors and tributary spring springs that are flowing into Dog River downstream from our diversion point,” said The Dalles public works director Dale McCabe.

It’ll be difficult to determine what environmental harms might come from expanding The Dalles’ reservoir. If the federal land around the reservoir is transferred to the city, The Dalles won’t need to undergo a federal environmental assessment.

“There may never be a proper analysis because it won’t be required, and that in itself is concerning,” said Jade Hagan, a spokesperson for Bark, a grassroots environmental group focused on Mount Hood.

Google’s long history in The Dalles

Around 2012, The Dalles started rebuilding its pipeline that diverts water from Dog River, a $14 million project. The old pipe was nearly a century old, made of wood, and leaked.

The new pipe would be made of plastic. It would also be much larger, with enough capacity to draw twice as much water from the river.

Multiple people and environmental groups, as well as the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, voiced concerns that the larger pipe wouldn’t leave enough water in the river for fish.

“The upstream reaches of the Dog River are entirely dewatered by the City of The Dalles on federal lands administered by your agency,” the tribes wrote to the Forest Service in 2016. “This is despite the trust responsibility the federal government has to the Tribes to maintain fish and wildlife populations.”

After a yearslong environmental assessment, the U.S. Forest Service assured those groups in 2020 that the city of The Dalles didn’t have immediate plans to take more water from the Dog River for at least another decade, because the city’s reservoir was at capacity. The Dalles public works staff told federal regulators that its current water capacity met the city’s needs.

“Therefore, the Forest Service considers any such plans to increase the reservoir’s capacity as an unforeseeable action at this time,” the agency told critics in 2020.

A year later, in 2021, Google announced its plans to build two new data centers.

That’s when Google, through a subsidiary called Design LLC, offered a deal to the city: it would spend $28.5 million to cover the cost of some water infrastructure, including two new groundwater wells, two storage tanks, and multiple pump stations. In exchange, The Dalles would provide Google deep tax cuts for the data centers’ first 15 years, and it would commit to providing a certain amount of water to the company annually.

Suddenly, The Dalles needed more water.

The Dalles public works staff solicited multiple studies and reports illustrating the city’s current water capacity and what it needed to “meet future demands,” according to staff reports presented to councilors.

Subsequent studies and water reports don’t explicitly name Google as a primary water consumer, though the city’s 2024 water master plan specifically mentions a “large industrial user” in projecting how much water The Dalles will need in the future.

That large industrial user, it says, needs about 1 million gallons a day, the same amount that Google currently consumes in The Dalles.

In addition to expanding the reservoir into federal land, the city’s water plan recommends a series of infrastructure improvements to meet future water demands, including replacing and expanding the city’s water treatment plant, and increasing aquifer storage. Altogether, these improvements are expected to cost about $260 million over the next 20 years — including the $70 million that would pay for the reservoir expansion

Revenues from Google, including property taxes, should cover almost a quarter of those upgrades. The rest will come from loans and higher water rates for customers. Those rates are expected to increase by 7% by 2036.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5febrijkhrdedk4cll65mkfrca-1024x6531768830356.jpeg?h=d3eda8cf&itok=9GJWKDbA,N,,2026-01-19 12:00:57.006436

This appropriation marks Congress’s largest federal investment in the Coastal Texas Project since the project’s authorization in 2022, a milestone effort led by U.S. Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14). Funding is finalized once the bill is signed by President Donald J. Trump.

The upper Texas coast is home to more than 7 million people supporting one of the nation’s largest oil, gas, and petrochemical manufacturing hubs and strategic petroleum reserves.

The region is critical to U.S. energy dominance, producing:

32% of the nation’s total refining capacity

60% of the nation’s aviation fuel

42% of the nation’s specialty chemical feedstock

80% of the nation’s military-grade fuel

“This significant federal investment in the Coastal Texas Project is critical to protecting not just our coastline, but the economic engine that powers the nation,” said Commissioner Dawn Buckingham, M.D., Texas General Land Office (GLO). “Texas is home to the largest concentration of oil and gas infrastructure in the United States, and safeguarding our coast from catastrophic storms protects every American. “Thank you to Congressman Randy Weber (TX-14) and the United States Congress for investing in Texas. This is a big step toward safeguarding our country’s economic security.”

This critical funding accelerates pre-construction, engineering, and design while driving federal coordination among the Gulf Coast Protection District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Texas General Land Office (GLO), and regional partners—pushing the nation’s largest coastal protection effort closer to reality.

“This appropriation represents a significant federal commitment to a project that protects infrastructure vital to the entire country and global supply chain. It signals to us that Congress has a strong interest in partnering with the State of Texas to advance a nationally important coastal protection effort,” said Coalter Baker, Executive Director of the Gulf Coast Protection District, the project’s lead non-Federal sponsor. “We appreciate U.S. Rep. Randy Weber’s leadership in this funding milestone and recognize it will take a whole of government effort to continue to advance this project.”

Coastal Texas Project, established by Congress in 2022, carries a total authorized cost of $35 billion, shared between the federal government (65%) and the non-Federal sponsor (35%). To date, the State of Texas has appropriated $950 million to the Gulf Coast Protection District for use toward its projects.

The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.
Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids.

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors.","WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday urged the largest U.S. electric grid to conduct an emergency power auction to protect against rolling blackouts as energy demand from data centers grows faster than the country can build new generation plants.

The Trump administration initiative calls on PJM Interconnection, which serves 67 million customers in 13 states and Washington, D.C., to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

PJM later on Friday unveiled its own plan, which called for big data centers to voluntarily bring their own new generation or face the potential of having their power supply curtailed during peak demand periods. The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.

At a White House event, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum joined several state governors to discuss initiatives to speed the construction of more than $15 billion in new power generation on PJM, which has been criticized for being too slow to build a cushion against rotating blackouts as demand rises.

Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids. President Donald Trump is seeking to combat consumer price inflation that risks undermining support for Republicans ahead of November's midterm elections.

The White House is seeking caps on the amount existing power plants can charge in the PJM capacity market. A recent PJM capacity market auction set record-high prices for power generators that were more than 800% higher than the previous year, increasing electricity prices for homes and businesses.

The agreement would also require data centers to pay for the new generation built on their behalf – whether they show up and use the power or not - rather than buying up existing power. The concept is called BYOG, or ""bring your own generation.""

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. PJM was not invited to the event, a PJM spokesperson told Reuters.

PJM has forecast that the grid's peak usage in the summer will climb by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts over the next 15 years. The record summer peak for PJM was 165 gigawatts in 2006.

Since 2023, PJM says it has processed more than 170 gigawatts of new generation requests. Nearly 60 gigawatts of projects have completed PJM's study process and have either signed or been offered generation interconnection agreements.

RISING POWER BILLS HAVE LED TO BACKLASH

Rising power bills in PJM's region have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid. Last summer, nine state governors wrote an open letter to the PJM board of managers criticizing the grid operator for not doing enough to address an escalating electricity affordability crisis.

""Unfortunately, what we have seen in our region is that PJM has been too damn slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time where energy demand is going up,"" Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at the White House event on Friday.

Burgum said PJM has been lucky so far in avoiding widespread blackouts.

Dominion Energy Inc. can restart construction of a wind project off the coast of Virginia while it continues a legal fight over the Trump administration’s order to stop the US$11 billion development, a federal judge ruled.

United States District Judge Jamar Walker in Norfolk, Virginia, issued a preliminary injunction Friday. It blocks the government from enforcing its stop-work order after Dominion claimed it was suffering irreparable harm and losing millions of dollars every day the project sits idle. Walker is the third federal judge this week to allow a halted wind development to resume construction.

The Virginia unit of Dominion Energy is among several companies suing the U.S. Department of the Interior over a Dec. 22 order suspending five East Coast wind projects for 90 days over unspecified national security concerns. But the developers sued, with some winning temporary reprieves. Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled Norway’s Orsted A/S can resume development of its project off Rhode Island while its lawsuit proceeds and a different judge issued a similar ruling for Equinor ASA’s Empire Wind project near New York.

The Virginia judge echoed concerns expressed in the other cases. Walker, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, said the government had failed to demonstrate that the “national security risk is so imminent” that the Dominion project should be halted. He added that department’s order was likely arbitrary and capricious and that further delays would cause irreparable harm to the company.

The White House didn’t immediately comment on the decision.

Dominion shares rose 0.6 per cent after the ruling to touch an intraday high of US$61.50.

President Donald Trump has sought to aggressively thwart the growth of the industry as he rolls back Biden-era climate policies and champions fossil fuels. This latest move also comes after Trump froze permitting for all wind projects on federal land and oceans on his first day back in office, though a federal judge ruled that his decree was illegal.

The U.S. offshore wind industry has faced other difficulties, including soaring inflation and supply chain snarls in recent years. And even after some of those problems subsided, developers have since been hit by rising costs from Trump’s tariffs. All told, that’s led to project cancellations, delays and writedowns.

Dominion said in court papers that it is losing about US$5 million a day on vessel contracts alone because of the construction halt, with more costs from idled workers and contractual penalties. The company says more than two-thirds of the expected US$11.2 billion total cost has already been spent on the Virginia project, which was expected to be completed this year and provide power for 660,000 homes.

Alternative investment firm Stonepeak Partners acquired a 50 per cent stake in the wind project in 2024 and has agreed to fund 50 per cent of project costs up to US$11.3 billion, with additional sharing of costs in excess of that amount. According to analysts at Jefferies Financial Group Inc., Dominion and Stonepeak are sharing about US$225 million in monthly costs associated with the stop-work order.

Dominion said in a statement last month that the project is “essential for American national security and meeting Virginia’s dramatically growing energy needs.” That includes electricity for the “world’s largest concentration of data centres” and many federal government and military facilities, including the Pentagon, attorneys for the company wrote in court records.

In a court filing, the operator of the 13-state power grid that includes Virginia said the Dominion project is important to meeting the rapidly increasing electricity demand and that further delay will cause “irreparable harm” to the 67 million people who live in the region.

The U.S. government has argued the move to pause construction was valid because it was done for national security reasons. The stop-work order adequately explained that the Department of Defense provided new classified information about advances in “adversary technologies” that “could raise national security issues with offshore wind projects,” government lawyers said in a December court filing.

Attorneys for Dominion contend in court papers the agency’s reasons for the pause weren’t “plausible” because national security considerations were already addressed during the permitting process. They also claimed the government infringed on Dominion’s constitutional due process rights by failing to give notice and an opportunity for a hearing before issuing the order.

There’s a lot of reasons to buy a new car, but what are some of the indicators that it is time to change over to an electric vehicle (EV) rather than buying a traditional gas-fueled car? Turns out, there are plenty of clues, most of which include how much money you are spending at the shop and how many miles you are racking up on the road.

Here are five key signs switching to an EV will save you money.

Amount of Driving

When considering whether or not to switch to an EV, the first thing to consider is how much you drive, according to Justin Fischer, EV automotive analyst and expert at CarEdge.

“The more you drive, the more you can save with an EV,” Fischer said. “This is especially true for urban commuters, who stand to benefit from greater fuel savings in stop-and-go traffic. For drivers who either spend excessive time in traffic, or drive at least 10,000 miles per year, an EV will save you much more money, making it more likely that the math will work out in your favor.”

Charging Locations

Fischer highlighted that another key consideration is where you’ll be charging your electric vehicle.

“If you’ll be able to charge at home or work, it’s very likely that you’ll save money with an EV,” Fischer explained, adding that public fast charging is expensive, with prices ranging from 35 cents per kiloWatt-hour (kWh) to north of 65 cents per kWh. “Per mile driven, public charging is often more expensive than gas, depending on your local gas prices.”

Maintenance Costs

If your car is prone to needing repairs and costly maintenance, an EV’s maintenance costs provide even more savings, according to Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing at CFR Classic.

“Over three years, an owner could save between $500 to $700 by not having to pay for oil changes, transmission servicing and exhaust repairs,” Giranda explained. “EVs stay longer on the road with fewer maintenance requirements, fewer moving parts, and the absence of a combustion engine.”

Societal Benefits

Government incentives and rebates can lower the upfront cost of EVs pointed out Rei Vardi, CEO and founder of Eon, sustainability-focused platform for EV car-sharing and rental space

“Consumers are also increasingly motivated by sustainability, and driving electric is one of the most impactful choices for reducing personal carbon emissions,” Vardi added.

Flexible Usage

Even with shifting incentives and rising costs, Vardi noted that many drivers are realizing that owning a car outright isn’t the only way to drive electric.

“Renting (or subscribing, through a service like Eon) removes the long-term financial risk of battery depreciation, tariffs or maintenance surprises,” Vardi explained. “People can experience all the benefits and cost-savings of EV driving without locking themselves into a purchase during an uncertain market. Flexibility is becoming its own form of savings.”",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/all-electric-vehicle-charging-station-shutterstock_548313280.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:59:02.552714

The legislation, which passed the House of Representatives the previous week by a vote of 397 to 28, provides $38.6 billion in targeted discretionary spending, including $8.8 billion for the EPA. It now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

The bill retains level funding for EPA’s major drinking water infrastructure programs, rejecting the 90 percent cuts to the State Revolving Fund programs proposed by President Trump last year. The final compromise bill wraps FY26 funding for EPA and its water infrastructure programs up in a package with appropriations for the Army Corps of Engineers and several other departments. EPA’s overall funding for FY26 is $320 million below FY25, but $4.7 billion above what President Trump sought for the agency. EPA’s core water infrastructure programs are maintained at FY25 levels, including:

The Drinking Water SRF, at $1.126 billion;

The Clean Water SRF, at $1.639 billion;

The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan program, at $64.6 million, plus an additional $7.6 million to support EPA’s administration of the program;

The Midsize and Large Drinking Water System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability program, at $2.25 million; and

Reducing Lead in Drinking Water grants, at $22 million.

Of the $2.76 billion in SRF funds appropriated through the measure, just over $1.6 billion would be distributed to 1,163 individual project earmarks requested by members of Congress.

Lawmakers’ compromise on EPA and water infrastructure funding comes after months of pushback by AMWA to Trump Administration proposals to slash key programs, like the SRFs and WIFIA. Over the past few months, AMWA collaborated with other stakeholders on outreach to Congress to urge strong funding for these critical programs.

In addition to the regular FY26 SRF funding included in the bill, EPA will also receive the last installment of supplemental water infrastructure funding provided by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This includes an additional $2.34 billion, evenly divided between the Drinking Water and Clean Water SRFs, plus another $2.875 billion through the DWSRF for lead service line replacement efforts.

Final Strategic Policy for Hydrogen The published policy encourages investment in the production and deployment of hydrogen where: The hydrogen production process meets the requirements of the UK Government Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (LCHS).","I am pleased that today we are publishing our hydrogen policy.

Wales is rich in renewable energy resources which provides a tremendous opportunity for low carbon hydrogen production. The Welsh Government is committed to ensuring hydrogen is deployed safely and effectively, making the best use of the technology to deliver decarbonisation and economic benefit for Wales.

Following a public consultation which ended in May 2025, we have taken time to consider fully the consultation responses, the advice of the Climate Change Committee on Wales’ Fourth Carbon Budget, and the UK Government Spending Review and Modern Industrial Strategy. We have also considered how this policy will align with the recently published Welsh Government strategic Carbon Capture and Storage policy.

The hydrogen policy we publish today highlights the strategic importance of hydrogen infrastructure to decarbonisation and sustainable economic growth in Wales. The policy aligns with UK Government hydrogen business models and support mechanisms, providing the best opportunity for Welsh developers to successfully access Hydrogen Allocation Rounds, while also reflecting a clear commitment to our well-being objectives.

Designing our hydrogen policy

Our vision for the future of industry and energy generation is one in which sustainable industries are retained in Wales, and continue to generate high-quality jobs and careers, and other benefits for the communities in which they operate. Wales is proud of its industrial base, and we must encourage the investment necessary to support a transition to a decarbonised, sustainable future.

Guided by the advice and views of the Climate Change Committee, Net Zero Industry Wales, UK Government regulatory groups, and our industrial, academic and public stakeholders, we are taking bold steps to support industry in decarbonising, as set out in Net Zero Wales, our strategic plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The Welsh Government recognises the importance of hydrogen for decarbonisation, particularly for sectors that are hard to electrify, such as heavy industry and certain transport applications. We also recognise the significant economic opportunities the technology can deliver for industry, business and citizens in Wales. Hydrogen projects will create jobs and careers during construction, operation and maintenance, as well as safeguarding jobs in other sectors and providing wider supply chain opportunities.

Consultation Details and Outcomes

The consultation received sixty-two responses representing a broad cross-section from industry, academia, government bodies, trade organisations and individuals, and I would like to thank those who responded.

Many respondents used the consultation to stress how important hydrogen is for decarbonising industry and energy, in particular for sectors that are challenging to electrify. Most respondents supported aligning the policy with the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard, and the requirement for hydrogen to make a clear and sustainable contribution to decarbonisation and building a stronger, greener economy that avoids de-industrialisation.

Some responses questioned how the energy hierarchy within Planning Policy Wales would apply to the specific nature of hydrogen developments. The role of the hierarchy is to guide energy investment towards reduced energy use, efficiency gains and renewable energy. Hydrogen has a strategic role in achieving these aims, and we are committed to producing additional guidance that will clarify how hydrogen aligns with the energy hierarchy.

Final Strategic Policy for Hydrogen

The published policy encourages investment in the production and deployment of hydrogen where:

The hydrogen production process meets the requirements of the UK Government Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (LCHS).

Where hydrogen makes a clear, measurable and sustained contribution to meeting decarbonisation targets and objectives.

Where hydrogen production does not contribute to unsustainable levels of fossil fuel use or impede our transition to net-zero.

Where hydrogen contributes to growing a sustainable economy.

The consideration of a development’s emissions intensity, rather than prescribing favoured technologies, provides developers with the broadest possible scope to devise innovative approaches to sector and site-specific challenges. The policy also provides additional clarity and a solid foundation from which we will continue to work with the UK Government, regulators and developers to help deliver both Welsh and UK net-zero ambitions.

Our finalised strategic policy position for hydrogen will sit alongside our evolving policy framework, designed to avoid the extraction and use of fossil fuels, provide alternatives for fuel switching, and managing those emissions that cannot be avoided.",https://www.gov.wales//themes/custom/govwales/images/content/og-global-1200.png,N,,2026-01-19 12:00:00.496694

The UK’s Policy Commission on Gigafactories will say in a Wednesday report that the UK needs to recalibrate the interim EV goals to 2030, Lord John Hutton, who launched the commission last year, told the Financial Times.

The Commission, launched in the middle of 2025, aimed to produce recommendations on how the UK can scale up its battery manufacturing capacity – a critical requirement to achieving net zero, generating economic growth, and securing high-quality green jobs.

Currently, the UK’s zero emission vehicle mandate is 80% of new cars sold in 2030 to be electric vehicles. This share should rise to 100% by 2035.

The UK doesn’t plan to revisit the 2035 end-date for sale of new gasoline and diesel passenger cars.

But the Policy Commission on Gigafactories will recommend that the government ease the 2030 interim target to 50-60% from 80% and reduce fines for carmakers in case of non-compliance. This, the commission reckons, will encourage investment in the UK’s battery supply chain.

“There is growing consensus in industry that there’s a need for a course redirection here. It’s not scrap everything, but recalibrate,” Lord Hutton, a former Labour Defence Secretary, told FT.

“Regulatory interventions have to be evidence based, not ideologically based,” Lord Hutton added.

Auto makers in the UK and Europe have been suffering in recent years from the U.S. tariffs, the Chinese curbs on rare earth exports, falling demand, and competition from the cheaper vehicles made in China.

At the end of last year, intense lobbying from Germany and Italy, and the auto industry, resulted in the European Commission proposing the easing of the de facto EU ban on new sales of combustion-engine cars from 2035.

These were also the regions with the largest growth in electricity demand.
According to the energy think tank, this means that solar met rising demand, but did not displace existing generation.
Ember’s Chief Analyst, Dave Jones, believes that solar has the potential to meet all the rise in electricity demand.
Solar growth already met 61% of electricity demand growth in 2025 and there’s nothing to stop it meeting 100%.","The US witnessed a 135 TWh rise in electricity demand in 2025, a 3.1% year-on-year (YoY) increase, of which 61% was met by solar energy generation, covering all the rise in daytime electricity demand between 10:00 and 18:00 ET, says Ember in a new report.

Weather did not play a role here, since the country’s insolation remained unchanged in 2025 compared to 2024, it adds.

Thanks to battery storage, solar also met some of the rising electricity demand in the evening hours from 18:00 to 10:00 ET, the report says, analyzing year-end data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

“The rise of batteries in the US is changing solar from cheap daytime electricity to dispatchable all-day electricity,” notes Ember. “In the last six years, California’s utility solar and battery generation has risen by 58%, yet generation at the sunniest hour of the day has risen by just 8%.”

Most of the solar power is still concentrated in a small number of US states. In the past year, 37 states got less than 10% of their electricity from solar, even though solar is growing fast in some places.

Solar electricity generation in the US rose by 83 TWh or 27% in 2025, with the largest increases in Texas, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic, meeting 81%, 81%, and 33% of electricity demand growth in these regions, respectively. These were also the regions with the largest growth in electricity demand. According to the energy think tank, this means that solar met rising demand, but did not displace existing generation.

Ember points out that the US has yet to see a ‘duck curve’ problem, which means that non-solar power demand is higher during the day than at night, so solar has not yet caused major oversupply during daylight hours. Even at the sunniest hour, solar provided only 20% of US electricity generation on average across the year, the report reads.

Ember’s Chief Analyst, Dave Jones, believes that solar has the potential to meet all the rise in electricity demand.

“Solar in the US is only just beginning. Solar can meet fast-growing electricity demand. Solar growth already met 61% of electricity demand growth in 2025 and there’s nothing to stop it meeting 100%. With the prospect of solar becoming so cheap, solar can also play an important role in reducing coal and gas use rapidly and economically,” according to the report.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2026-01-19%2Fc8rwvt0o%2FPresentation2.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-19 09:59:59.316129

Meanwhile, Tesla can still exit if the material doesn’t meet technical specs by February 9, keeping pressure on Vidalia’s ramp-up and the project’s funding story.

Why should I care?

For markets: Execution risk beats the reshoring story.

US-made battery inputs sound great, but quality and timing are what move stocks. Syrah fell even as a broader mining sub-index rose, a sign investors see this as company-specific risk rather than a commodity swing. Tesla is also Vidalia’s credibility anchor, so every delay supports hope of future revenue but extends uncertainty over volumes, margins, and financing.

The bigger picture: Building non-China battery supply chains takes time.

China still dominates anode processing, so Vidalia is meant to be a rare large-scale alternative. That also means it has to prove it can hit top automaker specs reliably and at scale – which is harder than signing an offtake agreement.

But while demand for AI systems continues, investment confidence is beginning to rebalance.
By contrast, 54% of respondents consider energy providers to be a stronger opportunity and 37% say energy infrastructure offers a better outlook than the big tech sector.
Energy demand takes centre stage As AI systems scale up, they bring increased attention to power consumption.
Data centres operate around the clock and require continuous cooling and server performance, making electricity providers and grid operators key players in the AI investment story.","Artificial intelligence remains central to investment portfolios, but the momentum that drove tech giants throughout 2025 is beginning to spread across a wider ecosystem.

Financial institutions are beginning to rethink where AI growth offers the best return – and the spotlight is now falling on energy providers, grid infrastructure and long-term power planning.

The shift in strategy is outlined in BlackRock’s latest Investment Directions report, which involved interviewing more than 700 of its EMEA clients.

Investors cool on big tech in 2026

AI captured a flood of investment in 2025 as companies like Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI ramped up development of language models (LLMs), cloud infrastructure and foundation model platforms.

But while demand for AI systems continues, investment confidence is beginning to rebalance.

""It's increasingly important to risk-manage megacap and AI exposure while also capturing differentiated upside opportunities,"" says Ibrahim Kanan, BlackRock's Head of Core US Equity.

Just a fifth of those polled by BlackRock say large US technology firms remain a compelling investment for the coming year. By contrast, 54% of respondents consider energy providers to be a stronger opportunity and 37% say energy infrastructure offers a better outlook than the big tech sector.

The data suggests investors are reacting to how AI systems are being built and scaled, with the cost of developing infrastructure remaining high. Consulting leader Gartner estimates that capital expenditure on AI hit US$1.5tn in 2025 – a worrying figure for investors concerned about concentration risk and uncertain returns, particularly when higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive.

There is also growing scrutiny of data centre profitability. Power bills keep rising and with that comes further pressure to identify sustainable, long-term value. BlackRock’s clients are looking beyond platforms and model providers to the utilities and infrastructure firms that supply the backbone of AI deployment.

Energy demand takes centre stage

As AI systems scale up, they bring increased attention to power consumption. Data centres operate around the clock and require continuous cooling and server performance, making electricity providers and grid operators key players in the AI investment story.

BlackRock asserts that this is far from a passing trend. Its research suggests AI has become a “structural component of global power consumption” rather than a short-term spike.

Energy providers are, therefore, in a favourable position. These firms not only provide a path to reduce the carbon footprint of AI growth but also offer a hedge against price volatility and long-term emissions risk.

Large technology companies and infrastructure developers are signing clean energy deals to secure future supplies and to manage emissions targets. These agreements stretch years ahead and underline how energy access becomes a core part of AI planning.

Investors see the same opportunity. As data centre demand expands, it puts pressure on national grids, transmission systems and storage capacity. Building new capacity now takes precedence over backing another large-language model.

Infrastructure builds underpin AI expansion

The focus for 2026 has already shifted to physical infrastructure.

Without investment in the grid, AI’s growth risks hitting a ceiling. Energy storage systems, transmission upgrades and modernised distribution networks are seen as vital to maintain expansion. In many areas, delays in permitting and planning slow the rollout of data centre infrastructure.

BlackRock, Microsoft and NVIDIA have jointly committed to a US$100bn programme to boost both AI data centres and surrounding energy networks, indicating industry recognition of the need to fix bottlenecks before power supply becomes a limiting factor.

However, this phase also brings short-term costs. Building new data centres and transmission networks involves high-emissions materials including steel and cement, as well as energy-intensive manufacturing. That raises further questions about the timing gap between upfront investment and eventual productivity gains.

Despite the concerns, interest in AI remains high. Just 7% of BlackRock’s respondents believe AI is a bubble, indicating that investors continue to believe in its long-term promise.

What's changing is how that promise is funded. Whereas early-stage AI development attracted money towards platform builders and model designers, 2026 marks a pivot towards companies that supply and sustain the ecosystem AI requires to function at scale. Grid stability, clean energy and private infrastructure projects are attracting the capital that once went into software.

Private markets are expected to take on a bigger role, funding efficiency upgrades and grid improvements that fall outside traditional equity investments.

Ultimately, BlackRock’s research indicates a shift in understanding, rather than a loss of faith in AI. Investors are approaching it as a wide-reaching investment theme that extends to the machines, cables and kilowatts powering digital transformation.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/535339b19a5aed53c5a2d4fb45e68356:07dd00fdf67275043609935075a7c749/gettyimages-1446334594.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:33.446776

But environmentalists said the programme will have limited climate benefits because it includes many plug-in hybrids.

Households with a taxable income below 80,000 euros can benefit from the new programme, with additional allowances for households with children. Low-income families with several children can receive up to 6,000 euros when they buy a fully battery-electric car.

The country’s coalition government of chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) had earlier agreed to spend three billion euros on supporting electric mobility adoption among low- and middle-income groups. SPD environment minister Carsten Schneider said he expected that around 800,000 car purchases would benefit from the scheme over a period of three to four years.

Following the abrupt end of an earlier purchasing subsidy in late 2023, sales of electric cars initially collapsed, but have since recovered. Following the 2024 dip, registrations of fully electric cars rose by more than 40 percent in the past year. But sales lag well behind earlier government plans to bring the number of EVs on the road to 15 million by 2030. The number of fully electric cars has just crossed 2 million.

The high average price of new electric vehicles remains a major obstacle to their mass adoption because it often limits purchases to drivers with higher incomes.

NGO Transport & Environment said the new programme “doesn’t fit the population or the climate”. It criticised that income thresholds were much too high and that the programme didn’t include used cars, given that few low-income households ever buy new models.

The NGO added that it didn’t make sense to promote plug-in hybrids because they emit almost as much CO2 as conventional cars in real-world operation. Greenpeace also said that “promoting bulky SUVs and climate-damaging plug-in hybrids is misguided, both socially and in terms of climate policy.”

Environment minister Schneider said during a press conference that support for plug-in hybrids “would not have been the first priority” for his ministry, but was a compromise with a view to saving jobs in the car industry.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2026-01-19 07:58:38.760538

Now, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.
Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included ‍Volvo and Polestar, which are both owned by China’s automaking group Geely.
“The beneficiaries are likely ‍to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian ‍customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,” Fiorani said.
The former Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024 too, all but blocking such exports to the United States.","BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) – Tesla is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada’s move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established Canadian sales network, experts say.

Under the deal announced last Friday, Canada ‍will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.

However, under one clause in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.

While many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, ‌its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of ‌its Model Y.

The U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.

But it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing a wish to ​counter what they called China’s intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.

Now, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.

“This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather ‍quickly,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Tesla has ​an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD and ​Nio do not yet have a sales presence there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it ‍only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.

“Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,” said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.

Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included ‍Volvo and Polestar, which are both owned by China’s automaking group Geely.

Volvo and Polestar also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHINESE EV BRANDS

However, the clause on price will likely give Chinese brands some breathing room.

“The beneficiaries are likely ‍to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian ‍customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,” Fiorani said.

John Zeng, head of market forecast for China ​at London-based consultancy GlobalData, said that the quota also would likely offer Chinese carmakers an ​opportunity to ⁠test the waters in Canada where there’s a large population of Chinese Canadians.

Canada wants ‌to look at joint ventures and investments with Chinese companies within the next three years to build a Canadian electric vehicle with Chinese knowledge, the public broadcaster CBC reported, citing a senior Canadian official.

China’s top EV maker BYD currently has an electric bus assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.

Trump administration officials have criticized Canada’s decision. The former Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024 too, all but blocking such exports to the United States.

In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.
“It’s not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,” Baker-White said.
“If we’re honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,” said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker.","This article first appeared on KFF Health News.

When one of Adam Burkhammer’s foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.

“We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,” said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. “There are real impacts on real kids.”

The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.

The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans — and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program — created last year as part of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas — offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.

Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water and PFAS, a group of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.

As Republicans spar over IVF, some turn to obscure MAHA-backed alternative

In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.

Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden’s term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.

Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.

“We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,” said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.

This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.

“The state laws are really what’s motivating companies to get rid of dyes,” said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.

Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California’s 2023 law, which bans four food additives.

“It’s not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,” Baker-White said.

State lawmakers embrace RFK Jr.’s health policies

Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — SNAP or food stamps — from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.

There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.

“There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,” Baker-White said.

In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It’s a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling “harmful and addictive” products. The lawsuit names specific brands — including cereals, pizzas, sodas and potato chips — linking them to serious health problems.

Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don’t agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven’t focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans’ championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.

Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.

Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.

“If we’re honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,” said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. “We’re going to step up as states and do the right thing.”",https://stateline.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/candy-dye.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 09:59:39.087260

The concerns focus on draft legislation UC84, which would change the rules for connecting renewable energy projects to the power grid. The Polish Photovoltaic and Energy Storage Association (known as Polskie Stowarzyszenie Fotowoltaiki i Magazynowania Energii or PSFiME) argues that the proposal introduces upfront financial requirements. While financial requirements are typical in battery energy storage projects, the approach is considered to be incompatible with standard project development and financing models given a non-refundable model.

In an interview with Onet.pl, PSFiME president Ewa Magiera said the draft law would shift the entire financial burden of grid capacity planning onto investors.

“The proposed mechanism carries financial risk for applicants seeking grid connection, which can only be limited by obtaining confidential information about the state of the grid from system operator employees,” she said.

Under UC84, developers would be required to pay an advance of $16.5( PLN 60) per kilowatt toward grid connection fees. The draft also introduces a new financial security of $8.75/kW for the first 100 MW of capacity and $16.5/kW above that threshold. In addition, and the most controversial, is the application of a non-refundable application fee of PLN 1/kW, capped at $27,520 (PLN 100,000).

Magiera said the scale of the changes would require immediate capital commitments well before projects reach construction readiness. “The scale of these changes means the need to engage capital of between PLN 8.9 billion and PLN 13.3 billion [$USD 2.46 billion USD $3.67 billion] immediately,” she said, adding that developers have already paid significant connection advances.

“In practice, only entities with easy access to large-scale financing, state-owned companies and large foreign corporations, will be able to meet these requirements,” said Magiera.

According to data from Poland’s transmission system operator, more than 145 GW of projects, excluding offshore wind, currently hold grid connection conditions, with around 70% controlled by private renewable energy investors.

“Project UC84 ignores how renewable investments are actually developed in Europe,” Magiera said. “No one reserves billions of zloty ‘just in case’ at the very start of the process.”

Strengthening India’s renewable energy capabilities with locally manufactured, advanced technologies

ABB announced today the dispatch of its first wind power converter in India after the acquisition of Gamesa Electric’s power electronics business in December 2025. Manufactured and shipped from the state-of-the-art Nelamangala facility in Bengaluru, India, this milestone delivery to a wind turbine OEM reaffirms ABB's expanded commitment to the renewable energy and wind power sectors, both in India and globally.

The dispatch represents a significant step in integrating Gamesa Electric’s power electronics proven wind energy conversion technologies into ABB’s portfolio. Aligned with the vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and the country’s push for ‘Make in India’, ABB is solidifying its Indian footprint in the renewable energy sector with a strengthened focus on wind power, supported by a broader portfolio spanning utility-scale solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS).

“Wind energy plays a critical role in the energy transition. By delivering advanced power conversion technologies that are locally manufactured in India and engineered for effective grid integration, we are strengthening the integration of wind power into the grid and supporting the scale-up of renewable energy worldwide,"" said Anoop Anand, President – Motion High Power Division, ABB India Ltd.""This also reinforces India’s position as a global hub for renewable energy manufacturing and deployment,” added Anoop.

India is rapidly consolidating its position as a global renewable energy manufacturing and deployment hub, with wind power at the heart of this transformation. Now as the world’s 3rd largest wind manufacturing bases, India is expected to meet around 10 percent of global wind demand and scale installed wind capacity to 107 GW by 2030, underscoring its growing importance in the global renewable energy ecosystem.

ABB has played a key role in advancing renewable energy globally for over 15 years, delivering more than 60,000 wind converters and generators worldwide. Building on this legacy, the acquisition significantly strengthens ABB’s renewable power conversion capabilities, enabling the company to offer comprehensive, utility-scale solutions across wind, solar, and battery energy storage, while expanding its serviceable installed base of wind converters by approximately 46 gigawatts. This ABB global figure is equivalent to nearly one-fifth of India’s current installed renewable energy capacity.

With deep expertise in power electronics and grid integration, ABB is well positioned to support India’s next phase of renewable energy growth, where grid reliability, compliance with evolving regulations, and local manufacturing are increasingly important. ABB India’s comprehensive renewable portfolio spans utility-scale solar inverters, power conversion systems (PCS) for battery energy storage systems (BESS), and converters for wind power, all manufactured locally to support India’s integrated renewable energy vision and contribute to the country’s target of 500 GW renewable energy by 2030.

Consequently, battery waste is also projected to exceed 128 GWh (59 GWh from EVs) by 2030. However, the amount of EV batteries being recycled is unclear, with reports suggesting that less than 1% of spent EVs are formally recycled.

One thing is certain: without a strong framework for a circular economy for batteries, there will be a huge quantity of waste to handle, along with a loss of resources. The very transition meant to decarbonise transport could generate new environmental vulnerabilities.

India’s Recycling Readiness

The country's installed recycling capacity may be more than 50,000 tonnes annually, but utilised capacity remains 20 to 25% of capacity. While there is much policy focus on EV adoption, the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 (BWMR), solely guide the end-of-life management of waste batteries. The BWMR (2022) introduced the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mechanism, mandating producers to ensure recycling or refurbishing.

However, informal recycling operations still dominate the industry. Refurbishing does not have clear enough guidelines, and certifications are also pending, but much of the volumes of end of life batteries may be heading towards refurbishing. The International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 warns that emerging economies like India risk linear transitions, meaning adoption may outpace circular readiness unless it is backed by an integrated fiscal and industrial strategy.

The Ministry of Mines recently released a landmark scheme that aims to subsidise battery material recovery from secondary sources and support recycling. The scheme’s implementation and results will be visible over the next couple of years.

Bottlenecks For Recycling

India’s recycling landscape mostly consists of pre-processors, who extract black mass (an intermediate material achieved post mechanical separation of battery materials) instead of full recycling capabilities, i.e. producers of recovered materials, for use in manufacturing. Domestic expertise in advanced recycling and refining remains nascent.

Recycling needs proper channels to direct waste and efficient collection systems. Even though the BWMR mandates collection, there are no dedicated take-back outlets, and OEMS/ small battery sellers must arrange collection individually. India’s dealership and service networks remain fragmented, and only a small percentage of used EVs re-enter formal recycling streams.

Economic factors often impact recycling. Lithium and cobalt imports are still preferred due to the unavailability of large-scale refined output of recyclers, as only a handful of recyclers have refining capabilities, and even fewer are able to do it at scale.

Due to recycling’s high processing cost (especially with hydrometallurgy), it is not always ideal for recyclers to produce refined materials, as the price of the refined materials is market dependent and margins are not guaranteed if processing costs are too high. While import duties on virgin lithium/cobalt incentivise recycling, inadequate scale hampers viability.

In China, for example, recyclers often lose money but absorb the cost for strategic resource security. In India, without subsidies or assured off-take of recovered materials, business models struggle. Hence, some forms of fiscal equalisation measures are needed in the industry.

How Budget 2026 Can Help

India can draw valuable lessons from mature markets like the EU’s Battery Regulation 2023, which mandates a digital battery passport that tracks lifecycle data and sets recovery benchmarks for critical minerals, minimum levels of recycled content in new materials. In China, there is an integrated government-industry data platform that ensures that automakers are partnered with approved recyclers before even selling their cars. Recycling firms receive performance-linked subsidies. The United States has a funding centre for R&D and incentivises domestic recyclers.

India’s Union Budget could also explore tax credits for manufacturers meeting recycling targets or using recycled materials, green infra bonds to finance recycling clusters. They could also consider output subsidies for recovered material.

Other policy and governance mechanisms could help as well, such as a Centre of Excellence for Battery Recycling, which would be a great potential government action that can localise advanced recycling tech.

Recycling Infra Must Also Accelerate

India’s electric mobility is at a crossroads. The EV adoption has accelerated, and so must recycling infrastructure. With a corrective policy, India stands to gain environmentally and economically with an aligned recycling policy.

Budget 2026 offers a decisive window. By integrating the Ministry of Mines’ recycling incentives, expanding fiscal tools, and fostering R&D collaboration, India can build a true circular battery economy, one that safeguards both sustainability and sovereignty.

Jobs are rising fast in solar installation, grid construction, EV manufacturing, battery production and heat pump deployment.

In China, close to 40% of all vehicle manufacturing jobs are now linked to electric vehicles and batteries.

The shift is also rippling across heavy industry, with clean power and electrification reshaping steel, chemicals and cement.

Emerging economies are capturing the biggest gains as clean energy supply chains scale at speed.

India, Indonesia and the Middle East are seeing some of the fastest energy job growth globally.

Advanced economies are still adding workers but at a far slower rate.

The IEA says skills shortages are now one of the biggest risks to maintaining momentum.

Electricians, engineers and technicians are already in short supply across multiple markets. Without rapid training and reskilling, labour constraints could slow grid buildout and clean energy deployment.

Below is an overview of several key changes.

Changes Impacting an Entity's Repeat Violator Status

One line item in TCEQ's penalty calculation worksheet is a multiplier for ""repeat violators."" Previously, this multiplier was reserved for entities with prior major violations of the same nature and same environmental media that occurred during the five-year compliance period. The new rule now includes minor and moderate violations.

The new points-based system for determining repeat violator status issues ""repeat violation points"" for each violation of the same nature and same environmental media documented in any final enforcement orders, court judgments, or criminal convictions that occurred at least three times during the five-year compliance history period. Further, each unauthorized discharge will be counted separately, thereby reducing the potential benefit of merging separate violations into a single enforcement action.

The agency received public comment from environmental groups on this change. Commenters noted that while the agency is considering minor and moderate violations, as required by the Sunset Bill, the requirement for a facility to have three enforcement orders to be considered a repeat violator undercuts the agency's directive to take into account repeat violations. During the January 14, 2026 hearing, the Commissioners expressed in response that the rule changes required ""threading the needle"" and they were proud of all of the hard work put in by agency staff.

More Predictable Compliance Period

The TCEQ has adopted a more practical way to calculate the relevant five-year compliance period it uses in calculating penalties during enforcement. A facility's compliance period looks back across a five-year period. This hasn't changed. However, while the prior rule considered the five years prior to the date the agency mailed an enforcement settlement offer or petition to the entity (which could be years after the initial investigation), the revised rule will change the relevant compliance period to five years prior to the date of an initial enforcement screening. This change has several effects.

First, the date of the initial enforcement screening more accurately reflects a facility's compliance at that point in time. The back and forth that may occur with the agency before a settlement offer is mailed can span months or years. Changing this trigger date better supports the agency's goal of having a facility come into compliance as a result of its enforcement efforts and facilities will not face a protracted compliance period due to factors beyond its control.

Additionally, regulated entities who respond to enforcement by implementing changes at the facility to come into compliance will be able to move toward a cleaner compliance history on a shorter timeframe. Already facing a five year look back, entities need to maintain compliance for years before accomplishing a clean record. The more predictable and earlier trigger date will allow the entities that have implemented lasting changes to develop a cleaner record, sooner.

With these rule changes, the TCEQ will also increase its frequency of reviewing compliance histories, with review to take place twice a year, rather than annually. This can give regulated entities a six-month advantage to accomplishing a clean compliance history.

Closing Thoughts and Evaluating Impacts to Your Facility

Companies with operations in Texas should review the final rule, once published; alert their compliance and environmental personnel of this rule change; access their compliance history through the agency's new Advance Review of Compliance History (""ARCH"") database; and plan for potential financial impacts the changes may have on penalty calculations.

While the above summary touches on several key changes, the amendments include additional changes that impact regulated entities. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these changes in more detail, should this notice raise any questions.

The recent decision by Ford Motor Co. and South Korea’s SK Innovation Co. to dissolve their American battery manufacturing partnership signals a significant shift in the automotive supply chain landscape. Instead of jointly operating their U.S. facilities, each company will now independently own and run specific plants, marking a strategic separation of their previously shared battery production efforts.

The New Operational Landscape for Battery Plants

Under the new arrangement, SK Innovation will take charge of the BlueOval SK plant in Tennessee, a facility central to the battery cell production for electric vehicles. Meanwhile, Ford will independently manage the factory situated in Kentucky, maintaining its stake in battery manufacturing but under solitary control rather than partnership.

Why This Matters — From Manufacturing to Logistics

This reorganization isn’t just about ownership; it reverberates through the wider supply chain and logistics sectors. With each party steering their operations solo, decisions on shipment routes, inventory management, and supplier relationships might adapt to best suit individual priorities. This could lead to increased efficiency on one hand, but also possibly more complexity when coordinating alongside other supply chain components.

Implications for Supply Chain and Freight Management

Battery production plants are high-stakes operations involving substantial freight and logistics management. Moving raw materials into the factories, dispatching finished battery packs, and synchronizing delivery schedules with automotive assembly plants requires a finely tuned logistical framework. With Ford and SK Innovation opting to control separate plants outright, the coordination of freight transport and distribution logistics will likely undergo adjustments tailored to each company’s objectives.

From a logistics perspective, this separation presents both challenges and opportunities:

Streamlined Decision-Making: Each company can optimize supply routes and inventory handling without negotiating joint decisions.

Customized Freight Solutions: Tailored transport agreements can enhance delivery reliability and cost management.

Potential for Redundancy: Redundant logistics efforts may arise if coordination between plants and supply chain nodes diminishes.

Plant Location Control Main Focus Impact on Logistics Tennessee (BlueOval SK plant) SK Innovation Battery cell production Focused freight routes and inbound materials tailored to SK’s supply chain Kentucky plant Ford Motor Co. Battery manufacturing Independent logistics planning aligned with Ford’s vehicle assembly supply chains

How This Affects the Electric Vehicle Market

Electric vehicles depend heavily on reliable and efficient battery production. By splitting their venture, both Ford and SK Innovation are positioning themselves to focus on slightly different strategic priorities. This could accelerate their respective abilities to innovate and customize battery technologies tailored explicitly for their customers or partners. However, the fragmented manufacturing may introduce variations in delivery schedules for battery packs and components, which logistics managers in vehicle assembly plants and distribution networks will need to accommodate.

The Road Ahead for Logistics in Electric Vehicle Production

Green energy-focused logistics specialists will find that adapting to these changes is crucial. The evolution of supply chains around battery manufacturing necessitates flexible freight solutions, from handling bulk raw materials to shipping finished goods. The reorganization influences not only local transport but international freight forwarding, especially where components cross borders en route to assembly.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds is to be made available to homeowners who rent their properties to construction workers on the new Sizewell C nuclear plant.

The Government's £12m Housing Grant Scheme was launched to increase the amount of accommodation available to contractors working on the site, near Leiston in Suffolk.

Anyone who owns a property, or has a spare room, annexe, or garage which could be converted to a ""lettable standard"" can apply for funding.

A Freedom of Information request revealed between November 2024 and November 2025, East Suffolk Council - which is delivering the scheme - paid £157,567 in grants and committed to paying grants worth £405,850.

'Mitigating'

The data showed 32 grants had already been paid with 19 new bed spaces ""delivered"".

Inspections take place before the grants are handed over, and again when work is finished - with six completed so far.

""The fund's purpose is to help maintain balance and stability in the local housing market by mitigating the impacts associated with Sizewell C's development,"" a council spokesperson said.

""The grants not only increase housing availability and support the local economy but also improve the energy performance of homes.

""The initiative ensures our communities benefit from the Sizewell C project while improving and maintaining high standards of housing and sustainability.""

Applicants can choose between three different grants: the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) grant, the minor works grant, and the renovation grant.

The EPC grant pays up to £2,500 to certain homeowners to help them improve their property's energy efficiency, while the minor works grant pays up to £3,000 per room.

The renovation grant is worth up to £7,000 per bed space and is designed to help convert properties into licensable standard houses in multiple occupation. (HMOs)

The money is handed over once all works have been completed and properties must remain available to workers for a minimum of five to 10 years, depending on the grant.

Sizewell C - a new £38bn two-reactor nuclear power station - is expected to be operational in the mid to late 2030s.

It will generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity and will reportedly power the equivalent of about six million homes and generate electricity for 60 years.

At the construction's height, the project will require the expertise and labour of 7,900 workers, with about 4,000 coming from the local area.

More than 500 of them can use on-site accommodation at the former Pontins site in Pakefield, which Sizewell C took over last year, while the rest will be using private accommodation.

'Just a nightmare'

Michael Sinclair, from Leiston, is one of the many property owners trying to make the most of the influx of workers.

The 43-year-old, who owns and rents out properties, has just purchased an empty three-bedroom semi-detached house in the town for £235,000.

Providing his applications for £38,000 of grants are approved, he plans to convert it into a four-bedroom home for Sizewell workers.

He then hopes to charge as much as £3,500-a-month for the rental of the entire home and bills – whether there is one worker living in it, or four.

""I live in Leiston and everything's sort of been chucked at us with Sizewell C and it's just a nightmare, this place,"" he said.

""So, I just think I might as well capitalise on it and make the most of it, rather than dwell on it. The grants are there, so it just seems silly not to do it.""

Last year residents told the BBC they feared being priced out of Leiston after the rent on some homes doubled to month than £3,000 a month.

Some people in the town claimed landlords were ""cashing in"" on the increased demand for accommodation.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b7b2/live/20a04af0-3cad-11f0-af00-f94ff1cabcc0.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 04:00:03.259371

Thermal electricity, generated mostly by coal-fired capacity with a small amount from natural gas, fell 1% in 2025 to 6.29 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh), according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

It fell more sharply in December, down by 3.2%, from a year earlier, the data showed.

The data reflects output from industrial enterprises with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan ($2.87 million).

The National Energy Administration announced on Saturday that China's electricity consumption had climbed 5% to a record high, surpassing 10 trillion kWh for the first time.

That was more than the combined consumption of the European Union, Russia, India and Japan in 2024, driven by rapid consumption growth in internet and related services and EV manufacturing.

Tesla equipped its Shanghai plant to export to Canada in 2023

China auto exports stopped after Canada imposed a 100% tariff

China-made cars now face only a 6.1% tariff after US-Canada deal

BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada's move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established Canadian sales network, experts say.

Under the deal announced last Friday, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.

Stay up to date with the latest news, trends and innovations that are driving the global automotive industry with the Reuters Auto File newsletter. Sign up here.

However, under one clause in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.

While many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.

The U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.

But it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.

Now, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.

""This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Tesla has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab and Nio (9866.HK), opens new tab do not yet have a sales presence there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.

""Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo (VOLVb.ST), opens new tab and Polestar, which are both owned by China's automaking group Geely (GEELY.UL).

Volvo and Polestar also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHINESE EV BRANDS

However, the clause on price will likely give Chinese brands some breathing room.

""The beneficiaries are likely to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,"" Fiorani said.

John Zeng, head of market forecast for China at London-based consultancy GlobalData, said that the quota also would likely offer Chinese carmakers an opportunity to test the waters in Canada where there's a large population of Chinese Canadians.

Canada wants to look at joint ventures and investments with Chinese companies within the next three years to build a Canadian electric vehicle with Chinese knowledge, the public broadcaster CBC reported, citing a senior Canadian official.

China's top EV maker BYD currently has an electric bus assembly plant in Ontario, Canada.

Trump administration officials have criticized Canada's decision. The former Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024 too, all but blocking such exports to the United States.

This offers easier entry into the North American market for Beijing's rapidly growing automotive sector.

Chinese manufacturers have been making global inroads with their high-tech, stylish, and affordable EVs. Experts suggest this Canadian access could accelerate their drive to dominate the global market, as their domestic market weakens, threatening other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, observed: ""This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers.""

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

Why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

In remarks at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Toledo, Ohio on Friday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”",https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/16/21/China-Canada-Electric_Vehicles_17882.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2026-01-19 02:57:56.181932

And twice, Indiana took aerial photographs of sellout crowds clad in red — when the Buckeyes came to town.
There’s no question about it.’” Investing in success Perhaps the greatest impediment to success was the perception Indiana wasn’t fully invested in football.
According to the Knight-Newhouse database, Indiana’s football budget has increased from $24 million in 2021 to more than $61 million last year.
Now they’re one win away from a title nobody saw coming, except perhaps Dolson and Cignetti.","Long before Angelo Pizzo penned the scripts for two of America’s most iconic sports movies, he and his father would make the one-block walk from their home to Indiana’s football stadium.

The strolls home usually seemed to take a bit longer because even then, in 1955, losses were the norm. Eventually, the man who introduced the world to such motivational flicks as “Hoosiers” and “Rudy” accepted the reality Indiana’s program may be permanently stuck in mediocrity — or worse.

Pizzo found himself in good company in these parts.

Seventy-one years later, he — like so many other long-suffering Indiana fans — has a new perspective. Suddenly, the Bloomington native is bursting with excitement, enthusiasm, even a sense of disbelief as the Hoosiers have gone 26-2 over the past two seasons and he’s now heading to Miami to watch his beloved alma mater try to pull off a “Hoosiers”-like ending by beating the 10th-ranked Hurricanes on their home field for the program’s first national championship.

“One of my first memories, talk about being in my DNA, was we always lost,” Pizzo told The Associated Press this week. “That’s kind of like, except for a couple blips along the way — certainly the (1968) Rose Bowl team, I was in school there and the boys Jade Butcher, John Isenbarger, Harry Gonso were all good friends of mine — so that was a great adventure. I thought we’d turned the corner and then it went back down. It returned to what was normal and we went back to losing.”

Storybook turnaround

Curt Cignetti promised to change Indiana’s image from the moment he took the job five days after the end of the 2023 season. The no-nonsense 62-year-old coach neither minced words nor wasted them when asked at his first news conference why people should believe he’d end all this losing.

“I win. Google me,” he famously boasted that day.

It was a brash, bold statement from someone tasked with fixing a program that hadn’t won a bowl game since 1991, an outright conference title since 1945 and carried the banner of losingest major college team in the country.

Rather than tamp down the expectations, though, Cignetti doubled down at a basketball game.

“Purdue sucks, but so does Ohio State and Michigan,” Cignetti said to roaring cheers.

Pizzo and other fans were understandably skeptical.

For decades, they’d seen hopeful coaches come promising big turnarounds only to depart when they failed to achieve such lofty goals in front of half-filled stadiums.

How bad was it?

When coach John Pont had the Hoosiers fighting for Big Ten crowns in the 1960s, fans enjoyed chanting “Punt, John, Punt.” In 1976, then-coach Lee Corso called timeout in the second quarter to snap a photo of the scoreboard with Indiana leading Ohio State 7-6. They lost 47-7.

In the 1990s and 2000s, some tailgaters never made it inside the stadium, which prompted coaches to rally students to show up. And twice, Indiana took aerial photographs of sellout crowds clad in red — when the Buckeyes came to town.

On the field, it was equally abysmal.

In addition to the 713 all-time losses Cignetti inherited, the Hoosiers also had lost five of its previous six against dreaded rival Purdue and was 9-18 since 1997 against the Boilermakers. Plus, they had only one win over the Wolverines since 1988 and none over the Buckeyes since 1989 — the longest active skid against one team in the Football Bowl Subdivision.

Athletic director Scott Dolson had a different vision for the program, one Cignetti shared.

“I remember even during our first conversation, I said to him, ‘Curt, do you really believe you can win here?’” Dolson told the AP. “He just said, ‘Scott, if I have average resources, I’m 100% sure I will win here. There’s no question about it.’”

Investing in success

Perhaps the greatest impediment to success was the perception Indiana wasn’t fully invested in football. Salaries for head coaches consistently lagged near the bottom of the Big Ten and each new coach seemed to be fighting to get their assistants paid, too.

The change began when former athletic director Fred Glass started upgrading facilities. But when NIL money and the transfer portal changed the college football world, Indiana didn’t adapt quickly and the delay led, in part, to the firing of coach Tom Allen in 2023.

According to the Knight-Newhouse database, Indiana’s football budget has increased from $24 million in 2021 to more than $61 million last year.

Allen, who grew up in Indiana and whose father was a longtime high school coach in the state, landed at Penn State as defensive coordinator in 2024 and then took the same job at Clemson last season. Today, he’s impressed with the results — and the commitments.

“Just really, really happy for those guys and just really, really happy they’ve chosen to invest in football,” Allen said in December. “That’s something they know they needed to do. They had not done that in the past to the level necessary, and it’s been awesome to see them recognize that and invest and be able to be rewarded for that.”

Honestly, though, Indiana didn’t have a choice.

Schools need football revenue to make athletic departments function. So empty seats, even at a basketball, can be costly.

But winning has helped Indiana strike gold.

School attendance and admission applications are both up. So are donations, which includes a significant contribution from billionaire Mark Cuban, an alum. In addition to shedding the label of America’s losingest team in November, it also surpassed Penn State in October for the nation’s largest living alumni base. And over the past two seasons, Memorial Stadium has drawn eight of the largest 10 crowds in school history.

So Dolson isn’t about to let Cignetti — or his key staff members — get away if he can help it.

Cignetti has earned contract extensions each of the past two seasons, pushing his average annual salary to $11.6 million, No. 3 in the nation. Bryant Haines and Mike Shanahan also have received contract extensions pushing their salaries to upwards of $3 million per year.

Indiana fans will tell you they’re worth every penny. Yet Dolson believes it’s not just about cash.

“He didn’t come in with demands, like saying ‘Hey, I’d only come here if I get this, that and the other.’ We laid out, ‘This is what our commitments are, this is what our plan is,’” Dolson said of Cignetti. “One of the misnomers out there is that it’s not just a spending contest. It’s more of having a comprehensive strategic plan for football and that’s what we really put together.”

Cignature style

Sure, Cignetti came to Indiana with a resume and a track record. He also brought most of his previous coaches and about two dozen James Madison players, too.

Why? They believed in the man and his principles.

“Coach Cig just does such a great job of bringing out the best in his players, and obviously his coaches as well,” said All-American linebacker Aiden Fisher, one of the followers from JMU. “But there’s something about coach Cig that just makes you want to play your heart out for him and he does a great job getting the best out of everybody.”

It explains how he’s taken self-proclaimed “misfit” recruits on the wildest journey of their lives.

Cignetti seemed to be built for this job.

He grew up learning the craft from his father, Frank Sr., a Hall of Fame coach at the Division II level. He spent more than two decades evaluating and developing players before he joined Nick Saban’s staff at Alabama in 2007, where he served as the recruiting coordinator for Saban’s first title team.

Somewhere along the way, though, Cignetti developed his own style — the short, punchy phrases, the quick quips and the unchanging facial expression that have created their own internet memes.

But Dolson was interested in Cignetti for other reasons.

He liked the notion of who Cignetti could bring with him and Dolson detected some similarities between Cignetti and another title-winning coach at Indiana, the late Bob Knight.

“Certainly, different personalities, but similarities in terms of their commitment to their blueprint, their plan, the focus on details and just the mental approach to competitive success,” Dolson said. “I feel like there’s an elite approach to that. I definitely see the way coach Cig runs things, the way he coaches, there are a lot of similarities.”

Movie time

Pizzo’s phone started ringing repeatedly almost from the moment Cignetti responded to a post-Rose Bowl game question about Indiana’s remarkable ascension.

“It would make a hell of a movie,” he cracked.

Perhaps no filmmaker understands the Cinderella story better than Pizzo, who introduced the world to his home state’s 1954 Milan Miracle team and captivated the nation by turning a previously little-known walk-on at Notre Dame into a recognizable star.

But Pizzo has no plans to make “Hoosiers 2.” He thinks the story of Indiana’s two-year football run needs to marinate for a decade or two, like his other two box office hits.

Besides, Pizzo has turned into a full-throttle believer, even suggesting the final chapter of this incredible run may not come Monday night.

“Last season was the season of a lifetime, to get into the College Football Playoff. But I thought we had hit our ceiling because we were going up against teams like Ohio State and Notre Dame that had more four- and five-star talent and NFL players than we did,” he said. “I’m not going to even think about Miami. I think we should win, but again, you know, it’s just too good to be true.”

Yes, the Hoosiers have exorcised their demons.

They’ve won two straight against the Boilermakers. They’ve beaten Michigan and Ohio State. They’ve won the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. They have a Heisman Trophy winner, quarterback Fernando Mendoza.

Now they’re one win away from a title nobody saw coming, except perhaps Dolson and Cignetti.

“Everything he said in his interview, everything he articulated in his blueprint is the same as you see today,” Dolson said. “In fact, everything he said during the interview has come true.”",https://wpcdn.us-east-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.wxxv25.com/content/uploads/2026/01/u/y/indiana.png,N,,2026-01-19 02:58:22.682677

China now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined.
The United States is far behind this competition.
Electrification demands engagement with the messy world of building power plants and manufacturing at scale, which are China’s strengths.","President Trump has an unconcealed hunger for natural resources from abroad and the power they could grant him. He declared that the United States intervened in Venezuela to “take the oil,” betting that investors would put up at least $100 billion to revive a decrepit industry. His gamble is that countries will still want to buy oil from America to power their cars, trucks, ships and planes for decades to come.

Though China is the world’s largest oil importer, its leader, Xi Jinping, is less brash about coveting foreign resources. The country’s leadership is pushing intensively at substituting electricity for oil.

Chinese technology companies are paving the way for a world that will be powered by electric motors rather than gas-guzzling engines. It is a decisively 21st-century approach not just to solve its own energy problems, but also to sell batteries and other electric products to everyone else. Canada is its newest buyer of EVs; in a rebuke of Mr. Trump, its prime minister, Mark Carney, lowered tariffs on the cars as part of a new trade deal.

Though Americans have been slow to embrace electric vehicles, Chinese households have learned to love them. In 2025, 54 percent of new cars sold in China were either battery-powered or plug-in hybrids. That is a big reason that the country’s oil consumption is on track to peak in 2027, according to forecasts from the International Energy Agency. And Chinese E.V makers are setting records — whether it’s BYD’s sales (besting Tesla by battery-powered vehicles sold for the first time last year) or Xiaomi’s speed (its cars are setting records at major racetracks like Nürburgring in Germany).

These vehicles are powered not by oil but by domestically generated electrical power that comes from coal, nuclear, hydropower, solar and wind.

In 2000, China produced only one-third of the amount of electrical power that the United States did; by 2024, it produced nearly two and a half times U.S. levels. China’s surging energy investments went substantially into building new plants for burning coal, which the country possesses in abundance. But over the past decade, it has also moved fast on building cleaner energy sources, especially wind and solar.

China now generates more electricity each year than the United States and the European Union combined. It has close to 40 new nuclear power reactors under construction, compared with zero in America. Last year, Beijing announced work on a new hydropower dam in Tibet that will have triple the capacity of China’s Three Gorges Dam, currently the world’s largest power station.

China isn’t just building gigantic amounts of power; its businesses are reshaping technological foundations to electrify the world.

China spent decades trying to build world-leading automotive champions; the results were not impressive until E.V.s arrived. Their adoption allowed Chinese automakers to stop trying to beat the Germans at building better combustion engines and leverage their greater expertise in electronics instead. If an E.V. is a smartphone with tires, then it makes sense that the country that makes most of the world’s electronics would also make nearly half of its cars.

Several technologies had to mature before they could be electrified. The lithium-ion battery was invented by American and Japanese scientists before Chinese companies took over most of this industry in the 2010s. The United States also used to dominate the production of rare-earth magnets, the crucial product in electric motors; China makes more than 90 percent of these magnets today. In addition to batteries and magnets, the writer Noah Smith identifies power electronics and embedded chips as the main drivers of the new electric age.

The oil-burning products that can now instead be powered by batteries and electric motors include not only cars, but also bikes, buses and even some boats. Heavy industry and temperature control for buildings are being electrified, too. And a future in which many noisy, gas-powered household tools can be electrically powered is in reach: Even the foul and loud lawn mower and leaf blower are gradually being replaced by a more gentle thrum.

Some products may never be electrified. Battery packs will probably not power a long-haul flight or container ship (though cleaner fuels are possible). But the opportunity to electrify almost everything else will grow over the next decade, and China is leading the charge.

The southern city of Shenzhen, which has been producing Apple products for two decades now, is leveraging its expertise in electronics — as well as more advanced batteries, magnets and chips — to remake whole categories of transportation and household and industrial products into the image of the smartphone. As the world moves on from combustion engines and into batteries, it will be looking away from oil producers and toward factories in Shenzhen.

The United States is far behind this competition. On the one hand, Elon Musk has done more than anyone else to raise the status of electric vehicles and create their associated technological improvements. But the broader U.S. industrial base has mostly shed its capabilities in batteries and rare-earth magnets, in part out of a deliberate effort to move these factories to China. American companies building drones or other products of the new electric age are also far behind their Chinese competitors.

Electrification demands engagement with the messy world of building power plants and manufacturing at scale, which are China’s strengths. But Silicon Valley has instead preferred to work in the realm of highly profitable digital businesses. Technologists like Sam D’Amico (who is making a high-powered electric-induction stove) and Ryan McEntush (a venture capital investor) have lately sounded the alarm at how comprehensively ahead Chinese capabilities have become.

The United States could compete on building better drones and electric vehicles if its businesses had greater access to electrical power and a vital industrial base. But it is governed by a president who is enthusiastic about powering the future with fossil fuels and has a personal pique against wind turbines, calling them the “SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” His administration is slow-walking approval of and canceling new solar and wind projects while favoring coal and gas — which makes it more difficult to electrify. No product is more important than batteries in electrification, yet an infamous ICE raid targeted a Korean company that was constructing a battery factory in Georgia. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s tariffs have hamstrung American manufacturing, which has lost around 70,000 jobs since April.

America had better shape up before losing out to an electric age ushered in by Beijing. Otherwise, it will be stuck with outmoded products at home while China conquers markets through better technology.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/opinion/16wang/16wang-facebookJumbo-v4.png,N,,2026-01-19 01:59:30.182358

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Thursday, Jan. 15, unanimously approved a site permit for the Duluth-based utility's $163.5 million, 85-megawatt solar project adjacent to its Boswell Energy Center in Cohasset. The project will also include a new substation and a nearly 3-mile, 230-kilovolt transmission line linking it to the existing substation at Boswell.

Solar panels are expected to cover about 500 acres of land, approximately half of which is owned by Minnesota Power, with the other half leased from other property owners.

""We're excited to get the permits and get the authorization to get to work on that when the snow melts,"" said Julie Pierce, vice president of strategy and planning at Minnesota Power.

Carrie Ryan, enterprise project manager, said work on the project will begin this spring, with the array coming online in fall 2027.

The company's larger, 800-acre, 119-megawatt project in Royalton, which is also permitted, has a similar construction timeline.

When complete, the two solar projects will be the company's largest, surpassing its 15-megawatt Sylvan solar project near Brainerd, which came online in 2023.

The Boswell and Royalton projects represent more than two-thirds of the 300 megawatts of solar Minnesota Power announced in 2022 as part of an agreement with clean energy organizations weighing in on the company's required integrated resource plan, which outlines the next 15 years of expected energy sources and demands.

The nearly 100 remaining megawatts will come through ""an exciting distributed solar energy standard that we are working on meeting,"" Pierce said. The specifics are still being worked out, company officials said.

Between 50% and 60% of the company's energy now comes from renewable sources. State law requires utilities produce all electricity with carbon-free sources by 2040.

Boswell is home to Minnesota Power's last two coal-fired power plants, which are scheduled to retire by 2030 and 2035, and are significant sources of tax revenue to Cohasset and Itasca County. This solar project or other proposals, like refueling Boswell with natural gas, could preserve some of that tax base.

It also makes use of what's already there.

""One of the really great things about this project is it takes advantage of all the existing infrastructure that's already at the Boswell Energy Center, and utilizes that to bring this energy to the transmission system,"" Ryan said.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/a622e2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5296x3531+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F39%2Fa6f9ad624d8eb968e4036322225b%2F102022.N.DNT.solarC3.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 01:59:25.681620

The global energy landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. As nations strive to meet ambitious decarbonization targets, the focus has expanded beyond mere electricity generation to encompass the entire energy ecosystem. The intermittent nature of sources like wind and solar has laid bare the urgent need for reliable storage and flexible grid solutions. In this context, renewable gases—biomethane from organic waste and the promising frontier of green hydrogen—have ascended to strategic importance. They represent not just clean fuel, but a form of long-duration energy storage, capable of powering industries, heating homes, and generating electricity when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.

However, the potential of these renewable gases is intrinsically linked to a fundamental engineering challenge: safe, large-scale, and cost-effective storage. This is the niche where specialized manufacturing expertise becomes indispensable. The storage of biogas, a corrosive mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, and trace elements like hydrogen sulfide, demands robust solutions. Modern Biogas Storage Tanks are feats of material science and design, often utilizing high-strength, flexible geomembranes or specially coated steels that resist corrosion and maintain integrity over decades. These are not passive containers; they are active, managed systems crucial for stabilizing the anaerobic digestion process, balancing supply with demand, and ensuring a continuous flow of energy.

The economic and operational viability of any biogas project hinges on this critical component. A well-engineered storage system acts as a buffer, allowing for the efficient scheduling of electricity generation and enabling the upgrading of raw biogas to pure biomethane for injection into gas grids or use as vehicle fuel. By maximizing uptime and output, manufacturers of this infrastructure directly contribute to improving the return on investment for project developers, making renewable energy projects more bankable and scalable. Their work underpins the business case for converting agricultural waste, landfill emissions, and sewage into valuable, clean energy.

The innovation driving this sector extends beyond corrosion resistance. Leading manufacturers are integrating smart monitoring technologies directly into their storage solutions. Sensors that provide real-time data on gas volume, pressure, and composition allow for unprecedented control and optimization of the entire gas production and utilization chain. This digital layer transforms a simple storage tank into an intelligent node within a smarter energy network, enhancing safety, predictive maintenance, and overall system efficiency. Furthermore, the development of flexible, double-membrane gas holders offers significant advantages in weight, installation speed, and cost over traditional rigid steel tanks, particularly for large-scale applications.

The market dynamics for these specialized solutions reflect a truly global energy transition. While Europe and North America lead in technological adoption and strict emissions standards, the vast potential for biogas development in Asia, South America, and Africa presents a significant growth frontier. Here, the ability to provide adaptable, durable, and locally serviceable storage technology is key to unlocking sustainable waste management and energy access. Manufacturers capable of operating on this global stage are not just exporting products; they are facilitating knowledge transfer and enabling climate action in diverse economic and geographical contexts.

Looking ahead, the strategic role of these manufacturers is set to expand into the nascent hydrogen economy. The techniques, safety protocols, and material sciences honed in the production of Biogas Storage Tanks provide a formidable foundation for addressing the unique challenges of storing lightweight, high-energy-density hydrogen. Companies with deep expertise in gas containment are therefore naturally positioned to be key enablers in the next wave of the clean energy revolution, bridging today’s biogas solutions with tomorrow’s hydrogen infrastructure.

In essence, the journey to a resilient, fully renewable energy system is a complex puzzle. While flashy technologies capture the public imagination, it is the robust, reliably manufactured components—the tanks, the seals, the sensors—that securely hold the pieces together. The meticulous work of specialized manufacturers ensures that the clean energy promise of renewable gases is not lost between production and consumption. They provide the essential confidence that energy will be there when it is needed, solidifying the foundation upon which a sustainable future is being built.

The transition to electric mobility has exposed significant weaknesses in global supply chains, particularly for specialized battery materials that require precise technical specifications and reliable sourcing partnerships. Furthermore, the importance of critical minerals energy security has become increasingly evident as manufacturers struggle with dependency on concentrated supply sources. Manufacturing facilities capable of producing automotive-grade graphite outside China remain scarce, creating strategic bottlenecks that can disrupt entire production schedules. Understanding these supply chain dynamics reveals broader patterns of dependency and risk management challenges facing the electric vehicle industry.

Tesla's ongoing supply agreement modifications with Syrah Resources demonstrate how technical compliance issues can cascade through complex manufacturing networks. The extended timeline for resolving quality specifications highlights the intricate nature of battery material production and the narrow margins for error in automotive applications.

Understanding Graphite's Strategic Role in Battery Performance

Natural graphite serves as the primary component in lithium-ion battery anodes, comprising approximately 95% of the anode material by weight. The material's crystalline structure allows lithium ions to intercalate during charging cycles, making it essential for energy storage capacity and charging performance. In addition, establishing a battery-grade lithium refinery alongside graphite processing capabilities represents a crucial step towards supply chain independence. Battery-grade graphite requires exceptional purity levels and specific particle size distributions that differ significantly from industrial applications.

Technical Requirements for Automotive Applications

Electric vehicle batteries demand graphite materials that meet stringent specifications for:

• Purity levels exceeding 99.95% carbon content

• Particle size consistency within narrow tolerances for optimal ion flow

• Surface area optimization to maximize lithium intercalation capacity

• Chemical stability under repeated charge-discharge cycles

• Low impurity content to prevent battery degradation

The processing requirements for achieving these specifications involve multiple purification stages, including flotation, acid leaching, and high-temperature treatment. Each step must maintain precise control parameters to ensure the final product meets automotive certification standards.

Supply Chain Concentration Risks

China currently dominates global graphite processing capabilities, controlling an estimated 70% of natural graphite production and over 80% of spherical graphite manufacturing for battery applications. This concentration creates strategic vulnerabilities for Western automakers seeking supply chain resilience.

The Syrah Tesla graphite supply deal represents a critical attempt to establish non-Chinese sourcing alternatives. Consequently, developing a comprehensive critical minerals strategy becomes essential for securing long-term supply chains. Syrah's 8,000 metric ton annual commitment under their 2021 agreement would provide Tesla with a dedicated supply stream from the Vidalia facility in Louisiana, the only vertically integrated large-scale anode material producer outside China.

Analyzing Production Challenges at Vidalia Operations

Vertical Integration Complexities

The Vidalia facility attempts to control the entire value chain from raw graphite processing to finished anode material production. This vertical integration approach offers supply security advantages but introduces operational complexities across multiple processing stages.

The facility must coordinate:

• Raw material quality control from Madagascar mining operations

• Multi-stage purification processes

• Spherical graphite shaping and coating

• Final anode material certification and packaging

Each processing step requires specialised equipment, technical expertise, and quality assurance protocols that can create bottlenecks when scaling to commercial volumes.

Timeline of Compliance Challenges

The extended deadline negotiations reveal the technical difficulties in meeting automotive specifications:

Timeline Milestone Status July 2025 Initial default notice issued Quality compliance failure identified September 2025 First cure deadline Extension granted November 2025 Second deadline Further extension required January 2026 Third deadline Additional extension to March 16 February 2026 Tesla termination threshold Critical compliance checkpoint

The repeated extensions indicate ongoing technical challenges rather than simple production delays. Tesla's February 9, 2026 termination threshold for technical specification compliance suggests the automaker maintains strict quality standards that cannot be compromised for supply security.

Quality Assurance Protocols

Automotive-grade anode material testing involves comprehensive evaluation of:

• Electrochemical performance under simulated battery conditions

• Particle morphology using scanning electron microscopy

• Chemical composition through elemental analysis

• Physical properties including tap density and surface area

• Contamination screening for metallic impurities

The collaborative approach mentioned in Syrah's statements suggests both companies are working to identify and resolve specific quality parameters that fall outside Tesla's specifications.

Supply Chain Risk Assessment Framework

Financial Implications of Supply Disruption

Syrah Resources' share price declined 6.6% to A$0.285 following the deadline extension announcement, reaching levels not seen since December 2025. This market reaction reflects investor concerns about the company's ability to execute its strategic positioning as a non-Chinese graphite supplier.

The Tesla supply agreement represents a cornerstone of Syrah's business strategy, providing revenue certainty for their Vidalia operations over the four-year contract period. Loss of this agreement would require the company to identify alternative customers or modify their production approach significantly.

Alternative Sourcing Challenges

Tesla's position during these negotiations demonstrates the limited alternatives available for non-Chinese graphite sourcing. The company has extended deadlines multiple times rather than terminating the agreement, suggesting:

• Limited qualified suppliers capable of meeting technical requirements

• Long qualification timelines for alternative sources

• Strategic importance of establishing non-Chinese supply chains

• Investment protection in supplier development initiatives

Alternative sourcing typically requires 18-24 months for full qualification and certification processes, making immediate substitution difficult for automotive applications. For instance, the development of a European CRM facility demonstrates similar challenges faced by Western manufacturers in establishing independent supply chains.

Department of Energy Oversight

The requirement for U.S. Department of Energy approval for deadline extensions indicates government interest in maintaining domestic graphite processing capabilities. This oversight suggests the agreement may receive support through critical minerals initiatives or supply chain resilience programs.

The DOE's involvement reflects broader national security considerations regarding battery material supply chains and efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese processing capabilities.

Global Market Dynamics and Regulatory Environment

Investment Requirements for Non-Chinese Production

Establishing automotive-grade graphite processing facilities outside China requires substantial capital investment and technical expertise. The Vidalia facility represents years of development and hundreds of millions in infrastructure investment to achieve commercial-scale production capabilities.

The plant, located just outside of Corpus Christi, Texas, marks a significant step toward the U.S. securing domestic refined lithium resources.

""Our Lithium Refinery ushers in energy independence for North America,"" Tesla North America stated, announcing the plant's operational status two years after breaking ground. This refinery is designed to convert spodumene ore directly into battery-grade lithium hydroxide, employing a process that is the first of its kind in North America.

Jason Bevan, Site Manager for Tesla’s Gulf Coast Lithium Refinery, explains that Tesla is using a new technology platform to obtain battery-grade lithium from spodumene ore, describing the process as cleaner, simpler, and cheaper.

Sustainable and Efficient Processes

Tesla sustainably sources spodumene, processing it through conveyance systems, a kiln, and a cooler. The material then undergoes alkaline leeching, purification, and crystallization to yield battery-grade lithium hydroxide.

A refinery employee highlighted the sustainability of the process: ""Our process is more sustainable than traditional methods and eliminates hazardous byproducts and instead produces a co-product named anhydrite used in concrete mixes.""

The refinery ensures access to critical minerals for energy storage, battery manufacturing, and EV growth, according to Tesla.

Impact on Supply Chains and Emissions

This lithium refinery enables Tesla to accelerate its mission by regionalizing supply chains for battery minerals and materials, creating jobs, and reducing emissions from transportation. ""It really allows us to usher in energy independence for North America,"" Tesla adds.

The refinery is a significant step toward reducing America's dependence on China for refined lithium supply. The U.S. has been working to decrease industrial and national security dependence on critical minerals used in battery, defense, military, and automotive technologies.

The Trump Administration previously invested in minority stakes in North American lithium producers and refiners through the Departments of Defense and Energy to secure domestic access to key minerals and create jobs.

NiSource Inc. is not the kind of name that trends on social media. It doesn’t sell shiny consumer gadgets or chase speculative AI hype. Instead, it does something far more fundamental: it keeps the lights on and the heat flowing for millions of customers across the American Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. In an era defined by decarbonization mandates, grid instability, and soaring infrastructure costs, NiSource Inc. is trying to turn a traditional regulated utility footprint into a modern energy platform.

As one of the largest fully regulated utility companies in the U.S., NiSource Inc. operates through its portfolio of local brands including Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), Columbia Gas, and others. The company’s product, in the broadest sense, is reliable, increasingly cleaner energy delivered at regulated rates — but under the hood, this product is being re-architected around renewables, grid automation, and safety-driven gas modernization.

That transformation is now central to how NiSource Inc. positions itself to regulators, investors, and the communities it serves. It’s also starting to show up in the numbers. The company is in the middle of a multi-year capital investment cycle focused on electric grid upgrades, renewable generation build-out, and gas pipe replacement — the kind of slow, compounding infrastructure story that can reshape a regional energy system for decades.

Inside the Flagship: NiSource Inc.

To understand NiSource Inc. as a product, you have to think like an infrastructure strategist rather than a consumer. The company’s core offering breaks into three interlocking pillars: regulated electric service, regulated natural gas distribution, and a long-horizon transition plan that leans into renewables and grid modernization while trying to preserve affordability.

NiSource’s electric operations are centered on NIPSCO in Indiana. Here, the company is executing an aggressive generation transition plan. Over the past several years, NiSource has laid out and begun acting on a strategy to retire coal generation and replace it with a mix of utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage contracts and projects. Its integrated resource plans forecast a system that is dramatically less carbon intensive this decade, with coal exits paired to a portfolio of renewables that target both reliability and cost predictability.

On the gas side, NiSource’s Columbia Gas utilities span states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. The product here is safe, modern gas delivery infrastructure — and that word ""safe"" is not marketing fluff. After the 2018 Merrimack Valley gas explosions in Massachusetts (a former NiSource territory since divested), safety culture and system modernization have become a defining feature of how the company presents itself and where it allocates capital. Large-scale pipe replacement programs, remote sensing, advanced leak detection technology, and better network segmentation are all part of the ongoing modernization push.

Across both electric and gas, NiSource Inc. is also marketing a quieter layer of innovation: grid and network intelligence. That includes investments in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), distribution automation, and control systems designed to better manage peak demand, integrate more distributed energy resources, and improve outage response time. Customers experience this as better reliability and more detailed usage information; regulators see it as a platform for future programs like time-of-use rates and demand response.

Underpinning all of this is a long-dated capex story. NiSource has articulated multi-year capital expenditure plans in the multi-billion-dollar range, targeting grid hardening, renewables, and gas system upgrades. Because it is a fully regulated utility, most of these investments are structured to earn regulated returns through rate cases. That dynamic — predictable, regulated returns on a growing asset base — is at the heart of the NiSource Inc. product for investors.

Where NiSource increasingly stands out is in how it pitches its transition. The company positions itself not as a speculative clean-tech play, but as a pragmatic decarbonization utility: retiring coal, ramping renewables, and modernizing gas in a way that tries to keep bills relatively stable and reliability high. In an environment where extreme weather, aging grid assets, and policy pressure collide, that mix of reliability, safety, and decarbonization is NiSource Inc.’s core value proposition.

Market Rivals: NiSource Inc. Aktie vs. The Competition

NiSource Inc. doesn’t compete the way a smartphone maker does, but it absolutely operates in a competitive landscape. Its closest peers are other large, predominantly regulated U.S. utilities with similar transition stories — think companies like CenterPoint Energy and WEC Energy Group, each with their own flavor of the modern utility ""product"".

Compared directly to CenterPoint Energy: CenterPoint Energy offers a hybrid portfolio of electric transmission and distribution, natural gas distribution, and some generation exposure, with service territories in states such as Texas, Indiana, Minnesota, and others. Like NiSource, CenterPoint is leaning into grid modernization and regulated growth. It has articulated a sizable capital plan centered on upgrading electric infrastructure and expanding its gas footprint with safety and reliability programs.

The contrast is in profile and geography. CenterPoint’s exposure to high-growth markets like Texas gives it a growth narrative tied to load expansion, industrial demand, and population inflows. NiSource Inc., by comparison, is more tightly focused on the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, markets that are slower-growth but heavily industrial and politically attuned to reliability and affordability. Where CenterPoint can frame itself as a growth-and-grid utility tied to booming Sun Belt economies, NiSource positions as a transition-and-modernization platform for more mature markets dealing with aging infrastructure.

On the product side, CenterPoint has pushed outage management, smart grid controls, and advanced metering as differentiated offerings for its territories, sometimes backed by more aggressive use of customer-facing digital tools. NiSource Inc. has moved in the same direction, but its messaging leans more heavily on safety, regulatory collaboration, and multiyear renewables transition plans in Indiana.

Compared directly to WEC Energy Group: WEC Energy Group, headquartered in the Upper Midwest, is one of the closest analogs to NiSource Inc. Its utilities serve customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, with a portfolio of electric and gas operations and a similarly intense focus on reliability in cold-weather states. WEC has its own large capital plan for grid modernization, renewables additions, and gas modernization, and it markets itself as an efficient, high-quality regulated utility with strong execution.

Where WEC has often enjoyed a premium reputation as an operationally disciplined Midwestern utility, NiSource Inc. historically traded more as a turnaround-plus-transition story — particularly after high-profile gas incidents and subsequent safety overhauls. Compared to WEC Energy Group, NiSource’s ""product"" is now centered on proving that its safety, compliance, and modernization programs can match best-in-class peers while still delivering on decarbonization commitments.

In terms of renewables, WEC Energy Group has used a combination of utility-owned and contracted projects to build its clean energy footprint. NiSource’s NIPSCO strategy is similarly built around a portfolio of owned and contracted solar and wind projects, plus batteries, with a strong emphasis on coal retirement milestones. The difference is that NiSource’s coal exit story is more central to its narrative, because its historical generation mix has been more coal-heavy than some peers. For NiSource Inc., the move to renewables is not a peripheral enhancement — it is the redesign of the core electric product.

How NiSource differentiates in this crowd: While all three utilities talk about modernization, NiSource Inc. puts unusually strong emphasis on three axes: gas safety and modernization, a defined coal retirement roadmap with renewables backfill, and the concept of being a fully regulated portfolio (as opposed to mixing in large merchant or unregulated businesses). Where some peers lean into unregulated clean energy development or transmission plays, NiSource stays close to the regulated-returns model. For risk-averse stakeholders, that is a different kind of competitive proposition.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

In a sector where many players look similar on the surface, NiSource Inc. is trying to carve out a specific edge built around execution, safety, and a defined transition plan. Its competitive strength isn’t in a single breakthrough technology, but in how it combines multiple strategic pieces into a coherent, regulated platform.

1. A clear generation transition story

NiSource’s coal retirement and renewables build-out plan is one of its most important differentiators. Rather than dabbling in clean energy while prolonging legacy coal assets indefinitely, NiSource has mapped out and begun executing on concrete retirement timelines paired with named solar, wind, and storage projects. That clarity matters to regulators, environmental stakeholders, and investors alike.

Because these renewables are predominantly rate-based or supported by long-term contracts, NiSource Inc. can frame them as both climate-responsive and financially disciplined. The product promise here is a decarbonized electric supply that still fits within the traditional regulated utility model — not a speculative merchant-generation bet.

2. Safety-first gas modernization

Many gas utilities are working on pipe replacement and leak reduction, but for NiSource Inc., safety-focused gas modernization is effectively part of its brand. The company has made large-scale capital commitments to replacing aging pipe, improving system design, and deploying advanced inspection technology. Its messaging to regulators and communities centers heavily on preventing incidents, enhancing emergency response, and reducing methane emissions.

That emphasis doesn’t just reduce risk; it also creates a structured, recurring investment program with clear regulatory frameworks. In other words, NiSource has turned safety modernization itself into a long-run product: a predictable pipeline of infrastructure upgrades that improve reliability and safety while earning regulated returns.

3. Fully regulated, long-horizon investment profile

Unlike some peers that blend regulated utilities with unregulated development arms or trading operations, NiSource Inc. positions itself squarely as a fully regulated platform. That means its growth thesis rests on expanding and upgrading its own networks and generation assets, not on competing in merchant markets or volatile wholesale segments.

For customers, that translates into a utility that is oriented around long-term rate stability, incremental modernization, and regulatory oversight. For investors, it means a lower-risk profile with returns driven by rate cases and capital deployment rather than commodity cycles. In a sector where some utilities have stumbled on riskier, non-regulated bets, NiSource’s relatively focused model is part of its competitive edge.

4. Midwest and Mid-Atlantic positioning

NiSource Inc.’s footprint in Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and neighboring states gives it exposure to a region where industrial demand, extreme weather resilience, and political scrutiny over energy affordability are all intense. That can be challenging, but it also creates a strong case for robust investment in the grid and gas infrastructure.

By focusing on reliability, safety, and cost-managed decarbonization, NiSource is aligning its product with exactly what these markets need. Where Sun Belt utilities talk about load growth and electrification, NiSource talks about replacing coal, modernizing gas, and hardening networks against storms and cold snaps — a story that fits the realities of its service areas.

5. Balancing decarbonization with affordability

Behind every utility transition plan is a political question: who pays, and how quickly? NiSource Inc. frames its strategy as one of ""pragmatic decarbonization."" By phasing in renewables, sequencing coal retirements, and structuring gas modernization over many years, the company aims to moderate bill impacts while still reducing emissions and risk.

That balance is its true USP. Rather than selling a vision of instant green transformation or extreme austerity, NiSource is selling time: enough time to replace coal with renewables at scale, modernize gas, and roll out grid intelligence without destabilizing rates. For regulators and customers wary of both climate inaction and bill shocks, that is a powerful proposition.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

NiSource Inc. Aktie (ISIN US65473P1057), trading under the ticker NI on the New York Stock Exchange, reflects this long-horizon, infrastructure-heavy story more than any short-term tech-cycle narrative.

Using real-time financial data as of the latest available trading session, NiSource Inc. Aktie was recently quoted around the mid-$20s per share, based on consolidated data from multiple financial platforms including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch. Because markets do not trade continuously around the clock, the most reliable reference point is the last closing price, which placed NiSource firmly in the range typical for a mature, yield-focused regulated utility rather than a high-volatility growth stock.

The share price behavior largely mirrors the company’s investment and regulatory cycle. When NiSource Inc. outlines multi-year capital expenditure plans for renewables, grid modernization, and gas infrastructure — accompanied by constructive regulatory outcomes — the stock tends to be viewed as a stable, income-oriented name with a visible growth runway in its rate base. Dividend stability is a key part of that thesis. Investors often treat NiSource Inc. Aktie as an income-generating infrastructure asset with embedded growth, not a speculative trade.

From a valuation perspective, NiSource Inc. typically trades in line with, or at a modest discount to, many of its regulated peers, reflecting both the opportunity of its coal-to-renewables shift and the lingering reputational overhang from past gas incidents. As the company continues to execute on safety upgrades, coal retirements, and regulatory settlements, it has the potential to compress that discount. Each successful rate case that locks in returns on new investments effectively monetizes pieces of the NiSource product roadmap for shareholders.

What really links the physical product to the stock is the growing regulated asset base. Every new solar or wind project added to replace coal, every tranche of pipe replacements finished, and every grid modernization program approved by regulators increases the capital deployed on which NiSource earns a set return. Over time, that expanding base is the primary driver of earnings and dividend capacity for NiSource Inc. Aktie.

In that sense, NiSource Inc. is less about quarter-to-quarter surprises and more about cumulative execution. If it hits its milestones on coal retirement, renewable integration, safety modernization, and grid intelligence, the company strengthens not just its infrastructure product but the underlying economics that support its stock.

For customers, communities, and investors, the story converges on the same point: NiSource Inc. is betting that the future of energy in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic will be built on regulated, modernized, cleaner infrastructure that still keeps reliability and affordability at the center. It is a long game — but in the world of utilities, the long game is the only one that really matters.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405021_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 01:59:37.916778

The Aurora project represents the first component of what 1414 Degrees describes as a “Continuous Energy Hub” designed to serve data centres and other high-demand industrial applications.

The 140MW system is being developed on behalf of SiliconAurora, which holds the Crown Lease over the 15.8-hectare site near Port Augusta, South Australia, and has invested over AU$3.5 million (US$2.34 million) to date in generator studies and regulatory approvals for development of the broader Aurora Renewable Energy Precinct.

The regulatory approvals are valid for 12 months, subject to execution of the Transmission Connection Agreement (TCA), and enable 1414 Degrees to advance toward securing PPAs with customers.

AEMO indicated that the final due diligence assessment of the system’s capability to meet agreed performance standards will commence following the submission of finalised technical models and detailed design information, which will mark the next phase of technical validation for the project.

The GPS approval has been granted for the 140MW battery storage system. The wider Aurora Energy Project will also include a pilot of the company’s SiBox thermal energy storage technology.

1414 Degrees’ thermal energy storage system technology

Thermal energy storage systems, like those developed by 1414 Degrees, represent an alternative to traditional lithium-ion battery storage, using heat as the storage medium rather than electrochemical processes.

The company’s proprietary SiBrick technology harnesses the exceptionally high latent heat capacity of silicon, which melts at 1,414°C, to store renewable energy as thermal energy that can be converted back to electricity or used directly as industrial heat.

This approach offers particular advantages for long-duration energy storage (LDES) applications and industrial processes requiring high-temperature heat, positioning the technology as complementary to conventional battery systems rather than directly competitive.

The SiBox system, 1414 Degrees’ complete thermal energy storage solution, integrates heating elements with SiBrick storage media within an insulated heat store, coupled with an energy recovery system.

This technology can deliver temperatures ranging from 700°C to 1,000°C, making it suitable for high-temperature industrial applications that currently rely on fossil fuels, including cement production, alumina processing and steel manufacturing.

The system’s ability to provide both electricity and industrial heat represents a key differentiator from conventional battery storage technologies, which can only provide electrical output.

1414 Degrees has reached several major milestones in the energy storage landscape. In the third quarter of 2022, the company joined the Long Duration Energy Storage Council, and in 2018, the organisation kicked off a molten silicon storage project in Australia.

The company noted that separate negotiations remain ongoing with the current sole user of the existing transmission line to enable reclassification as a Dedicated Connection Asset, which would allow open access to the National Electricity Market (NEM), which spans Australia’s eastern and southern states.

Executive chairman Dr Kevin Moriarty expressed confidence that an agreement would be reached on this matter, describing it as a necessary step to unlock the project’s full commercial potential.

“In addition to revenue from the BESS, it supports broader development opportunities, including data centre potential previously outlined by the company,” Dr Moriarty added.

The Aurora Precinct’s positioning for potential data centre applications reflects broader market trends, with increasing global investment in AI-driven digital infrastructure creating demand for a reliable, continuous power supply.

The company referenced recent initiatives involving NEXTDC and OpenAI, along with continued expansion by operators such as Firmus, as indicators of growing market opportunity for facilities capable of providing uninterrupted renewable energy.

China's drive to develop controllable nuclear fusion is nearing a historic turning point, with related procurements totaling 10 billion yuan ($1.37 billion) set to be completed this year and early demonstrations of fusion-generated electricity likely to be seen around 2030, industry experts and company executives said on Sunday.

Their comments were made at the Fusion Energy Technology and Industry Conference 2026, which was hosted by the Anhui Province Fusion Industry Federation and Fusion Energy Technology, among others, and which ended on Saturday in Hefei, Anhui pro-vince. The presence of over 1,500 industry participants highlighted the growing convergence of science, manufacturing and capital in the area of fusion development.

Fusion occurs when two nuclei combine to form a new nucleus. Fusion energy seeks to replicate the sun's nuclear reactions to produce carbon-free electricity, effectively creating a safe, controllable ""artificial sun"" on Earth.

If successful, it could provide a near-limitless source of clean energy without carbon emissions while significantly lowering safety risks associated with conventional nuclear power.

A report presented by experts at the conference said that China's fusion energy development is entering a decisive phase, shifting from scientific experimentation to practical energy systems.

It emphasized that the Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak, or BEST, a major fusion device, aims to achieve net fusion power gain and demonstrate electricity generation by around 2030.

Song Yuntao, head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Plasma Physics, said: ""Fusion is no longer just a physics experiment. It is becoming an energy engineering project. The key question now is how to build it, operate it and make it economically viable.""

Currently, skepticism prevails over whether fusion can be commercialized at scale, particularly given its history of long development timelines.

Xu Qiang, chief analyst for power and environmental sectors at Guotai Haitong Securities, said: ""China's advantage in fusion deve-lopment is that it combines State-led research facilities with growing participation from private companies. That significantly improves the speed of technology iteration and commercialization.""

In addition, China is advancing multiple fusion pathways at the same time, Xu emphasized.

Flagship facilities such as the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak, or EAST, in Hefei, have set world records by sustaining plasma temperatures above 100 million C for more than 1,000 seconds. Meanwhile, BEST is under construction in Hefei, to bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and future power plants, he said.

Rising confidence is reflected in capital flows. Guotai Haitong Securities estimated that fusion-related exchange-traded funds launched in 2025 brought 70 billion yuan of new capital into related sectors, reflecting rising expectations that fusion-related projects could translate into equipment orders in coming years.

Notably, a 2026 procurement plan released by the fusion industry alliance showed that more than 120 procurement projects are scheduled for this year, centered on tasks including the upgrade of EAST and BEST, with total funding approaching 10 billion yuan.

At the conference, Hefei Industry Investment Group unveiled a future fusion energy venture capital fund, with an initial size of 1 billion yuan. The fund will focus on key fusion technologies and core industrial segments, with a maximum lifespan of 15 years.

Jiang Xin, chairman of Hefei Industry Investment Group, said: ""We are clearly prepared to invest with long-term patience. Based on technological progress and industry outcomes, we will launch follow-up funds to meet the phased investment needs of the fusion industry.""",http://image.cns.com.cn/ecns_editor/transform/20260119/tUSl-heywhna5927711.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 01:59:22.338101

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said there have been ""huge strides toward affordability"" through regulation cuts and an increased focus on producing cars in America.

The average age of a vehicle on American roads is 13, which is ""way too old,"" Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said.

""If we have more affordable cars and more people can put a new car in their driveway, those are safer cars,"" Duffy said. ""That's what we want for American families and that's why this affordable push is so critical.""

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin blamed the high cost of new cars on car companies feeling like they had to focus on EVs. The officials said Trump ending what they called the ""EV mandate"" — referring to Biden-era government incentives for companies to create more EVs in order to avoid greenhouse gas emissions — was one of the administration's biggest moves to help the auto industry.

""When government policy is dictating to the manufacturer what kind of a vehicle they have to create, even though Americans don't want it, that comes with a cost,"" Zeldin said. ""When you have to be hiring workers, and you have plants built, and you're spending all that time, energy and money, and you're doing the research, and the development, to come up with a vehicle that Americans do not want to buy, that causes prices to go up.""

Advocates for government incentives to increase EV production say it's an important step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions that enact climate change.

In December, Trump announced he was rolling back the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and trucks set by the Biden administration, which required automakers to increase the miles per gallon for new cars and encouraged electric vehicle production, USA TODAY reported.

""Their decision on CAFE standards, the significance of it to benefit the U.S. market and American consumer to make it realistic and practical to apply common sense,"" Zeldin said.

Earlier in 2025, Trump signed legislation that ended fuel economy penalties for automakers.

Zeldin also cited the EPA push to eliminate the credit automakers received for implementing start-stop, the feature that automatically turns the engine off when a car is idling, as a push for affordability.

Before heading to Detroit, the officials made stops at manufacturing plants in Ohio and appeared at the Toledo Auto Show this week.

The government is intensifying its policy efforts to raise the national greenhouse gas reduction target (NDC) and expand the adoption of electric vehicles, aiming to accelerate the transition to a carbon-neutral society. However, many in the field assess that the spread of electric vehicles is not meeting expectations.

The primary reason is still the high initial purchase price. With increasing fiscal burdens, it is difficult for the government to endlessly expand electric vehicle subsidies. Now is the time to move away from subsidy-centered policies and seek structural solutions through institutional innovation.

This means that while consumers own the vehicle, the battery is separately owned and managed by the manufacturer or a specialized business entity, or provided in a subscription or rental format, with this structure legally recognized. It represents a fundamental shift from the traditional automotive management system, which has bundled the battery as an inseparable part of the vehicle.

This transition is necessary because the economic characteristics of batteries are fundamentally different from those of conventional internal combustion engine components. Batteries are high-value assets, accounting for about 40% of a vehicle's manufacturing cost. Even after the vehicle's lifespan ends, they retain 70-80% of their original performance. After use, they can be repurposed for energy storage systems (ESS) or reused and recycled in various industries. They are independent economic goods from which key minerals such as lithium and nickel can be recovered.

Nevertheless, the current automotive management system still treats batteries as components subordinate to the vehicle, like engines or transmissions. Although a battery identification number registration system is in place, it is only for safety history management and does not provide for the legal separation of ownership. These outdated regulations are hindering the emergence of financial products, subscription services, and data-driven innovative businesses based on batteries.

International cases provide clear insights. In particular, China has institutionalized battery-swapping electric vehicles by recognizing batteries not as ""vehicle components"" but as ""assets subject to management.""

Furthermore, China officially operates a variety of battery services (BaaS) within its policy framework, including battery subscriptions, condition diagnostics, and data-driven management. By proactively establishing systems for insurance coverage, residual value assessment, and battery tracking and management, China has fostered a robust battery service ecosystem and market. This clearly demonstrates that the separation of battery ownership is not a technological issue, but a matter of policy choice.

In contrast, in Korea, the Automotive Management Act, circular economy policies, and insurance and financial systems operate in a fragmented manner. Attempting to separate battery ownership simultaneously raises issues across multiple ministries, such as accident liability, performance degradation management, restructuring of automotive finance, and adjustments to electric vehicle subsidies. Due to the lack of a control tower and a clear roadmap, institutional reform has been slow despite widespread recognition of its necessity.

Now, decisive action is needed for innovative growth and the transition to a circular economy. Through amendments to the Automotive Management Act, a legal basis should be established for the separate registration, transfer, and collateralization of battery ownership, with clear delineation of responsibilities.

In parallel, financial and insurance products specialized for BaaS must be designed, and a history management system for the rational sharing of battery life, safety (SOH), and driving data should be established. Furthermore, promoting the use of electric vehicle battery assets for distributed power generation and the activation of V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) integration is also a crucial task.

The separation of electric vehicle battery ownership is no longer an experimental idea. It is an urgent policy issue, with automakers such as Hyundai Motor Company, battery manufacturers, and startups all unanimously calling for its introduction. If the government and National Assembly accelerate institutional innovation, Korea's world-class battery manufacturing competitiveness will expand into the realms of finance, energy, and mobility services.

What's happening?

U.S. district judge Amit Mehta determined that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it singled out states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, as the AP reported.

The $7.6 billion of energy projects included support for hydrogen initiatives, carbon capture, battery plants, and electric grid updates. They were set to take place in 16 states, including California, Massachusetts, and Washington.

""Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,"" Mehta wrote.

Clean energy advocates supported that claim by noting that similar projects in Texas, among other red states, were left alone.

The Trump administration pushed back on the ruling. Energy Department spokesman Ben Dietderich insisted that officials ""evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars.""

The Environmental Defense Fund was one of the groups that filed the suit, and its general counsel, Vickie Patton, was having none of that explanation.

Patton argued the Department of Energy ""vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration,"" per the AP.

Why is the Trump administration's hostility to many types of clean energy important?

While this ruling serves as another loss to the Trump administration, it's becoming clearer that it will continue to obstruct many types of clean energy projects (it has shown support for select low-carbon endeavors, such as nuclear). But the clean energy sector can boost jobs, reduce dependence on dirty fuels like oil and gas, and cut down on pollution.

As energy bills are on the rise due to AI and data centers, expanding the energy mix will be critical to keeping up with demand. There's also the issue of fairness and political targeting.

Many of these projects are supported by the local community and provide employment opportunities and long-term benefits. As Patton argued, stripping them as retaliation for votes in an election is a petty move that flies in the face of the Constitution.

What's being done about clean energy projects in America?

States, clean energy advocates, and municipalities are continuing to challenge the Trump administration's dubious moves. On Monday, a judge allowed a long-awaited offshore wind project in Rhode Island and Connecticut to go forward despite a similar cancellation bid, per the AP.

The shift towards electrified transportation has exposed critical vulnerabilities in how advanced economies secure essential battery materials. Modern electric vehicle manufacturing faces unprecedented challenges as automakers navigate increasingly complex supply chains for critical battery materials. The Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal illustrates these broader systemic challenges, as Tesla's pursuit of non-Chinese graphite processing capabilities has encountered repeated technical delays.

Furthermore, this transition from fossil fuel dependence to electrified transportation has highlighted fundamental weaknesses in sourcing, processing, and securing access to essential minerals. Among these materials, graphite represents a particularly acute bottleneck, with processing capabilities concentrated in regions that may not align with strategic interests of major automotive markets. This case study reveals critical insights about supply chain diversification, technical specification challenges, and the intersection of industrial policy with private sector risk management.

Understanding Graphite's Critical Role in Battery Manufacturing

Natural graphite serves as the foundation for lithium-ion battery anode production, comprising approximately 90-95% of anode material by weight in most commercial battery designs. This proportion makes graphite the largest single component in battery cells, yet it receives significantly less attention than lithium, cobalt, or nickel in public discussions about critical minerals energy transition strategies.

The transformation from raw graphite flakes to battery-ready active anode material (AAM) requires sophisticated processing capabilities that few facilities outside China currently possess. Consequently, the conversion process involves several critical steps that demonstrate the complexity of establishing alternative supply chains.

The conversion process involves:

Spherical shaping: Raw graphite flakes must be mechanically processed into spherical particles

Purification: Achieving battery-grade purity levels above 99.95% carbon content

Coating application: Surface treatments to improve electrochemical performance

Size classification: Precise particle size distribution control for optimal battery performance

Battery-grade graphite specifications differ substantially from industrial applications. Automotive battery cells require consistent particle sizes typically ranging from 10-25 micrometers, with strict controls on impurity levels, surface area characteristics, and electrochemical properties. The Tesla 4680 battery cells demand particularly stringent specifications due to their larger format and higher energy density requirements.

However, processing yields from raw graphite to finished AAM typically range from 75-85%, meaning substantial material losses occur during qualification. These technical requirements explain why establishing new AAM production capabilities outside established supply chains presents such formidable challenges.

Chinese Market Concentration and Strategic Implications

China's dominance in graphite processing stems from decades of industrial development combined with access to both domestic and imported raw materials. Chinese companies control an estimated 65-70% of global natural graphite production and approximately 90-95% of spherical graphite manufacturing capacity worldwide.

In addition, this concentration creates multiple vulnerability points for Western automotive manufacturers. Supply security risks include trade policy disruptions affecting graphite exports, quality control challenges with distant suppliers, currency fluctuations impacting long-term pricing, and potential export restrictions on strategic materials.

Technical Integration Challenges

Limited visibility into Chinese processing methods

Difficulty customising specifications for specific battery chemistries

Intellectual property concerns around advanced coating technologies

Quality consistency variations between different Chinese suppliers

The Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal represents one of the most significant attempts to establish large-scale AAM production outside Chinese control. Syrah's Vidalia facility integrates raw material from the company's Mozambique mining operations with processing capabilities designed to serve North American automotive markets.

However, the repeated deadline extensions in this partnership illustrate the technical complexity of replicating established Chinese processing capabilities. Tesla issued its first default notice in July 2025, citing failures to deliver conforming AAM samples. Subsequent deadline extensions to November 2025, January 2026, and now March 2026 demonstrate the challenges involved in achieving automotive-grade specifications.

Technical Specification Challenges and Quality Control

The ongoing difficulties between Tesla and Syrah Resources highlight fundamental challenges in AAM production that extend beyond simple manufacturing scale-up. Automotive battery specifications require precise control over multiple technical parameters that affect both performance and safety.

What Are the Key Electrochemical Performance Standards?

Battery-grade graphite must demonstrate consistent performance across multiple test protocols. Furthermore, these standards represent critical benchmarks that distinguish automotive-grade materials from consumer electronics applications.

Coulombic efficiency: First-cycle efficiency typically above 92%

Cycling stability: Capacity retention over 1,000+ charge cycles

Rate capability: Performance at various charging speeds

Thermal stability: Safe operation across temperature ranges

SEI formation: Predictable solid electrolyte interface development

Particle Engineering Requirements

The conversion to spherical graphite requires precise control over multiple technical parameters. For instance, size distribution must maintain narrow particle size ranges for consistent packing, while surface morphology requires smooth surfaces for optimal electrolyte contact.

Tap density: Achieving target volumetric energy density

BET surface area: Controlling reactive surface area for safety

Syrah's challenges in meeting Tesla's specifications likely relate to one or more of these technical parameters. The company does not accept it is in default under the offtake agreement, suggesting disagreement about whether specification failures represent fundamental process deficiencies or addressable quality control issues.

The collaborative approach described in recent statements indicates both parties view the technical challenges as solvable rather than representing fundamental incompatibility. Tesla retains termination rights through February 9, 2026, providing additional pressure for resolution while maintaining the partnership framework.

Financial Structure and Risk Allocation in Battery Supply Agreements

The Tesla-Syrah agreement structure reflects broader trends in how automotive companies approach critical material sourcing. The four-year commitment for 8,000 tonnes annually provides Syrah with demand certainty while giving Tesla access to non-Chinese AAM production capacity.

Offtake Agreement Mechanics

Component Details Risk Allocation Volume Commitment 8,000 tonnes/year (32,000 total) Tesla demand risk Duration Four years from first delivery Long-term price stability Quality Standards Automotive-grade AAM specifications Syrah technical risk Termination Rights Performance-based with cure periods Shared resolution incentive

This structure differs from traditional commodity purchasing through spot markets or short-term contracts. The long-term commitment provides capital investment justification for Syrah while ensuring Tesla access to strategic materials outside Chinese supply chains.

Pricing mechanisms in such agreements typically include escalation clauses tied to inflation, energy costs, or raw material input prices. The specific pricing structure between Tesla and Syrah remains undisclosed, but likely includes provisions for cost adjustments given the volatile nature of battery metals investment markets.

Performance-Based Risk Management

The multiple deadline extensions reveal sophisticated risk management approaches in battery supply agreements. Rather than immediate termination upon specification failures, the partnership structure includes several collaborative elements.

Cure periods: Opportunities to address technical deficiencies

Collaborative resolution: Joint problem-solving rather than adversarial enforcement

Regulatory coordination: DOE approval requirements for modifications

Termination triggers: Clear performance deadlines with exit options

Government Support and Industrial Policy Integration

The Syrah Vidalia project benefits from substantial federal support designed to establish domestic battery material supply chains. The U.S. Department of Energy has provided comprehensive financial backing including loans, grants, and tax credits totalling approximately $487 million across the project lifecycle.

Federal Funding Structure

DOE Loan Program: $102 million in debt financing

Grant Funding: $220 million for facility construction

Tax Credits: $165 million through various federal programmes

This level of government support reflects recognition that battery recycling breakthrough developments and supply chain establishment require coordination between public and private sector investments. The Inflation Reduction Act provides additional policy framework supporting domestic battery manufacturing through production tax credits and supply chain requirements.

Strategic Mineral Classification

Graphite's designation as a critical mineral under various federal frameworks enables this level of support. The classification recognises that supply chain concentration creates national security vulnerabilities, private sector investment alone may be insufficient to establish alternative suppliers, and coordination with allied nations requires compatible supply chain infrastructure.

The DOE involvement in contract modifications between Tesla and Syrah demonstrates how government support creates additional stakeholders in private commercial relationships. Approval requirements for deadline extensions reflect federal interest in ensuring taxpayer-supported projects achieve intended strategic objectives.

Production Scaling and Industrial Benchmarking

Syrah's operational timeline illustrates the complexity of establishing new AAM production capabilities from greenfield development through commercial qualification. However, establishing Australia's strategic minerals reserve requires similar coordination between private sector capabilities and government strategic objectives.

Development Milestones

Phase Timeline Achievement Next Steps Construction 2022-2023 Facility completion Equipment commissioning Initial Production Q4 2023 Unpurified spherical graphite Process optimisation AAM Production Q1 2024 Active anode material output Quality qualification Commercial Validation 2024-2025 Customer specification trials Volume scaling

The facility's current capacity of 11,250 tonnes annually positions it as a significant supplier in North American markets. Furthermore, expansion potential to 45,000 tonnes represents meaningful competition to Chinese imports.

Industry Benchmarking

Established AAM producers typically require 18-24 months for customer qualification cycles, making Syrah's extended timeline, while challenging, not unprecedented in the industry. Processing efficiency targets of 85-90% represent standard expectations for mature operations.

Automotive specifications generally require higher consistency than consumer electronics applications, explaining the extended validation periods compared to other battery market segments. The distinction between automotive and consumer-grade materials creates different market segments with varying price premiums and specification requirements.

Alternative Supply Chain Scenarios and Market Implications

The outcome of the Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal will influence broader industry approaches to battery supply chain diversification. Several scenarios could reshape market dynamics depending on technical resolution success or partnership dissolution.

Success Scenario: Technical Validation Achievement

If Syrah meets Tesla's specifications by the March 2026 deadline, several market impacts become likely. Proof of concept demonstration that non-Chinese AAM production can achieve automotive specifications would provide volume scaling pathways to full 8,000 tonne annual production capacity.

Additional partnerships with other automotive manufacturers may pursue similar agreements, while investment replication could encourage similar projects from competitors. These developments would occur alongside broader US‑China trade impacts on global supply chain strategies.

Risk Scenario: Partnership Dissolution

Partnership termination would create different market dynamics. Tesla would need to accelerate relationships with other graphite suppliers, while Syrah would focus on consumer electronics and energy storage markets.

Consequently, the investment community would reassess non-Chinese supply chain development risks, potentially leading to revision of federal support strategies. These outcomes would influence policy implications for future critical mineral development initiatives.

Competitive Landscape Evolution

Regardless of immediate outcomes, the partnership has already influenced industry development. Other graphite projects have attracted increased investor interest in North American graphite development, while technology advancement continues improving yields and reducing costs.

Strategic partnerships see more automotive companies exploring long-term supply agreements, while geopolitical considerations drive government support for supply chain diversification initiatives.

Investment Framework for Critical Mineral Supply Chains

The Syrah-Tesla partnership provides insights for investors evaluating critical mineral supply chain opportunities across multiple commodities and processing stages. In addition, successful investment requires comprehensive evaluation across multiple technical and market dimensions.

Due Diligence Considerations

Successful investment in battery material supply chains requires evaluation across multiple dimensions. Technical capabilities include processing expertise and yield optimisation potential, quality control systems for automotive specifications, scalability of production processes, and intellectual property considerations.

Market Positioning

Customer validation and automotive qualifications

Geographic diversification benefits

Cost competitiveness versus established suppliers

Long-term contract security and pricing mechanisms

Policy Alignment

Government support availability and sustainability

Regulatory compliance and environmental standards

National security considerations and strategic mineral classification

International cooperation frameworks and trade policy consistency

Financial Structure Analysis

Investment evaluation must consider the extended development timelines characteristic of battery material projects. Capital intensity involves high upfront investments with extended payback periods, while cash flow timing depends on customer qualification completion.

Government support serves as risk mitigation versus market price subsidies, however, exit strategies remain limited during development phases. These factors require careful consideration when evaluating investment opportunities in the sector.

Regulatory Framework Evolution and Market Development

Federal policy development continues shaping market conditions for domestic battery material production through multiple regulatory channels. Recent policy developments create institutional support for supply chain diversification across various frameworks.

Critical Minerals Security Frameworks

Recent policy developments create institutional support for supply chain diversification. The Defense Production Act offers potential applications to graphite processing capacity, while trade policy coordination affects tariff structures on Chinese graphite imports.

Environmental regulations may favour domestic production, while technology transfer enables international cooperation agreements with allied nations. These frameworks indicate sustained government commitment to reducing import dependence for critical battery materials.

Investment Incentive Structures

The Inflation Reduction Act and related legislation create financial incentives for domestic battery supply chain development. Production tax credits provide incentives based on qualifying material output, while investment tax credits support capital expenditure for facility development.

Grant programmes offer direct federal funding for strategic projects, while loan guarantees provide risk sharing for large-scale industrial investments. However, effectiveness depends on successful private sector execution, as demonstrated by the ongoing Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal technical challenges.

Strategic Implications for Industry Evolution

The Syrah Resources Tesla graphite supply deal represents more than a bilateral commercial relationship; it serves as a critical test case for broader supply chain transformation strategies across the battery materials sector.

The extended timeline for technical qualification demonstrates that establishing alternative supply chains requires sustained commitment from both commercial partners and supporting government institutions. Success or failure will influence industry confidence in pursuing similar diversification strategies across other critical materials including lithium hydroxide, battery-grade nickel sulfate, and high-purity cobalt compounds.

Market development beyond Chinese supply chains ultimately depends on achieving cost competitiveness while maintaining quality standards. The Syrah project's outcomes will provide crucial data on whether non-Chinese production can achieve these dual objectives at commercial scale.

Furthermore, the partnership's resolution will establish precedents for similar agreements across the battery materials sector. Successful technical validation would encourage broader industry investment in alternative supply chains, while partnership dissolution might prompt reassessment of diversification strategies and government support mechanisms.

What's happening?

A recent survey by Autotrader showed that the U.K.'s move to charge EV drivers a per-mile tax has had a cooling effect on adoption.

Nearly half of respondents said they were less likely to make their next car an EV due to the new fee, which comes into effect in April 2028. It would add roughly an additional $325 to owners' expenses each year.

The move runs counter to the British government's stated goal of accelerating EV adoption, leading Autotrader CEO Nathan Coe to call the new tax ""incoherent and inconsistent,"" per The Times.

Part of the issue is that the U.K.'s EV transition has been so successful. Government revenue from taxes on gas sales has dropped; this EV levy could make up 25% of the shortfall.

""All cars contribute to the wear and tear on our roads,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said during the 2025 budget announcement. ""I will ensure that drivers are taxed according to how much they drive and not just by the type of car they own by introducing the EV Excise Duty on electric cars.""

Why is EV adoption important?

Electric vehicles are cheaper to run than gas cars, making the switch a major cost-of-living improvement.

On top of that, they release no tailpipe pollution. That means better local air quality and less pollution going into the atmosphere to exacerbate destructive weather patterns.

What's being done about EV adoption in the U.K.?

""We need more carrot and less stick if we're serious about the electric transition,"" said Ian Plummer, Autotrader's Chief Customer Officer. ""The Chancellor clearly needs to raise revenue, but if she wants to encourage EV adoption, she should think extremely carefully before introducing pay-per-mile charging for EVs.

""Drivers respond to incentives, and anything that puts up running costs for electric vehicles will slow that momentum. We've already seen changes to Vehicle Excise Duty this year, making the cost of driving new EVs more expensive.""

Gizmodo also asked xAI if the Colossus data centers are operating at reduced capacity while the permitting issues are being resolved.
We will update if we receive a useful response.","This past summer, activists at the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) announced they were going after Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, for what it claimed were “unpermitted gas turbines that threaten to make air pollution problems even worse,” in the Memphis area, where the xAI “Colossus” data centers are located. It appears the SELC has now prevailed, because the language of a general ruling from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding that type of turbine essentially confirms the activists’ assertion, undermining the Grok parent company’s legal rubric for using the equipment.

In order to serve the computational needs of products like the Grok AI chatbot, Grokipedia, and the Grok image generator, xAI was generating off-grid power for its data center with gas-powered turbines and classifying them as “non-road engines”—temporary generators, ostensibly used for more transitory purposes. That temporary status, it was apparently hoped, would have made them exempt from air quality requirements. The newly updated EPA rules clarify that using such turbines, even temporarily, does not confer any such exemption from clean air rules.

According to the Guardian, the placement of the initial “Colossus 1” turbines—which eventually came to number 35—benefited from a local loophole in environmental laws that says generators don’t require permits as long as they’re in place for 364 days or less. The Guardian’s reporting also notes that xAI now has locally permitted generators at the sites, but that the new EPA rules say the federal government is now in charge of such permitting, not the local authorities.

In a statement published by the NAACP, SELC senior attorney Amanda Garcia said this decision “makes it clear that companies are not—and have never been—allowed to build and operate methane gas turbines without a permit and that there is no loophole that would allow corporations to set up unpermitted power plants,” adding that her organization expects “local health leaders to take swift action to ensure they are following federal law and to better protect neighbors from harmful air pollution.”

This feels like a lifetime ago, but just under a year ago, during Elon Musk’s tenure at DOGE, Musk sought to slash EPA contracts with the stated aim of reducing government waste. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said at the time, “DOGE is making us better,” adding, “They come up with great recommendations, and we can make a decision to act on it.”

xAI’s media contact email address sends a three-word auto-reply in response to all inquiries, including one from Gizmodo about what the turbine situation currently is for the relevant facilities in Tennessee.

The research team analysed 777,000 patents and 1.3 million citations spanning 182 years of hydrogen technology development, revealing clear differences in progress across the system.

Dr David Dekker, a research fellow at Edinburgh Business School, Heriot-Watt University and the paper’s lead author, said: ""Distribution will become the dominant cost in any hydrogen system. Even as we get better at producing and using hydrogen, getting it where it's needed stays expensive.

“The problem is structural. Distribution requires massive pipeline networks and liquefaction plants that need billions in capital investment. Safety regulations and permitting processes are complex, so progress is slow.

“Most distribution infrastructure sits with a handful of major companies. They tend to share less knowledge than innovators in other hydrogen fields. In capital-intensive sectors where competitive advantage matters, companies are far less likely to publish innovations openly. This slows progress across the entire sector.”

Professor Dimitris Christopoulos who co-authored the findings is director of research for the Edinburgh Business School and Heriot-Watt University’s School of Social Science. He said: ""We cannot have a hydrogen economy without the infrastructure to move it around. Right now, that is the fundamental missing piece.

“The 2015 Paris Agreement requires rapid scaling of clean energy technologies, but infrastructure bottlenecks could undermine major investment programmes. The question now is whether policymakers and industry will act before distribution costs make hydrogen uncompetitive.”

The findings reveal where the hydrogen system is most vulnerable showcasing that pipes, terminals and liquefaction plants needed to move hydrogen safely and affordably are lagging behind. This matters because distribution is what links the entire hydrogen system together. Without it, production stays concentrated near manufacturing sites, meaning the wider economy cannot make use of it and the climate benefits never materialise.

Professor Mercedes Maroto-Valer who leads the UK Industrial Decarbonisation Research and Innovation Centre (IDRIC), said: “As the BBC recently reported on Germany’s green hydrogen industry, hydrogen faces a classic chicken-and-egg problem: industry won’t commit at scale without pipelines, terminals and reliable delivery, but those networks won’t be built at scale without firm industrial demand. What this new Heriot-Watt research adds is hard evidence that distribution innovation moves much more slowly than the rest of the hydrogen system, so without targeted action to de-risk infrastructure, the distribution costs and uncertainty will keep holding the market back.”

Targeted policies, incentives for greater knowledge sharing, creation of open technical standards and publicly backed demonstration projects would all reduce risk for industry and speed up the development of viable distribution solutions.

The paper ""Dynamics of knowledge production: A relational-event analysis of patent citation hazards in hydrogen technologies"" was published in Sustainable Futures.

His political career was marked by moments of environmental foresight, voter mobilization, and infrastructure support. Born in Tacoma, Swift attended Central Washington College before undertaking a career in broadcasting, where he mastered the art of communication and was awarded a regional Emmy for his work. Later, Swift moved into politics and was elected to represent five Washington counties at the congressional level in Washington, D.C.. Swift transitioned into increasingly influential positions, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Administration Committee. Key bills guided by Swift included the Elwha River Restoration Act, National Voter Registration Act, and Amtrak Authorization Act. By 1994, he had helped oversee 177 bills progress into law, and worked across the aisle to achieve results for the state. Leaving Congress, Swift held a series of lobbying positions in Virginia before his death in 2018 at the age of 82.

Media Man

Allan Byron Swift was born in Tacoma on September 12, 1935. One of two sons of a Coca-Cola truck driver, Swift lived on McKinley Hill in the center of town. His mother served as a superintendent of a Sunday school, and it was in Tacoma where Swift met his future wife, Paula Jackson, at the age of 12. He attended Lincoln High School and served as the editor of the student newspaper. His brother, Larry Swift, remarked to The Seattle Times that Al ""became very interested in radio as a young boy"" to the extent that he set up a mock station room at home (""8-Term Washington Congressman ...""). Following high school, Swift attended Whitman College in Walla Walla from 1953 to 1955 and then worked for KUJ, a radio station a short distance east of Tacoma – his first employed position in broadcasting proper. (KUJ continues to operate as of January 2026.) In 1957 he moved to Ellensburg, where he was employed by KXLE and graduated from Central Washington College.

Swift then moved to Bellingham and began a long tenure with KVOS-TV. Employed as director of news and public affairs, he covered a local events for an increasingly wide audience. The Anacortes American reported in 1972, for example, on Swift’s meeting with a local chapter of Soroptimists. Perhaps signaling his later turn to politics, Swift noted that he ""particularly enjoys interviewing political candidates"" and that talking with ""Governor [Dan] Evans made for enlightening conversation"" (""Soroptimists Hear KVOS Broadcaster""). By 1976 Swift had been awarded a regional Emmy for his programming on tide pools, and by 1977 he had joined the office of U.S. Congressman Lloyd Meeds (1927-2005), a Democrat from Washington’s Second Congressional District – a vast area including all of Whatcom, San Juan, Island, and Skagit counties, along with the most populous parts of Snohomish County. Thus began Swift's transformation into one of the state's longest-serving public officials.

Entering Politics

Swift first worked for Meeds as an administrative assistant, gaining experience before his own attempt at election. He was tasked with handling minor party operations and the general public. He was noted for having presented regional energy plans at the Skagit County Courthouse on behalf of the congressman in 1977. Meeds had become the representative for the district following a comfortable election victory in 1964, when he defeated incumbent Republican Alfred Westland (1904-1982). Meeds represented a turn in state politics, particularly after his comments about the 1974 Boldt decision, which affirmed Native American fishing rights. Meeds was derided for asking his constituents to move on from the issue. Following a narrow win in 1976, Meeds made plans to leave politics, opening a path for Swift to fill his seat.

On the campaign trail, Swift moved quickly to secure critical voting bases and appeared in the media with commentary designed to support small businesses, voter representation, and transportation. Speaking to the Anacortes American in June 1978, Swift declared his intent to oppose large oil tankers and a new terminal at Cherry Creek near Blaine, an issue that has been debated as recently as 2023. In September 1978, Swift held a campaign dinner in Mount Vernon, inviting members of the public to join him for an 'authentic Mexican' meal prepared by Greg and Mary Espinoza. Swift used events such as these to solidify his base, meet people, and capitalize on his communication skills. By late September, Swift had secured the Democratic nomination. His opponent was Republican John Nance Garner III. David Horsey (b. 1951), a reporter for The Eatonville Dispatch, covered part of the race, noting Swift’s ""smooth style"" and ""aggressive, effective campaign"" (""Campaign ’78: A Battle of Images""). Newspaper advertisements touted Swift’s record, including statements about the 1974 Boldt decision and his desire to 'restore equity' to fishing as well as financial policy.

Swift’s campaign was buoyed by Democrat support in November when Senator Henry Jackson (1912-1983) visited Anacortes and endorsed him. Primarily, Jackson spoke to the city’s concern for its industries, which faced increasingly tight restrictions on the disposal of contaminants and air quality. Swift won the election comfortably against Garner with a platform based on moderate, reasonable politics. By January 1979 he was in Washington, D.C., to begin the first of his eight terms of service to the district.

Busy in Both Washingtons

In the nation's capital, Swift took a no-nonsense approach to the environment. He introduced his first bill to the House of Representatives in 1979: House Bill 2821, which called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct further flood control along the Skagit River. While the bill didn’t pass, it coincided with Swift doubling down on construction concerns and other infrastructure related to water, power, and transportation. He is noted for having publicly supported the Northwest Power Act, which provided a regional model for collaborative management of hydroelectric infrastructure. Also in 1979, Swift went toe to toe with representatives from Texaco and the Shell Oil Company over a potential project in the Cherry Point area. Swift insisted that a pipeline be built to replace regular tanker trips, citing the reduction of potential harm to the environment, and greater efficiency with the ultimate goal of saving taxpayer funds. Ultimately, environmentalist resistance killed the Cherry Point project entirely, but Swift continued to explore energy issues, charged by the economic 'stagflation' of the 1970s.

Before the end of 1980, Swift had introduced three bills regarding power and infrastructure in the state, and spoken publicly about increasing demands for future development. His first successful bill, however, didn't come until 1983 with the passing of HR 3376, which explicitly recognized land held in trust for the Makah Tribe. It followed a series of remediation efforts over the status of fishing in the state, and crucially preserved the rights gained in the Boldt case almost a decade before. Swift would provide emergency consultations for other fishermen as the industry continued to suffer economic hardships across the decade.

By 1985, Swift had won re-election comfortably three times and continued to meet community members as issues changed in the state. Healthcare became an increasingly important topic, and Swift spent much of 1985 discussing elder care, Medicare, and hospital management. In March 1985, he returned to Bellingham to host a forum on the issue and address the concerns of senior citizens. Now established with the day-to-day operations of a sitting congressman, Swift navigated Ronald Reagan's presidency and a changing world. He started that year on his second bill, which would be passed and signed into law. HR 4393, known as the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, repealed two previous acts regarding voting rights and set the precedent for a later piece of legislation. In essence, the act further developed the rights of U.S. citizens to participate in elections from outside the country. Post offices were instructed to provide materials for this purpose free of charge, including write-in ballots, campaign materials, and absentee-ballot applications. This less-than-controversial bill passed both the House and Senate without amendment and was signed into law in August 1986, before the campaign cycle began again.

Main Bills

Once again winning re-election, Swift looked to increasingly complex issues for legislative challenges. He had by 1986 secured positions on several committees, including the Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Administration Committee. Both gave Swift a broad understanding of D.C. politics and how to leverage bipartisan support for infrastructure. These experiences would allow Swift to become a ""workhorse"" congressman, sponsoring and cosponsoring a series of important bills (""Former U.S. Rep. Al Swift ..."").

The Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act demonstrated some of Swift’s political tact. Passed by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and then the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the bill included a series of stipulations relating to rail regulations. Specifically, the bill required the Secretary of Transportation to further tighten safety protocols for maintenance workers and issue equipment for working on bridges. Power brakes on locomotives, radios, hazardous materials, and penalties had all been attended to in the wording of the bill. A pilot program was established to assign litigators to regional offices, with several previous laws being revised in the process.

There were ample reasons to improve rail safety. A 1989 incident in San Bernardino, California, in which a Southern Pacific Railroad freighter demolished several houses and killed four people, had heightened concern just a few years before. In 1987, an Amtrak passenger train accident in Maryland resulted in 16 deaths. The Rail Safety bill passed into law by the end of 1992, without much opposition. Simultaneously, Swift helped pass the Amtrak Authorization and Development Act, which focused much less on safety regulations and more on the ability of the company to finance expanding operations. Also in 1992, Swift helped restore Amtrak service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. This service is still in use as of 2026, having been halted for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and returning as travel restrictions were lifted.

Dam Buster

Swift’s experience with environmental and power-related issues would come to bear on HR 4844, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act. Designed to end the legal debate over the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams on the Olympic Peninsula, it provided a framework for dam removal and established a precedent for tribes, fishing interests, and states working around endangered species and aging hydropower. Specifically, after consultation with the city of Port Angeles, the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, Bonneville Power Administration, and other stakeholders, the bill instructed the Secretary of the Interior to acquire both dams. Further, it provided replacement power from the BPA grid and money for a tribal cultural facility.

Debates over the structures had started as early as 1937, following their construction by Canadian entrepreneur Thomas Aldwell (1868-1954) from 1910 to 1927. The wide variety of opinions and stakeholders, however, had halted a majority of removal attempts until the dams came up for relicensing in 1973. The Lower Jamestown S’Klallam, the National Park Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intervened in the application process and began a formal legal process to initiate removal. Swift worked with these groups, the town of Port Angeles, the dam owners, and the public to secure an agreement and pass it into law in October 1992. Successive congressional sessions would deliberate over where the funding to acquire the dams would come from, resulting in a delay of two decades between the act and final removal. The project continues to mark a significant moment in the management of large-scale infrastructure not only in Washington but also in the wider Pacific Northwest. The act, little appreciated before the final removal of the dams in 2010 and 2014, has since been the blueprint for removals such as the Klamath River project in Oregon and Northern California.

Upon passage of the bill, Swift wrote a private letter to President George H. W. Bush (1924-2018) requesting ""the pen you use to sign HR 4844, the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act"" (""Letter to President ...""). Internal documents from Swift’s office, now housed at the Center for Pacific Northwest Studies in Bellingham, detail Swift's deep sense of satisfaction following the vote.

More Victories

Swift also helped pass the 'Motor Voter' bill during this period, which became effective in May 1993. Building on his previous bill regarding overseas voting, HR 2 streamlined the methods by which U.S. citizens could be registered to vote. At a federal level, this meant that anyone who submitted an application for a driver's license was automatically registered to vote unless they decided to opt out. Furthermore, the act protected voters from being removed from the registry for changes of address, unless there was no change notice provided. Again, Swift had demonstrated his ability to work within the fine grain of regulation for the benefit of all, and not simply those who shared his party affiliation. It is unsurprising then that the bill was cosponsored by more than 73 members of Congress. It would mark the last piece of major legislation authored by Swift, although he continued to support other efforts.

Later in 1993, he cosponsored legislation introduced by Republican congresswoman Nancy Johnson (b. 1935) to extend Medicare policies, and another bill introduced by Republican Elton Gallegly (b. 1944) to permit penalty-free withdrawals on retirement funds for emergency expenses. But the eight terms of service that Swift had conducted for Washington and the nation were coming to an end. In 1992, Swift had announced that he wanted just one more term before retiring from his post. He had led a successful office for over a decade, passing major bills and working closely with allies such as Democrat Norm Dicks (b. 1940), who represented Washington's Sixth District for 36 years.

Republicans Jack Metcalf (1927-2007) and Tim Erwin, and Democrat Harriet Spanel (1939-2016) competed for the soon-to-be vacant seat. Metcalf prevailed easily, ending the longstanding Democratic representation in the Second District.

Lobbying and Retirement

Having regularly moved between Washington state and Washington, D.C., Swift settled in Virginia following his retirement from Congress. He continued to apply his knowledge of railroad legislation and management, serving as vice president of government affairs for Burlington Northern Railroad. Serving only a year before the company merged with Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe, Swift briefly started his own consultancy before joining as a partner at Colling, Swift & Hynes. The Virginia-based lobbying group employed several public figures, including Robert Hynes (1936-2023), a former legislative vice president at NBC, and lobbyist Pablo Colling.

Swift worked with companies such as Eastman Kodak to advance interests in the halls of power and continued to engage with national politics in a variety of capacities. In 2006, he appeared before a Senate committee to provide testimony on lobbying regulations alongside Senator Barack Obama (b. 1961) and Senator John McCain (1936-2018), among other notable figures. The debate over lobbying featured a variety of opinions and discussed alternative regulations, notably whether or not meals should be regulated. By 2007, the firm's client list had grown to include the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Media General Inc., the Newark Group, and Quest Diagnostics.

The remainder of Swift’s working career was spent in this way. He continued to review regulations, government materials, and other legislative documents. In one of his final visits to Washington state, and last public comments, Swift toured the site of the removed Elwha and Glines Canyon dams on the Olympic Peninsula. Overlooking the watershed by air and on foot, he told Cascadia Weekly that he was ""very impressed with the work and that salmon have already returned to their former habitat above the dams"" (""The Week That Was"").

By 2018, Swift had retreated from public service entirely following a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He died on April 20, 2018. The Seattle Times published an obituary and editorial, noting Swift’s fondness for jazz and cigars, and his dedication to public service.",https://www.historylink.org/Content/Media/Photos/Small/AlSwift-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 20:58:35.151554

Stephen Moore is a former Trump senior economic adviser and the cofounder of Unleash Prosperity.","The Trump administration took a well-deserved victory lap last week for repealing more than 100 Biden-era rules for every new regulation. This will save U.S. businesses potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of unnecessary costs. Gone are discriminatory racial preferences, Green New Deal mandates and electric vehicle mandates — to name a few.

President Donald Trump has solidly established himself as the “deregulation president.”

That’s why it’s an ongoing mystery why the Trump Treasury Department and IRS have refused to repeal one of former President Joe Biden’s most onerous rules of all: targeting business partnerships for $50 billion of new tax liabilities. Business partnerships are a common legal form of American business arrangements.

This giant stealth tax increase was never voted on or approved by Congress. It appears to be a blatant violation of the constitutional requirement that all tax bills start in the House of Representatives. The House never even saw this tax hike coming. Talk about a “danger to democracy.”

The U.S. has more than 4 million partnerships — employing more than 10 million people — that could be affected.

Many small family businesses use partnership arrangements routinely.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Tax Reform, the National Taxpayers Union and the Job Creators Network have all urged the GOP to rescind the Biden backdoor tax increase.

Back in September, The Wall Street Journal pummeled the Biden rules as an “extralegal” plot to go around Congress and squeeze higher business taxes out of employers. The WSJ noted that the tax hike was finalized just days before Trump took office as part of the quest for more revenue to pay for trillions of dollars of budget-busting programs.

These partnership rules are “functioning like the administrative state’s own version of a deep state rebellion,” writes my friend and Unleash Prosperity colleague Steve Forbes. They are nothing more than a tool for “punishing Main Street.”

He’s right. The regulations created a new IRS auditing SWAT team with agents whose sole purpose is to harass partnerships in a guilty-until-proven-innocent “compliance” process. Several companies are facing multibillion-dollar retroactive tax assessments that go back four to five years. These are deductions on activities that were previously untaxed under the IRS code. So much for the rule of law.

The Trump administration has supercharged the U.S. economy for 2026 in no small part by repealing these kinds of Biden-era antibusiness taxing and regulating policies.

Former Trump chief economist Larry Kudlow is predicting 4% to 5% growth for the year ahead. Reaching that ambitious target would be an amazing feat made all the easier to achieve if the Trump IRS would repeal the most conspicuous remaining antibusiness Biden policy: the $50 billion sucker-punch assault on legal business partnerships.

The Tesla Lithium Refinery just outside of Corpus Christi, Texas, is another step toward the U.S. goal of having domestic refined lithium resources to counter China’s market dominance.

“Our Lithium Refinery ushers in energy independence for North America,” Tesla North America said in the caption of a video announcing that the plant is operational, just two years after breaking ground.

The refinery converts spodumene ore directly into battery-grade lithium hydroxide, in a first-of-its-kind process in North America.

Tesla uses a new technology platform that allows a cleaner, simpler, and cheaper process to obtain battery-grade lithium from the raw material, spodumene ore, says Jason Bevan, Site Manager for Tesla’s Gulf Coast Lithium Refinery.

Tesla says it sustainably sources spodumene and brings it to site where it runs it through a series of conveyance systems, takes it through a kiln and a cooler. From there, the material is taken through an alkaline leech and additional purification steps, and then into crystallization to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide.

“Our process is more sustainable than traditional methods and eliminates hazardous byproducts and instead produces a co-product named anhydrite used in concrete mixes,” a refinery employee says in the Tesla video.

Tesla notes that this refinery enables it to have access to the critical minerals for energy storage, for battery manufacturing, and ultimately for EV growth.

The first-of-its-kind lithium refinery in North America also enables Tesla to accelerate its mission by “regionalizing supply chains for battery minerals and materials, by providing jobs, by cutting emissions from transportation that's required for those supply chains.

“It really allows us to usher in energy independence for North America,” Tesla says.

The company’s new domestic lithium refinery is one of the first concrete steps for America to reduce dependence on refined lithium supply on China.

The U.S. has been trying for years to break that industrial and national security dependence on critical minerals used in battery technology and defense, military, and automotive technologies.

The Trump Administration took this fight a notch up by directly investing, through the Departments of Defense and Energy, in minority stakes in North American lithium producers and refiners. That’s to ensure access to a domestic supply of key minerals and create jobs in the minerals supply chain.

The U.S. Administration is increasingly looking to have a direct equity involvement in America’s critical minerals supply chain, in the race to close the gap with China.

Direct Administration bets on lithium mining projects were a key theme in the sector last year.

For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) has agreed to provide a $2.26 billion loan to Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corp. to help it complete a major lithium project in Humboldt County in northern Nevada.

For the first draw on the DOE loan, the Department received a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas through warrants to purchase common shares, as well as a 5% economic stake in Lithium Americas’ joint venture with GM for the Thacker Pass lithium project in Nevada.

Lithium Americas targets late 2027 for the mechanical completion of the Thacker Pass project, in which GM last year bought a 38% interest for $625 million in total cash and letters of credit.

Thacker Pass is expected to be the biggest lithium supply project in the Western hemisphere. Thacker Pass alone is expected to raise nearly ten times the current U.S.-sourced lithium volumes.

In addition, in July 2025, U.S. rare earths miner and magnet producer MP Materials Corp announced it had entered into a public-private partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD) to accelerate the build-out of an end-to-end U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain and reduce foreign dependency.

The direct involvement of the U.S. federal government highlights the importance the Administration places on securing domestically-sourced critical minerals and reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, most notably China.

Despite the end of federal tax credits for solar panel installations, WPS customers can still benefit from clean energy projects, which have provided tens of millions of dollars in savings. WPS aims to be net carbon neutral by 2050 and has already reduced emissions by 56% since 2005.",https://abcnews4.com/resources/media/a9f10a54-1163-4942-b6d2-abfefa4dc655-jumbo16x9_SOLARPANELSRAW_frame_1261.jpeg?1682027702772,N,,2026-01-18 19:58:54.135447

While other data centers in Archbald were able to move forward under legacy zoning by applying prior to the zoning amendment, the Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus needed zoning relief due to the land’s residential and conservation zoning.
Composed of 14 two-story data centers, each up to 80 feet tall with a 202,340-square-foot footprint, the Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus is one of the largest campuses proposed in Lackawanna County.
Despite that, the entire power plant would not be enough to fuel Wildcat Ridge if it were connected directly to the facility.","A proposed data center campus will rise above Business Route 6 in Archbald while pumping in up to 3.3 million gallons of water per day and using more electricity than the region’s largest natural gas power plant can produce.

The Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus became Lackawanna County’s first data center proposal when representatives approached Archbald officials in January 2025 to tout a $2.1 billion investment into data centers for artificial intelligence, but there was little information on how the project would impact local utilities. A 777-page conditional use application submitted to the borough last month provides the clearest picture of just how much water and electricity are needed to sustain 5.66 million square feet of data centers near Archbald’s Eynon and Sturges sections. If Archbald Borough Council approves the project, Brooklyn-based Cornell Realty Management LLC wants to build 14 data centers across 574.2 mountainside acres, including former mine land, along Business Route 6 and Route 247, or Wildcat Road. The commercial section of the campus also calls for a grocery store, an office building and mixed-use building.

The campus would use 1,600 megawatts of power, and to offset its water demands that top out at 3.3 million gallons per day, the data center campus is exploring tapping into the mine water below as a source of cooling for its computers.

Isaac Hagar, managing partner of Cornell Realty Management LLC, 347 Flushing Ave., Suite 800, Brooklyn, New York, is listed as the applicant in the Dec. 15 application.

The location quickly drew scrutiny from residents who urged Archbald officials to restrict data centers to industrial land across the Casey Highway. The opposition came amid Archbald’s efforts to amend its zoning to define, regulate and designate where data centers can be built. The Wildcat Ridge property is zoned for residential and conservation uses, and it was previously proposed to have a housing community with nearly 2,000 multifamily residential units, an additional 120 residential lots and 1.2 million square feet of commercial space. Borough council gave Wildcat Ridge the zoning relief it needed to move forward with the conditional use process when it adopted a data center zoning ordinance in November that made data centers conditional uses in multiple overlay districts throughout the town. As conditional uses, developers are required to attend a public hearing and adhere to a slew of conditions established by the borough in order to receive approval from council.

While other data centers in Archbald were able to move forward under legacy zoning by applying prior to the zoning amendment, the Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus needed zoning relief due to the land’s residential and conservation zoning.

Following Wildcat Ridge’s initial proposal, and driven by both increased demand for artificial intelligence as well as local access to high-tension power lines and high-speed fiber optic internet lines, Archbald received applications for four more data center campuses — giving the town the highest concentration of data centers in the region with 44 buildings across five campuses. More data centers are proposed in Clifton and Covington townships, Dickson City, Jessup and Ransom Twp. Plans for up to four data centers in Blakely were also proposed and subsequently withdrawn.

Archbald Borough Council will hold a public hearing on Wildcat Ridge’s conditional use application Jan. 28 at 6 p.m. in the Valley View High School auditorium, 1 Columbus Drive, Archbald, according to a public notice published Tuesday in The Times-Tribune.

Council President Dave Moran declined to comment due to pending legal action.

What is Wildcat Ridge?

Composed of 14 two-story data centers, each up to 80 feet tall with a 202,340-square-foot footprint, the Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus is one of the largest campuses proposed in Lackawanna County. The site is bounded by a PPL Electric Utilities access road across to its west near the Blakely border, continuing east along Business Route 6 until its split with Wildcat Road, and then moving up Wildcat for more than half a mile. The project is divided into an 11-data-center north campus and a three-data-center south campus. Tinklepaugh Creek flows between the north and south campuses, according to a site master plan included with the application.

Every data center would have 40 emergency generators, each with its own 1,000-gallon diesel fuel reservoir, totaling 560 generators, in addition to 60 cooling devices for computer hardware known as chillers on every rooftop. The generators and utility yards will face west up the mountain to reduce the potential for noise pollution, and the chillers would be screened, according to the application.

The master plan also depicts two substations — a 326,000-square-foot primary user substation and a 69,000-square-foot secondary user substation — a 3.75 million gallon water storage tank that would be about 101 feet in diameter, and a 33,000-square-foot admin and logistics building. Written descriptions of the water tower in the application describe it as 3 million gallons.

Just below the data centers, Cornell Realty Management plans to build 316,000 square feet of commercial space. Plans show a 50,000-square-foot grocery store with 1,800 square feet of retail space; two four-story, 85,000-square-foot buildings, with one mixed use and the other an office; and a 96,000-square-foot surface parking lot with about 360 spaces. Archbald officials have long looked to revive the town’s struggling Business Route 6 corridor in Eynon, which never recovered after the closure of the popular Sugerman’s shopping center in 1995, and Cornell’s plans promise to help accomplish that.

“Cornell Realty Management is committed to revitalizing the once vibrant commercial zone along the Business Rte. 6 corridor,” the company said in its application.

The entire campus would generate an estimated 2,500 new vehicle trips per day, representing a 13.6% increase in local traffic volume, according to the plans.

There will be a western entrance on Business Route 6 in Eynon near Terrace Drive, and there will be an east entrance on Wildcat Road after its split with Business Route 6.

The campus would create 1,280 permanent “high-wage” jobs divided into three shifts operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, according to a project summary. The developers estimate the project would generate more than $44 million annually in revenue for local governments, with $7.4 million going to Archbald, $21.8 million to the cash-strapped Valley View School District, and $15.2 million to Lackawanna County. The developer also promises “significant investment” into both local STEM and career and technical education programs, with scholarships, internships and equipment donations, as well as fully funding any emergency responder training and specialized equipment.

The property owners selling their land to make way for the campus are: Pine Line Inc., Timothy J. Seaman, James L. and Michael A. Booth, and Archbald Ventures LLC, according to the application. Pine Line sold 249.87 acres of the land to Archbald Ventures LLC of Suffern, New York, for $4 million in February 2024, with Jeffrey and Alan Rudalavage signing the deed on behalf of Pine Line as president and secretary, respectively.

Water demands

The Wildcat Ridge Data Center Campus will use a daily average of 598,000 gallons of water, with a daily maximum of 3,310,149 gallons, according to the conditional use application. The developer attributes the range to the impact that temperature has on data center cooling systems between summer and winter, meaning the campus will use the most water when temperatures are hottest. At peak demand, the campus would require more water per minute than the average American family uses in a week. The campus would require just shy of 2,300 gallons per minute at 3.3 million gallons per day. The average American family uses about 300-plus gallons per day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

An existing 4-inch water main owned by Pennsylvania American Water would service the site.

As a condition required for its approval, the data center developer included a will-serve letter from PAW, though the utility notes in its Nov. 18 letter, “It is understood that this is not a commitment to reserve water, and that such amounts are subject to curtailment or other operational conditions that require PAWC to suspend or limit water sales.”

The data center campus would discharge about 78,000 gallons per day to the Lackawanna River Basin Sewer Authority’s wastewater treatment plant on Boulevard Avenue in Throop, according to the application and an attached will-serve letter from the sewer authority dated Nov. 24.

Neither the 777-page application nor the letter from PAW indicates where the water company would source the water, but during a Jan. 6 meeting in Archbald, representatives from another proposed data center campus in the borough, Project Gravity, revealed that they will use up to 360,000 gallons of water per day sourced from Lake Scranton to cool their seven data centers along Eynon Jermyn Road and Business Route 6.

The Lake Scranton Reservoir can produce up to 33 million gallons of water per day, according to PAW, and the utility’s 2024 annual water quality report for Lake Scranton notes that it already supplies 17.5 million gallons per day from its Lake Scranton system, which would leave 15.5 million in available capacity as of 2024. The Lake Scranton system serves the city of Scranton and all or parts of Archbald, Blakely, Dickson City, Dunmore, Jessup, Moosic, North Abington Twp., Old Forge, Olyphant, Scott Twp., South Abington Twp., Taylor and Throop, according to PAW.

The EPA reports that Lake Scranton serves 134,570 people, representing more than 60% of Lackawanna County’s entire population. If the Wildcat Ridge campus uses water from Lake Scranton, it would account for up to 21% of the remaining capacity, requiring enough water to fill five 660,000-gallon Olympic-sized pools every day at its maximum daily limit. It would cost $3.7 million-plus per year buying the water from PAW, according to the application.

“The developer understands the concerns presented by the community regarding the consumption of domestic water to feed the cooling systems necessary to maintain efficient and consistent operation of the computers located inside each data center building,” according to the application. “To offset domestic water usage, the developer has directed the design team to pursue potential alternative water sources.”

One of those alternatives is to use the existing mine pool aquifer beneath its campus to help cool its computers.

“Fortunately, when the water supply infrastructure was developed for the Lackawanna Valley, the water companies chose to construct a large network of reservoirs for the production of domestic water,” the company wrote. “These reservoirs rely solely on the collection and treatment of surface water sources. Therefore, extraction of water from the mine pool will not impact the regional quality or quantity of domestic water.”

The project does not require the use of mine water, but if it is determined to be beneficial, the developer said it would work with the state Department of Environmental Protection, the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Eastern PA Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation and the Lackawanna River Conservation Association.

Archbald resident John Mellow, a retired DEP geologist and a technical adviser with the Sierra Club’s Northeastern Pennsylvania Group, believes it’s possible to use mine water to cool data centers, but the location might not be feasible due to limited water directly beneath the campus, based on his limited review of a 2014 mine pool mapping report included in the application.

“It depends a lot on how much water they need from the mines,” Mellow said. “If they need small quantities to supplement what they’re getting, maybe it’ll work. If they’re looking for large volumes of water … it might be not really there.”

Mellow believes there is limited water beneath the site due to the geography of the valley. Comparing it to a piece of paper folded into a U shape, Mellow said water drains into the low point at the syncline, which is roughly where the Lackawanna River is, and as a site gets higher up from the syncline, like Wildcat Ridge, it will have access to less underground water.

While there is the potential that disturbing the water could lead to more subsidences, Mellow believes they would be localized to the data center property itself. He noted the developer has an included subsidence plan.

Beyond the significant water demands, Mellow pointed to the developer’s plans to use large quantities of electricity.

Powering data centers

PPL committed to service the data center campus with 1,600 megawatts of power once the developer completes more than $93 million worth of upgrades, according to the application. In addition to notifying the developer about its ability to transmit the requested power, PPL submitted its request to the PJM’s Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee for consideration. PJM is a regional transmission organization that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity throughout the eastern United States, including all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.

The developer reports PPL has infrastructure in place to manage about 40 gigawatts, or 40,000 megawatts, and Pennsylvania has the current capacity to produce 47 gigawatts, with a net increase of 16 gigawatts expected within the next decade.

An attached June 10 project feasibility study from PPL breaks the data center campus down into three phases following a five-year timeline based on distribution/transmission capacity availability. Phase 1 would be up to 300 megawatts and would take 36 months from authorization, Phase 2 would then increase to 1,000 megawatts within 36 to 40 months after the initial authorization, followed by Phase 3 bringing the project to full capacity over 48 to 60 months from authorization.

Less than 3 miles away, and almost directly across the valley from the campus, the Lackawanna Energy Center natural gas-fired power plant in Jessup was touted as the largest natural gas power plant in Pennsylvania and one of the largest in the country by producing 1,485 megawatts of electricity. Marketed as a state-of-the-art power plant with the capacity to power 1 million homes, the Lackawanna Energy Center emitted just over 3.7 million tons of greenhouse gasses in 2023, which is the most recent year available, according to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory for large facilities. Despite that, the entire power plant would not be enough to fuel Wildcat Ridge if it were connected directly to the facility.

With additional power generation leading to more greenhouse gas emissions and more global warming as a result, Mellow noted the compounding effect on the grid.

“All of a sudden now, you’re going to have a lot of people, due to climate change in the summer, using a lot more electricity for air conditioners,” he said, pointing to other data centers proposed nearby in Archbald, Dickson City and Jessup.

Cumulative effects

Mellow contends regulators need to look at data centers cumulatively, not on a case-by-case basis — a notion that has gained traction locally as proposals inundate the Midvalley. He floated petitioning the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to conduct a health study prior to data centers becoming operational to establish a baseline.

In late October, Archbald residents Justin Healey and his wife, Tamara Misewicz-Healey, who are the parents of three young children, formed the “Stop Archbald Data Centers” Facebook group, quickly amassing 3,200-plus members in 11 weeks. Residents use the page to livestream local meetings while creating hundreds of posts per month on data center proposals, not only in Archbald but surrounding communities. The Healeys also raised more than $16,600 through a GoFundMe campaign launched in November to fund a legal challenge to Archbald’s data center zoning ordinance.

“(Wildcat Ridge) is going to have a massive impact, and it’s going to have an impact in a lot more ways than we realize,” Justin Healey, 35, said.

He worried about draining up to 3.3 million gallons per day and if there could be impacts from tapping into mine water.

“Global heating trends are increasing, so we are going to see more of these ‘rare’ peaks,” he said. “The more I learn, the more it’s affirming everything that we initially thought and kind of pursued from there.”

The husband and wife are regulars at Archbald meetings, including testifying against the borough’s then-proposed data center zoning ordinance that ultimately let Wildcat Ridge move forward with the conditional use process.

It’s incredibly concerning, Misewicz-Healey, 37, said.

“I really feel like a lot of the local government, especially our council, is really just seeing the promises and not really looking at the big picture,” she said. “What we’re finding is we’re not sure anybody is looking at the big picture, and I think that is one of the scariest things about this regionally.”

By drawing up to 3.3 million gallons per day, Wildcat Ridge doesn’t impact just Archbald, it impacts the entire region, she said.

“We’re just getting either no answers or very little information at a time — just little bits, so we’ve really just been trying to piece all those little bits together to understand the scope of this,” Misewicz-Healey said. “For all of our local politicians, is there literally anyone overseeing sustainable, responsible development in Northeast Pennsylvania related to these data centers?”

If Wildcat Ridge ends up receiving water from the Lake Scranton system, which is still unknown, Misewicz-Healey stressed that the campus alone would consume as much as 21% of the system’s remaining capacity, not accounting for the other data centers proposed in Archbald, Dickson City and Jessup.

With 44 data centers proposed between Business Route 6 and Eynon Jermyn Road in Archbald, she also worried about flooding when developers replace forests with impervious surfaces, compounded by a request from the seven-data-center Project Gravity to permanently disturb 2.24 acres of wetlands for its campus.

“So while you’re clear cutting the mountains and you’re going to allow for more water to stream down faster, you’re simultaneously getting rid of the wetlands at the bottom of the mountain,” she said. “What kind of impact is that going to have?”

When council meets Jan. 28 at 6 p.m. at the Valley View High School auditorium for the conditional use hearing on Wildcat Ridge, Healey hopes for a large turnout — and that council members listen to the community.

“These are people’s lives, livelihoods, and it’s our whole community,” he said. “When I say community, not just Archbald — it’s our whole region that’s going to be impacted by these decisions, and they shouldn’t be taken lightly.”",https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/STT-L-DATA-0111-04-1.jpg?w=1024&h=576,N,,2026-01-18 22:58:02.470946

At home, electricity production is growing far faster than in most western peers, which is allowing utilities to deliver more power to the fast-growing and energy-intensive data centres and AI applications that are key drivers of the U.S. economy.

Overseas, the U.S. is set to cement its position as the largest and most influential exporter of crude oil and natural gas, which continue to underpin a vast majority of global energy systems and generate massive earnings for the U.S. Treasury.

The robust state of the U.S. energy sector makes good on U.S. President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” push, which looks set to gather even more momentum this year as further supportive energy policy measures are rolled out.

Below are the main metrics on electricity generation and fossil fuel production and exports to help track the state of the U.S. energy sector through 2026 and beyond.

ELECTRIC GROWTH

Total U.S. electricity generation by utilities climbed by 3% in 2025 from the year before, which marks the second straight year that wholesale electricity output posted a 3% or better rise, data from Ember showed.

That electricity supply growth rate compares to an annual average of 0.3% during the previous five years, and so clearly reveals that utilities have stepped up generation efforts.

The lift in total utility generation resulted from a 5% annual increase in electricity output from clean power supplies, and a 1% rise in output from fossil fuel power plants.

The United States’ 3% expansion rate in total utility supplies compares with just a 0.2% rise last year in total utility electricity generation in Europe, which remains gripped by an economic slowdown due in part to stubbornly high energy costs.

The U.S. growth rate matches the global average in 2025, but lags the 5% rise in utility electricity output posted by China.

In 2026, U.S. utilities are expected to lift electricity generation to new heights, thanks mainly to scheduled additions to solar and battery networks as well as the planned restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

However, scrapped federal support for renewable energy projects will slow the pace of new solar and wind capacity additions and may drag on the electricity output growth rate over the medium term.

OIL, GAS & COAL

While clean power sources gained a record share of the U.S. electricity mix in 2025, fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of the U.S. energy system and account for around 83% of total U.S. energy supplies, according to the Energy Institute.

Record production of both crude oil and natural gas in 2025 has helped fossil fuels maintain that heavy share of the energy supply mix.

U.S. crude oil output averaged 13.6 million barrels per day in 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), while dry natural gas production averaged 107.4 billion cubic feet per day.

The output of coal also increased in 2025 – by around 5% from the year before – but total U.S. coal production remains well below the levels of a decade ago due to reduced use in the domestic power generation system.

Natural gas remains the primary power fuel in the U.S., and accounts for around 40% of electricity production and is also a major power and heating source for industry.

Rising natural gas prices – driven by rising power use as well as record demand from LNG exporters – are expected to lift extraction rates from gas wells in 2026, especially in low-cost basins in close proximity to liquefied natural gas export hubs.

FOSSIL EXPORTS

LNG was the star of the U.S. energy export arena in 2025, with a record 252 million cubic meters shipped out, according to commodities intelligence firm Kpler.

Total LNG exports in 2025 jumped by 25% from the year before, and are poised for additional growth in 2026 as new liquefaction capacity comes online along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

The EIA has estimated that total U.S. LNG exports could climb by 9% in 2026 to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and will then rise to 1.7 Bcf/d in 2027.

The trajectory of U.S. crude oil exports in 2026 is less clear.

On the one hand, robust output combined with fairly flat domestic crude consumption suggests exporters will have ample supplies.

However, whether exporters will be able to ship out more than the 1.38 billion barrels they exported in 2025, according to Kpler, remains to be seen, as they will have to contend with higher supplies out of Venezuela following the U.S. ouster of Venezuelan President Maduro earlier this month.

U.S. exports of coal are also under pressure from declining global demand for the fuel and elevated competition from Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Russia and South Africa, which all enjoy shorter trade routes to major importers.

That said, U.S. President Trump’s strong support for the coal industry is expected to yield higher coal output and use by the power sector in 2026, so even if coal exports remain flat overall, coal output and use look primed for growth in 2026.",,N,,2026-01-18 17:59:04.759449

Through separate letters of intent signed with the Mexican Association of Private Industrial Parks (AMPIP) and the National Chamber of the Cosmetic Products Industry (CANIPEC), CONUEE aims to promote best practices, strengthen technical capacities and encourage voluntary commitments to efficient energy use.

At the signing with AMPIP, CONUEE Director General Israel Jáuregui Nares said energy efficiency must be integrated across the full industrial cycle, from design and operation to final energy consumption. He said the agreement enables Conuee to extend its technical and operational capabilities to a sector with significant economic and territorial impact. “We are convinced that energy efficiency must always come first. This agreement is the start of work that will yield benefits for national development and for industrial parks themselves,” Jáuregui Nares said.

AMPIP Director General Claudia Esteves Cano said the association represents 95% of Mexico’s industrial parks, with operations in 28 states and more than 4,000 companies. AMPIP includes 477 industrial parks currently in operation and 103 under construction. She said the goal is for all affiliated parks to adopt energy efficiency measures and obtain a distinction reflecting a commitment to sustainability.

Esteves Cano added that AMPIP-affiliated parks concentrate 99% of foreign direct investment in manufacturing and 98% of national manufacturing GDP. Collaboration with CONUEE, she said, will support energy diagnostics, training programs and the dissemination of best practices to improve competitiveness and environmental performance.

CONUEE officials said the AMPIP agreement establishes four main lines of action: strengthening technical capabilities, creating collaboration networks, organizing joint training events and providing technical assistance to affiliated parks. The initiative is aligned with the National Energy Efficiency Agreement (ANEE), which targets large energy users and emerging industrial development hubs.

In a separate ceremony, CONUEE signed a letter of intent with CANIPEC to promote energy efficiency and sustainable practices in the personal care and household products industry. The agreement was led by Jáuregui Nares and CANIPEC Executive President Carlos Ramón Berzunza Sánchez.

Jáuregui Nares said cooperation with manufacturing sectors is essential to position energy efficiency as a core element of sustainability and competitiveness. Berzunza Sánchez highlighted the industry’s role in quality of life and said responsible energy use must be embedded throughout the value chain.

CANIPEC representatives said the chamber acts as a link between companies, authorities and consumers to promote environmental protection. Sustainability and circular economy initiatives already underway will be strengthened through collaboration with Conuee, including technical training, workshops and voluntary agreements under Mexico’s energy planning and transition framework.

Diana Verónica Noriega Navarrete, CONUEE’s director of large energy users, said the ANEE provides a platform for companies in both industrial parks and consumer goods manufacturing to adopt practices that improve energy performance and support decarbonization.

CONUEE: Advancing Energy Efficiency in Mexico

The AMPIP and CANIPEC agreements build on a series of similar memorandums signed by CONUEE and industry groups in late 2025. In September, the Commission signed a letter of intent with Mexican Institute of Chemical Engineers (IMIQ), laying the groundwork for joint energy efficiency initiatives through 2029. The signing was led by Jáuregui Nares and Víctor Martínez, National President, IMIQ.

Within the framework of Mexico’s National Energy Efficiency Agreement (ANEE), CONUEE outlined priority actions, including improving energy management among major users and driving efficiency gains across industrial processes. According to the Commission, the partnership is designed to facilitate technical information exchange and the development of collaborative projects, reinforcing both institutions’ roles as key players in advancing sustainable energy use. For its part, IMIQ highlighted the contribution of chemical engineers to improving processes, proposing innovative solutions, and creating networks of expertise to promote best practices.

That same month, CONUEE signed another letter of intent with National Institute of Electricity and Clean Energy (INEEL) at INEEL’s headquarters in Cuernavaca, Morelos, involving Jáuregui Nares and INEEL Director General Víctor Salcido. At the signing, both officials emphasized that the agreement formalizes joint efforts to develop strategic projects, training programs, and technical capacity-building initiatives that support the country’s energy transition.

Under the agreement, CONUEE and INEEL are set to establish joint working groups to design methodologies and technical tools, share information, and organize workshops, courses, and training events. The collaboration will also include the promotion of knowledge networks focused on efficient energy management in key sectors of the Mexican economy.

Officials highlighted that the partnership will allow INEEL to expand the services it provides to both public and private companies, while CONUEE will be able to access national and international programs supporting energy efficiency and sustainability. Together, the institutions said they aim to build synergies with academic, public, and private organizations to reinforce Mexico’s role in global clean energy efforts.

CONUEE has also sought to integrate state government agencies in its energy efficiency initiatives. In October 2025, the Commission signed an agreement with the Jalisco State Energy Agency (AEEJ) to promote energy efficiency across the state and strengthen the technical capacities of government personnel. The collaboration built on workshops held in August and September of that year, which trained state and municipal staff on energy efficiency in public buildings, street lighting, and water pumping systems. The sessions encouraged the adoption of measures aimed at reducing energy consumption and optimizing the operation of public services.

Meanwhile, in March 2025, CONUEE signed another letter of intent with Campeche’s Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity, Climate Change, and Energy (SEMABICCE), seeking to expand joint cooperation on energy efficiency initiatives in the state. The agreement followed an earlier collaboration launched in 2023 to promote energy-saving programs in public buildings across Campeche.

The initiative was initiated to bolster the technical capacity of municipal governments and support the implementation of best practices for energy efficiency in public facilities. It also included training, technical assistance, and project development guidance focused on improving public lighting and potable water pumping systems.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Thursday unanimously approved a site permit for the Duluth-based utility's $163.5 million, 85-megawatt solar project adjacent to its Boswell Energy Center in Cohasset. The project will also include a new substation and a nearly 3-mile, 230-kilovolt transmission line linking it to the existing substation at Boswell.

Solar panels are expected to cover about 500 acres of land, approximately half of which is owned by Minnesota Power, with the other half leased from other property owners.

""We're excited to get the permits and get the authorization to get to work on that when the snow melts,"" said Julie Pierce, vice president of strategy and planning at Minnesota Power.

Carrie Ryan, enterprise project manager, said work on the project will begin this spring, with the array coming online in fall 2027.

The company's larger, 800-acre, 119-megawatt project in Royalton, which is also permitted, has a similar construction timeline.

When complete, the two solar projects will be the company's largest, surpassing its 15-megawatt Sylvan solar project near Brainerd, which came online in 2023.

The Boswell and Royalton projects represent more than two-thirds of the 300 megawatts of solar Minnesota Power announced in 2022 as part of an agreement with clean energy organizations weighing in on the company's required integrated resource plan, which outlines the next 15 years of expected energy sources and demands.

The nearly 100 remaining megawatts will come through ""an exciting distributed solar energy standard that we are working on meeting,"" Pierce said. The specifics are still being worked out, company officials said.

Between 50% and 60% of the company's energy now comes from renewable sources. State law requires utilities produce all electricity with carbon-free sources by 2040.

Boswell is home to Minnesota Power's last two coal-fired power plants, which are scheduled to retire by 2030 and 2035, and are significant sources of tax revenue to Cohasset and Itasca County. This solar project or other proposals, like refueling Boswell with natural gas, could preserve some of that tax base.

Can we trust automakers to make, support, and keep EVs on the road?","Read the full transcript here

Hey everybody, happy Sunday. I hope that wherever you are and whatever you were doing, you’re safe, you are well, and you are with someone you care about who also cares for you — especially at this particularly troubling time in the world.

I’ve been thinking a lot in the last couple of weeks about the channel, about our future, and about the things we talk about. There’s been a lot of perceived pushback, both on our channel and also on other channels, where we have not been afraid to discuss what’s happening around the world. Lots of people are saying, “I don’t want that, I just want you to talk about happy things.” And moreover, a lot of people are posting random political stuff that doesn’t have any relationship to whatever it is we’ve made a video about.

I was watching a video from Cychic in which she was saying she’s noticed it too, and it’s made me question — who can we trust, and what is trustworthy? What is true, not what someone tells you is true, but what is actually factually true, based on your own experiences and the world around you.

That has led me to today’s topic, which is one in which — apologies, I was looking at the camera a lot today and being a very terrible presenter, I guess — my ADHD is on display today. I tend not to give people eye contact when I’m feeling a particular way. I’m worried about trust in the EV world and trust in the automotive world specifically, and today I want to talk to you about whether we can, should, or do trust automakers.

Earlier this week, at the time of filming, President Trump went to a Ford plant in Detroit. He was a guest of Ford. As Ford has pointed out, Ford has welcomed every president for decades. I think since the 1950s, Ford has welcomed every president to tour the facilities.

At that visit, a Ford employee on the factory floor heckled the president at one point, and the president flipped them off. That employee has since been laid off, lost their job, and I think they’ll be okay. I think there was a GoFundMe set up for that employee.

We could have a long discussion as to whether it is appropriate to heckle the president and whether it’s appropriate to engage in that in your workplace. Some people will say yes, some will say no. I’m not here to weigh in on that.

What I am here to weigh in on is the way in which the overwhelming majority of the auto industry has gone over backwards to give the president of the U.S. what he wants. We’ve seen slowing down of EV adoption, slowing down of EV production, and pushing back on emission standards.

I have stood in the same room as Ford CEO Jim Farley, more than once, actually many times, where he waxed lyrical about how amazing EVs were and how it was the future for the company. Now, Ford is dancing to a different tune. It’s pushing more V8s, more V6s, going back to gas guzzlers, really pushing out its plans for EVs. Yes, I know there’s a new model coming out in the future, but I have a lot of doubt. I know someone who covers the industry — my job is to be objective — but personally, I have a lot of doubt about the future of Ford EVs right now.

Ford did it in the past. You know, it made the Ranger EV in the 1990s — phenomenal truck, very small, very practical, great for around town. And it feels like with the F-150 Lightning now, we’re seeing that history repeat.

But it’s not just Ford. Stellantis has gone from “we’re going to make an electric Charger, we’re going to make an electric pickup truck, we’re going to do plug-in hybrids” — yes, we’ve decided that EVs are not our thing, plug-in hybrids are not our thing, and we’re just going to make what customers want.

As many have commented online in various forums, and also on our channel, it’s not really customers in the U.S. who pick a vehicle. It’s dealerships — the ones who buy the vehicles from the manufacturers — and dealerships are the ones who decide which vehicles go on their floors. There’s a disconnect between what automakers say they want and what we actually want. That disconnect is called the dealership. I’m sure dealerships play a large part in this, but I also think automakers play a large part, because they want government funds, tax rebates, incentives, and whatever. They are going to work with whoever is in charge because it’s easier — it’s easier to make money doing something that doesn’t rock the boat.

I have been told many times throughout my career to not rock the boat. But I have a different goal in why I do what I do, why I am here, and why I am still here — and that is to make sure people have the information they need to pick a better future for themselves and their families, whatever that may be. Hopefully a car-free one. Hopefully public transit. But now, it definitely does not focus for many people around internal combustion engines, no matter how many people tell us otherwise.

I know if you’re watching this outside of the U.S., and maybe outside of Canada, you might be thinking, “Yeah, it doesn’t affect us. We’re still seeing automakers really push forward with EVs.” I’d like to gently, quietly remind you that Stellantis is a big global company, Ford is a big global company, and they do produce for other markets.

I’ve got to a point now where I’m like, are they just looking for an excuse? Are they looking for an excuse to back down? Are they looking for an excuse to say, “Yeah, we tried it, it didn’t work”?

As a parent, I’m reminded of when a child is learning a new skill for the first time. They start doing something — it’s difficult, but it might be fun. It might be a challenge. After a while, they get the basics. You say “well done” and give lots of praise. Then they may decide they don’t like doing it and move on, or they may really, really like it and work on it, hopefully with a little encouragement, to get better.

It feels like a lot of automakers right now are looking for the excuse to give up. The excuse is, “It’s too hard. I didn’t really want to do it in the first place.” But they spent a lot of time convincing us they wanted to do it. Of course, we’re not parents to these automakers — we’re customers. It’s a very different relationship.

There’s a lot of inherent broken trust in the EV industry right now, in the auto industry as a whole. That’s part of why we’ve switched what we’re doing and what we’re making. In some ways, I know a lot of you have watched this channel for over a decade; I know many have not. We’re returning more to our roots — more advocacy/journaling, as opposed to just pure journalism — because we think it’s time, we think it’s needed.

Openly speaking out and saying, “I don’t trust the auto industry,” is a horrible thing to say for someone in my position. But I’m not the only one. Some people say, “Well, what about Tesla? Tesla’s fine.” Many say, “You wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for Tesla.” But I started covering the industry before Tesla had a single vehicle on the road, or before Elon Musk was really involved with the company.

I will turn around and say I do not want to have an association with a company whose CEO has other companies doing things I find objectionable. Wherever possible, I will find alternatives or avoid working with or personally owning a vehicle from that company.

I don’t think that Tesla, with Elon Musk’s attention elsewhere, as an electric car company, is going to continue to exist in the way it currently is. I think there has been a metaphorical bed made, and people will lie in it. Even Tesla has had issues — some of the things Elon Musk has said about full-self driving. Some people call them lies, some call them extensions to timeframes, some call them missed deadlines. Others say, “We were sold a lie, it was a charlatan act.” I’m not going to give my personal verdict again — that’s down to each individual.

Right now: can we trust the auto industry? Can we trust automakers to make, support, and keep EVs on the road? Can we trust specialist EV companies, or are they just trying to make a quick buck? In the last decade, I’ve seen companies come and go that I perceive as not really doing it to change the world or make travel better, but because a wealthy person decided to invest in a company to sell a product that wasn’t ready for prime time. They just banged out as many as they could, and screwed the consequences.

Maybe I’m just feeling depressed after a week where geopolitical instability looks like it’s going to be the new norm for 2026 — where things that used to only be associated with nations in other parts of the world are becoming here in the U.S.

I’d love to know your thoughts. Let me know in the comments what you think. Remember, we are 100% Patreon-supported — without you, we wouldn’t exist.

But there’s a problem — those technologies are dominated by China, and Japan’s history shows that economic dependence on China comes with risks.
Behind China’s rise It was not so long ago that the world’s leading exporter of solar panels was, in fact, Japan.
“But companies lost the market to China.” Today, Japan has limited solar manufacturing capacity, relying on imports for more than 90% of installed solar panels in 2024.
“Because of cheap labor costs and other factors, China could produce inexpensive solar panels and could export and kill Japan, Germany and U.S. production,” Ohta said.","Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan has been one of the world leaders in solar. Today, despite limited flat, open space, it gets about 10% of its electricity from solar panels — more than France, the United States, and, perhaps most surprisingly, China.

But this solar might has mostly been generated using imported panels, as Japan has nearly no domestic production of photovoltaics (PV), despite it being a technology that Japan pioneered.

Japan’s ambitious climate and energy goals, including its Paris Agreement target to cut emissions by 60% by 2035 compared with 2013 levels and its plan — announced in 2021 — to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, will require a massive expansion of domestic renewable energy production, especially solar, but also wind and battery storage.

But there’s a problem — those technologies are dominated by China, and Japan’s history shows that economic dependence on China comes with risks.

“China has shown it is willing to use the business side for what the United States calls economic coercion,” said Yuriy Humber, the founder of Japan NRG, a Tokyo-based energy intelligence company. “China could, if it wanted, impose restrictions on the exports of other technologies, cleantech included, which could affect solar panels and batteries.”

Japan, which faced the wrath of China blocking exports of rare earth minerals back in 2010, a situation that is repeating itself in 2026 over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comments about a potential military response in a Taiwan contingency, has become increasingly wary of relying on China. The Takaichi administration has also come out with new policies against megasolar while showing enthusiastic support for nuclear power. As part of this, Tokyo has expanded state support for alternative decarbonization technologies with questionable efficacy — including carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), ammonia and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The concern is that Japan might not only fail to meet its own decarbonization goals but also see its energy and automotive industries lose out to the Chinese cleantech industry as countries around the world shift away from internal combustion vehicles and fossil fuel power generation.

Behind China’s rise

It was not so long ago that the world’s leading exporter of solar panels was, in fact, Japan. At the time, Japanese companies, including Sharp and Kyocera, were manufacturing and exporting solar panels from factories in Katsuragi, Nara Prefecture, and Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, to countries such as Germany and the United States.

“Japan once led in solar panel production until the early 2000s,” said Hiroshi Ohta, a professor and energy expert at Waseda University. “But companies lost the market to China.”

Today, Japan has limited solar manufacturing capacity, relying on imports for more than 90% of installed solar panels in 2024. Sharp and Kyocera, once leading global producers, are now not even ranked in the top 10 globally. A similar dynamic took place with solar manufacturers in other countries, like Germany and the U.S. The undisputed world leader is now China, which produces more than 80% of solar panels and components, and has near total control of key solar, battery, and wind turbine components, such as solar-grade polysilicon, silicon wafers and modules.

“Because of cheap labor costs and other factors, China could produce inexpensive solar panels and could export and kill Japan, Germany and U.S. production,” Ohta said.

Low prices, state subsidies, and access to cheap inputs made it difficult for solar manufacturers in Europe, Japan, South Korea and the U.S. to compete on price. While there are still solar manufacturers in the U.S. and South Korea, they benefit from state support that, in Japan, has mostly been reserved for traditional energy sources such as LNG.

“For China, it was about gaining technological advantage in the next generation of tech and gaining business advantage as well as global influence and political leverage, with cleantech as a side benefit,” said Humber.

Social and human rights risks

While some climate advocates see China’s excess solar, electric vehicle and cleantech capacity — and growing power as an exporter — as a good thing for global decarbonization, others raise concerns about security and social impacts.

“The idea that China’s clean technology successes have uncovered a more hopeful recipe for climate salvation is wrong,” said Seaver Wang, who leads the energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, a U.S.-based think tank.

Wang and others point to the clear links that solar, wind and other Chinese technologies have to the Xinjiang region, the homeland of the Uyghurs, who the Group of Seven nations say have been subject to wide-ranging human rights abuses. In May 2025, a report from the Japan Uyghur Association and the Tokyo-based nonprofit Human Rights Now identified numerous brands — including Japanese giants Marubeni, Mitsubishi Electric and Panasonic — as having indirectly sourced from suppliers in the region. Numerous reports have also shown the global reach of Xinjiang’s products, including in the areas of cleantech, particularly the solar supply chain.

“Allegations of state-sponsored Uyghur forced labor program participation have plagued solar polysilicon, metallurgical silicon and aluminum production in Xinjiang,” said Wang.

It’s not just in Xinjiang — Chinese sourcing of minerals from countries such as Indonesia, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been linked to labor and human rights abuses. Often, these are regions where — due to instability or sanctions — Japanese and Western companies are unable to operate.

“Globally, many unethical supply chains leverage China as their chief refuge from accountability,” Wang added.

There are growing efforts by governments to scrutinize supply chains and restrict imports from China due to these concerns. The most direct instance was the passage of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) in the U.S. The bill, which came into force in 2022, prohibits the import of all goods from the Xinjiang region due to concerns about complicity in state-sanctioned forced labor.

The European Union has been considering an even broader set of rules, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, that would also impact Chinese cleantech imports and add scrutiny to mining supply chains in other source countries. France, Germany, Canada and Mexico have also recently expanded national human rights due diligence requirements, which Johannes Blankenbach, the senior Europe researcher at the Business and Human Rights Center, sees as part of a global trend.

“Over the last couple of years, there has been a trend towards mandatory rules,” said Blankenbach. “I’m hopeful that the trend towards mandatory is here to stay and continues in other parts of the world.”

While Japan has yet to pass its own, there has been a push from the government to get companies to adopt stricter voluntary guidelines. In parliament, the cross-party Japan Uyghur Parliamentary Association has begun discussions on drafting a UFLPA-like law for Japan. Moreover, with Europe and the U.S. as major markets for Japanese exports, regulations there could have an impact on Japanese supply chain management too.

The nonprofit World Benchmarking Alliance argued in a statement released last year in favor of a mandatory human rights due diligence law, noting that “Japanese companies struggle to extend due diligence ... into complex global supply chains, which is critical for meeting international expectations and maintaining competitiveness in global markets.”

In the U.S., fewer imports of solar panels tainted by forced labor and increased tariffs on Chinese solar products hasn’t slowed down the expansion of solar due to increased domestic production, partly as a result of increased state support through initiatives such as former U.S. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and imports from other countries such as South Korea and Malaysia. Japan hasn’t yet made similar moves, with state support mostly going to fossil fuel technologies, but the recent push to support next-generation perovskite solar cells — which are thinner, more flexible and could be produced domestically without reliance on Chinese inputs, but do come with questions over durability and price — might be a sign of a shift in thinking.

“With perovskite, Japan has been quite secretive,” said Humber. “The number of companies involved has been somewhat limited, and state support has been very tight, partly to prevent technology know-how from being leaked.”

Diversifying the energy transition

Japan’s companies have, for now, a strategic advantage in certain energy technologies such as gas turbines, said Humber. Japan has also pushed technologies such as CCS and ammonia co-firing through government-led efforts such as the Asia Energy Transition Initiative. And while there are pilot projects to expand CCS and co-firing in places such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, there isn’t yet a proven business model for those technologies, and many analysts are skeptical there ever will be.

But Southeast Asia does present an opportunity when it comes to proven cleantech, as countries in the region are also expressing concern about China’s dominance in the sector and its dumping of excess solar onto developing countries. There are also concerns about China’s perceived reluctance to share that technology, which would allow other countries to expand their cleantech sectors.

Japan’s investment in alternative cleantech supply chains, perhaps with partners such as India, who also fear Chinese economic coercion, could be a way to reduce fears of Chinese dependence while also expanding Japan’s role in this growing sector.

“There has to be diversification of supply chains,” said Humber. “You may not be able to achieve 100% diversification or find a supplier as big as China, but you should certainly try to build up capacities domestically and elsewhere.”",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2026/01/18/517160.jpg?v=3.1,N,,2026-01-18 15:58:47.072990

The new normal: geopolitics and growth are inseparable

As the World Economic Forum commences on January 19 2026, the message for global business is simple: the old playbook is obsolete. Geopolitics and trade have become inseparable, with sanctions, tariffs, and export controls shaping market access as much as consumer demand. In this environment, risk management is not a back-office function; it is a strategic directive at the board level.

The WEF’s theme “A Spirit of Dialogue” is organized around five imperatives: cooperating in a contested world; unlocking growth; investing in people; deploying innovation responsibly; and building prosperity within planetary boundaries. That framing mirrors what executives already feel in their P&L and risk registers: trade, regulation, technology, and climate have fused into a single operating system for corporate strategy.

Trade is fragmenting, but competition for growth is intensifying

Davos 2026 will center on a singular key question: how to achieve growth in an era defined by fragmentation and shifting rules.

Recent indicators capture the two-speed reality. The WTO’s 2025 outlook warns of turbulence: tariff spikes and policy uncertainty have darkened the near-term horizon, with scenarios ranging from fractional declines in merchandise trade to only modest recovery.

Yet, paradoxically, UNCTAD reports global trade values reaching a record $35 trillion in 2025, powered by East Asia and South-South corridors. This is not globalization’s collapse but its reconfiguration. Commerce is adapting, not retreating; shifting toward regional clusters and politically aligned bilateral partners.

McKinsey’s latest analysis reveals the underlying architecture: trade is tilting toward proximity and trust. U.S. flows increasingly favor Mexico and Vietnam; Europe continues to pivot away from Russia; ASEAN, India, and Brazil are weaving cross-bloc ties. These patterns signal that growth remains attainable – but through different lanes and under different rules, where resilience and strategic alignment matter as much as efficiency.

Sanctions and tariffs are converging into one regulatory front dominated by national security

In line with this overarching shift, boards can no longer treat sanctions, export controls, tariffs and trade defense as discrete issues. Regulators themselves are coordinating more closely than at any time in recent memory and this integration blurs traditional boundaries between trade compliance and geopolitical risk management, creating a complex environment where businesses must navigate overlapping restrictions.

2025 – 26 brings tighter U.S. and EU scrutiny on advanced technologies, China moving toward tighter customs and export controls on strategic resources, evolving controls on inbound and outbound investments, and sustained pressure tied to Russia, Iran, and China. At the same time, tariffs have shifted from a secondary tool to a primary driver of trade outcomes – suppressing volumes and forcing companies to front-load shipments or reroute flows, as seen in the first half of 2025 where cross-border trade figures reflected companies front-loading imports ahead of the expected impact of escalating tariffs. A tariff adjustment may trigger sanctions exposure, and vice versa. The result is a unified, high-stakes framework where proactive monitoring and strategic foresight are essential to maintain competitiveness and avoid costly disruptions.

Supply chains: resilience with measurable value at risk

Additionally, expect 2026 to elevate supply-chain resilience further from a defensive measure to a core growth lever. Resilience now underpins agility, market access, and investor confidence in a world where disruption is structural, not cyclical. As such, industry analysts point to three converging pressures: geopolitical intervention, regulatory complexity – including cross-jurisdictional human rights and due diligence regimes – and climate-driven shocks. Taken together, these trends make resilience a strategic differentiator: companies that invest in adaptive, compliant, and transparent supply chains will not only mitigate risk but unlock sustainable performance gains.

CEOs need a new resilience playbook

Many companies are not yet equipped for integrated legal-operational-geopolitical risks. Here’s a pragmatic, board-level playbook we see high performers adopting:

It starts with building the right team and equipping them for a world where traditional silos no longer suffice: resilience requires cross-functional collaboration. The Davos 2026 imperative of investing in people reflects this necessity of equipping teams with cross-disciplinary expertise: Legal teams must grasp geopolitical risk; compliance officers need fluency in sanctions regimes; procurement specialists should be versed in export controls and ESG dynamics; and teams must prepare for cyber threats. And the C-Suite must have oversight of all of these.

Secondly, a culture of operational continuity is the heartbeat of resilience, and it thrives on adaptability. In a world where global shocks and policy rifts can disrupt supply chains, digital systems, and workforce stability, organizations that embed continuity into their culture stand apart. This means considering strategically building delays into critical processes, requiring rigorous risk assessment and the agility to adjust plans quickly through established governance frameworks as conditions shift – whether due to market volatility, geopolitical tensions, or unexpected operational challenges. For leading enterprises, continuity is proactive – one that ensures not only operational stability but also compliance adaptability, and preserves trust, sustains performance, and turns unpredictability into an expected and manageable constant.

Thirdly, a robust internal compliance program (ICP) is essential – not as a static checklist, but as a living framework that evolves with geopolitical and regulatory shifts. This means continuous monitoring of sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions, paired with clear communication channels across legal, procurement, and operations teams. A strong ICP should anticipate risk rather than merely react: scenario planning, early-warning systems, and regular cross-functional briefings help organizations stay ahead of sudden policy changes. Embedding compliance into strategic decision-making ensures that resilience is not an after-thought but a core business capability, and one which is designed to grease, rather than gum up, the wheels of productivity

Finally, documentation, though often overlooked, is the cornerstone of accountability. CEOs should ensure that documentation is not treated as a formality but as a strategic tool: it creates internal accountability, demonstrates diligence to regulators, and serves as the first line of defense in audits or investigations.

In a fragmented global environment and an era of uncertainty, disciplined preparation is both the most reliable shield and the most effective weapon.

Hawaii has long been a leader in renewable energy, and that leadership is something we can be proud of.
A modern, resilient grid is the backbone of a clean energy future.
It supports the recommendations in the “Alternative Fuels, Repowering and Energy Transition” study published last year by the Hawaii State Energy Office, which calls for greater diversification and innovation in how we produce power.
Hawaii’s energy transformation will not happen overnight and will go way beyond election cycles.","Throughout my legislative and regulatory careers, I voiced concerns about Hawaii’s heavy dependence on imported oil and the need to diversify our energy mix balancing the goals of: 1) the need to increase our use of renewable resources; 2) ensuring grid stability and reliability; and 3) keeping energy costs stable, equitable and affordable for Hawaii’s families and businesses.

A critical component to balancing those goals was a timely transition to natural gas. Working alongside renewable resources, natural gas could have provided a bridge to a more stable and affordable energy future. The intent was never to slow Hawaii’s progress, it was to give Hawaii a realistic timetable to transition cost effectively and responsibly while maintaining reliability and affordability. By not moving forward, our state missed out on an estimated $1.5-$3.5 billion in fuel cost savings over the past 10 years.

Hawaii has long been a leader in renewable energy, and that leadership is something we can be proud of. We have seen more rooftop solar, more wind and growing investment in storage and efficiency.

Yet, as isolated island grids, we still rely heavily on imported fuel and have limited options for backup power when disruptions occur. These realities remind us that our transition must be guided by both vision and practicality.

A 2020 state Public Utilities Commission audit of Hawaiian Electric highlighted the need to modernize our infrastructure and strengthen reliability. The report did not point fingers, but it did make clear that we must move faster to replace aging, highly inefficient, unflexible oil-fired generators. A modern, resilient grid is the backbone of a clean energy future. Without it, even the cleanest renewable resources and policies cannot deliver on their promise.

Having spent many years developing energy policy and regulating the key drivers of this transformation, I know that progress depends on both inspiration, careful planning and investments. Hawaii has always been rich in vision, but we must continue to match that vision with practical action. This means investing in new technologies, modernizing our grid, and supporting policies that strengthen resilience and affordability at every level of our energy system

That is why I was encouraged by Gov. Josh Green’s mission to Japan last fall. His meetings with energy and technology leaders, including JERA Co., Inc., NEC Corporation and the Yomiuri Shimbun Group, signal that Hawaii is seeking solutions through global collaboration.

The new agreement between the state of Hawaii and JERA is a meaningful step forward. It supports the recommendations in the “Alternative Fuels, Repowering and Energy Transition” study published last year by the Hawaii State Energy Office, which calls for greater diversification and innovation in how we produce power.

JERA, Japan’s largest power producer, has committed to achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its experience in clean and low-carbon energy development aligns with Hawaii’s goals and can help us strengthen energy security while moving toward a carbon-free future. Hawaii’s clean energy transition does not have to be a choice between renewables and other cleaner alternatives. When we create these strategic partnerships, we build the momentum needed toward full decarbonization.

Hawaii’s energy transformation will not happen overnight and will go way beyond election cycles. It will take time, persistence, collaboration, considerable investment and flexibility while we keep our eye on Hawaii’s end goals. We will succeed when we combine local expertise, innovation and partnerships focused on real solutions that protect both our environment and our economy.

Vision and pragmatism are not opposing forces. When we embrace both, we move closer to an energy future that is sustainable, secure, and truly reflective of who we are as an island community — innovative, resilient and guided by our shared purpose of aloha aina.",https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/web1_20240412-oped-solar.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 13:58:50.524982

The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board (“EIB”) will hold a public hearing beginning at 9 a.m., March 23, 2026, to consider EIB 25-77 (R) – In the Matter of Proposed Repeal and Replacement of 20.2.71 NMAC – Operating Permit Emissions Fees and 20.2.75 NMAC – Construction Permit Fees.

The hearing will last as long as required to hear all testimony, evidence, and public comment, and is expected to last approximately three days.

The EIB may deliberate and make a decision on the proposed regulatory changes at the conclusion of the hearing or may convene a meeting after the hearing to consider action on the proposal.

The hearing will be conducted in a hybrid format to allow for both in-person and virtual participation. The in-person component will be held at the New Mexico State Capitol, 490 Old Santa Fe Trail (alternatively 411 S. State Capitol Street), Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501. Hearing details, including the meeting room number and how to participate virtually, will be available on the New Mexico Environment Department (“NMED”) events calendar at https://www.env.nm.gov/events-calendar/, under the calendar entry corresponding to the hearing start date. For more information, contact the EIB Administrator at 505.660.4305 or pamela.jones@env.nm.gov.

The purpose of the hearing is for the EIB to consider and take possible action on a petition by NMED requesting that the EIB repeal and replace 20.2.71 NMAC, Operating Permit Emissions Fees, and 20.2.75 NMAC, Construction Permit Fees. The petition, statement of reasons (attached to the petition as Exhibit A), proposed replacement rules 20.2.71 NMAC and 20.2.75 NMAC (attached to the petition as Exhibits B and C), and current rules 20.2.71 NMAC and 20.2.75 NMAC with proposed changes shown in redline fashion (attached to the petition as Exhibits D and E) are available on NMED’s docketed matters website at https://www.env.nm.gov/opf/docketed-matters/.

To access these documents, click on “Environmental Improvement Board” to display the drop-down list of matters before the EIB, then click on “EIB 25-77 (R): In the Matter of Proposed Repeal and Replacement of 20.2.71 NMAC – Operating Permit Emissions Fees and 20.2.75 NMAC – Construction Permit Fees” to display the drop-down list of all documents filed in conjunction with this matter. Copies of the petition, statement of reasons, and proposed replacement rules can also be obtained by contacting Eric Peters at 505.629.5299 or eric.peters@env.nm.gov, or at any of NMED’s offices statewide.

The purpose of proposed replacement rules 20.2.71 NMAC and 20.2.75 NMAC is to ensure that NMED’s emissions and construction permit fees are sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of NMED’s Title V Operating Permit Program and Construction Permit Program. The EIB is authorized to adopt the proposed rules pursuant to the Environmental Improvement Act, Section 74-1-8(A)(4), and the Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Sections 74-2-1 to 17. The schedule of Title V operating permit emissions fees must be consistent with the provisions of Section 502(b)(3) of the 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act, which requires sources that are required to obtain an operating permit to pay fees sufficient to cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs of developing and administering the state’s Title V Operating Permit Program. See Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-2-7(B)(7). The schedule of construction permit fees must be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of reviewing and acting upon any application for such permit and implementing and enforcing the terms and conditions of the permit, excluding any court costs or other costs associated with an enforcement action. See Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-2-7(B)(6).

20.2.71 NMAC establishes a schedule of emissions fees for sources required to obtain a Title V permit under 20.2.70 NMAC, Operating Permits. The schedule specifies the annual emissions fee for each fee pollutant expressed in dollars per ton of allowable emissions. Proposed replacement rule 20.2.71 NMAC revises the current definition of fee pollutant, adding particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter (“PM10”) and particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (“PM2.5”) and removing mercury and total suspended particulate matter; reduces the maximum tons used in the fee calculation for each fee pollutant; provides that a fee shall be assessed for either PM10 or PM2.5, not both, depending on which has the higher allowable emission rate; increases the dollar per ton amount used in the fee calculation for each fee pollutant; establishes a late fee for failing to timely pay annual emissions fees; and confirms administrative compliance costs for enforcement of New Mexico’s air quality regulations. If adopted, replacement rule 20.2.71 NMAC will be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) as a revision to New Mexico’s Title V Operating Permit Program.

Similarly, 20.2.75 NMAC establishes a schedule of construction permit fees for notices of intent, permits to construct or modify a source, construction permit revisions, and technical reviews of existing construction permits under 20.2.72 NMAC, Construction Permits, and 20.2.73 NMAC, Notice of Intent and Emissions Inventory Requirements. The schedule includes a complexity-based points schedule for various actions and a cost per point, which is multiplied by the sum of all the points applicable to a given permitting action to determine the required permit fee. The schedule also includes an annual fee for sources that have already been issued a construction permit. Proposed replacement rule 20.2.75 NMAC revises the current complexity-based points schedule, increasing the points for certain actions and adding points for notices of intent; increases the cost per point used to calculate permit fees; increases the annual fee for sources that have already been issued a construction permit and institutes an annual fee for sources that have filed a notice of intent; establishes a late fee for failing to timely pay annual fees; and confirms administrative compliance costs for enforcement of New Mexico’s air quality regulations. If adopted, replacement rule 20.2.75 NMAC will be submitted to EPA as a revision to the New Mexico State Implementation Plan.

The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 20.1.1 NMAC, Rulemaking Procedures – Environmental Improvement Board; the Environmental Improvement Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-1-9; the Air Quality Control Act, NMSA 1978, Section 74-2-6; orders issued by the hearing officer appointed by the EIB; and other applicable procedures.

Trump’s energy and interior secretaries greeted the roomful of coal industry and utility executives in Washington.

“No coal, no modern world,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “No coal, no lifestyle we have today. It’s just that simple.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum thanked the industry.

“Thanks for keeping the lights on on the coldest days of the year,” Burgum said. “You’re making a difference for this country on affordability and on national security and we’re grateful for all of you.”

The coal council includes Kentuckians such as Sam McKown, president of the Kentucky Coal Association, and Joe Craft, president, CEO and director of Alliance Resource Partners, and a prominent Kentucky political donor.

It also includes Tony Campbell, retired president CEO of East Kentucky Power Cooperative, based in Winchester, and Don Gulley, president and CEO of Big Rivers Electric Cooperative, based in Owensboro.

The Trump administration has taken steps to promote coal, such as delaying the retirement of coal plants in Michigan, Indiana, Colorado and Washington. Federal agencies have also rolled back regulations on coal that were implemented in previous administrations.

However, the Trump administration’s own data show coal generation will decline in the next few years. The U.S. Energy Administration forecasts that coal generation will fall from 17% in 2025 to 15% in 2027. That’s where it was in 2024.

“The jobs of 2026 are no longer living inside traditional career ladders,” Houle told me.
A Final Takeaway On Where The Jobs Are In 2026 The 2026 job market isn’t broken.","The first Wednesday in January has long been the busiest job-search day of the year. AI is reshaping work at record speed amid layoffs and burnout and a tough economy. Experts predict the surge will be greater heading into 2026. If you’re planning a job search, you must look in the right place. I spoke with labor-market analysts, recruiters and workforce leaders about where the jobs are in 2026. The message is consistent: opportunity hasn’t disappeared, but the rules of engagement have changed.

Why Finding Where The Jobs Are In January Is Intense

So where are the jobs in 2026? Why do so many qualified candidates still feel stuck? And why is January’s job search surge so intense? “The first week of January is when reality sets in,” Meghan Houle, executive recruiter and founder of CONCÉ, told me. “People return from the holidays having received performance reviews, smaller-than-expected bonuses or clarity that the role they’re in no longer aligns with who they’ve become.”

Houle notes that this year’s surge is more emotionally charged. Burnout, return-to-office mandates, leadership turnover and rapid AI disruption have created one of the most psychologically driven job markets in decades. She points out that professionals aren’t just chasing titles anymore—they’re chasing alignment.

Where The Jobs Are In 2026

Chris Graham, executive vice president of workforce education solutions at National University insists that a major focus on AI isn’t going away. He believes fields like technology and cybersecurity will continue to hire due to innovation, accelerating AI adoption and an increasingly competitive landscape. Graham adds a shortage of healthcare workers gives those pursuing degrees in medicine and nursing more opportunities for employment.

Jason Greer, president of Greer Consulting, Inc., agrees that healthcare will remain one of the largest job engines this year. Green energy, infrastructure and skilled trades will expand. And human skills will differentiate workers in an AI-driven economy.

Greer predicts AI, data and technology-enabled roles will dominate growth. “Jobs tied to artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and cloud computing will continue to surge as organizations embed AI into daily operations. Demand will be strongest for professionals who can translate AI insights into real business decisions.”

Ali Gohar, CHRO at Software Finder sees AI as the operating layer for everything from HR to healthcare software in 2026. It’s creating massive demand for roles like AI prompt engineers, AI trainers and compliance specialists to translate legal and ethical frameworks into machine-readable rules. He believes you’re a winner if you can link AI and real-world needs.

Monster’s 2026 Job Market Outlook, based on full-year 2025 job postings and search behavior, confirms the expert opinions, showing employer demand holding firm in four high-volume, high-growth careers as job seekers navigate 2026:

1. Healthcare And Behavioral Health

Chronic labor shortages and an aging population are driving continued demand for registered nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, EMTs, dentists, dietitians and other healthcare professionals. Healthcare remains one of the most reliable job engines in the economy.

2. Skilled Trades And Technical Services

Automotive technicians, electronics technicians, mechanics, electricians, and repair specialists are in short supply. Infrastructure investment, domestic manufacturing, and clean-energy projects are fueling long-term growth in these roles.

3. Transportation, Logistics And Essential Services

Essential jobs that support supply chains and emergency responses. Logistics specialists, supply-chain professionals and over-the-road truck drivers remain critical as companies re-shore production and optimize fulfillment.

4. Technology And Data

While tech hiring is uneven, demand persists for practical, business-aligned roles such as data engineers, quality assurance engineers, cybersecurity specialists, and AI-adjacent positions—especially in healthcare, finance, SaaS and enterprise software.

Other fields—including sales, construction, installation and repair and computer and mathematical roles—are largely stable. They aren’t experiencing explosive growth, but they’re not in decline either.

“The jobs of 2026 are no longer living inside traditional career ladders,” Houle told me. “They’re forming at the intersection of technology, creativity and human-centered leadership.” Demand is rising for roles blending AI fluency with emotional intelligence, Houle explains, citing such positions such as AI integration coaches, learning and development leaders, brand and growth strategists and people-and-performance leaders.

“Across the 2026 hiring landscape, the market has shifted from volume recruiting to precision hiring, with companies prioritizing roles that directly drive revenue, decision quality and operational efficiency,” Houle states. That’s why professional services, consulting, finance, operations, logistics and data-driven customer experience roles remain resilient.

How To Put Yourself Where The Jobs Are In 2026

Experts agree that if you rely solely on online applications, you probably feel invisible because you’re standing in the most crowded line with the weakest odds. Monster career expert Vicki Salemi, asserts that while you’re on the bench waiting out your job search, several industries are thriving.

She suggests you consider pivoting your career path to areas where hiring is concentrated and strong. ""Skills and labor shortages still exist. The key for workers is to upskill and leverage their transferable skills into these areas where employers are struggling to keep up with the demand to fill their open roles.”

In today’s market, Houle advises that submitting hundreds of applications is far less effective than a targeted, strategic approach. She offers five practical strategies for 2026:

Stop relying only on job boards. Use them, but don’t build your entire strategy around them. The most important shift job seekers still overlook is that the best roles in 2026 never appear on job boards. Silent hiring has led to roles being filled through warm networks, curated communities, referrals and internal pipelines—long before anything is posted publicly.

Build visibility with intention. Share insights publicly, comment thoughtfully on industry conversations, and position yourself as a problem-solver—not a desperate applicant.

Focus on proximity to decision-makers. Alumni groups, professional communities, mentors, and warm introductions matter more than cold applications.

Tell a future-focused story. Employers care less about where you’ve been and more about how you’ll add value next.

Treat your career like a brand. Clear positioning, consistent messaging, and intentional growth make it easier for the right opportunities to find you.

Houle says some candidates are going even further—submitting short video introductions, sharing 30-day impact plans or following up with concrete ideas on how they would tackle a role’s challenges. Those signals stand out to recruiters.

A Final Takeaway On Where The Jobs Are In 2026

The 2026 job market isn’t broken. Experts say it’s fundamentally different. Healthcare, skilled trades, logistics, AI-adjacent roles and human-centered leadership positions continue to grow. At the same time, the path to those jobs has shifted away from mass applications toward alignment, visibility and relationships.

Hiring is more competitive and moves faster than in previous years, Houle admits. But it’s also more opportunity-rich for candidates who know how to show signal, not just credentials. Employers are prioritizing adaptability, learning velocity and leadership presence over perfectly linear resumes.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/696cdaa752d652d6c9e65792/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-18 10:59:22.806178

Davos, the Forum’s largest meeting, brings together some 3,000 global leaders from business, politics and civil society.
This is very much a learning journey, but one informed by 55 years of hosting the meeting in Davos.
The Congress Centre, our first and main structure, has had a heat pump since 2020.
We also haven’t had PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles [which are not biodegradable] at the Congress Centre since 2016.","When the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting begins in Davos, Switzerland, on Monday, sustainability will again be at the forefront. Last year, “Safeguarding the Planet” was one of the five pillars of the gathering, and the topic continues to be top of mind at this year’s event. One of the five key global challenges under the meeting’s headlining theme, “A Spirit of Dialogue,” asks: “How can we build prosperity within planetary boundaries?”

But the focus on sustainability extends beyond panel discussions and speeches, influencing how the event itself is designed and operated, according to Mirek Dusek, a managing board member, chief business officer and head of global programming for the World Economic Forum.

“Sustainability has always been a core operational principle because we believe in the long-term value of society, and overall, it is a smart thing to include sustainability in how we plan and run the event,” he said. To that end, the broader goal of sustainability globally is to meet the needs of people now, in the short term, without damaging the future of the planet.

Davos, the Forum’s largest meeting, brings together some 3,000 global leaders from business, politics and civil society. The gathering unfolds across three primary venues: the Congress Centre; Kurpark Village, a nearly 65,000-square-foot temporary wooden chalet that debuted in 2024, which gets assembled and disassembled each year; and the Zondacrypto-Arena, the home stadium of the local hockey team. Collectively, the sites form the Secured Zone and are within a five-minute walk of one another. “All have sustainable aspects in different ways,” Mr. Dusek said

How do the event’s organizers define sustainability with respect to planning and execution, and how do you accomplish that goal?

We look at sustainability from a big picture, holistic perspective. It is not a stand-alone objective or a box to be ticked, but something that sits at the heart of how we plan and deliver the annual meeting.

This is very much a learning journey, but one informed by 55 years of hosting the meeting in Davos. Over that time, sustainability has become a core operational principle. We draw on best practices, but we also focus strongly on lean design, smart procurement and the practical use of technology, including A.I., to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Context matters greatly. Davos is a small alpine town that depends on an intact natural environment to remain viable as a destination in both summer and winter. Sustainability, therefore, cannot be approached as something that only matters during one week of meetings. You need to be part of the place, not just treat it as a venue. That means thinking not only about outcomes, but about how those outcomes are achieved.

We work closely with local suppliers, prioritize local procurement wherever possible, collaborate year-round with the municipality and other stakeholders and aim to leave behind a legacy that the town and its residents can benefit from long after the meeting has ended.

Participants and media traveling from Europe to Davos receive 100 percent reimbursement for train travel, a benefit we began offering a few years ago. We also built a dedicated train stop at the Congress Centre [which operates during the event], making it easy to get there by public transportation.

For people flying in, we spearheaded several initiatives to help offset carbon emissions. One is Airports of Tomorrow, where we bring together experts, people working in the airline industry and policymakers on how to increase the use of sustainable fuel in aviation and other solutions for aviation to be at net-zero emissions.

During Davos, we provide free shuttles and public buses for attendees to get around. The majority of our shuttles are electric or hybrid, as well as the majority of the cars used by the Forum. We continue to increase the number of both each year.

Davos relies heavily on temporary structures, including pavilions, as spaces. How does sustainability figure into how they are designed, built and dismantled?

The Congress Centre, our first and main structure, has had a heat pump since 2020. This technology reduces emissions from heating and electricity by moving existing heat, thereby generating fewer emissions. Also, the Centre roof has solar panels. In the Kurpark Village, we have 100 percent pellet heating [pellet heating uses renewable, recycled wood waste for fuel]. The structure is highly insulated, which means it requires less heating.

At every venue, we reuse materials for several years, but eventually, when we need to invest in new furniture, we donate what we have through a green-share program, which distributes it to various entities within the Davos community. Most of our temporary structures are stored in Davos, so we don’t expend energy transporting them in and out.

And we use only LED lighting throughout.

At the Congress Centre and core venues under our responsibility, we have cut fuel consumption by 50 percent since 2023 and expect to reduce it by a further 45 percent by 2027. We achieved this through investments in better-insulated temporary structures that can be heated with renewable energy, upgrades to the heating system and the introduction of smarter energy concepts and energy-saving measures.

How does the Forum approach food sourcing, waste reduction and recycling during the week?

With A.I., we monitor how we use food and what goes to waste.

This technology continues to improve and enables us to plan for subsequent years, including how many ingredients to purchase and in what quantities.

We donate any extra ingredients to our pop-up restaurant, 4Reasons, which is open to the public during Davos. There’s no cost to dine, but diners can make a [voluntary] donation.

In addition, over the past few years, we have reduced bottled drinks by 50 percent. We also haven’t had PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic bottles [which are not biodegradable] at the Congress Centre since 2016.

How important is collaboration with local Swiss suppliers and municipalities in making Davos more sustainable?

Very important. Without their cooperation, we wouldn’t be able to make our sustainability initiatives as effective. They’re our partners on the train stop at the Congress Centre, 4Reasons and the Congress Centre heat pump, which are all joint projects with the local municipality, along with other initiatives. We also collaborate with local suppliers for our ingredients, such as nearby bakeries and farms, cheese producers, and hunters, who supply meat that is not farmed but comes from animals living in the natural environment.

The Congress Centre is fully supplied by a local caterer, and our food sourcing reflects a strong focus on local and seasonal products. We primarily purchase seasonal fruit, typically Swiss apples, of which we consume more than 1.2 metric tons [roughly 2,645 pounds] during the meeting. All fish served is 100 percent Swiss, and more than 70 percent of our ingredients are local and seasonal.

What sustainability goals have proven hardest to achieve at Davos?

Many of the challenges are not about intent, but about time, scale and influence. Davos is a small town, the meeting is temporary and a lot depends on partners, suppliers and systems that cannot be changed overnight.

We try to go beyond our own operations and influence the wider environment, for example, by working with local chefs and caterers and offering training on more sustainable kitchen and catering practices. That kind of change is important, but it takes time and trust, and results tend to build gradually rather than happen immediately.

There are always further improvements that could be made. The trade-off is often between pushing for small changes everywhere and focusing our efforts on measures that deliver real impact and can be sustained year after year. In practice, sustainability means making choices, setting priorities and accepting that progress is sometimes incremental rather than instant.

As climate concerns intensify, do you foresee changes to the scale or format of the annual meeting in the years ahead?

In addition to in-person participation, we encourage people to tune in online so they don’t incur travel-related emissions. We livestream 200 sessions [of some 270 total] and aim to improve the online experience every year with the latest technology.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/19/multimedia/19sp-Davos-QandA-inyt-01-tvql/19sp-Davos-QandA-inyt-01-tvql-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:00:38.614210

“That’s new.” The business-oriented mindset even rankles people who don’t spend time suing polluters as a way to enforce the Clean Water Act.
First, does the water in question “abut” another body of water, such as a river or ocean, that is protected under the Clean Water Act?
“The Porter-Cologne Act regulates water quality more broadly than the Clean Water Act,” Herman said.
“Trump’s EPA has been directed to narrow the scope of the Clean Water Act as much as possible,” Spinuzzi said.","The long-term health of the ocean off the coast of Southern California, and the health of the region’s freshwater streams and rivers and lakes, soon could hinge on the Trump administration’s definition of a single word: ditch.

The Environmental Protection Agency is in the midst of sorting out which of the “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS – the creeks, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, wetlands, oceans, and, yes, in a few cases, ditches – should still be protected from pollution by the Clean Water Act of 1972.

At least some of the proposed new rules could result in more pollution in Southern California’s vast network of paved flood control channels, which soon could be viewed by the federal government as “ephemeral ditches.” That, in turn, could translate into a dirtier Pacific and dirtier rivers and creeks.

Though details of the EPA’s proposals are complex and filled with legalese, the agency’s broader goal is pretty simple. In November, when it initially posted its water proposals, the EPA wrote: “When finished, this WOTUS rule will help accelerate economic prosperity while protecting vital water resources.”

The original language of the Clean Water Act – which is widely credited with staving off and, in some cases, reversing water pollution for more than a half-century – explicitly mentions environmental and human health, yet says nothing about economic prosperity.

The new emphasis, and the current EPA’s view that economic interests should be critical to environmental rules, pleases many business groups. The comment section of the EPA’s WOTUS proposal, included letters from agriculture interests and home builders and others who applauded what they view as “clarity” of the EPA’s new definitions. Such regulatory clarity is, in fact, a goal that’s been shared by EPA officials from both political parties for many years.

But the new EPA’s business-oriented mindset, as reflected in everything from its preamble to some details of the proposals to remake the Clean Water Act, also frustrates some people who work to reduce water pollution in Southern California.

“Over the years, we’ve seen the definitions change when it comes to which waters are covered (by the Clean Water Act). When Obama was president, the definition gave us more protection. When Trump came in the first time, the definitions became more narrow,” said Garry Brown, founder and president of Orange County Coastkeeper, a Costa Mesa-based nonprofit that works to make sure clean water laws are followed in Orange County and the Inland Empire.

“But we’ve never seen any politician campaign on the idea that more pollution is OK,” he added. “That’s new.”

The business-oriented mindset even rankles people who don’t spend time suing polluters as a way to enforce the Clean Water Act.

“Look, I’m for nature,” said Kyle Gerhard, a Beaumont resident who teaches science at Palm Middle School in Moreno Valley.

“Nature needs more protection, not less,” Gerhard said. “From what I’m hearing, these EPA rules would mean less protection.”

Ditched

The EPA’s move to redefine the scope of the Clean Water Act isn’t anything new. In fact, the Trump administration’s proposals, which are widely expected to kick in later this year, are coming less than three years after the Biden administration’s EPA took on the same question.

Both reinterpretations of the Clean Water Act were sparked by the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in a case known as Sackett vs. EPA. That’s when the Supreme Court said federal anti-pollution rules could apply only to waters that had a “continuous surface connection” to other protected waters.

That language raised a lot of questions. Could federal anti-pollution rules be applied to streams and creeks that flow partly underground, which might not have “continuous surface connection” even if those underground streams can, and often do, carry pollutants? What about wetlands that are dry for some or much of any year? Or paved channels that carry storm water from, say, a freeway underpass in Hawaiian Gardens to the ocean off the coast of Bolsa Chica?

The EPA plans to answer all that with a two-part test.

First, does the water in question “abut” another body of water, such as a river or ocean, that is protected under the Clean Water Act? And, second, does the water in question have “surface water” at least during that region’s wet season?

The first part of the EPA’s test – the “abut” rule – could free up millions of acres of land around the country for future development. That would please, among others, groups that hope lower-priced housing can help lower-income home buyers and reduce homelessness. But it also could mean more pollution in waterways that flow above and below ground, a category that includes most streams in dry climates such as the southwest part of the United States.

The second part of that test – the “wet season” rule – could exclude many marshes, ponds and streams in dry, higher-elevation areas, such as the Sierra, San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountain ranges. At altitude, in California and other hot areas, wet seasons aren’t always clear or consistent.

By some accounts, the EPA’s proposals would lift water pollution protection from 90% of the nation’s wetlands.

Critically, the EPA’s ideas about water also delve into the world of ditches.

Though federal Clean Water Act rules don’t apply (and haven’t ever applied) to most ditches, they have protected the water flowing in some paved channels that serve as tributaries from existing natural sources, like rivers, and for some ditches on farms that connect to rivers or lakes.

The EPA, under its new proposal, would set anti-pollution rules only for water flowing in ditches that were “constructed or excavated in dry land.”

That could mean huge changes in Southern California.

Over the decades, the state and counties in the region have built more than 500 miles of paved flood control channels to direct stormwater runoff and flows from the Los Angeles, San Gabriel and Santa Ana rivers. Those channels often flow into the ocean.

It’s unclear if the new EPA proposals would force government agencies to adhere to federal rules by paying to remove or prevent certain types of pollution from those paved waterways. If not, pollution could flow more freely.

“As drafted, ‘flood channels’ would not be (protected) waters if they have surface water only in response to heavy rain events,” Sean Herman, a lawyer with San Francisco-based Hansen Bridgett LLP who specializes in water pollution law, said via email.

Herman, who represents clients with a wide range of opinions about environmental questions – from public agencies to commercial developers to agricultural companies – said the EPA’s proposals, as written, present several unresolved issues that figure to be challenged in court.

But he also noted that federal rules might not matter as much in California as they do in other states.

California waters have an extra layer of legal protection – the state’s Porter-Cologne Act, passed in 1969. Herman said in many ways, the state law is more stringent than the Clean Water Act, so even if the EPA bows out of regulating Southern California’s ditch system, the state’s rules might prevent pollution from flowing.

“The Porter-Cologne Act regulates water quality more broadly than the Clean Water Act,” Herman said.

“Where we draw these jurisdictional lines on features like flood channels affects how we regulate those features rather than whether we regulate them.”

See everybody in court?

In its comment to the EPA, Orange County Coastkeeper argues that many of the agency’s goals – at least those about clarity – aren’t met in its proposed new rules. In fact, Coastkeeper claimed, the proposed new rules “introduces new uncertainty,” particularly in Southern California, where “upstream pollution routinely affects downstream waters” that are covered by the Clean Water Act.

Still, Sarah Spinuzzi, a lawyer for Orange County Coastkeeper, who wrote the comment for her organization, suggested that details in the EPA’s proposal might not be as critical as the bigger, pro-business picture.

“Trump’s EPA has been directed to narrow the scope of the Clean Water Act as much as possible,” Spinuzzi said.

“So when they add in these new variables, like the wet season versus the dry season, that’s kind of not so important,” she added. “When you’re talking about whether water gets polluted or not, the time of year isn’t relevant.”

She added that by filing a comment on Jan 5, the last day when the EPA was taking public comments on its WOTUS proposal, Coastkeeper could have more leverage if it files a lawsuit against some aspect of the new rules.

“It keeps our options open,” she said.

Herman, another lawyer, said a lot of people interested in the Clean Water Act – from all sides of the political spectrum – are keeping their options open, too.

“I expect that there will be more litigation resulting from these proposed changes, as there has been in the past,” Herman said. “And I would expect that future presidential administrations will have a different view of the Clean Water Act, resulting in more tinkering with regulations and more litigation in the future.

“This regulatory volleyball, across presidential administrations, will continue until Congress finds consensus and amends this half-century-old law to provide greater clarity. I look forward to the day when Congress returns to a culture of consensus building.”",https://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SBS-L-CHANNEL-0313-edv.jpg?w=1024&h=685,N,,2026-01-18 11:58:44.197658

As per this bill, intended to cut the power bills of millions, the SB868, the Plug and Play Solar Act, and the SB222, the Heat Pump Access Act, will be combined in an attempt to reduce the power bills of millions of Californians. In this way, clean power will be accessible to more citizens, and citizens will stress less about their state ranking second to Hawaii in terms of high power prices.

Looking at SB222, the Heat Pump Access Act

As per SB222, heat pumps are advocated and seen as a better alternative to gas furnaces and water heaters. Cutting down electricity usage by more or less 75 percent, heat pumps are an ideal solution. With heat pumps, the idea is to have a fossil fuel HVAC or water pump system replaced by a heat pump.

Despite the adoption of heat pumps being slow, SB222 would enable automated permitting for standard installations along with cap fees. Such measures may very well be necessary if the state meets its goal of installing six million heat pumps by 2030.

What does the SB868 Act mean on its own?

A central part of SB868 would be to ensure that California becomes the second state to make plug-in photovoltaic systems legal. These systems are described as “balcony solar” and rely on using the abundant sunshine available in the state. The output ranges from 200 to 1800 watts, and the units are made up of a few panels, an inverter, and a small battery that plugs in directly to a 120-volt outlet. Electrons do not leave the house and flow to the grid, but these electrons would rather flow to the house next door.

Understanding what plug-in solar could mean for Californians

Balcony solar can be mounted on railings, patios, and yards, and can be fitted on older roofs or easily on roofs without requiring major construction or adjustment. Electricity generated gets consumed effortlessly within the home, providing power to appliances, like refrigerators, with very little power being exported to the grid.

According to supporters, this bill could unlock tremendous savings for renters and homeowners in the state. A concept like this has been established abroad, with Germany having installed balcony solar systems already. Ten million consumers have enjoyed massive savings. While the house and the model chosen matter, a plug-in solar system could very well mean savings of up to $450 per year, with average households saving about $400 yearly just by making the switch to a heat pump. California is not the only state that has braced itself for increasing electricity prices. Another state’s energy bill has gone up by 20% in one month.

Increasing energy costs are curbed by the Balcony Solar Bill

The Clean Homes and Energy Affordability Package (CHEAP) has come into effect, and it considers both bills together, making clean energy technology that is easier and cheaper for many Californians. Since electricity rates in this state have been increasing between 2022 and 2025, this package seems essential for many Californians who have been finding escalating energy costs hard to deal with. According to Senator Scott Wiener, citizens have been given the tools to reduce energy costs.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Balcony-Solar-Panels.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:00:07.900552

With the cost of living spiralling out of control, affordability is now the key factor determining whether climate action gains public support or faces opposition.

Zohran Mamdani’s recent successful mayoral campaign in New York was based on concrete affordability pledges to make life more affordable to New Yorkers: rent freezes, fare free buses, city owned grocery stores, raising the minimum wage, baby baskets for newborns and no-cost childcare. The UK and Australian governments have taken note of this success and have prioritised addressing the cost of living and affordability as key to electoral success. Climate leaders need to take note.

This success can be replicated! We know that the money exists to prioritise affordability for the general public, what we need is political will. Leaders must urgently switch to cleaner energy alternatives as they are proven to be cheaper than fossil fuels, bringing down energy costs for everyone. Taxing big polluters, the ultra-rich and using those funds towards public investment is a popular and necessary action.

For years, climate misinformation has tried to convince people that a green transition is a luxury not an inevitability. Despite the millions spent on disinformation, public opinion tells a very different story. Across countries and political contexts, people increasingly understand that clean energy is not the cause of rising costs — it is one of the most powerful solutions to them.

Our latest Global Green Attitudes polling shows a remarkably strong global public consensus:

82% per cent of respondents believe investment in clean energy should be a top government priority, even if it requires significant public spending.

An even larger share — 88%— agree that stronger laws are needed to support renewable energy like solar and wind.

Notably, this support has held steady despite inflation and increasing economic anxiety.

As cost-of-living pressures deepen, people are judging energy choices on a simple test — will this lower my bills? As routine household bills become the main source of financial stress, renewable energy offers both an economic solution and a political opportunity for governments prepared to act.

Crucially, public perceptions are already shifting in clean energy’s favour. Many people already see clean energy as cost‑competitive or cheaper than fossil fuels. In the United States, a majority now believe clean energy costs the same or less than oil and gas. Globally, renewable electricity is routinely 30–50 per cent cheaper than new fossil fuel generation.

In this context, this year’s polling data reveals an interesting dynamic between public support for environmental action and the perception of government performance:

People want lower bills and place responsibility for this squarely on governments.

The public wants transformative government action, such as public investment, fair rules, and accountability for polluters while also holding low trust in political leaders to deliver this.

Many are feeling deeply frustrated at political inaction as inflation and economic anxiety increase.

What is missing from climate action is not public backing then, but policy creativity. Clean energy can deliver affordability, good jobs, and energy security — if leaders choose to act.

From free or discounted solar power programs to large‑scale investment in grids, storage, and clean industries, the solutions exist. Renewables already save countries trillions in avoided fuel imports and shield households from price shocks.

The choice facing leaders is stark. Continue delaying in service of fossil fuels or unlock a future where clean energy is understood for what it truly is: clean, common‑sense, and cheap. The public is ready. The question is whether governments are willing to listen.",https://350.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/istockphoto-494417257-612x612-1.webp,N,,2026-01-18 10:59:31.423757

Farah",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/18/trump-offshore-wind-problems-00734850,"Trump’s Interior Department in December paused all five leases for large-scale offshore wind projects that are currently under construction, citing publicly undisclosed national security concerns.
In his ruling pertaining to the Revolution Wind project, Judge Royce Lamberth also did not buy the administration’s arguments.
The decisions marked a near-term win for the projects’ developers and supporters of the offshore wind industry.
One legal expert said Trump’s disdain for wind power appeared to undercut the administration’s legal strategy.
The New England power grid operator said offshore wind projects are included in its planning forecasts and are needed to help meet electricity demand.","Democrats and wind supporters hailed the clean sweep in this week’s legal cases, even if the ultimate fate of those massive offshore energy projects remains to be determined.

“Trump is getting his butt kicked again. The question is whether he learns from that,” said Democratic Rep. Scott Peters of California.

The legal decisions, Peters said, “reinforces what we’ve been saying: That this is illegal. It’s a bad signal to the markets.”

Trump has made no secret of his deep dislike of wind farms — particularly those built in coastal waters. “My goal is to not let any windmill be built,” Trump told a meeting of oil executives at the White House last week. “They’re losers.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers reiterated on Friday Trump’s contention that wind power represents “the scam of the century.”

The Trump administration paused the construction of projects because its “priority is to put America First and protect the national security of the American people,” she said. “The Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue,” Rogers added.

Trump’s Interior Department in December paused all five leases for large-scale offshore wind projects that are currently under construction, citing publicly undisclosed national security concerns. Those projects were approved as part of then-President Joe Biden’s effort to create an offshore wind industry that could feed clean electricity into the nation’s power grid and reduce the need for fossil fuels.

The administration’s stop-work orders are among the roadblocks for renewable energy enacted by the Trump administration that also includes potentially revoking permits for offshore wind projects approved under the Biden administration. And they come with the added appeal for the administration of thumbing their nose at efforts to address climate change, which Trump has frequently derided as a hoax.

The companies behind the impacted projects quickly filed lawsuits to lift the stop-work orders, citing the billions of dollars already sunk into the projects and a tricky coordination required to synchronize the installation vessels that required the courts to act quickly.

A fourth wind farm’s appeal will be heard Feb. 2.

Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, said the Trump administration’s lawyers had failed to respond to several arguments from the developers of New York’s Empire Wind project, and noted that the government’s national security concerns were not enough to outweigh the harm to the project.

In his ruling pertaining to the Revolution Wind project, Judge Royce Lamberth also did not buy the administration’s arguments. The Ronald Reagan appointee pointed to press interviews by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that focused on offshore wind’s costs, its impacts on wildlife and “a variety of reasons unrelated to national security.”

And Judge Jamar Walker ruled Friday in Virginia that work on Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project could proceed while the litigation continues. The Biden appointee, too, said the administration failed to make a case for its concerns.

“Ordinarily a national security risk would weigh heavily in the government’s favor,” Walker said, adding, however, the “evidence does not demonstrate the security risk is so imminent” that a stop-work order is necessary.

The decisions marked a near-term win for the projects’ developers and supporters of the offshore wind industry.

“If you are a developer, the lesson is don’t cower in the corner. You have to be willing to fight for your legal rights,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

One legal expert said Trump’s disdain for wind power appeared to undercut the administration’s legal strategy.

“The reality is that the animus that this administration has toward these projects has forced it to cut corners with its reasoning,” said Joel Eisen, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It’s blinding them to making a good and reasoned explanation as to why it is they want to stop work.”

Eisen noted that under administrative law, the government must provide a sufficient explanation for major actions such as blocking projects already under construction.

“The government is required to explain itself and obviously in all three of these cases the judges are convinced that they haven’t,” Eisen said, noting the judges were appointed by three different presidents but all reached the same conclusion.

Yet, analysts warned the decisions are unlikely to stop Trump’s crusade, particularly as the rulings themselves could do little to calm the fears of companies looking to invest in future offshore wind development, a still-nascent industry in the United States.

The suspension orders may still “serve the long-term purpose of injecting significant uncertainty for offshore wind,” said Timothy Fox, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm.

“A future administration could support offshore wind, but we think the industry — and perhaps as importantly — financiers may be wary of investing in a capital-intensive sector with such demonstrable high election risk,” he said.

Other analysts said Friday the court rulings will likely force the administration to find other ways to try to impede offshore wind, even as the legal proceedings play out.

“While this blocks the latest targeting strategy, we expect the administration’s animus to continue in the form of other challenges,” Paul Greenough, a senior vice president on advisory firm Capstone’s energy team, wrote in an email.

Greenough pointed to Interior’s other court filings that seek remands for key offshore wind permits, as well as the potential for the administration to try to revive national security issues, flag new “findings” for endangered species impacts or other obstacles.

Craig Rucker, the president of Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow, which challenged the Virginia project, urged Interior to appeal the decision on Friday. “Instead of showing deference to well documented military objections, a single federal judge, without any expertise in national security, has taken it upon himself to substitute his judgment for the considered opinion of military professionals,” Rucker said.

Dominion noted in a press release after the Friday hearing that even as its lawsuit proceeds, the company “will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government.”

The company told Walker that it had been in frequent contact with Interior, including as recently as December, and it was surprised by the stop order issued later that month.

“In none of these meetings was there an indication that an order was coming,” said Dominion attorney James Auslander, a principal at the firm Beveridge & Diamond.

Governors, particularly in New England, have positioned the projects as vital to bringing down energy costs in their states — some of which had been scheduled to begin generating power this year. Attorneys general in Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island — who have tussled with the administration over its efforts to slash other climate initiatives — joined the developers and filed their own lawsuits to contest the administration’s stoppage.

The New England power grid operator said offshore wind projects are included in its planning forecasts and are needed to help meet electricity demand. Attorneys for the PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization stretching 13 states, supported CVOW’s motion and argued that the project will help provide much-needed generation in the region amid already high demand.

“Given the size of the project and the long lead times associated with development of alternatives, further delay of the project will cause irreparable harm to the 67 million residents of this region that depend on continued reliable delivery of electricity,” the RTO said in a recent filing.

Trump administration officials met with a bipartisan group of governors on Friday on plans to direct PJM to hold a special auction for technology companies to fund the construction of new power plants needed to supply data centers — part of the president’s effort to address growing affordability concerns.

Trump energy officials have repeatedly put baseload energy sources, like natural gas and nuclear, at the center of their agenda, while targeting wind power as intermittent and unreliable.

Others contend that the stop-work orders may have impacts beyond states’ borders.

Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who is traveling this week to Copenhagen, Denmark, told POLITICO she is hoping to meet with Ørsted, the Danish developer of two of the projects impacted by the stop-work orders.

“You have this project that has been underway for years, millions of dollars, 80 percent complete, and then you have, ‘Sorry, that’s not on our approved list.’ Now they go through the courts,” she said of Ørsted’s Revolution Wind project.

“OK, now we’re back on. But what is the message that is sent to Ørsted? What is the message that is sent to any of these companies about the reliability of working on a project in the United States? I worry about that.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F59%2F40%2Ffc9ec3144bbeab3d327edaa46153%2Fblock-island-wind-farm-47493.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:00:15.212199

On one hand, you have the world’s largest market, China, accepting EVs and plug-in hybrids in even greater numbers than ever before. Meanwhile, in Europe, manufacturers are pulling back on their EV manifestos as the European Union provides some respite in the face of slower-than-predicted adoption.

Toyota, by contrast, has always been pro-ICE. For years, the company has questioned its competitors and governments, who have been advocating exclusively for electric vehicles. And while the company has shown off various plans for EVs, they’ve maintained a more balanced approach.

Read: Toyota GR GT Looks Like A Batmobile And Hits Like A Supercar

Now, it may be clear that Toyota wasn’t going to say goodbye to combustion without a fight, but we imagine not many would have predicted the unveiling of the GR GT: a production-slated halo supercar with a ferocious twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter hybridized V8 engine.

The Fight for Identity

In an era of tightening emissions regulations and downsized powertrains, the decision to green-light a V8 may seem almost rebellious. But for Toyota, the GR GT isn’t about volume or compliance alone. It’s about identity.

Nikkei Asia notes that the GR GT has been built without the assistance of Yamaha, unlike its spiritual forefathers, the 2000GT and Lexus LFA. “Automobiles, as an industrial product, are in danger of becoming commoditized,” says Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda. “The engine still has a role to play,” underscoring the importance of the in-house powerplant.

The reality is that Toyota’s focus on keeping engines around will permeate throughout its lineup for the foreseeable future. In June 2025, Toyota convened suppliers at an internal combustion engine rally, where executives outlined plans to develop new engines, including high-output units, while maintaining overall engine production volumes through 2030.

It was a clear signal that Toyota sees a long runway for combustion, even as the market fragments.

Satisfying the Giants: US vs China

However, Toyota is still hedging its bets with EVs, especially when it comes to China. Over there, the car-buying population continues to march towards an all-electric future.

Toyota, like all foreign manufacturers, is feeling the pinch against local rivals. At a supplier event in Shanghai last summer, a Toyota executive drew rare applause by declaring, “In China, we will focus not on cars for the global market, but on cars made specifically for China.”

He added pointedly that if Japan’s headquarters hesitated on investment, he would “explain things to them directly.”

That shift is already visible in the product lineup. The bZ3X electric SUV, launched in March 2025 through GAC Toyota, was co-developed with Guangzhou Automobile Group and uses cost-effective lithium iron phosphate batteries. Priced from 109,800 yuan or about $15,300, it surpassed 10,000 units in monthly sales by November. A bZ7 electric sedan is set to follow.

Hybrid Momentum in America

Back in the US, where EV adoption is not as clear-cut, Toyota is investing in hybrid production. The move is driven by strong demand as hybrids accounted for roughly 13 percent of new-vehicle sales in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2025.

Toyota opened its new battery plant in North Carolina on November 12. Toyota Motor North America President Tetsuo Ogawa called it “a pivotal moment in our company’s history.”

On the same day, Toyota announced plans to invest up to $10 billion over five years to expand U.S. production of hybrids and related components, boosting output at five American plants and reducing reliance on Japanese imports.

Is Betting on Everything the Smartest Bet?

Of course, building cars powered by everything from V8 hybrids to LFP-battery EVs is expensive. Toyota spent ¥1.3 trillion on R&D in the year ending March 2025, which is roughly on par with BYD, and well ahead of many rivals.

To manage the burden, Toyota has begun leaning more openly into partnerships, including work with NTT on AI-based crash prevention and a collaboration with Waymo on autonomous driving.

In a market increasingly obsessed with picking a single technological winner, Toyota’s refusal to do so may look risky. But if the global auto future really is plural rather than uniform, betting on engines, rather than shunning them, may yet prove to be the company’s most calculated move of all.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/008tholdgy1i5gohe92r5j32hn1e71ko-copy-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:59.212554

Renewable energy investor Kushagra Nandan, who cofounded SunSource Energy in 2011 and biofuel firm REnergy Dynamics (RED) in 2024, has launched a new clean technology company, LNK Energy, along with investor Varun Karad and Paritosh Ladhani, joint managing director of SLMG Beverages, India’s largest Coca-Cola bottler.

The trio plans to invest around ₹10,000 crore over the next five years to set up a solar equipment manufacturing factory in Maharashtra, and later expand operations into green fuels, including green hydrogen, renewable energy development, and energy storage.

The first project involves a 6 gigawatt solar cell and module manufacturing plant with integrated ingot and wafer facilities at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in Maharashtra. The company, incorporated last year, has already signed a memorandum of understanding with the Maharashtra government for the project.

Over time, LNK Energy will also manufacture key adjacencies such as junction boxes, battery platforms, and related energy storage components, supporting the development of a robust domestic clean energy ecosystem, the three investors told Business Standard in an interview.

In the long run, the plan is to build a renewable energy generation portfolio as an independent power producer and through hybrid open-access solutions, integrating storage, solar, and other forms of renewable energy to create a fully integrated platform spanning manufacturing, fuels, and operating assets.

“In the first phase of setting up the plant in Maharashtra, we plan to invest ₹1,000 crore. We have already received approvals from lenders — mostly domestic — to raise ₹700 crore for the project, while the remaining ₹300 crore will be infused as equity,” Ladhani said. The broader ₹10,000 crore investment will be deployed over time across the manufacturing and clean energy platform.

The investors said the time is ripe for new-age manufacturing to be integrated with renewable energy technologies and long-term patient capital in India, starting with solar manufacturing and batteries and eventually moving into green fuels.

“We have been working on this idea for one and a half years and have been working with a technology team from Germany for its expertise in setting up solar cell manufacturing. We also plan to participate in the solar production-linked incentive scheme,” Nandan said.

Asked whether the ongoing consolidation in the solar power sector makes this the right time to commit capital, Nandan said the government has launched several programmes to promote domestic solar manufacturing, including the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers, which provides confidence.

Our Sustainable Energy Plan, adopted in 2020, set a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2030 and included plans to retire Nixon.
In 2023 and 2024, we sought renewable energy projects for this replacement power.
When we retire a power plant, we must have reliable replacement power ready to go.
Later this year, we’ll update our Sustainable Energy Plan to help us chart our energy transition.","Last week, Colorado Springs-area lawmakers announced the introduction of important bipartisan legislation that could make a real difference for all our customers – especially hard-working families struggling with the ever-rising costs of living in Colorado.

Senate Bill 26-022, introduced by Sen. Marc Snyder, Senate Minority Leader Cleave Simpson, House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell and Rep. Amy Paschal, gives us more time to find affordable and reliable replacement power for the coal-fired unit at our Ray Nixon Power Plant.

Under current state law, we must retire this unit by the end of 2029. We cannot meet this deadline without significant impacts on customers’ bills.

Make no mistake; we’re not abandoning the ultimate goals in our Clean Energy Plan, and we will retire Nixon. We are asking for more time so we can accomplish this retirement in a manner that is more affordable for our community.

Our Sustainable Energy Plan, adopted in 2020, set a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% by 2030 and included plans to retire Nixon.

We have made tremendous progress in this plan, including the retirement of the former coal-powered Martin Drake Power Plant; however, we faced very unfavorable market conditions when seeking to replace the 200 megawatts of power generated by Nixon.

In 2023 and 2024, we sought renewable energy projects for this replacement power. The bids were 50-60% higher than forecasted.

If we had pursued those projects, customers would face an estimated additional 13.9% electric rate increase over 10 years. Combined with the already-approved annual electric base rate increases through 2029, this would result in a total rate increase of 35% over five years and a nearly 50% increase in the next 10 years.

The combination of these market conditions, the lack of immediately viable transmission developments in Colorado, and the ever-increasing demand for electricity has created a perfect storm against our ability to achieve Colorado’s goals before the state’s deadline.

When we retire a power plant, we must have reliable replacement power ready to go. That includes base-load power or energy that is available 24/7, even when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

We are taking important steps to ensure we have this power in a way that protects affordability. This April we will enter the Southwest Power Pool Regional Transmission Organization, giving us access to renewable energy from elsewhere at substantially lower prices than if we were to acquire these resources ourselves.

Later this year, we’ll update our Sustainable Energy Plan to help us chart our energy transition.

As Rep. Amy Paschal shared at a news conference last week, the people that care about the environment, and those that care about affordability and reliability are not different groups. These are things we all care about and need to carefully balance.

Citizens and customers may voice their opinion on the proposed legislation in a variety of ways in the coming months, including contacting their legislators.

They now plan to join unified appeals from the Highlands and North East for Holyrood to pause all major planning applications.

More than 40 community councils and other organisations from across the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian and South Lanarkshire packed into Jedburgh town Hall for the convention.

The Scottish government denied that communities were being ignored during site specific assessments of renewable energy planning applications.

As the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy gathers pace, the location of infrastructure to support the change has become increasingly contentious.

From a trickle of wind farm applications in areas like the Borders and the Highlands a decade ago, many rural communities are now facing a flood of development proposals for increasingly higher turbines, battery energy compounds, vast solar parks and new electricity sub stations.

Highlands councillor Helen Crawford began a push back last year which led to a unified statement on behalf of 50 community councils in her area being sent to Holyrood.

As well as asking the government to oppose the ""industrialisation"" of the countryside and protect communities, the appeal called for a planning inquiry, and all major applications to be paused.

Councillor Crawford, who was a guest speaker at the Jedburgh convention on Saturday, said: ""We need an urgent review of what is happening to our countryside - people from Shetland to here in the Borders are deeply concerned.

""We are starting to come together and that unified voice is powerful.

""It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Scottish government to ignore what rural communities are saying.""

A similar unified statement from community councils in the rural North East has already been sent to the Scottish government.

And, during the Jedburgh meeting, it was agreed that a document for the South of Scotland will be drawn up over the coming months.

Convention organiser Bob Hope, who is chair of Leitholm, Eccles and Birgham community council, said: ""The government promised that they would listen to us as communities when considering renewable energy applications, but they haven't and we are now having to come together in an effort to have a voice.""

He added the Highland statement had already been put in front of First Minister John Swinney.

Hope said: ""The North East has added its voice, and we will be doing the same.

""There comes a time when the Scottish government will have to listen to rural communities.""

The Scottish government aims to generate around half of the country's overall energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030.

Energy Secretary Gillian Martin, who declined an invitation to the South of Scotland convention, said: ""Renewable energy is set to further turbo-charge the economy of Scotland, and will provide many more jobs for the communities across the country as well as wider infrastructure benefits.

""The renewables industry also has a large positive impact on the domestic supply chain which includes many businesses based in Scotland.

""Increased generation of renewable energy is critical to the energy security of the country, and have the potential to reduce our reliance of fossil fuels and the price volatility they come with.""

Almost all rural towns and villages across the South of Scotland are currently either fighting planning applications or already have renewable energy developments on their doorstep.

Moffat Community Council is opposing proposals for wind farms and battery energy storage systems.

Chair Mick Barker said: ""Although the developers have a strategy for exploiting our landscapes and our communities, our council and government appear to be without any strategy.

""We are facing a Klondyke gold rush for space around our communities that they can develop.""

Fiona Nugent believes that developments near her home in Newcastleton are responsible for an increased risk of flooding.

She said: ""These developments don't just spoil the views, they damage the area.

""I can tell how bad the river is going to be by the amount of water pouring down the hill - the turbines are all the way around the headwaters of Hermitage Water and Liddel Water.

""Our village now has its back up against the wall.""

Borders MP John Lamont, who was one of the guest speakers at the convention, is backing a unified statement for the South of Scotland being sent to Holyrood.

He said: ""While Westminster determines the need under the Electricity Act, it is absolutely the planning process here in Scotland that approves all these applications.

""The power is very much with the Scottish government and I applaud the communities that are saying they have had enough.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ab30/live/99278270-f45b-11f0-8650-c15b6ede387c.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:59:47.322337

ValOre Metals expects preliminary economic assessment completion by end-2026 for Pedra Branca whilst pursuing acquisitions that could provide production in 2026.","Western dependence on concentrated supply sources has elevated battery metals from industrial commodities to national security imperatives, with single-country dominance in processing and production creating vulnerabilities that 2025 export restrictions and geopolitical tensions have starkly exposed across rare earths, nickel, and platinum group metals sectors.

Coordinated financing mechanisms, expedited permitting frameworks, price support discussions, and multi-billion dollar bilateral agreements demonstrate fundamental policy shift from recognition of supply vulnerabilities to active deployment of development finance, export credit agencies, and sovereign wealth fund partnerships for strategically significant projects.

Breakthrough processing technologies, geological advantages, and alternative extraction methods are demonstrating pathways to compete with incumbent low-cost producers through natural cost reductions, superior environmental performance, and elimination of traditional cost drivers rather than relying solely on premium pricing or subsidy support.

Electric vehicle manufacturing, renewable energy infrastructure, steel industry transition to direct reduction processes, and defence system requirements generate sustained demand across battery metals value chains, with hybrid vehicle dynamics and clean steel production proving more favourable to metals demand than earlier transition scenarios anticipated.

Multiple projects with completed or advancing feasibility studies, secured or progressing permits, established strategic partnerships, and near-term financing catalysts provide investors with exposure to assets transitioning from exploration to development execution within compressed 12-24 month timeframes backed by government coordination and strategic offtaker engagement.

Chinese export restrictions on rare earths, Indonesian dominance of nickel processing, and mounting concerns over Western defence and automotive manufacturing dependencies have elevated battery metals from industrial commodities to matters of national security. Against this backdrop, a cohort of advanced Western projects is progressing toward production with government backing, technical innovation, and partnership strategies designed to address the supply vulnerabilities that recent events have starkly illuminated.

For investors evaluating battery metals exposure, the distinction between aspirational exploration projects and assets approaching development decisions with government support, strategic partnerships, and demonstrated technical viability has become critical. The projects examined here—spanning heavy rare earths in Sweden and Australia, platinum-palladium in Brazil, and nickel and iron in Tanzania and Canada —represent advanced-stage opportunities positioned at the intersection of strategic necessity and commercial readiness.

Europe & Australia's Heavy Rare Earth Supply Security

Leading Edge Materials is advancing its Norra Kärr heavy rare earth project in Sweden towards a prefeasibility study expected to complete in the first half of 2026. The project's strategic significance derives from both its production profile and timing. CEO Kurt Budge emphasises the scale:

""If I look at the Lynas announcement back in October 2025 about the expansion of their Malaysian plant for heavy rare earth production, their nameplate capacity for that plant was 250 tonnes of dysprosium and 50 tonnes of terbium oxide. Norra Kärr is 248 tonnes of dysprosium and 38 tonnes of terbium oxides.""

This comparison positions Norra Kärr's output at comparable scale to expansions undertaken by Lynas Rare Earths, one of the few significant rare earth producers outside China. The project benefits from 16 years of technical work providing substantial data foundation. The current programme focuses on optimising mineral processing through 28,000 metres of drill core test work and upgrading the mineral resource classification.

Defence implications add urgency beyond industrial applications.

""When it comes to defence and whether it be equipment or armaments, depending on what global alliances form, can we really be reliant on heavy rare earths that come from jurisdictions that may not necessarily be fully aligned with Europe in our manufacturing processes to produce the equipment to the armaments we need,"" Budge questions.

Leading Edge is pursuing a mining lease decision in Sweden expected in the near future whilst engaging with downstream permanent magnet manufacturers. The development timeline positions the resource approximately three to four years from production.

Interview with Kurt Budge, CEO of Leading Edge Materials

Cobra Resources is advancing a heavy rare earth in-situ recovery project in South Australia with unique palaeochannel geology that bypasses traditional clay-hosted operational challenges. Recent field hydrology studies demonstrate exceptional permeability and connectivity, achieving pump rates of nearly 20,000 litres per day with 60% tracer recovery in four days at 7-metre well spacing.

The most significant technical development is natural acid generation from sulfide-rich organics within the ore body. As Managing Director ad CEO Rupert Verco explained,

""Our ore body is very unique. It's got natural high sulfides in the organics. And we've shown in bench scale tests and based on some of the observations in our field tests, we put an oxidant into that ore and it creates a reaction that produces sulfuric acid.""

This characteristic addresses one of the largest cost drivers in rare earth recovery.

""Sulfuric acid's one of your primary costs in the recovery of rare earth and this gives us a significant opportunity to really decouple ourselves from supply chain risk, particularly sourcing equipment and consumables from China and give ourselves some self-reliance, further drive down that cost basis and control our acid generation,"" Verco added.

Current testing indicates acid consumption under 4 kilograms per ton of ore—dramatically lower than typical rare earth operations. Metallurgical breakthroughs centre on cerium suppression with the ability to suppress 90% of cerium and results to concentrate containing 35% magnet rare earths and nearly 50% heavy rare earths—exceptional by global standards.

The company controls 3,300+ square kilometres of prospective tenure and plans resource drilling in early 2026, targeting 4,000-5,000 tons annual mixed rare earth carbonate production with modular, low-capex development.

Interview with Rupert Verco, CEO of Cobra Resources

The platinum-palladium market has shifted dramatically from anticipated decline to structural deficit. ValOre Metals CEO Nick Smart,Smart explains the dynamics:

""Instead of this declining picture, you've had a steady level of demand, but the last few years with prices as low as they have been has not incentivized as new supply to come on. As a result, you've got the situation of steady demand, declining supply, so older mines particularly in South Africa which become more and more challenging to operate, more costly to operate, and you have a drop off in terms of supply and that leads to that deficit situation that we're seeing today.""

ValOre Metals is transforming from a single-asset platinum-palladium explorer into an integrated precious metals producer across Brazil, pursuing strategic acquisitions of advanced-stage projects whilst advancing the flagship Pedra Branca project towards a preliminary economic assessment by end-2026.

Stable jurisdiction, fantastic infrastructure, good access to electricity and a supportive government in terms of permitting and bringing that forward - that's a huge advantage for us,"" Smart noted.

ValOre targets H2 2028 production from Pedra Branca's initial phase following an 18-month construction period after licensing approval, leveraging Brazil's trial mining pathway that allows demonstration-scale operations at one-tenth of full capacity.

Nickel Secures Major Projects Office Referral

Lifezone Metals acquired BHP's 17% stake in Kabanga for deferred consideration, gaining 100% control of one of the world's highest-grade undeveloped nickel assets. Chief Financial Officer Ingo Hofmaier detailed the transaction economics: payment is structured as $10 million due 12 months after FID, plus $28 million indexed to Lifezone's share price after declaring commercial production.

""Tanzania is expected to become an exporter of electricity in the next couple of years once they have gone through a maintenance cycle of the older ones now that the newer ones are coming on,"" Ingo confirmed.

Tanzania's infrastructure improvements have fundamentally altered the project's viability. The country commissioned three new hydropower stations creating electricity surplus where shortages previously existed, with 95-98% grid availability replacing diesel generators.

""Environmental concerns are one element but the key thing is that traceability of nickel sulfates that ultimately go through western smelters and end up in the defense industries or the stainless steel industry,"" Ingo emphasises.

Indonesian production, primarily Chinese-controlled, now represents 70-80% of global supply—concentration exceeding OPEC's oil market dominance. Lifezone is in advanced discussions with US DFC, European ECAs, and Mineral Security Partnership members. The company targets 60/40 debt-to-equity project financing with FID targeted for late 2026.

""We are in regular touch with European capitals, Washington and Tokyo through the MSP, the Mineral Security Partnership. We are very well advanced in due diligence exercises with several of them,"" Ingo confirmed.

Interview with Ingo Hofmaier, Chief Financial Officer of Lifezone Metals

Canada Nickel's Crawford project has been referred to Canada's Major Projects Office, becoming one of only three mining projects selected for expedited government support. The Minister of Natural Resources Tim Hodgson personally flew to the Crawford site for the announcement. His statement emphasized the project's national significance:

""With global nickel demand surging, now is the moment for Canada to build on over 140 years of nickel-mining legacy in Northern Ontario - and bring greater reliability and sustainability to the global commodities market for our allies. That's why the Crawford Nickel Project is now with the Major Projects Office: to move faster, get shovels in the ground sooner, unlock jobs and Indigenous equity opportunities, and raise the bar for clean, responsible mining.""

Prime Minister Carney stated that Crawford is setting a new standard in terms of how responsible mining gets done, representing explicit political commitment. Canada Nickel CEO Mark Selby emphasised the significance:

""When you have the Prime Minister of the country talking about the fact that Crawford is setting a new standard, using those kind of words in the speech that he did, you can be certain that he wants to make sure that we deliver on what his statement is saying as coming true.""

Beyond domestic coordination, the MPO facilitates connections with international funding sources. Selby explained that being sponsored by the major project office means having express pass to the front of the line referencing French, German, and Japanese funding programmes.

Canada Nickel committed to breaking ground by end of 2026, as Selby outlined, targeting construction decision in late Q3 or early Q4 2026.

""Starting from now, you'll see a number of financing announcements from the different bits and pieces with a view to having the package in place by mid-year.""

Steel Decarbonisation

Champion Iron operates at the nexus of battery metals supply chains through its role in steel industry decarbonisation. The company's ultra-high-grade iron ore concentrate proves essential to the direct reduction iron processes that enable low-carbon steel production for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and clean energy infrastructure.

CEO David Cataford explains the strategic importance:

""As we go into the next years and we get into a bigger transition into decarbonising the steel industry, we definitely think those premiums can increase. We have seen those sort of shifts. Is it predictable to a sense that we can put a date on it? No. But we know the trends make quite a lot of sense for us to position our material.""

Champion delivered its strongest quarterly performance in two years with approximately $175 million EBITDA and record sales of 4 million tonnes. The company's $500 million DR Pellet Feed project is over 80% complete and on track for delivery, transitioning half of production to up to 69% iron ore concentrate—amongst the world's highest grades.

""By producing 7-12 million tons of material that's higher grade, we want to sell more into North Africa, Middle East, and in Europe. That's going to reduce significantly our shipping costs while at the same time increasing our premiums for our material,"" Cataford detailed.

This geographic reorientation enables sales into markets where direct reduction iron production is accelerating as steel manufacturers respond to decarbonisation mandates.

The company's positioning captures the steel industry's inevitable transition toward lower-carbon production methods essential for battery metals supply chains. Electric vehicle manufacturing requires high-quality steel components, wind turbine construction demands structural steel meeting stringent specifications, and battery production facilities require steel infrastructure—all increasingly produced through direct reduction processes that depend on Champion's ultra-high-grade concentrate.

What to Expect in 2026

Government support mechanisms continue advancing, with European price support policies under active discussion, the US-Australia $8 billion critical minerals agreement creating funding pathways, and Canada's Major Projects Office demonstrating coordinated permitting and financing approaches. Strategic partnerships with downstream manufacturers, particularly in permanent magnets and battery materials, should accelerate as supply chain diversification imperatives translate into commercial arrangements.

""What they need now is capex to take it up to full operation,"" Smart noted. ""Through our positioning with ValOre and being backed by Discovery Group, access to capital from North America and Canada in particular is a big advantage.""

The $8 billion agreement between the US and Australian governments for critical minerals development has increased investor interest. Verco emphasises,

""We're going to be in a race with a number of other projects. So we're going to deploy a process with great efficiency to make sure that when that funding does reach projects, we're in a very competitive position for it.""

The 2026 calendar presents multiple inflection points across battery metals projects:

Leading Edge Materials expects prefeasibility study completion in H1 2026 alongside mining lease decision, serving as catalysts for government support programmes or strategic partnerships.

Cobra Resources commences resource drilling in early 2026 with results expected after several months of drilling and analysis, establishing the foundation for economic studies already supported by demonstrated metallurgical and hydrological parameters.

Lifezone Metals targets late 2026 FID for Kabanga following completion of project financing, with multiple financing components expected to materialise throughout the year.

Canada Nickel anticipates federal permit approval in early 2026, followed by progressive financing announcements through mid-year supporting the committed end-2026 construction start.

ValOre Metals expects preliminary economic assessment completion by end-2026 for Pedra Branca whilst pursuing acquisitions that could provide production in 2026.

Champion Iron's DR Pellet Feed project completion positions the company for first commercial shipments of ultra-high-grade concentrate in early 2026, with the seven-year capital expenditure cycle ending to enable material free cash flow generation with thedestocking of approximately 3 million tonnes of high-grade concentrates.

The Investment Thesis for Premium Metals

Single-country concentration exceeding 70-90% across critical battery metals has elevated supply security to national security priority, catalysing coordinated government support through development finance, expedited permitting, and price support mechanisms transitioning from policy discussion to capital deployment

Processing innovations including natural acid generation, hydrometallurgical alternatives, in-situ recovery methods, and surface mineralisation demonstrate pathways to compete with incumbent producers through fundamental cost reductions rather than relying exclusively on premium pricing or subsidies

Electric vehicle motors, renewable energy infrastructure, steel industry direct reduction processes, and defence systems create sustained demand, with hybrid vehicle dynamics and clean steel trajectories proving more supportive than earlier scenarios whilst supply remains constrained

Multiple projects with completed feasibility studies, secured permits, strategic partnerships, and government backing progressing toward 2026 final investment decisions and construction commencements provide exposure to assets transitioning from exploration to execution within compressed timeframes

Feasibility-stage projects with bankable economics, proven technical parameters, experienced management teams, and strategic government coordination trading at valuations not reflecting near-term catalysts, replacement costs, or strategic positioning in stable jurisdictions

Exposure spanning heavy rare earths, nickel, platinum group metals, and steel decarbonisation materials across projects from near-term production through study completion enables staged capital deployment whilst capturing multiple demand drivers across automotive, industrial, energy, and defence applications

Projects concentrated in established mining regions with reliable infrastructure, proven regulatory pathways, and community support provide optionality on government programmes and premium pricing for traceable materials whilst contrasting with emerging market political risk

TL;DR

Battery metals supply chain vulnerabilities exposed through 2025 export restrictions have elevated strategic importance from industrial concern to national security imperative, catalysing government coordination mechanisms, multi-billion dollar financing agreements, and expedited permitting frameworks. Advanced Western projects spanning rare earths, nickel, platinum group metals, and steel decarbonisation materials are progressing toward 2026 development decisions with demonstrated technical breakthroughs enabling cost-competitive production, completed feasibility studies establishing bankable economics, and strategic partnerships securing downstream offtake. Supply concentration exceeding 70-90% in incumbent producers, structural demand growth from decarbonisation imperatives across electric vehicles, renewable energy, and clean steel production, and government backing transitioning from policy recognition to capital deployment create favourable conditions for projects with jurisdictional advantages, proven management teams, and near-term execution catalysts. The 2026 calendar presents multiple inflection points including prefeasibility completions, final investment decisions, permit approvals, and construction commencements across projects positioned at the intersection of strategic necessity and commercial readiness.

The entire developed world spent the last 50 years playing a game of thermodynamic arbitrage to avoid the cost of domestic energy production.
We can calculate the “Substitution Penalty” using 2024 production data: Human Grid Load: ~4,200 kWh/year.","My apologies for the one week gap. Occasionally, the attic receives an inflow of new information that requires additional reorganizing. And this is why I love writing on Substack. In response to my scarcity posts, I received a research package from Hudson Bay Capital that perfectly crystallizes the “Optimism” narrative currently sweeping Wall Street. The papers, titled “Tech Trumps Tariffs” (Nouriel Roubini) and “No, Stocks Aren’t in a Valuation Bubble” (Jason Cuttler), are sophisticated, compelling, and arguably the most dangerous documents I have read this year. Please read them.

Their argument is the highest-conviction version of the “Soft Landing” consensus. They posit that we are on the precipice of a “positive supply shock” driven by AI that will raise US potential GDP growth to 4%, crush inflation, and justify an S&P 500 target of 9,000. Their thesis is elegant: Technology (AI) enables us to dematerialize growth, rendering physical constraints such as labor shortages and tariffs irrelevant.

It is a beautiful theory. Unfortunately, it violates the laws of physics — specifically, the physics of our infrastructure networks. And, as the latest research from Jones and Tonetti identifies, it violates the “laws” of economics. Using their projections, it also assumes a catastrophic path for wages vs capital that will not be tolerated:

Fortunately, it will not come to pass. The Hudson Bay thesis rests on a fatal accounting error. It assumes that Machine Labor is infrastructurally equivalent to Human Labor. It assumes that replacing a worker with an AI agent is a 1:1 swap in the economic ledger.

It is not. Per-capita productivity equals throughput divided by population only if capital scales at least proportionally with the population. Wall Street assumes the numerator (throughput) scales infinitely, while ignoring that the denominator (capital stock) is physically capped. This isn’t a Malthusian tale of inevitable collapse—I’m not predicting an endpoint where growth hits zero forever. It’s about the path: the short-run thermodynamic penalties and ergodicity errors that Wall Street’s linear models miss, turning a ‘productivity boom’ into a margin call unless we adapt.

I spent the last week auditing the energy books, and the results are stark. We are not facing a “Productivity Boom”; we are facing a “Thermodynamic Margin Call”. The transition from a human-led economy to a machine-led economy carries a specific topology penalty that Wall Street’s linear models are missing.

This is the Growth Wedge. And it implies that the “Cost of Capital” isn’t going back to zero—it’s going to track the cost of rebuilding the entire US energy grid from scratch.

The Optimist’s Delusion

To understand why the consensus is wrong, we must first steelman their argument. Hudson Bay posits that US exceptionalism is strengthening. They argue that the productivity gains from AI (estimated at 0.5–1.5% annually) will outweigh the stagflationary drag of protectionism.

In their model, AI acts as a deflationary force. By substituting capital (software/compute) for labor, we lower unit costs and expand margins. This justifies a “Sentiment Spread”—a premium valuation multiple—similar to the 1985-2001 period.

The mistake in the AI-optimist model is treating machine substitution as “Hicks-neutral” (a technological change that doesn’t alter the ratio of capital to labor). In reality, this transition is energy-biased and capital-deepening.

The Ergodicity Error

More fundamentally, the AI-optimist model commits an ergodicity error: it confuses the ensemble average with the time average.

Wall Street implicitly assumes that because capital can flow and equilibrate in the long run, it will do so smoothly over the short run. But we do not live in an ensemble of possible economies. We live in a single, path-dependent timeline.

If the copper wires, transformers, and gas turbines cannot be built fast enough to support the AI load in 2027, the system breaks long before it ever reaches the hypothetical 2035 equilibrium.

They see “The Cloud” as a place where value scales infinitely with near-zero friction. But “The Cloud” is not a place. It is a physical infrastructure of aluminum, copper, and megawatts. And unlike the software boom of the 1990s, which ran on the “stranded capacity” of office buildings and efficiency gains from the death of the incandescent bulb, this new boom requires Net New Industrial Capacity (a replay of the DotCom fiber buildout).

Revisionist History: The Decoupling of Throughput

To understand the trap we are in, we have to rewrite the history of the last 50 years. Standard economics holds that the divergence between Productivity and Wages that began in 1973 was a policy failure or the result of corporate greed, the loss of unions, etc.

Institutions and policy certainly shaped how this divergence manifested, but it became unavoidable once throughput migrated from human bodies to owned infrastructure.

Some economists argue that this divergence is a statistical illusion—that if you adjust for inflation correctly (using output prices instead of consumer prices) and include non-wage benefits, pay actually kept up with productivity.

They are missing the point (unsurprisingly). The divergence isn’t a measurement error; it is a Topology Shift.

As the chart above illustrates, Labor and Productivity marched in lockstep for the first half of the 20th century. Why? Because the economy ran on Liquid Fuels and Human Labor. To burn more oil, you needed more men to drive the trucks, man the rigs, and work the assembly lines. Labor controlled the throughput and hence negotiated its proportionate share. In the areas of the economy where this remained true, as the linked paper demonstrates, wages largely tracked productivity:

In 1973, we hit the Thermodynamic Wall. We couldn’t just add more men to burn more oil. We switched to the “Cheat Code” (Offshoring) and began the slow transition to the “Electro-Capital” grid.

The reason “Consumer Prices” (what workers buy) rose faster than “Output Prices” (what workers make)—creating the statistical gap economists struggle to “correct” away—is Global Arbitrage. We used foreign labor to suppress the price of tradable goods (TVs, Toys), but we could not suppress the thermodynamic cost of living (Housing, Energy, Healthcare) in the domestic economy.

Whether you call it the end of the “Family Wage” (Sociology) or the end of “Cheap Oil” (Physics), the result is the same: The Surplus Evaporated.

The Bottleneck Arbitrage:

Pre-1973: Energy flowed through human bodies (food/transport). Labor captured the gains because Labor was the transmission mechanism.

Post-1973: Energy began to flow through increasingly privately-owned infrastructure (wires, pipelines, servers). Capital captured the gains because Capital owned the bottleneck.

The “China Shock” and automation were just accelerators of this trend. But the system didn’t totally bypass the human. Ironically, it increasingly consumed their LEISURE as data inputs to the machine.

We didn’t stop working; we just stopped getting paid. We entered a Barter Economy: we trade our “Audience Services” (attention/labor) for “Media Services” (content). The value of this labor is captured in GDP as Advertising Services (Corporate Revenue), but it is absent from Wages (Household Income). We lost the paycheck, kept the work, and called it “content.”

The Global Cheat Code

This wasn’t just an American phenomenon. The entire developed world spent the last 50 years playing a game of thermodynamic arbitrage to avoid the cost of domestic energy production.

The UK Model: When the UK hit the wall in 1976, they didn’t solve it with efficiency; they solved it with geology (North Sea Oil). When that ran out in 2000, they swapped cheap oil for cheap imported labor.

The EU Model: Europe combined cheap energy (Russia gas) with successive waves of labor arbitrage. The first phase absorbed high-skill Eastern European labor following EU expansion, effectively delaying automation. As wage convergence and demographic decline closed that channel, Europe substituted quantity for quality via non-EU migration. This preserved headcount but diluted capital per worker, intensifying pressure on housing, infrastructure, and long-standing social norms. The model’s instability reflects the same Hicks-neutral error seen in AI optimism: assuming labor inflows can substitute indefinitely for capital formation.

The East Asian Model: The “China Shock” wasn’t an isolated event; it was the last gasp of a 50-year strategy to outsource the world’s entropy to a manufacturing sink.

This becomes apparent when we consider the arbitrage that existed in 1990 that allowed the US (and other developed nations, but mostly the US) to outsource human labor:

The crisis today is that all three Cheat Codes are failing simultaneously.

The China Valve: Closed by geopolitics and demographics.

The Russia Valve: Closed by war.

The Migration Valve: Closing due to a Physical Capital Crisis.

The Hicks-Neutral Fallacy of Migration

Just as Wall Street treats AI projections as having access to infinite energy, policymakers treat migration as having infinite infrastructure. The standard assumption was that migrants moving from capital-poor to capital-rich regions would “level up” to Western productivity.

This is not a claim about migration per se. In a capital-abundant regime that builds housing and infrastructure at scale, migration is productivity-enhancing. The failure arises only when policymakers assume Hicks-neutrality and refuse to build. Migration stress arises not from flows per se, but from the slow-moving stock of housing and infrastructure.

If Physical Capital (Housing, Healthcare, Roads, Schools) is constrained, adding more people doesn’t raise the migrant; it levels down the native and forces them to compete (via higher prices) for these increasingly scarce resources. When the capital stock per capita dilutes, the “B-Sector” (Housing/Services) experiences massive inflation. The political backlash closing borders today isn’t just cultural; it is a reaction to the thermodynamic crowding out of the native working class.

The Energy Investment Equation

The end of the “Cheat Code” is visible in the raw physical data.

For twenty years (2000–2019), the US economy pulled off a magic trick. We grew GDP while keeping energy consumption flat. This was the “Negative Slope” anomaly.

That illusion is over.

Since 2020, the US slope has turned positive (Beta = 1.34). To generate the next dollar of GDP, we must once again use more energy. Why? Because “US Exceptionalism” now includes Reshoring. We are bringing aluminum smelting, chip fabs, and data centers back home.

The “14% Bottleneck”

Here is where the math gets violent. The core of the Bull Case is that AI will “fill the gap” left by a stagnating labor force and efficiency will lower overall usage.

But let’s look at the topology of that thesis.

You can’t efficiency your way out of a shortage.

The US primary energy system consumes roughly 100 Quads (29,000 TWh) of energy per year. However, the electrical grid only generates ~4,200 TWh.

The Reality: The grid handles only ~14% of the nation’s energy flow.

The Rest: The other 86% flows through liquid fuels (oil/gas) and direct chemical inputs (food/fertilizer).

The Human Engine (Distributed & Diversified)

Humans are energetically expensive (~36,500 kWh/year in biological and chemical energy consumption required to sustain a Western worker) but infrastructurally diversified. We draw ~80% of our energy from the “Off-Grid” system: Gasoline, Natural Gas, and Food. Only ~4,200 kWh of that burden is transmitted to the electrical grid (residential load).

The Machine Engine (Concentrated & Constrained)

Machines are infrastructurally concentrated. An AI Agent draws 100% of its energy from the electrical grid. It cannot eat a sandwich, nor can it burn gasoline.

When you replace a Human with a Machine, you are attempting to route the entire economy through a 14% bottleneck. We can calculate the “Substitution Penalty” using 2024 production data:

Human Grid Load: ~4,200 kWh/year.

Machine Grid Load: To generate the same GDP output ($150k), a machine requires ~156,000 kWh of electricity (based on the current economy-wide average capital efficiency of ~1.04 kWh/$, a likely understated assumption as Data Centers run at much higher utilization than the average factory).

Recent work by Jones and Tonetti (2026) provides the mathematical proof: in a system of complementary inputs, growth is constrained by the “Weakest Link.”

The prevailing technocratic interpretation is that Human Labor is this weak link—a drag on efficiency that must be automated away.

This is not just a sociological error; it is a fatal strategic error. You cannot ask a human to build a machine whose stated purpose is to replace the human. It’s as inhumane as asking prisoners of war to dig their own graves. It is not a business plan; it is a declaration of war.

To fund the massive capex required to build the Thermodynamic Grid, we need the political and physical buy-in of the population. We are currently selling them “Fear of Replacement.” We need to sell them “Inheritance.” The Meek don’t want to just serve the machine; they want to inherit the Earth it builds.

Until we correct this narrative — until we make the human a beneficiary rather than a target — the grid will remain the binding constraint. The machine waits for the electron because the voter refuses to dig the trench.

The Predatory Nature of Capital Deepening

Standard economic theory and status quo defending economists assume that “Capital Deepening” (investing in machines) raises wages because it makes workers more productive.

This assumes Energy is elastic. It assumes that if we build a Machine, the grid will expand to feed both the Machine and the Human.

In a 14% Bottleneck world, Capital Deepening can be predatory.

The Machine does not just compete with the Human for work; it competes with the Human for current. The AI Data Center pays for the substation upgrade; the residential neighborhood gets the brownout. And the protests begin:

If you doubt the cost of this transition, look at the divergence between the fuel (Gas) and the product (Electricity).

As the chart above illustrates, the cost of Electricity (White Line) has largely decoupled from the cost of Natural Gas (Orange Line).

The Molecule (Orange): Remains cheap due to the shale revolution and “Associated Gas” surplus. More on that later.

The Electron (White): Is soaring in price.

The Ratio (Green): This is the Topology Penalty. It is the cost of grid congestion, ESG mandates, and transmission complexity. We have plenty of cheap gas, but we cannot turn it into cheap power because the transmission layer is broken.

The counterargument is that the grid can be bypassed or modularized via “behind-the-meter” generation, i.e., Microsoft building power plants. This path has been promoted by the Trump administration. This can be done — but only at the cost of turning software firms into utilities and internalizing capital costs that markets price currently as external. Privatization does not remove the constraint; it converts a public bottleneck into a balance-sheet one, raising the marginal cost of capital for every downstream activity.

The issue is not that this capital cannot be built, but that it cannot be built fast enough, cheaply enough, or uniformly enough to avoid a decade-scale binding constraint.

The “Triple Load” Disaster

Critics might argue that demographic decline will offset this load. This ignores the Transition Period (2025–2035) discussed in my end-of-year post. We are facing a period of Displacement, not just Replacement.

We are squeezing the grid in a Triple Pincer:

The Legacy Pincer (The Human Stays): The displaced worker is still alive. They still heat their home and drive their car (increasingly electric). Their 36,500 kWh load remains.

The Machine Pincer (The AI Arrives): The AI Data Center comes online to do its job, adding 156,000 kWh of new load to the grid.

The Rerouting Pincer (The Electrification): Even the “efficiencies” we are promised (EVs, Heat Pumps) work against us topologically. When you swap a gas car for an EV, you may save energy in aggregate, but you worsen congestion in the constrained layer that sets the system’s price.

The Net Result: We don’t save energy. We add a massive new layer of industrial demand (Pincer 2) while simultaneously dumping the entire transportation load (Pincer 3) onto the same fragile copper wires used by the legacy base (Pincer 1). The policy goal is to raise the grid’s share—but doing so requires rebuilding the transmission layer itself, which is precisely the binding constraint.

We are trying to force a disproportionate share of future growth through a pipe built for a fraction of today’s load.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ru7B!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41997641-f034-4e7f-92fa-768b65691761_512x359.png",N,,2026-01-18 11:00:19.134783
,Louisiana Environment,2026-01-18 12:00:58+00:00,NOLA.com,Is Louisiana bucking a national trend on greenhouse gas emissions? Here's what the numbers say.,"Josie Abugov, Staff, DAVID GRUNFELD",,,,,https://www.nola.com/news/environment/louisiana-climate-warming-greenhouse-gas-industrry/article_0cf13047-fc0c-4327-a2fc-be2069b48cc8.html,"At the national level, power generation drives greenhouse gas emissions, said David Dismukes, professor emeritus at the LSU Center for Energy Studies.
""Even though it's natural gas and it's not renewable, we're emitting far less greenhouse gas emissions for that power generation,"" Dismukes said.
""It's not just about reducing carbon emissions,"" said Justin Carr, a carbon capture asset manager for ExxonMobil.
She pointed to year-to-year changes in state emissions data, noting that 2023 emissions figures were similar to nearly a decade prior.
""If we remove that one source of natural gas transport, that takes away most of the decrease,"" Terrell said.","Louisiana has been among the nation's biggest greenhouse gas emitters due to its heavy industry, but new data shows the state may be at least temporarily bucking a trend.

While climate-warming emissions increased nationwide last year, Louisiana's share has slightly declined over the past few years and was relatively flat in 2025, the preliminary data from an independent research group shows.

Any reduction in greenhouse gases classifies as good news. But industry and environmental analysts caution that Louisiana's figures should be taken with a heavy dose of caution.

The uptick in nationwide emissions reverses a trend of decreases over the past two years, note analysts at the Rhodium Group, which used U.S Environmental Protection Agency data for its report. Much of the increase was due to utilities burning more coal to help meet the growing power needs of artificial intelligence data centers and residents heating their homes during cold winter weather, the analysts say.

But some of the underlying factors are different in Louisiana.

At the national level, power generation drives greenhouse gas emissions, said David Dismukes, professor emeritus at the LSU Center for Energy Studies. But nearly 60% of Louisiana's carbon emissions came from industry as of 2023.

""We have a much higher industrial base than the average state and we also have a lower population,"" said Dismukes. ""Where industry goes is where our greenhouse gas emissions are going to go in the state.""

It is precisely for that reason that the reductions may come as a surprise to some.

The state has welcomed a variety of industrial plants in recent years, from a booming liquefied natural gas export sector to continued petrochemical production along the Mississippi River corridor. A range of projects are also slated to begin operations in the coming years, such as a nearly $6 billion Hyundai steel mill and Meta's power-hungry AI data center.

Dismukes attributes Louisiana's decreasing emissions to improved efficiency when it comes to both power generation and industry. He highlighted utilities phasing out old generators and replacing them with newer, less polluting, models.

""Even though it's natural gas and it's not renewable, we're emitting far less greenhouse gas emissions for that power generation,"" Dismukes said.

The same is true on the industrial side, Dismukes said, as Louisiana expands its productive capacity without making substantial changes in emissions at ammonia plants, methanol plants and refineries. Greg Upton, the current director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies, also noted that many industrial plants are trying to connect to the grid, which could reduce emissions if the energy being transmitted there is cleaner.

""It's not just about reducing carbon emissions,"" said Justin Carr, a carbon capture asset manager for ExxonMobil. ""It's about consuming less energy and natural gas to save cost, too. There's always a push to make the products with less input.""

A mixed result

Carr argued that Louisiana has the opportunity to decrease emissions ""without sacrificing its ability to be a manufacturing powerhouse"" through carbon capture -- but that technology is highly controversial and it is unclear how intensively the state will pursue it in the future.

Carbon capture involves piping C02 emissions deep underground for permanent storage, but it has faced heavy opposition in rural areas.

Another concern is that an influx of new industry could outpace improvements.

""On one hand, you'll have the emissions intensity of products decline, but on the other hand, you have these billions of dollars of investment in facilities that are going to come online,"" Upton said. ""Even if they're producing a very low carbon product...that can actually increase the total amount of emissions.""

Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at the Environmental Integrity Project, said that even a single large facility can change the overall picture for the state's emissions. She pointed to year-to-year changes in state emissions data, noting that 2023 emissions figures were similar to nearly a decade prior.

Decreasing emissions from 2023 to 2024 largely came from reductions in natural gas pipeline transport, she said, even as other sectors increased their emissions.

""If we remove that one source of natural gas transport, that takes away most of the decrease,"" Terrell said. ""Individual sectors in Louisiana have been remaining steady or increasing slightly.""

Over the last two decades, carbon emissions dropped nine percent in Louisiana, according to the Rhodium Group, mirroring a larger national trend to a less dramatic degree. Across the country as a whole, emissions declined by 18% in the same period as the country phased out coal power in favor of mostly natural gas and some renewable energy.

But there are warnings that the Trump administration's opposition to renewable energy and embrace of coal could reverse many gains.

What about on the national level?

Competing forces are also playing out on the national level, the Rhodium Group's estimates show.

Last year, solar power was the fastest growing source of electricity. But higher demand in the power sector, largely fueled by AI data centers, and the resurgence of coal due to high natural gas prices — in part spurred by liquefied natural gas exports — ultimately trumped the surge in solar, the researchers found.

""When power demand is growing substantially, both things can be true: You can be bringing a record amount of renewables online, but at the same time you're not really reducing emissions,"" said Michael Gaffney, a lead author of the report.

Gaffney noted that Louisiana has seen some emissions reductions in the power sector, as natural gas has reduced the grid share of coal. Conversely, emissions from LNG exports have increased as more capacity for the facilities come online. Louisiana is the global epicenter of the carbon-intensive industry and President Donald Trump has pushed to expand the sector further.

The three existing LNG export terminals in Louisiana were all among the top 10 carbon emitting facilities in the state as of 2023, according to data from Upton. There are more than a dozen more terminals approved or proposed for Louisiana. The other top emitters were chemical plants and refineries.

Terrell noted that Rhodium's low, medium and high emissions predictions for Louisiana all project a ""massive increase in emissions from LNG,"" even as the state's holistic emissions figures are more varied.

The Rhodium Group found that some of the national emission changes resulted from Trump repealing climate regulations and curbing clean energy tax credits passed under the Biden administration. More effects of policy changes may be felt in the coming years, Gaffney said.

Upton and Dismukes similarly pointed to the impact of the shuttered tax credits, but they cautioned against giving too much weight to some domestic political changes.

""I know broadly where the policy is going and it doesn't matter who it is,"" Dismukes said. ""It's going to be more efficient and having lower emissions and delivering product and commodity at the lowest cost, both environmentally and economically.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/15/015afb34-75e5-11ef-9d7f-876a5df48d0f/6373fd8ad3900.image.jpg?crop=1917%2C1006%2C0%2C37&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-18 09:59:02.744354

Merifund Capital Management continues to track how supply-chain control, regional production and pricing translate into resilience, and Saunders describes “operational discipline and repeatable execution” as the attributes most likely to define leadership as competition intensifies.","Annual delivery data to 31 December 2025 places BYD ahead of Tesla in battery-electric volumes, sharpening focus on scale, supply-chain control and overseas plants, while Tesla’s strategy pivots towards robotaxis, AI and humanoid robotics.

New full-year delivery disclosures tighten the competitive picture in electric vehicles, and Merifund Capital Management Pte. Ltd. is spotlighting a clear change in leadership as BYD reports 2.26 million battery-electric deliveries against Tesla’s 1.64 million.

Set against the preceding comparable period, Tesla deliveries contract 8.6%, while BYD’s battery-electric volume expands 28%. Across its broader automotive footprint, BYD reports 4.55 million vehicle sales, alongside plug-in hybrid volumes of 2.29 million, down 8% on the prior year.

For institutional investors tracking the energy transition, the significance sits in how the lead is built. Scale manufacturing, supply-chain control and disciplined cost curves are becoming as important as early-mover branding, particularly as price-sensitive buyers take a larger share of demand across major regions.

Tesla’s softer trend is most visible in the final quarter of the reporting period, when deliveries slip 15.61% compared with the same quarter a year earlier to 418,227. The end of the $7,500 US federal tax credit at the start of this month adds pressure to pricing, with competitive alternatives multiplying across the mid-market segment.

Governance scrutiny is also sharpening. A coalition of pension investors representing 7.9 million Tesla shares is now pressing for a minimum 40-hour commitment each week from Elon Musk, arguing that operational focus, brand perception and share-price volatility are increasingly intertwined.

Tesla is simultaneously reframing its forward narrative around autonomy and physical artificial intelligence. Robotaxi trials in Austin currently run with a pilot fleet of around 25 to 30 vehicles and retain in-car safety monitors, while hiring activity points to expansion across multiple US cities over the coming year. Optimus, the humanoid robot programme, remains prominent in factory planning, even as rare-earth magnet supply constraints influence deployment pace.

BYD is taking a more industrial route to expansion, backed by integrated production and a broad line-up across price points. Overseas volumes now exceed one million vehicles on the latest full-year reading, up 150% on the prior year, as the group broadens manufacturing in locations including Thailand, Turkey and Hungary to reduce shipping costs and policy risk. Merifund Capital Management notes that current supply-chain mapping suggests BYD produces roughly 65% of direct materials internally. For Anthony Saunders, Director of Private Equity at Merifund Capital Management, “BYD’s manufacturing diversification strategy positions the company effectively against trade policy uncertainties” while “maintaining cost competitiveness through technological advantages in battery production” is now central to its international push.

Cost and pricing signals reinforce that assessment. Industry estimates currently put BYD’s Blade battery manufacturing costs about $11.6 per kilowatt-hour below Tesla’s 4680 approach. As of this month’s published UK list prices, a Tesla Model 3 rear-wheel drive is listed at about $53,586.6, while a BYD Seal is around $61,640 for comparable positioning. In Australia, current market pricing places the Seal about 22% below the Model 3, strengthening BYD’s ability to compete for volume without relying on subsidies.

Policy settings are splitting the market into distinct regional battlegrounds. In the United States, the removal of the $7,500 consumer credit is reshaping demand and pushing manufacturers to route incentives through leases, with some projections pointing to EV penetration easing towards 5% of total vehicle sales over the next year. China remains driven by consumer preference, with the electric share of new-car sales staying close to half on the latest full-year data, and surveys released over the past year indicating that more than 80% of buyers expect their next purchase to be electric.

Taken together, BYD’s delivery lead and Tesla’s technology pivot underline a sector where manufacturing discipline and software ambition are both being priced by investors.

No one elected the judges who keep inserting themselves into the day-to-day policy decisions, and they are a huge problem. Members of Congress need to stop their nonsense. This president is setting the United States on a good path forward to sustain itself into the future for hundreds of years. Other politicians only look to the next election. We need to protect the U.S. first and foremost. Thankfully, Trump is doing exactly this.

Tariffs: Implemented worldwide tariffs in April, helped resolve wars in India and Pakistan, and collecting $200 billion in additional tariff revenue by the end of 2025, with the U.S. economy holding up as noted by The Wall Street Journal.

Immigration: Achieved seven straight months of zero illegal aliens release into the United States, reducing nationwide crossings by 93% compared with the peak under the Biden administration, by enforcing existing laws without new legislation.

Drill, baby, drill: Ushered in energy dominance with record production, leading the world in oil (24.2 million barrels per day, more than Saudi Arabia and Russia combined) and natural gas (nearly 109 billion cubic feet per day), with gas prices at a four-year low of $2.90 a gallon.

Passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Made 2017 tax cuts permanent, added childcare subsidies, eliminated the tax on tips, exempted overtime and Social Security from taxation for most beneficiaries, and included Trump Accounts with $1,000 investments for U.S.-born children.

President of peace: Ended multiple wars using economic pressure and military might, facilitating peaceful resolutions in warring nations including in the Middle East, though a Russia-Ukraine deal remained elusive.

He should not allow Chinese students to attend our universities. Their exemption is a mistake. China pressures students to spy for them.

We are safer and our finances are doing much better under President Trump.

Trump should work to maintain control of Congress, and he should focus on expanding U.S. energy dominance policies to achieve full American energy independence, slashing regulations to even further to boost the economy and securing our borders with unprecedented immigration enforcement to keep America first in 2026.

More thoughts from readers on Trump's first year

I had hope originally that he would bring us out of foreign conflicts as he repeatedly said on the campaign trail. I have been severely disappointed in Trump’s second term. He's essentially betrayed everyone that voted for him on America First principles. On the contrary, it seems we're going back to neocon interventionism.

— John Walling, New Jersey

It's worse than I could have possibly imagined, and the spineless Republicans just let Trump get away with it. He has alienated our former friends and is sucking up to war criminals. Things are more expensive because of tariffs, and the environment will degrade faster. For me, it touches so many things in daily life.

— Isabel Ackerman, Montana

I’m afraid there's been no change. Groceries are still expensive, and there's still a lot of political division between people in a way that you can't even sit and have a normal conversation. The immigration raids keep me off the street with my family, just because I'm Latino, even though I'm a citizen. I know I'll be targeted.

— Wilfredo Pagan, North Carolina

I am watching the greatest experiment in freedom and democracy die. It is understandable that Trump is acting with such shamefully malicious behaviors, such despicable abuses of power. To be abandoned by Congress is what is utterly shocking. When coequal branches of government are subservient to one another, the show is over.

And rather than relying entirely on the private sector, Maine should create a public power authority comparable to those in other states that have produced lower rates and greater public benefits.
The benefits of public power are newly relevant to renewable conversion, which requires major investment and skillful navigation through the shoals of public opinion.
Rather than attempting to uproot established regulated utilities, a public power authority focused on generation could be a winner.
Public power would allow us the shape our energy future to a significant degree, and for that reason alone demands debate.","Last week, I reviewed some of Maine’s policy hits and misses in attempting a transition to renewable energy without driving up electric rates to unaffordable levels. Heat pumps are working well, but all-electric vehicles have fallen well short of projections.

But there should be no doubt we need to replace fossil fuels to avert a climate disaster, especially since the cost of new solar installations is below that of natural gas, and over the last two years 80% of new U.S. generation came from renewables. President Donald Trump’s attempts to revert to fossil fuels will fail on economic as well as policy grounds.

Yet Maine faces formidable difficulties. It has the best chance to build renewables of any state in the Northeast, thanks to its wide-open landscapes away from the coast, but there are obstacles that can’t be surmounted without significant changes in way Maine builds and finances projects.

Exhibit A is an Aroostook County 1,200 megawatt wind project that the Legislature authorized and was put out to bid by the Public Utilities Commission in 2022. The effort failed when the contractor chosen ran into serious opposition from landowners along the transmission corridor that increased costs. A new RFP went out in December, supposedly better coordinated with New England-wide planning, but there are reasons to be skeptical it will be any more successful.

There’s no doubt Aroostook wind would be a major new energy source, equal to the Quebec hydropower that will soon flow through western Maine to Massachusetts, helping fulfill the Bay State’s ambitious renewable goals, similar to Maine’s. But the fraught history of the New England Clean Energy Connect line shows that even cost-effective projects are hard to pull off.

Though Maine ratepayers will actually benefit from NECEC, fervent opposition led by the Natural Resources Council of Maine resulted in its rejection by referendum in 2021, with 60% opposed. Only a Supreme Judicial Court decision finding developers that had already begun construction had “vested rights” allowed its completion, two years late and costing about 50% more than the original contract.

Although the Aroostook wind project more directly benefits Maine, it likely faces similar opposition to the necessary transmission lines. And since the Legislature has already ruled out use of eminent domain for private developers, the odds for lengthy delays and litigation will increase.

Changes in state policy and a new state agency could tip the balance back toward completion of projects making electricity more affordable and reliable. The new Department of Energy Resources is a start. It can focus on the comprehensive state energy plan that goes beyond goal-setting to specify what must be done to achieve them.

And rather than relying entirely on the private sector, Maine should create a public power authority comparable to those in other states that have produced lower rates and greater public benefits. Most state authorities were established in the early 20th century around hydroelectric dams that powered industrial growth; Maine missed that chance.

The benefits of public power are newly relevant to renewable conversion, which requires major investment and skillful navigation through the shoals of public opinion. A 2023 referendum to replace century-old Central Maine Power and Versant for electric transmission and distribution with a non-profit Pine Tree Power Co. failed utterly, but its argument about the benefits of public ownership were sound – just misdirected.

Rather than attempting to uproot established regulated utilities, a public power authority focused on generation could be a winner. Unlike CMP and its construction arm, Avangrid, a public authority would pay no federal or state taxes, require no profits, and should be far more responsive to public attitudes and needs. The savings would be substantial, but the ability to persevere for the decade or more it often takes to bring major projects on line could be even more important.

True, state government hasn’t attempted any similar agency-building in decades, but that’s all the more reason why public power is such a compelling concept now. Our major utilities were sold out-of-state, then out-of-country long ago, the result of misguided deregulation efforts.

We no longer have much control over the electric system powering new technology that promises – and threatens – to exceed the demands of 20th century industry. Public power would allow us the shape our energy future to a significant degree, and for that reason alone demands debate.

The real question is who among those who seek to lead Maine after 2026 will take up the challenge?

People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.
As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.
“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont (AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn’t seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump’s stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year’s elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

“We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,” McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben’s Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he’s sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology” got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it’s not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style’s popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,” McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

The ongoing energy crisis in Cuba has led to residents experiencing almost daily blackouts and gas cuts in recent months.

President Trump is strongly encouraging Cuba to sign an agreement with Washington to ensure its oil supply and alleviate its ongoing energy crisis.","Cuba has been experiencing a worsening energy crisis for several years, which has led it to rely heavily on Venezuela for its fuel. Following the United States' intervention in Venezuela earlier this month, Cuba is expected to lose a vital supply chain for fuel, putting increasing pressure on the government to respond to the energy crisis. In the short-term, this will likely mean relying more heavily on oil-rich neighbours, such as Mexico, to provide supplies. However, Cuba must look for a long-term solution to its energy problems to bring an end to the crisis and enhance security.

The ongoing energy crisis in Cuba has led to residents experiencing almost daily blackouts and gas cuts in recent months. The crisis was driven by years of underinvestment in the country’s transmission network, which led power plants to run below capacity. The country’s energy supply now falls far below the consumer demand. The regular blackouts have forced Cubans to invest in charcoal stoves, rechargeable batteries, and fans, which many residents can scarcely afford.

In March last year, Cuba’s national electrical grid collapsed, leaving most of the island’s population of 10 million without power. Major tourist hotels came to rely on generators, while many had no access to power at all. This has resulted in mass protests, as residents call for the government to address the crisis.

Venezuela has become one of Cuba’s main oil suppliers in recent years. Despite its dwindling oil production, Venezuela was shipping an average of 26,500 bpd to Cuba last year, according to ship tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA. This was thought to cover around 50 percent of Cuba’s oil deficit, while Venezuela accounted for roughly 10 percent of Cuba’s trade in 2025.

However, no cargoes have reportedly left Venezuelan ports for Cuba since the U.S. intervention in the South American country earlier this month. Thirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. attack. President Donald Trump has since warned Cuba that it should sign an agreement with Washington to ensure it continues to receive much-needed oil from Venezuela.

Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, “THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA – ZERO!” He added, “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”

Shortly after, Trump wrote, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of oil and money from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators.” The president went on to say, “But not anymore! Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn't need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years. Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will.”

Cuba’s president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, responded by writing on the X social media site, “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do.” He added, “Cuba does not attack; it has been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” Meanwhile, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez wrote on X that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to export it.

The halt of Venezuelan oil exports to Cuba has forced Mexico to step in. Mexico moved ahead of Venezuela in 2025 as Cuba’s main oil supplier, according to a recent Financial Times article, although President Claudia Sheinbaum was quick to say that Mexico is not shipping significantly more oil to Cuba than in previous years. President Sheinbaum said, “We are not sending more oil than we have historically… Of course, with the current situation in Venezuela, Mexico has obviously become an important supplier. Before, it was Venezuela.”

Mexico was estimated to have sent a daily average of 12,284 bpd of crude to Cuba in 2025, contributing 44 percent of the Caribbean island’s crude imports, while Venezuela exported an estimated 9,528 bpd of oil to Cuba, accounting for 34 percent of its oil imports.

The Trump administration is less than impressed by the ongoing export of Mexican crude to Cuba, which could put increasing pressure on Sheinbaum to curb shipments due to the upcoming review of the North American USMCA free trade agreement. The Florida Republican Congressman Carlos Giménez recently threatened, “Make no mistake: if the Sheinbaum government continues to give away free oil to the terrorist dictatorship in Havana, there will be serious consequences as we renegotiate the USMCA.”

As the threats continue to mount, several Latin American countries are feeling increasing pressure from their northern aggressor to change their behaviour. President Trump is strongly encouraging Cuba to sign an agreement with Washington to ensure its oil supply and alleviate its ongoing energy crisis. While Mexico is feeling greater pressure to curb its increasingly vital oil exports to Cuba.

The certification applies to Prime’s Dallas facility, DFW01-01 and its Sacramento data centre, SMF01-01.

Both earn the EPA's label for demonstrating superior energy performance based on verified data across operational conditions such as occupancy, run hours and infrastructure usage.

ENERGY STAR® certification is the only energy efficiency mark in the United States based on actual measured energy use and independently verified performance.

To qualify, buildings must operate with lower energy intensity than the majority of comparable facilities, adjusted for environmental and usage factors.

According to the EPA, certified buildings use on average 35% less energy and emit 35% fewer greenhouse gases than non-certified peers, without compromising performance.

Steve Benson, Senior Vice President of Critical Operations at Prime Data Centers, says: “Data centres play an increasingly critical role in supporting the systems we depend on every day, which places a responsibility on operators to run facilities as efficiently and consistently as possible.

“These ENERGY STAR certifications validate the work our teams do to ensure our facilities are prepared to support customer needs today while scaling responsibly for what comes next.”

Focus on energy benchmarks and performance

The ENERGY STAR® programme uses normalised data that accounts for external variables to create a fair baseline for comparison.

Each facility's performance must be verified by a third party before certification is awarded.

The Dallas facility, DFW01-01, and the Sacramento site, SMF01-01, achieve scores that meet the EPA threshold, placing them among the most energy-efficient data centres in the country.

These scores reflect consistent performance across site infrastructure, IT load and support systems.

Prime designs its facilities with energy efficiency in mind, integrating infrastructure that supports operational best practice.

The company combines design, monitoring and benchmarking to reduce energy waste while maintaining uptime and supporting digital infrastructure at scale.

Sara Martinez, Vice President of Sustainability at Prime Data Centers, says: “This certification is a meaningful validation of Prime’s broader sustainability strategy and our commitment to responsible growth.

“Energy efficiency is a critical component of reducing environmental impact and ENERGY STAR recognition demonstrates that our facilities are performing at the highest standards as we continue to expand our footprint.”

Strategy built around operational efficiency

Prime Data Centers develops and operates hyperscale and purpose-built data centres, with a portfolio that supports global clients through scalable digital infrastructure. Its approach to sustainability aligns with long-term growth targets across markets.

Customers require high performance without energy inefficiency and this standard provides a validated performance marker.

As Prime expands, facilities are benchmarked and assessed against third-party frameworks to ensure operational integrity matches environmental performance.

Thousands of buildings and plants across the United States now hold ENERGY STAR® certification, including data centres, office buildings and manufacturing sites. Certification must be renewed annually, based on updated data and continued performance.

Prime's Dallas and Sacramento sites are among a smaller group of data centres that meet these requirements, marking a step in the company’s strategy to scale efficiently across its global footprint.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/18c396e3893ea73aa61f63859a5f0666:74f4ac66831194879d678ad0bbc8b689/sara-martinez-vice-president-of-sustainability-at-prime-data-centers.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 03:57:27.645925

The company documented the 5,000-mile-long road trip that put the Cadillac OPTIQ luxury crossover and a GMC Sierra EV pickup truck to the test. During the drive, three GM engineers gathered data on its hands-free driver assistance system, EV charging, and real-time range prediction while towing a trailer.

""We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios, from trailering features and GPS navigation updates to Super Cruise behavior in unusual situations,"" quality engineering manager Tony Kraatz said.

​​GM noted that both vehicles were equipped with advanced monitoring gear that helped the team ""find the root cause of a frustrating problem"": slow performance at one public fast-charging system. Ultimately, they discovered that the charger's software code had a typo that was slowing it down. They contacted the operator, who promptly fixed the issue.

This kind of extreme real-world testing helps improve overall performance for electric vehicles, which should be a win for greater EV adoption. According to the Department of Energy, driving an EV can help slash fuel costs, though it adds that initial costs for EVs can be greater than those of combustion engine vehicles.

Still, many states offer rebates or tax credits that help offset this. For instance, New Mexico gives residents a $3,000 state tax credit when they purchase a new EV.

EV users can save even more money — and avoid annoying malfunctions like the one described by GM — by charging at home instead of using public chargers. If you're interested in exploring home-charging options, Qmerit can help get you started with a Level 2 charger system. The company offers free installation estimates, too.

Hugh CasswellEast Midlands environment correspondent

""You're talking once in multiple generations that a really new energy source comes into being.""

Speaking this week, UKIFS chief executive Paul Methven said a fusion power plant, set to be constructed in north Nottinghamshire, will have ""global significance.""

UKIFS is the company responsible for building the prototype, known as STEP (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), on the site of the soon-to-be-demolished West Burton A coal-fired power station near Retford.

The region's power-generating heritage was one of the chief reasons for it being chosen to pioneer the technology, which it is hoped could eventually provide humanity with near-limitless, clean energy.

Nuclear fusion is the process which powers the sun, and scientists have been trying to recreate it on Earth for decades.

It does not rely on fossil fuels or produce harmful greenhouse gases, and is the opposite of the nuclear fission used in existing nuclear power plants.

Speaking at one of the public consultation events which started this week, head of engineering for STEP's fuel cycle, Michael Lord, demonstrated the process with a model of a tokamak - the device at the fusion plant's heart.

""We're looking to replicate the conditions you would have in a star,"" he said.

""We're taking atoms, we're holding them together under high temperature and pressure, and when they fuse, they generate and release energy.""

Fusion experiments usually consume more energy than they create, but there have been major breakthroughs in recent years.

Scaling the technology up to a point where it is commercially viable, however, is still a long way away.

""I don't expect the first device to be putting power on [the] grid in a way that will bring down energy bills, but all that learning will mean we have a futuristic power supply and power source for generations to come,"" Lord said.

With successive governments having invested billions of pounds in the sector, it can seem like a lot to stake on unproven technology.

""It's not a gamble, it's a calculated risk,"" Methven said.

""We're facing energy security challenges, climate challenges in the future, cost-of-energy challenges.

""If we don't take big strategic decisions and follow through on them over decades then those problems just get worse.""

Overcoming the hurdles that still exist with fusion, he said, is ""the job of the prototype"".

""Solving every one of those problems is a business opportunity in itself,"" he said. ""The spin-off technologies could be massive out of this.""

He added he understands why people living nearby may be concerned about the project, but said the consultation is ""not a tick-box"".

Vikki Wallace attended one of the drop-in events, having moved to the area seven weeks ago.

""We've come for the quiet life, and now all this is happening,"" she said.

""They're going to need thousands of people coming to work here, they've all got to get here, they've got to live here somewhere.""

She added she was worried about traffic noise but was reassured after hearing about the project's transport strategy, which includes new rail infrastructure and using the River Trent for freight transport.

Godfrey Watmough has lived in the nearby village of Bole for almost 80 years.

""Anything that brings security in electricity and energy has got to be a good thing, if it works,"" he said.

""They seem to be spending a lot of money before they know it actually works, but it's going to be an experimental site so that's what you expect.""

It continues to claim that 1,200 comments made to the U.S. CHIPS Program Office and OCIDA, including a ""lengthy"" comment from Jobs to Move America, raised ""a wide range of potential harms associated with the project, including impacts to public health, housing, the environment, and regional transportation systems.""

“This conclusion is unacceptable given that Micron is expected to receive an estimated $20 billion in combined federal, state and local subsidies. Public agencies overseeing the approval process should require the company to pursue stronger mitigation measures and less harmful alternatives,” said Khadeejah Ahmad, a lifelong resident of Central New York and organizer with JMA.

The lawsuit argues that these ""impacts"" were not properly ""addressed and mitigated"" in the environmental review process. It points to three main concerns that the advocacy group holds:

Potential pollution of local air, water, and soil due to the intensive use and disposal of toxic forever chemicals;

Harms resulting from the destruction of approximately 200 acres of wetlands, including increased flood risk to surrounding properties;

The project’s enormous carbon footprint from on-site emissions and energy demand, and how that complies with greenhouse gas reduction goals enshrined in state law.

“Micron must be a good neighbor to those of us who have lived here for years. The agencies did not adequately make sure those of us who live near the Micron site will be protected,” said Bonita H. Siegel, President of Neighbors for a Better Micron. “The goal of the lawsuit is to make sure Micron moves forward in a way that keeps us and our environment safe. We want Micron to be a good neighbor for years to come.”

CNY Central did extensive coverage on the Environmental Review Process that Micron went through with the county's Industrial Development Agency. Including attending multiple public hearings where similar concerns, to the lawsuit, were raised.

Neighbors and advocacy groups over the summer of 2025, expressed worries about the time allotted to review the extensive 719-page document, which included references, thousands of pages worth of appendixes and further reading.

County Executive Ryan McMahon addressed community concerns at the time by taking a swipe at neighbors who had previously challenged projects in Onondaga County, calling them ""the usual suspects,"" before saying that some comments were ""interesting and validating"" to hear and would be addressed.

""We’re going to take the comments, we’re going to review them, we’re going to make sure we didn’t miss anything. Did someone think of something we did not? It took us a while, so I don’t think that is going to be the case. Then we are going to respond to those, which gives us the final Environmental Impact Statement,"" he said at the time.

The draft environmental impact statement for Micron passed through the local level, and the NYSDEC began issuing permits for Micron's construction in December of 2025. Which led up to the groundbreaking ceremony on Friday. The first phase of constructing what is being called ""the largest project in New York State history"" is removing hundreds of trees from the Clay site.
