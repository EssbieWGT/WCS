However, the traditional 9-to-5 work schedule still provides the opportunity to find essential social connections.
While forming personal connections through work helps combat isolation, employees must still maintain and strengthen those connections.
Young adults’ daily experience in the workplace should be seen as an opportunity to establish new social connections.
The 9-to-5 work schedule has long been seen as a producer of boredom, but with the right mindset, living 9-to-5 can be an adventure.","What does it mean to live a normal life? Coming out of college, the traditional goal for many was to get a well-paying job, live in a nice place and socialize with people their age. Due to the current economic struggles and social fragmentation, many in our generation are struggling to achieve this goal, experiencing loneliness and isolation. However, the traditional 9-to-5 work schedule still provides the opportunity to find essential social connections.

It is important to understand the current difficulties that young adults are facing. Chris Beevers, director of the Institute for Mental Health Research, explained the paradoxical dichotomy of modern connection.

“Young adults are more connected to other people via online methods, but at the same time report higher levels of loneliness than ever,” Beever said. “What we’re finding is that for a lot of adolescents, just having a lot of contact with friends online is not sufficient.”

Therefore, a traditional in-person work environment may be more optimal for socialization because working virtually does not provide the same personal experience.

Chemistry freshman Jesse Bridwell expressed his concerns with a fully virtual employment.

“If you’re in your home 24/7, you can box yourself in and get in a little depressive episode,” Bridwell said. “I can’t imagine it’d be too good.”

However, the workplace is not a straightforward solution to loneliness. Although the workplace does undeniably create opportunities for in-person connections, much of that is dependent on the workplace culture.

“If the culture is basically everybody goes off, works in their office, eats lunch by themselves and then they go home at the end of the day, that doesn’t really do a lot for increasing interaction,” Beevers said.

Thus, it takes an active effort to create connections amongst coworkers. Another way to establish personal connections is through shared interests.

“If you have that common interest, it’s almost like an automatic entry into a conversation,” Beevers said.

While forming personal connections through work helps combat isolation, employees must still maintain and strengthen those connections. Beevers’ research found that spontaneity may be the key to fighting off feelings of loneliness.

“We collected Bluetooth signatures, which helped us understand when they were spending time with people versus without people,” Beevers said.

With this data, Beevers’ team determined that performing a variety of activities was beneficial for one’s mental health.

“The people who reported being the least lonely were the ones spending time with the same people, but having some variety in their day-to-day living,” Beevers said.

Therefore, the solution to our current crisis of loneliness requires both routine and spontaneity. Young adults’ daily experience in the workplace should be seen as an opportunity to establish new social connections. However, to strengthen these connections, individuals should embrace novel experiences, taking chances on new activities.

When we talk about Henry Hub, we’re really talking about Sabine Pipe Line (SPL) — a small, 150-mile, 235-MMcf/d interstate system in Southern Louisiana — and the 11 pipelines that connect to it in Vermillion Parish, LA.
These include: Acadian, Columbia Gulf (CGT), Gulf South, Jefferson Island, Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL), Sea Robin, Southern Natural (SONAT), Texas Gas, Transcontinental Gas Pipeline (Transco), Trunkline, and Bridgeline, an intrastate sister pipeline to Sabine.

Since 1990, it’s also served as the delivery mechanism for the third-largest commodity futures trading instrument in the world — the CME/NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures contract (behind only WTI and Brent crude). We delved into the formation, evolution and rationale for the benchmark trading location in our Henry the Hub, I Am I Am blog series, and we highly recommend you revisit those blogs if you want to learn how the hub really works.

As shown in Figure 1 below, most of these interconnects are bidirectional, and all but four (Acadian, Bridgeline, Jefferson Island and Sea Robin) are large-diameter, long-haul interstate pipelines. Depending on the combination of receipt and delivery points, these interconnects total as much as 3 Bcf/d of receipt capacity inside the hub and as much as 2.6 Bcf/d of delivery capacity. (For more on pipeline flows, see RBN’s Arrow Model, which breaks Louisiana and Texas into 11 regions and creates predictions for flows based on internal supply-and-demand fundamentals and the available pipeline capacity from one region to another.)

“Evolution” was written by Sheryl Crow and appears as the first song on side two of her 12th studio album of the same name. Released as a single in January 2024, it went to #12 on the Billboard Adult Alternatives chart and #33 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Singles chart. Crow said the song is about “leaving a better world for my children and a healthier planet.” Personnel in the record were: Sheryl Crow (lead, backing vocals), Mike Elizondo (keyboards, bass, drum programming, acoustic guitar), Fred Ettringham (drums, percussion), Rob Moose (viola, violin) and Tom Morello (Digi Tech Whammy WH-1 pedal guitar solo).

The album Evolution was recorded at Phantom Studios and Old Green Barn in Nashville, as well as Multiview Studios in Los Angeles, with Mike Elizondo, Sheryl Crow and John Shanks serving as producers. Released in March 2024, it went to # 42 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. Four singles were released from the LP.

Sheryl Crow is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actress. When singing in bands on the weekend while teaching school during the week in rural Missouri, Crow met St. Louis musician and record producer Jay Oliver. Oliver used Crow for jingles for McDonald's and Toyota. Crow relocated to Los Angeles, where she did session vocals and hooked up as a backing vocalist on Michael Jackson's Bad World Tour from 1987 to 1989. Her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club, was released in 1993. She has released 12 studio albums, four live albums, seven compilation albums, two EPs and 56 singles.

The details announced fall short of creating a fully independent EPA. A better model than the one announced by Minister Watt would be one in which the Environment Minister makes nature protection rules, and the EPA assesses and approves projects and enforces the rules based on strong National Environmental Standards.

“For decades, ministers have been able to be influenced and pressured by developers. Tragically, this has resulted in millions of hectares of valuable bushland and habitat being razed by bulldozers, and Australia’s natural wealth significantly degraded,” said ACF Acting CEO Paul Sinclair.

“We remain strongly of the view that independent, expert decision making by the EPA on assessments and approvals is the best way to the deliver the consistency and certainty that is needed under our national nature protection laws. Arm’s length decision making is better for nature and better for business. We will carefully consider the details of the model proposed in the context of the entire reform package by the government once we see the legislation.

Write to Maddison Elliott at Mining.com.au Images: IMARC, Silica Resources Australia & Pilbara Ports","State governments emphasised Australia’s reach in the critical minerals sector after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with US President Donald Trump last week to produce a secure supply amid export bans from China.

At the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC) in Sydney from 21-23 October, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns made an appearance to highlight the state’s clear focus on aiding the clean energy transition.

“Not only do we have experienced companies, the trained workforce, the stable democracy, the rule of law, we’ve also got the critical minerals sitting there to make a big difference: 21 of 31 on the critical minerals list, four out of five on the strategic minerals list, significant deposits of rare earths,” Minns says.

“We’ve got critical minerals and high-tech metal projects that are ready to go.”

Minns believes New South Wales projects are likely to rake in billions for the state economy, while also making a “major difference to the global economy”, so long as investors start buying in.

The Premier described the event as a sales pitch for investors, where companies can showcase their assets and appeal to market demand.

“Without mining, we can’t transition our energy system. We can’t expand renewable power. We can’t drive the economy of the future,” Minns adds.

The conference welcomed more than 11,000 mining executives, operational staff, investors, government officials, diplomats and METS companies over the three day event, reaching new heights.

Mining.com.au was in attendance at the event this year, with Executive Producer Shae Russell on the floor.

Queensland captures investors

A state north of IMARC, Queensland jumped onboard the country-wide focus on critical minerals, investing $30 million into silica mining jobs in Far North Queensland.

The investment will create 180 new jobs south of Innisfail, where public, unlisted, critical minerals company Silica Resources Australia’s Mourilyan Silica Sands Project is focused on ramping up production efforts.

The project was recently awarded a $30 million grant from the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC) to produce over 360,000 tonnes in the next year, and over 750,000 tonnes in the next five years.

Also attending IMARC, Queensland Minister for Finance, Trade, Employment and Training Ros Bates describes the investment as an initiative to deliver better outcomes and stronger returns to become a “significant local employer”.

“Silica flour is an essential precursor for silicon, a key component in advanced technologies like semiconductors and solar panels,” Bates says.

“Demand in countries like Japan, Korea and Taiwan is growing rapidly, and we are taking strong action to make sure Queensland is essential in the global supply chain.

“Our investment through QIC has delivered the plant, equipment, and land acquisitions for SRA to get on with creating jobs and mining the more than 50 million tonnes of silica sand on the project site.”

Utilising this grant, Silica Resources Managing Director Rob Tindall says the company intends to develop common user infrastructure at Mourilyan.

“This investment and our existing mining lease has allowed us to start extracting from a silica deposit requiring only shallow, low-cost extraction methods,” Tindall says.

“Demand driven by solar and clean energy technologies is anticipated to grow the global silica sand market to more than $36 billion by 2032, and this project allows North Queensland to secure a stake in that market while creating local employment and trade opportunities.”

Meanwhile, Queensland-based Graphinex has secured a US$860 million ($1.32 billion) Letter of Interest from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) to fund a proposed graphite mine and processing plant in North Queensland.

The site is predicted to create over 200 jobs at the mine site near Croydon and the plant in Townsville.

“Over the past decade, exports were transactional, relationships were an afterthought, Queensland’s export potential sat idle, and investment opportunities were missed,” Bates adds.

“By taking our international partnerships seriously, we are delivering a fresh start with new jobs and new investment, so Queenslanders can get on with building the lifestyle they deserve.”

Minister for Natural Resources and Mines Dale Last describes the support from the US as a “vote of confidence” for Queensland’s resources.

“This Letter of Interest follows close engagement between the Crisafulli Government and EXIM, as part of our plan to restore Queensland’s international reputation and deliver a better lifestyle for Queenslanders through a stronger economy,” Last says.

“Queensland is home to world-class graphite reserves in the world, and Graphinex’s plan to mine, process and manufacture ultra-high performance anodes right here in Queensland shows we are ready to lead the next wave of critical minerals investment.”

Graphinex Managing Director Art Malone says the US has sent a strong signal regarding its graphite demand.

“This is a pivotal moment for Graphinex and a strong signal from Washington DC that graphite matters,” Malone says.

“The US has made it clear that secure supply chains for critical minerals are essential to advanced manufacturing and defence capability.

“This financing milestone provides the momentum needed to accelerate development, lock in downstream partnerships, and create a secure and scalable pathway for high-quality and reliable graphite supply into the US market.”

WA conference opens

Over in Western Australia, the Pilbara Ports Safe Ships Safe Ports Forum welcomed 700 delegates including Australian and international industry leaders from the marine, resources and logistics sector.

Ports Minister Stephen Dawson described the Pilbara region as the “engine room of the Australian economy”.

“Pilbara Ports Safe Ships Safe Ports Forum is an outstanding example of collaboration across industry to strengthen maritime safety and operational excellence,” Dawson says.

“Confirming the feasibility of ship-to-ship ammonia refuelling at the Port of Port Hedland marks a major step towards establishing the Pilbara as a global hub for clean fuel bunkering and decarbonised shipping.”

The forum is regarded as one of the country’s largest maritime conferences, first established in 2016.

The 2025 program ran from 21-22 October, focusing on the Pilbara Ports Clean Fuel Bunkering Strategy to support a ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering trial at the Port of Port Hedland in 2026.

At its meeting on Oct. 8, city council gave approval — known as municipal support confirmation (MSC) — to two solar energy projects in Kanata North and two more in West Carleton-March.
That comes after the city hit pause on new renewable energy facilities over the summer.
""With falling costs and improving capabilities of renewable energy and battery energy storage systems, renewable resources such as solar energy should be competitive in our supplies,"" the agency said.
Solar technology has been improving, agreed both Hinzer and John Kirkwood, president of the Ottawa Renewable Energy Co-operative (OREC).","Four solar panel projects in Ottawa have received the go-ahead from city council, and experts and advocates believe more could soon follow.

""Nothing is more important right now than energy. We talk about how energy is the new gold,"" said Kanata North Coun. Cathy Curry, whose ward could house two of the new projects.

At its meeting on Oct. 8, city council gave approval — known as municipal support confirmation (MSC) — to two solar energy projects in Kanata North and two more in West Carleton-March.

That comes after the city hit pause on new renewable energy facilities over the summer.

The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), the organization that manages Ontario's electricity system, requires developers to have MSCs before submitting a provincial procurement proposal.

The four projects which got an MSC from council on Oct. 8 were:

The Dunrobin Solar Project, located on Dunrobin Road and on two properties without addresses.

The Carp Airport Solar Project at 1500 Thomas Argue Rd.

Kanata Solar I at 375 March Valley Rd. and 940 Klondike Rd.

Kanata Solar II at 915 Klondike Rd.

They all still need to be approved at the provincial level before they become a reality.

But they're needed, Curry said, to meet a growing demand for electricity in a changing world, adding that she anticipates many more renewable energy projects will get greenlit across Ontario.

Electricity demand

According to Curry, whose ward is known for its tech park, reliable energy is essential to attract and support businesses.

""It used to be that companies would come in and put all their furniture in and then ask [Hydro Ottawa], 'Oh, can you hook us up to electricity?'"" Curry said.

""It's a totally different world now. [Businesses] won't even relocate, they won't expand unless they know they can be guaranteed that power.""

Curry added that it's important for the energy to be green so that companies from foreign countries with stricter regulations can still meet their requirements if they relocate to Kanata or open an office there.

'Population explosion'

In addition to businesses, ordinary Ontarians will increasingly need power, said Karin Hinzer, an electrical engineering professor at the University of Ottawa, in a French-language interview.

There's been a ""population explosion"" across Ontario — including Ottawa — that ""was not planned for 20 years ago,"" Hinzer said.

In a French-language statement to Radio-Canada, the IESO wrote that electricity demand in Ontario is expected to increase significantly and it wants to ""maintain the reliability of the provincial grid at the lowest cost.""

As of May 14, 2025, only 2.2 per cent of Ontario's electricity was being generated by solar power, according to data from the Ontario Energy Board.

But that could change, the IESO said.

""With falling costs and improving capabilities of renewable energy and battery energy storage systems, renewable resources such as solar energy should be competitive in our supplies,"" the agency said.

Solar technology has been improving, agreed both Hinzer and John Kirkwood, president of the Ottawa Renewable Energy Co-operative (OREC).

OREC partnered with the Canada Science and Technology Museum in 2019 to install solar panels on its roof, and this summer installed even more, Kirkwood said.

The newer solar panels are double-sided, he said, so they can generate more electricity than the old ones of the same size.

""We've got close to a megawatt operating on this rooftop,"" he said.

Kirkwood also expects there will be more demand for solar energy in the coming years and said he's ""really optimistic about the direction the [provincial] government is taking.""

""We're looking forward to absolutely more renewable energy. And it's not just because it feels good or it's nice,"" Kirkwood said.

""We believe it's literally cheaper than nuclear, than natural gas, and it's obviously better for the environment. So we think it's a benefit in many respects.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/92ce7ecb-6349-42ab-bcbd-1d38032996f9,1761321086433/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1197%2C673%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-10-26 18:58:16.960965

Formerly of Los Alamos

While visiting with my sister and her husband this week, we enjoyed getting out and exploring the Hill Country of Texas. One of our stops was Wimberley Glassworks.

The company often allows patrons the opportunity to see the glass-blowing process. The “Hot Shop” is where the magical process takes place. Seating for several visitors is arranged for spectators, but there were only about six visitors there the day we were at the shop.

The Hot Shop has earned the designation because it is very warm, not HOT due to the furnace and torches used in the glassblowing process. We watched glassblowers Wes Sweetser and Nick Noble as they made glass vases.

Glassblowing is a fascinating process to watch. Clear glass is melted into a liquid form in the furnace, which is heated to temperatures above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The glassblower collects the liquid glass with a blowpipe, which is a long steel tube that allows the operator to collect the glass and then blows through the pipe to form the basic bubble.

The marver is a large steel surface that allows the glass blower to shape the glass bubble and also creates symmetry. The artists continually reheat the glass and repeat the process. Glassblowers use a variety of tools to continue shaping and fine-tuning the glass into the desired shape.

A torch is also used periodically to heat specific areas of the glass and to create details. The glass must be heated continually to so the artists can make changes and prevent the glass from hardening too quickly. The heating process allows more time for the artists to refine the process.

After the piece is completed, it must be put in an annealer, a specialized kiln that allows the piece to cool slowly and evenly. If not put in the annealer, the glass would cool unevenly and crack.

We watched the glass blowers for over an hour while two vases were created. Glassblowing can be learned in a reasonable timeframe, but it is obvious that refining and perfecting the process takes years. We found that the process was fascinating.

Wimberley Glassworks was started by Tim de Jong. De Jong opened the business in 1992. His first shop was just south of the town of Wimberley, Texas, and has been operating from the current studio on Ranch Road 12 since 2006. In addition to the shop, there is a beautiful gallery of their work for sale.

Another step, Ekiyor says, is to continue engaging and connecting small businesses in the area with the many high-profile sporting and cultural events that take place each year. From creating pop-up shops in the convention center to retail activations in cultural districts, Ekiyor says he wants to see small businesses play a bigger role during these events. “How do our small businesses win?”

Ultimately, Ekiyor wants to see the small business community connected around a larger goal. Now that the city has created an environment that supports the growth of small businesses, he wants to see everyone aligned around the same goal: a thriving small-business community.",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/26/TWIB.png,N,,2025-10-26 18:02:29.509225

This bilateral agreement encompasses $8.5 billion in planned investments designed to accelerate critical mineral development across multiple project phases, building upon Australia's emerging critical minerals strategy.

President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have each pledged $1 billion within six months to unlock this comprehensive pipeline of strategic mineral projects. The framework addresses immediate national security concerns while positioning both countries as leaders in energy transition security away from Chinese-dominated supply chains.

Strategic Investment Breakdown:

Investment Phase Amount Timeline Focus Area Initial Commitment $2 billion combined 6 months Project acceleration Total Pipeline $8.5 billion 2025-2030 Full development Priority Minerals Varies by project Ongoing Rare earths, lithium

The partnership extends beyond simple financial commitments to include coordinated infrastructure development, streamlined regulatory approvals, and guaranteed purchase agreements that reduce investment risks for mining companies.

Why Did Australia and the US Form This Critical Minerals Partnership?

Addressing Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

China's dominance in critical mineral processing creates significant strategic vulnerabilities for Western democracies seeking technological independence. Current Chinese control over various stages of critical mineral refining ranges from 60% to over 90% depending on the specific material, forcing allied nations to develop alternative supply networks.

The partnership directly confronts these dependencies by establishing processing capabilities outside Chinese influence. Both governments now classify critical minerals as national security assets rather than traditional commodities, fundamentally altering how these materials are managed and traded internationally.

Furthermore, the Defence-Critical Minerals Supply Chain initiative recognises the strategic importance of securing reliable access to materials essential for military applications and national defence infrastructure.

Economic and Defense Imperatives

Modern military systems depend heavily on rare earth elements for precision-guided munitions, advanced radar systems, and communications equipment. Similarly, the clean energy transition requires substantial quantities of lithium, cobalt, and other critical materials for battery storage and renewable energy infrastructure.

Critical Applications by Sector:

Defense Systems: Missile guidance, electronic warfare, satellite communications

Clean Energy: Battery storage, wind turbine magnets, solar components

Technology Manufacturing: Semiconductors, advanced electronics, 5G infrastructure

Supply disruptions in any of these areas could severely impact both military readiness and economic competitiveness in emerging technology sectors, making supply chain diversification a strategic imperative.

How Will the Deal Impact Australia's Mining Sector?

Accelerating Development Timelines

Traditional mining projects face extraordinarily long development periods that often discourage investment and delay market entry. Andrew Napier from Multicom Resources notes that projects typically require 13 to 17 years from inception to commercial operations, while copper mining projects average over 22 years globally according to University of Queensland research.

The US partnership aims to compress these timelines through guaranteed financing, streamlined approvals, and coordinated infrastructure development. Early-stage financing represents the biggest hurdle for junior mining companies, and access to government-backed funding significantly reduces investment risks.

In addition, the framework supports Australian minerals investment initiatives that could accelerate project development across multiple commodity sectors.

Regional Development in North West Queensland

North West Queensland contains approximately 75% of the state's base metal capabilities and nearly 30% of global vanadium deposits across a 380,000-square-kilometer region. Despite this mineral wealth, the area currently hosts 14 critical mineral projects with none yet achieving commercial production.

Queensland's Strategic Assets:

Mineral Type Regional Significance Project Status Commercial Timeline Vanadium 30% of world deposits 5 active projects 3+ years to export Base Metals 75% of state capability 14 total projects Development phase Rare Earths Emerging deposits Early exploration Assessment stage

The Saint Elmo vanadium project near Julia Creek exemplifies these challenges, requiring over a decade of development with three additional years before commercial export despite being closest to operational status.

Financial and Logistical Challenges

Mining executives emphasise that geographic remoteness creates substantial logistical challenges for North West Queensland projects. Transportation distances to customers and export facilities significantly impact project economics, particularly for lower-value bulk materials.

Scott Winter from Critical Minerals Group explains that initial investment support is critical for getting projects operational, particularly given the urgency of establishing supply chains before other countries fill market demand. The partnership's guaranteed offtake agreements from US customers or government stockpiling programs could provide the revenue certainty needed for project financing.

Which Australian Projects Are Prioritised Under the Agreement?

Initial Priority Selections

The framework has identified two strategically significant projects for immediate development support, though notably none are located in North West Queensland despite the region's exceptional mineral wealth.

Western Australia Focus:

Alcoa-Sojitz Joint Venture: Large-scale alumina refining with integrated rare earth extraction capabilities

Advanced Processing: Sophisticated separation and purification facilities for defence-grade materials

Northern Territory Development:

Arafura's Nolans Project: Comprehensive rare earth mining and processing operation

Strategic Positioning: Central Australian location for both domestic supply and export markets

Queensland's Future Opportunities

While North West Queensland has not received direct initial funding allocation, industry experts anticipate significant future investment given the region's mineral endowments. The area's vanadium deposits alone represent nearly one-third of global reserves, while base metal capabilities span multiple strategic materials.

Regional Project Pipeline:

Saint Elmo Vanadium Project: Closest to commercial operation, targeting steel alloy and battery storage markets

Lindfield Project: Includes proposed manufacturing capability for vanadium electrolyte production

Multiple Exploration Projects: Early-stage development across rare earth and base metal deposits

The prioritisation of Western Australia and Northern Territory projects suggests the partnership initially favours operations closer to commercial viability and existing infrastructure networks.

What Challenges Must the Partnership Overcome?

Infrastructure and Processing Gaps

Australia currently lacks commercial-scale processing capabilities for many critical minerals, requiring sophisticated separation and purification technologies. Building domestic processing capacity represents both a technical and financial challenge requiring specialised expertise and equipment investment.

Rick Valenta from the University of Queensland's Sustainable Minerals Institute identifies supply chain development as one of the biggest challenges, noting that even established industries like copper mining face extended development timelines and infrastructure requirements.

Processing Infrastructure Requirements:

Rare Earth Separation: Complex chemical processes requiring specialised facilities and skilled technicians

Quality Standards: Meeting specifications for defence and advanced technology applications

Environmental Compliance: Managing processing waste streams and environmental impact mitigation

Workforce Development: Training programmes for advanced processing operations and equipment maintenance

Geographic and Logistical Constraints

The scale of North West Queensland's mineral region, spanning nearly 400,000 square kilometers, creates substantial logistical challenges for resource extraction and transportation. Moving materials from remote mining sites to processing facilities and export terminals requires significant infrastructure investment.

Transportation costs can substantially impact project economics, particularly when competing against lower-cost producing countries with established supply chains. The partnership must address these fundamental infrastructure gaps to ensure long-term commercial viability.

Timeline and Market Pressures

Scott Winter emphasises the urgency of project development, noting that delays in establishing Australian supply chains could allow other countries to capture market share and establish competing networks. This creates pressure to accelerate traditional development timelines while maintaining safety and environmental standards.

The partnership faces the challenge of balancing rapid deployment with thorough project evaluation and risk management, particularly given the substantial financial commitments involved.

How Does This Compare to Global Critical Minerals Strategies?

Scale and Integration Differences

China's approach involves massive state-directed investment across entire supply chains, from equity stakes in global mining operations to domestic processing and manufacturing capabilities. Chinese companies have secured long-term supply agreements and vertical integration that creates comprehensive control over material flows.

The critical minerals deal between United States and Australia represents a more targeted approach focusing on specific strategic materials and key processing capabilities. Rather than attempting to replicate China's comprehensive integration, the alliance prioritises alternative supply chains for the most critical defence and technology applications.

However, Trump's Critical Minerals Order demonstrates the US commitment to establishing domestic capabilities and reducing foreign dependencies across multiple mineral categories.

Competitive Positioning

Chris Vernon from CSIRO notes that the critical minerals industry now operates in direct competition with China's established dominance across multiple materials and processing stages. This competitive dynamic requires Western alternatives to demonstrate both technical capability and economic viability.

Strategic Comparison Factors:

Chinese Advantages: Established infrastructure, integrated supply chains, cost efficiencies, global market presence

Western Strengths: Technological innovation, quality control standards, political stability, allied nation coordination

Market Dynamics: Growing demand from democratic nations seeking supply diversification and strategic independence

The partnership's success will depend on its ability to create economically competitive alternatives while maintaining higher environmental and labour standards than typical Chinese operations.

What Are the Long-Term Implications for Global Supply Chains?

Reshaping International Trade Patterns

The partnership signals a fundamental shift toward friend-shoring in critical materials, where allied nations prioritise trade relationships based on shared values and strategic interests rather than purely economic considerations. This approach may result in higher short-term costs but provides greater supply security and reduces geopolitical vulnerabilities.

According to analysis by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, ""The agreement represents a significant step toward establishing alternative supply chains that reduce reliance on potentially hostile nations while maintaining competitive market dynamics.""

Other democratic nations are likely to develop similar partnerships, creating alternative supply networks that bypass Chinese-controlled infrastructure. This could lead to a bifurcation of global critical mineral markets along geopolitical lines.

Technology and Innovation Acceleration

Guaranteed demand from US government stockpiling and defence contracts provides mining companies with revenue certainty that enables greater research and development investment. This could accelerate innovations in extraction techniques, processing efficiency, and recycling technologies.

Innovation Opportunity Areas:

Advanced Extraction: Environmentally sustainable mining techniques with reduced land disturbance

Processing Automation: Reducing labour costs while improving consistency and quality control

Recycling Technologies: Recovering critical materials from electronic waste and end-of-life products

Material Substitution: Developing alternatives for the most scarce or geopolitically sensitive materials

The partnership's emphasis on domestic processing capabilities could drive technological advancement in separation and purification processes, potentially creating exportable expertise and equipment.

Market Structure Evolution

The agreement represents a shift from purely market-based resource allocation toward strategic resource management involving government coordination and guaranteed demand. This hybrid approach combines private sector efficiency with public sector strategic planning.

Future critical mineral markets may increasingly feature long-term bilateral agreements between allied nations rather than spot market trading, fundamentally altering price discovery mechanisms and investment decision-making processes.

Addressing Implementation Challenges

Regulatory Streamlining

The partnership must balance accelerated project approvals with maintaining environmental and safety standards. Streamlined regulatory processes could significantly reduce development timelines, but require coordination between multiple government agencies and jurisdictions.

Both countries have committed to maintaining high environmental standards while reducing bureaucratic delays. Advanced monitoring technologies and risk assessment frameworks may enable faster approvals without compromising oversight quality.

Private Investment Coordination

Government commitments are designed to de-risk private investment through guaranteed offtake agreements and infrastructure support. The majority of actual mining and processing operations will require private capital, making public-private coordination essential for success.

Venture capital and institutional investors are increasingly interested in critical minerals projects given government support and long-term demand visibility. The partnership's structure could serve as a model for similar resource development initiatives in other strategic sectors.

Future Market Dynamics

Demand Growth Projections

Global critical mineral demand continues expanding rapidly driven by electric vehicle adoption, renewable energy deployment, and advanced technology manufacturing. The Australian Government's framework agreement acknowledges ""substantial increases in lithium, cobalt, and rare earth element demand over the next decade.""

The critical minerals deal between United States and Australia positions both nations to capture value from this demand growth while reducing dependence on potentially unreliable suppliers. Strategic stockpiling capabilities also provide buffer capacity during market disruptions.

Technology Evolution Impact

Advances in battery chemistry, renewable energy systems, and defence technologies continue evolving critical mineral requirements. The partnership's flexibility to adapt to changing material demands will determine its long-term strategic value.

Research and development investments supported by the framework could accelerate breakthrough technologies that reduce critical mineral requirements or enable more efficient utilisation of available resources.

Furthermore, the deal demonstrates how allied nations are responding to supply chain vulnerabilities through coordinated investment and strategic planning, setting a precedent for future resource security initiatives.

The critical minerals deal between United States and Australia represents a comprehensive response to supply chain vulnerabilities that have emerged as major national security concerns. While initial project prioritisation may not immediately benefit all mineral-rich regions, the framework establishes mechanisms for expanded investment based on strategic priorities and commercial viability.

Success will ultimately depend on the partnership's ability to compress traditional development timelines while maintaining quality and environmental standards, creating economically competitive alternatives to existing supply chains, and adapting to evolving technology requirements across defence and clean energy applications.

She believes free-market forces are increasingly backing the case for clean energy.
“You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs.
For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: Engage people where they are, identify shared priorities and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits.","Heather Reams, the president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), stepped onto the stage at Breckenridge’s Mountain Towns 2030 summit — a room full of progressives accustomed to negotiating with Republicans on climate policy. She faced an audience from Idaho, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado — areas that often depend on Republican-controlled legislatures to achieve local sustainability goals.

Reams suggested that the instinct of these communities shouldn’t be to lecture or shame. It should be to listen and find common ground. “Democrats can’t do it alone,” she said. “Republicans care deeply about their land. They hunt, they fish, they ski. They love the outdoors as much as anyone. So, of course, they care about clean air and water. The question is: How do we talk about it?”

A lifelong Republican, Reams has made it her mission to answer that question. CRES collaborates with GOP lawmakers to promote clean energy, arguing that the conservative case for renewables is grounded in innovation, competitiveness and energy independence — not ideology.

At the conference, she stressed that the key to climate progress isn’t confrontation, but compromise. One side might favor solar projects while the other insists on traditional fuel sources. By recognizing shared interests — for example, expanding solar energy while permitting additional natural gas pipelines or transmission lines — both sides can advance without ideological conflict. It’s not about surrender; it’s practical problem-solving.

Reams highlighted Sen. John Curtis of Utah, founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus, as a conservative champion of the environment. He has argued that the GOP should help shape, not resist, climate policy, emphasizing that sound stewardship and strong markets go hand in hand. Not all conservatives are on board. Reams wryly notes Utah’s other senator, Mike Lee, who, as she puts it, “just pats me on the head” when renewables come up.

Polls suggest that finding common ground reflects more than strategy — it meets voter demand. Pew Research Center data from 2024 show that 72% of Americans — including 56% of Republicans under 40 years old — support expanding solar and wind energy. A Yale Climate Communications poll reinforces this enthusiasm, showing that clean energy incentives can generate local jobs and economic growth.

Beyond politics, Reams emphasized the economic benefits of renewables. Solar, wind, battery storage, advanced nuclear and geothermal are increasingly cost-competitive. Emerging energy industries can create high-paying local jobs, keeping residents in their hometowns rather than forcing talent to cities. She believes free-market forces are increasingly backing the case for clean energy.

That resonates with Republican leaders, who tend to prioritize economic and local issues and often find that sustained dialogue is more effective than public confrontation. “Renewables are winning on price,” Reams said. “You don’t have to love climate policy to love cheaper energy and American jobs. We can win this on free-market principles.”

Geography and lifestyle naturally align. Western Republicans often share goals with progressives for preserving air, water and open space — and honoring the outdoorsy lifestyle. Coastal communities have similar motivations, whether it’s a clean Chesapeake Bay or a healthy Tampa Bay. For Americans who hunt, ski or hike, the outdoors can be a shared starting point — even across party lines.

For communities pursuing ambitious climate goals, the lesson is clear: Engage people where they are, identify shared priorities and focus on solutions that deliver economic and lifestyle benefits. Extreme views will always exist, but the broad middle can drive policy forward. Pragmatic collaboration, not ideological purity, is the path to progress.

By turning shared values into practical policies — whether through permitting reform or renewable energy initiatives — communities can make net-zero goals achievable. The enemy isn’t political disagreement; it’s obstinacy. When both sides operate from common interests, compromise becomes not just possible but also the most effective way forward.

A $1.6 billion loan from the federal government will modernize 5,000 miles of transmission lines and, in conjunction with stronger wires, potentially change how Midwest electricity is delivered, reduce costs, reduce outages, and advance renewable energy. But can the grid live up to the promise?

How the backbone of the Midwest electricity is strengthened by the Ambitious Power Overhaul (APO)

American Electric Transmission has received a loan guarantee of $1.6 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy to replace transmission lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, with a capacity to meet greater energy demand.

For many years, sections of the Midwest electricity grid have been defended on infrastructure constructed during the mid-20th century. Although formerly strong, these older lines are now under pressure from growing electrical demand and increasingly severe weather.

AEP’s effort to modernize supports improved reliability, keeps customers from experiencing weather-induced power interruptions, and sets the conditions for the power grid to serve today’s demand and needs into the future. This isn’t just engineering; it is a fundamental investment in the region’s economic and technological future.

Powering the future while meeting the Midwest’s surging energy demand

Due to the current rise in electricity use in the Midwest, electricity dependency on data centers and artificial intelligence has increased recently. People use data centers for many purposes, especially for professional needs. A power interruption is always a problem due to its reliance on power. The $1.6 billion investment eliminates the concern of power interruptions.

That being said, we should mention that high-tech sectors are not the only ones to benefit from this upgrade. Residents and commercial road users will enjoy the grid as well because they’ll experience power outages less often, preventing certain situations, just like this groundbreaking innovation, powering America’s grid. Overall, this upgrade is intended to provide secure electricity throughout the Midwest.

How the Midwest electricity project brings jobs, savings, and benefits to communities

A brief look at the impact this Midwest electricity project has on the community, it would bring several local economic benefits; one being: It will create approximately 1,100 construction jobs that will add income and provide further opportunities to the local communities. The modernization of the transmission lines has guaranteed an opportunity for customers to save a gross of $275 million in financial costs over the full term of the loan.

For the Midwest communities, these jobs and savings serve as tangible evidence that investments in infrastructure are a vital catalyst for growth. The project provides committed power while developing an opportunity to save costs. The $1.6 billion upgrade is a technical upgrade and economic lifeline for the Campbell County region.

Diving into a controversial choice that puts fossil fuels at the core

Although the Midwest electricity project has made massive improvements, mostly needed in this region, it is still reliant on fossil fuel electricity that must be transmitted through upgraded lines. This, of course, has sparked major controversies among several factions in the province, with critics clamouring for the need to add more clean power establishments, saying it will be more aligned with long-term sustainability goals.

On the other hand, supporters have based their allegiance on the need for a reliable, high-capacity grid. They believe that powering Midwest homes sustainably requires a transition to fossil fuels. This implies the dilemma faced before implementation can take effect.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1001411193.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 17:17:59.694797

The move is coming months after a federal court order restored $76.5 million in frozen federal funding.
Groff said the federal funding cancellation caused about a seven- to eight-month delay.
“Implementation of ADOT’s plan will ensure EV charging is available on interstates and alternative fuel corridors,” Brown said.
Utilities like Tucson Electric Power and Arizona Public Service determine whether electrical capacity exists to support charging infrastructure at specific locations, Groff said.","Arizona’s plan to build more than 70 electric vehicle charging stations along state highways is moving forward after months of delay, with the first stations expected to be operational in 2026.

The move is coming months after a federal court order restored $76.5 million in frozen federal funding.

The Arizona Department of Transportation submitted an updated expansion plan to federal authorities in September after completing a public input period that closed Sept. 8. The agency had finalized contracts for 18 stations in August 2024, but was forced to put the project on hold when federal funding was suspended in February.

The agency expects to launch a second solicitation this fall for 34 additional stations along state highways, said Garin Groff, an ADOT spokesman.

ADOT’s current plan, now under federal review, proposes a third phase adding approximately 21 stations on nine new corridor segments, including Arizona 77 from Tucson north to the Pima County line.

The Federal Highway Administration has not specified a timeline for completing its review. If federal approval comes through and Phase 2 solicitation proceeds this fall as planned, the full network could be operational by 2028, establishing reliable fast-charging access along Arizona’s major travel corridors for the first time.

Groff said the federal funding cancellation caused about a seven- to eight-month delay.

Arizona was among 17 states and jurisdictions that challenged the freeze in federal court, arguing the administration lacked authority to withhold funds already appropriated by Congress. U.S. District Judge Tana Lin agreed in June, ruling that the funding suspension exceeded executive authority. The court restored funding to 14 states, including Arizona.

With funding restored, ADOT is moving ahead with a three-phase buildout designed to close gaps in charging access along major interstate and state highway corridors. The network aims to address range anxiety that has limited EV adoption in Arizona, where major cities can be separated by 100 miles or more of highway.

Reliable highway charging infrastructure is critical for addressing those barriers, said Diane Brown, executive director of the Arizona Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. The nonprofit advocates for consumer protection issues.

“Implementation of ADOT’s plan will ensure EV charging is available on interstates and alternative fuel corridors,” Brown said. “The plan calls for EV charging to be available on highways every 50 miles, which enables EV drivers to know they won’t get stranded.”

The first phase covers 18 interstate locations to be constructed by Tesla, Francis Energy, Love’s Travel Stops, Pilot, Red E Charge and EV Gateway. Construction on those stations is expected to begin this year, with the locations operational by 2026, according to ADOT.

For Tucson drivers, the nearest new station will be Tesla’s seven-port facility at Rudy’s Country Store and Bar-B-Q, 2130 E. Ajo Way, off Interstate 10.

The charging network will serve drivers across Arizona’s diverse regions. Phase 1 stations are planned along Interstate 10, stretching from the California border near Yuma through Phoenix and Tucson to New Mexico, as well as along Interstate 8 connecting Yuma to Casa Grande.

Northern Arizona will see coverage along Interstate 40, spanning from Kingman through Flagstaff to Holbrook; and Interstate 17 connecting Phoenix to the Verde Valley and Flagstaff.

The year’s proposed plan adds Arizona 77 from Show Low to Holbrook in eastern Arizona, according to ADOT planning maps.

Under federal program requirements, stations will be privately owned and operated, with developers contributing 20% of project costs and handling long-term maintenance. Each location must offer at least four high-speed chargers capable of 150-kilowatt charging, available around the clock.

ADOT will oversee the stations for five years after opening, monitoring performance through data collection and reporting. After that period, private developers assume full responsibility for operations, which include technical support, electrical and IT services, routine maintenance, software updates and cybersecurity.

Utilities like Tucson Electric Power and Arizona Public Service determine whether electrical capacity exists to support charging infrastructure at specific locations, Groff said. While ADOT does not track job creation for the privately built stations, developers will need construction, installation, technical, electrical and IT workers throughout the buildout and ongoing operations.

The charging network’s expansion comes amid shifting federal policy. Federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles expired Sept. 30, but Brown said projections for EV adoption in Arizona remain strong as vehicle prices drop and charging infrastructure expands.

Beyond infrastructure, continued EV adoption will require emphasizing the financial and health benefits of electric vehicles, Brown added.

“The facts on consumer savings when driving an EV versus an internal combustion engine along with the air quality in public health benefits, will need to be front and center,” she said, adding that these factors will help drive adoption, “at a rate that will help our economy as well as our air quality and public health.”

“Arizona is known for a cradle-to-grave EV sector,” Brown said, noting the charging stations complement clean energy work already underway in local governments across the state.""

Opposition leader Sussan Ley wrote to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday to raise ""serious concerns"" about elements of Labor's rewrite of Australia's environmental laws.

She suggested that the bill be carved into two so the first part, focused exclusively on ""practical measures to streamline approvals"", could sail through parliament when it is introduced this week.

Under her proposal, the more contentious environmental changes would be dealt with later.

""While the streamlining reforms still require detailed amendment to ensure they function effectively, separating them from the broader, more contentious environmental elements of the legislation would allow parliament to make immediate progress on areas that can genuinely help unlock investment and growth,"" the letter read.

Environment Minister Murray Watt rejected the proposition, declaring that splitting the bill in this way ""would weaken environmental protections and it would remove the certainty that business is looking for"".

""It would mean more habitat destruction, more species threatened, no independent regulator and slower approval times,"" he said.

There had initially been optimism in talks between the government and Coalition that an agreement to finally reform the laws could be reached, but that soured after details of the bill emerged last week.

Labor open to working with Coalition or Greens

Mr Watt is open to dealing with either the Coalition or the Greens to successfully rework the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act), almost five years after a review found the laws were not fit for purpose.

The government has said the changes will deliver stronger environmental protection but also quicker approvals for all kinds of projects, including housing and mines.

The legislation will also include the establishment of a National Environmental Protection Agency, with the environment minister retaining the final say on approving or rejecting major projects.

Until now, the minister personally considers only a small number of significant applications — such as Woodside's North West Shelf extension — with departmental officials signing off on more than 90 per cent of decisions.

The new regime will operate in a similar fashion; however, officials in the new agency will deal with the bulk of approvals instead of the department.

On Sunday, Mr Watt urged both parties to come to the negotiating table as he vowed that this iteration of the laws would finally pass parliament after two earlier attempts failed.

Parts of the draft laws have been shared with environmental and business groups, but both the Coalition and the Greens are yet to see the bill in full.

Last week, the minister confirmed that a so-called ""climate trigger"" that could be used to block coal and gas projects — which had been one of the Greens' key demands — would not feature in the proposed legislation.

But on Sunday, Greens environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young indicated that the absence of a trigger was not a red line for the minor party, telling reporters that she was open to negotiations.

""I will work and talk with the government about how to make sure climate is protected,"" she said.

""If we're going to negotiate, the government is going to have to come up with what they are prepared to do to protect the climate and to protect our forest.""

If the Coalition rejects the legislation, it could become a key test of how the Greens will act in this term of parliament, after Labor accused the minor party of acting as blockers in the Senate.

Mr Watt said there does not have to be a choice between productivity and the environment.

""We can improve both, and that is what our bill is designed to do,"" he said.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/66b14998d84a9c1e89ccb1ba6824d250?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=4954&cropW=8808&xPos=0&yPos=459&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-10-26 15:58:13.765270

Solid-state batteries, made of a cathode, an anode, and a solid electrolyte, have been promoted as offering higher output, longer driving range, quicker charging times, and extended battery life.
Solid-state batteries are also touted as being smaller and therefore lighter than liquid-based batteries, with a greatly reduced risk of EV fires, which is a hard battle firefighters face.
Idemitsu is building a factory capable of producing 1,000 metric tons of lithium sulfide, an essential solid-state battery component, each year.

What else should you know about Toyota's solid-state batteries for EVs?

This joint effort by Toyota and Sumitomo is more than just a technology development. It is an attempt by Japanese manufacturers to get back some of the EV momentum that has been lost to China. China is now the world's leading manufacturer of electric vehicles and has announced its plans to produce semi-solid-state batteries, which use less liquid electrolyte but are not pure solid-state batteries. South Korea has also built up a lead over Japan in the race to produce EVs that are accepted by the world market.

Toyota and the other Japanese manufacturers now realize that the home country must build a supply chain that can provide solid-state batteries for the next generation of EVs, whether they will be produced in Japan or in other Japanese-owned factories around the world. The total amount of Japanese investment in this domestic supply chain, by Toyota and other companies, is $7 billion.

Toyota has also announced an alliance with Idemitsu, a large Japanese oil company. Idemitsu is building a factory capable of producing 1,000 metric tons of lithium sulfide, an essential solid-state battery component, each year. Interestingly, the Idemitsu lithium sulfide plant also plans to manufacture solid-state batteries in 2027. While these developments are promising by themselves, there are still many obstacles to be overcome as manufacturers rush to embrace solid-state batteries for their EVs, including the complexities of making them, expensive production costs, and where the solid-state battery materials will come from.

In its latest report, SolarPower Europe’s Global Markets Workstream provided an extensive overview of solar investment opportunities in five priority countries in Latin America, namely Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.

The report explores several substantial investment prospects in Latin America through a comprehensive analysis of the countries’ market dynamics and regulatory frameworks, while also providing recommendations to accelerate solar deployment in the Latin American countries.

“With established markets and a robust pipeline, Latin America stands out in the global solar landscape. Our report equips investors with the intelligence, trends, and data to navigate one of the world’s most promising renewable energy regions.” – Máté Heisz, Chief Operating Officer at SolarPower Europe

The Latin American energy sector’s transition to renewable energy is close to reaching its goal

As the world aims to decarbonize the energy sector, solar power has emerged as the most pragmatic solution to the global energy needs. Latin America is committed to its renewable energy capacity expansion.

The region aims to have at least 70% of its electricity generated from renewable energy by the end of the decade, which would align perfectly with the 2019 Renewable Energy for Latin America and the Caribbean (RELAC) Initiative. As the solar sector gains momentum around the world as the go-to renewable energy resource, Latin American nations are aiming not to be left behind.

“Investment is the key to transforming Latin America’s solar promise into progress. By unlocking capital through blended finance, risk-mitigation tools, and clearer market structures, we can scale solar where it’s needed most. A better and prosperous future for countries across Latin America is not just possible with solar – it’s powered by it.” – Sonia Dunlop, CEO of the Global Solar Council

The solar power sector has seen substantial and consistent growth over the past few years, and SolarPower Europe’s leadership could not be happier.

“Latin America’s strong solar resources can be an engine for regional growth. This report focuses on several major solar markets in the region, providing clear guidelines to investors alongside concrete recommendations for policymakers looking to tap into Latin America’s potential.” – Katherine Poseidon, Head of Strategy, Analytics & Process, Europe, Africa & International, Voltalia, and Chair of SolarPower Europe’s Global Markets Workstream

Hassan Dawudi on the Tesla Model Y Owners Facebook page says,

""I just sold my 2026 model Y to a dealer in Houston for what I paid for it in July (tax liability credit made it possible). If this car isn't for you, you may consider this. No trade or anything. I wrote them a check, and they wrote me a check for the same amount 3 months later.""

""Tesla makes other cars feel dumb, but I needed a more utilitarian/rugged vehicle. It didn't have the utility I needed. I’m keeping my Toyota 4Runner for when it matters; it's more my style.""

High-Tech vs. High-Utility: Why One Owner Sold His Tesla Model Y Preferring His 4Runner and Walked Away Clean

The appeal of a Tesla is undeniable. Their vehicles offer blistering performance, industry-leading charging infrastructure, and a connected user experience that leaves rival brands feeling decades behind. Yet a recent social media post from a Model Y owner reveals a critical difference between a groundbreaking electric crossover and everyday utility needs.

I'll break down this owner's experience: Tesla's unique market position and the persistent need for traditional, rugged capability.

Zero-Sum Depreciation

The first part of Hassan Dawudi's story is exceptional and offers a savvy financial decision. He reported selling his ""2026 Model Y"" for exactly what he paid just three months prior, attributing the feasibility to the federal tax liability credit.

The Model Y is not magically depreciation-proof.

This zero-sum loss is a direct result of understanding the impact of federal tax credits on short-term vehicle valuations. If a buyer is eligible for a $7,500 point-of-sale credit (as many new EV buyers are) and they transfer that credit to the dealer, their effective purchase price is immediately reduced.

If demand for the car remains strong—especially ahead of anticipated incentive changes—the owner can trade it in at the full sticker price, thereby using the credit to fully offset the immediate depreciation hit. It shows that it's possible to time your sale with eligibility changes, and it can be highly lucrative.

When 'Dumb' is Smart

The second part of Hassan's quote is far more critical for the average buyer. While he acknowledged that ""Tesla makes other cars feel dumb,"" he concluded: ""I needed a more utilitarian/rugged vehicle. It didn't have the utility I needed. I drove my 4Runner when it mattered; it's more my style.""

This highlights the difference between crossover SUVs and true rugged utility vehicles. The Model Y is a crossover built on a unibody chassis—designed for on-road handling, efficiency, and speed. The Toyota 4Runner is body-on-frame; it's heavy and gas-thirsty, but it offers qualities like ground clearance, suspension travel, and a four-wheel-drive system designed for off-road performance.

Hassan quickly learned why the Tesla Model Y doesn't satisfy actual off-road and towing requirements.

The Model Y's battery sits low in the chassis, optimizing handling but sacrificing ground clearance. Its smooth, aerodynamic lines and sophisticated electronics are useless when navigating a muddy access road or hauling a heavy trailer off-pavement. When the job requires getting dirty, the body-on-frame architecture of the 4Runner is superior in every measure of ruggedness.

Recommendations for Utility Seekers

If you're reading this and your primary use case involves heavy towing, frequent off-road use, or encountering severe weather, the Model Y and most current electric crossovers are not the right tools for the job.

Key Takeaways:

If You Must Go EV: Look at vehicles specifically built with utility in mind. I'm talking about the dedicated future electric truck alternatives for rugged utility seekers like the Rivian R1T or the Tesla Cybertruck. These are built on different, more robust platforms designed to handle payload and punishment, not just 0-60mph times.

The Hybrid Bridge: If you need that daily ruggedness now and cannot accept the current price or wait for a true EV utility vehicle, stick to proven hybrids like the Toyota Tundra Hybrid or the new Tacoma Hybrid, which offer excellent torque and maintain that necessary body-on-frame strength.

Know the Mission: The Model Y excels at efficiency, tech integration, and being a superb commuter. But when you need capability, you need capability. Don't confuse advanced technology with utility.

What the Community is Saying

The sentiment is clear that the Model Y is an incredible piece of technology, but it's not a replacement for specialized tools. However, Hassan took some hard hits.

Steve Clabaugh - Nice! Now you get to join the world of waiting at Jiffy Lube, gas stations, and dealerships for vehicle maintenance.

Mike Miller - Why would you spend $50k on the wrong car or assume a Tesla would be rugged or for anything other than pavement?

GrayShark Dave - Why? You want an outdated, slow, non-intelligent ICE car? Why not a horse and buggy? At least the horse thinks.

The Market Perspective

As I've reported before, the Model Y is a revolution in personal transportation, as seen in stories like the owner who traded a Scat Pack for a Model Y and was ""in awe"" of the performance (""Tesla Model Y Owner Says, 'It Feels Good to Finally Get My First EV...'""). However, the market is maturing, and consumers are beginning to consider specialized needs.

We are seeing a clear delineation in the EV landscape, a trend I cover constantly in my reporting. While cars like the Model Y are fantastic for improving daily life, as one owner noted after adding ceramic tint—""I Put On A Full Ceramic Tint On My Tesla Model Y...""), they are useful for cargo capacity and efficiency, not rugged durability.

The takeaway? The resale success Hassan achieved was an anomaly dependent on tax timing. However, you should buy the vehicle that matches your needs, not the latest technology hits.

A Question For You

Hassan Dawudi ultimately decided the Tesla Model Y didn't have the utility he needed, preferring his 4Runner for rugged use. For Model Y owners, how have you managed the vehicle's utility and off-road/towing limitations, or has it ever led you to consider a different vehicle for specific needs?

Officials from the state transport department said the rates will vary based on the vehicle type -- Rs 80 for small passenger vehicles, Rs 250 for small goods carriers, Rs 140 for buses, and Rs 120-Rs700 for trucks, depending on load capacity. The initiative aims to curb vehicular pollution, protect the fragile Himalayan ecosystem and promote cleanliness across the state. State additional transport commissioner Sanat Kumar Singh told mediapersons on Saturday that the system will rely on Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras installed at border checkpoints to record registration numbers of incoming vehicles. Sixteen ANPR cameras have been installed so far at the state's entry points, and the number is being increased to 37. To streamline the process, the transport department has engaged a private vendor to manage tax collection. Data captured by the cameras will be automatically sent to the vendor's software, which will filter out vehicles registered in Uttarakhand, govt vehicles, electric and CNG vehicles, ambulances, fire brigade trucks and two-wheelers. The filtered information will then be transmitted to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) database. Once verified, the applicable amount will be deducted automatically from the vehicle owner's payment wallet and credited to the transport department's account. Vehicles re-entering the state within 24 hours will not be charged again. Officials said the move is part of govt's broader strategy to encourage environmentally responsible travel in Uttarakhand, where increasing tourist and commercial traffic has worsened pollution in recent years. The green tax is also expected to create a dedicated revenue stream for environmental protection and sustainable transport infrastructure in the hill state.

It's using that money to pay for its lucrative distribution and expand its operations.

The MLP is pursuing several additional expansion projects to further enhance its growth prospects.

10 stocks we like better than Energy Transfer ›

Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) is one of the largest energy midstream companies in the country. It has a nearly nationwide footprint of 144,000 miles of pipelines, extensive storage and export terminal capacity, and other energy infrastructure assets that support the flow of oil, natural gas, and other energy products from wells to end users.

Building on its established presence, the Dallas, Texas-based company is investing heavily to expand its footprint and deliver healthy earnings growth. That could give it the fuel to produce high-octane total returns for energy investors in the coming years.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

Built on a strong foundation

Energy Transfer's extensive midstream operations generate stable cash flow. Fee-based revenue frameworks, such as long-term, fixed-rate contracts and government-regulated rate structures, provide about 90% of its earnings.

During the first half of 2025, the master limited partnership (MLP) produced nearly $4.3 billion in distributable cash flow. It distributed almost $2.3 billion to investors and retained the rest. That comfortable payout ratio puts the MLP's 7.8%-yielding distribution on a very solid foundation.

Energy Transfer also has a strong balance sheet. Its leverage ratio is currently in the lower half of its 4.0-4.5 times target range. That puts it in the strongest financial position in its history, further supporting its high-yielding payout.

Texas-sized growth through the end of the decade

Energy Transfer's stable cash flow and bond-like income stream are only part of its story. The midstream giant has a lot of growth on the horizon. It's investing $5 billion into growth capital projects this year, which will fuel accelerating earnings growth as they come online over the next year. Most of those projects will expand its extensive infrastructure in its home state.

For example, one notable expansion project is the Hugh Brinson Pipeline. The 400-mile gas pipeline will extend from Waha in the western part of the state to Maypearl, Texas, just south of Dallas. Phase I of the $2.7 billion project should come online at the end of 2026, followed by Phase II in early 2027.

Energy Transfer is also expanding its natural gas liquids (NGL) capacity at its terminal in Nederland, TX, building another NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, TX, constructing two more gas processing plants in the Permian Basin, and building out eight gas-fired power plants to support its operations in Texas. Those projects should enter commercial service through 2026.

Meanwhile, the company's largest project is the recently approved Desert Southwest Pipeline project. The $5.3 billion, 516-mile pipeline will move gas from Waha to Phoenix, Arizona, when it comes online at the end of 2029. This project gives Energy Transfer visible earnings growth through the end of the decade.

More growth coming down the pipeline

The midstream giant is pursuing several additional expansion projects. The biggest is the long-delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The company has been working to secure the customers needed to support the project and partners to help fund its construction. The MLP is hoping to finally make a positive final investment decision (FID) on Lake Charles LNG early next year.

Meanwhile, the company is pursuing several projects to supply natural gas to AI data centers. Earlier this year, it signed a deal to provide gas to CloudBurst's Next-Gen Data Center campus near San Marcos, TX, which could be operational next year, assuming CloudBurst makes an FID this year. The company recently signed a deal to supply Fermi America with gas for its HyperGrid project in Amarillo, TX. At 18 million square feet spread across 5,200 acres, HyperGrid is one of the largest planned data centers in the country. Those are just two of the roughly 200 data centers it could supply gas to in the future. The company is also pursuing opportunities to supply gas to more than 60 power plants, many of which are also aiming to support the AI data center power boom.

Securing these and other potential projects would give Energy Transfer more fuel to grow its earnings and distribution in the future. The MLP conservatively plans to increase its payout by 3% to 5% annually over the coming years, allowing it to grow its distribution to investors while retaining more cash to fund its robust expansion opportunity set.

High-octane total return potential

Energy Transfer generates stable and steadily rising cash flows to support its high-yielding distribution. That payout provides a nice base return, which should steadily increase in the future. Additionally, the MLP's large and growing backlog of expansion projects should fuel meaningful earnings growth in the coming years, significantly boosting its total return potential. That high return potential makes Energy Transfer a strong buy for energy investors who are comfortable receiving the Schedule K-1 Federal Tax Form the MLP sends each year.

The $5.3 billion, 516-mile pipeline will move gas from Waha to Phoenix, Arizona, when it comes online at the end of 2029. This project gives Energy Transfer visible earnings growth through the end of the decade.

More growth coming down the pipeline

The midstream giant is pursuing several additional expansion projects. The biggest is the long-delayed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Lake Charles, Louisiana. The company has been working to secure the customers needed to support the project and partners to help fund its construction. The MLP is hoping to finally make a positive final investment decision (FID) on Lake Charles LNG early next year.

Meanwhile, the company is pursuing several projects to supply natural gas to AI data centers. Earlier this year, it signed a deal to provide gas to CloudBurst's Next-Gen Data Center campus near San Marcos, TX, which could be operational next year, assuming CloudBurst makes an FID this year. The company recently signed a deal to supply Fermi America with gas for its HyperGrid project in Amarillo, TX. At 18 million square feet spread across 5,200 acres, HyperGrid is one of the largest planned data centers in the country. Those are just two of the roughly 200 data centers it could supply gas to in the future. The company is also pursuing opportunities to supply gas to more than 60 power plants, many of which are also aiming to support the AI data center power boom.

Securing these and other potential projects would give Energy Transfer more fuel to grow its earnings and distribution in the future. The MLP conservatively plans to increase its payout by 3% to 5% annually over the coming years, allowing it to grow its distribution to investors while retaining more cash to fund its robust expansion opportunity set.

High-octane total return potential

Energy Transfer generates stable and steadily rising cash flows to support its high-yielding distribution. That payout provides a nice base return, which should steadily increase in the future. Additionally, the MLP's large and growing backlog of expansion projects should fuel meaningful earnings growth in the coming years, significantly boosting its total return potential. That high return potential makes Energy Transfer a strong buy for energy investors who are comfortable receiving the Schedule K-1 Federal Tax Form the MLP sends each year.

While China unsurprisingly dominates the global market in terms of sales volume, some European countries still lead the way in terms of adoption (looking at the share of BEVs in new car sales).

As Statista's Tristan Gaudiaut details below, for several years now, Norway has been a notable exception at the top of the list: in the first half of 2025, according to data compiled by PwC, more than 90 percent of newly registered passenger cars in that country were electric, a record.

Reflecting the rapid adoption of electric mobility in Northern Europe, Denmark and the Netherlands also have some of the highest market shares: 63.6 percent and 35.0 percent, respectively (between one and two out of every three new vehicles sold). Outside Europe, China leads the way in terms of adoption, with a BEV share of 29.8 percent in the first half of the year (including commercial vehicles). In comparison, the United States lags with a BEV share of just 7.3 percent.

While Norway’s policy measures (such as tax exemptions, toll exemptions, and other incentives) did prove highly effective in promoting electric cars, the Norwegian model cannot be easily transferred to other countries.

First and foremost, this country imposes hefty vehicle import duties and car registration taxes, making cars significantly more expensive than, say, in the United States. By waiving these duties for electric vehicles, Norway is effectively subsidizing EV purchases at a level that a larger country such as the U.S. couldn’t afford.

Secondly, Norway is a very wealthy country (ironically, thanks to its oil reserves) with a high level of income.

According to Norway's national statistical institute, the country’s median household income after taxes was around $64,000 in 2025, which is roughly level with the United States but significantly higher than the EU average.

Not only can its revolutionary process help cut energy production costs, but it can also help reduce planet-heating carbon emissions.

In a press release, Factor2 Energy announced that it has secured over $9 million in seed funding to continue developing its geothermal power generation system that uses carbon dioxide. Based in Germany, the company is aiming to build a ""pilot power plant to demonstrate scalability.""

According to Factor2 Energy, its technology can unlock geothermal power at shallower depths and lower temperatures than conventional methods, making more sites viable for energy harvesting.

The company's method utilizes CO2 as the ""primary working fluid in the geothermal cycle, replacing water or brine,"" making the process more economically feasible. By using CO2, Factor2 Energy asserts that it can eliminate the need for subsurface pumps, reducing energy consumption.

The method also has the potential to eventually turn carbon capture and storage sites into energy-generating power plants. As noted by Kendra Rauschenberger, general partner at Siemens Energy Ventures, the $9.1 million in funding can further enhance the development of a more planet-friendly energy production source.

""I am pleased to see this technology progressing toward commercialization, following its development within Siemens Energy Ventures,"" Rauschenberger said in a statement. ""Geothermal energy is a reliable and renewable power source, and we will work with Factor2 Energy to tailor our turbines to meet the specific needs of this emerging market.""

Geothermal energy is capable of becoming a relatively stable renewable energy source with minimal environmental impact and lower carbon emissions than traditional power plants. Geothermal energy can also lead to cheaper energy in the long run, thanks to its low operating costs and efficient energy production process.

""Our approach enables emission-free, efficient, and baseload-capable electricity production, which is ideal for traditional oil and gas companies looking to diversify their operating assets,"" said Factor2 Energy CEO and co-founder Felix Boehmer.

Texas-sized growth through the end of the decade

Energy Transfer's stable cash flow and bond-like income stream are only part of its story. The midstream giant has a lot of growth on the horizon. It's investing $5 billion into growth capital projects this year, which will fuel accelerating earnings growth as they come online over the next year. Most of those projects will expand its extensive infrastructure in its home state.

For example, one notable expansion project is the Hugh Brinson Pipeline. The 400-mile gas pipeline will extend from Waha in the western part of the state to Maypearl, Texas, just south of Dallas. Phase I of the $2.7 billion project should come online at the end of 2026, followed by Phase II in early 2027.

Energy Transfer is also expanding its natural gas liquids (NGL) capacity at its terminal in Nederland, TX, building another NGL fractionator in Mont Belvieu, TX, constructing two more gas processing plants in the Permian Basin, and building out eight gas-fired power plants to support its operations in Texas. Those projects should enter commercial service through 2026.

As more EVs have entered the market and some at better prices, Tesla’s Model Y has been put up against some very attractive options.

This is especially prudent in Europe and China, where domestic car companies have been offering attractive and cheap EVs as Tesla alternatives.

However, in September, the Model Y was able to battle back and take over the top sales spot for EVs in Europe.

In September, it had 25,938 sales, and although it was an 8.6 percent decrease compared to the same month in 2024, it was enough to be labeled the best-selling car in the European market, Automotive News reported.

500-mile test proves why Tesla Model Y still humiliates rivals in Europe

There are four vehicles that have been atop the European EV sales rankings for any given month this year: the Renault Clio, which has three titles, the Dacia Sandero, which has won four monthly sales titles, and the Volkswagen T-Roc, which was the best-selling car in the market in August.

The Clio captured the number-two spot in September with 20,146 sales.

Despite a strong September showing for the Model Y, which was its first monthly sales crown of the year, the vehicle has not been a top-three EV in Europe this year. That is still led by the Sandero, Clio, and T-Roc.

Despite that, Tesla’s Model Y is still likely to be one of the best-selling vehicles in the world, if not the best, for the year.

In the United States, it has dominated EV sales charts and has been one of the most popular cars in the region. The same goes for China, where the Model Y has more competition than in Europe, but is so attractive because of its premium look and feel, as well as its tech offerings.

The Model Y has been the best-selling car globally for the past two years, outpacing widely popular gas and EV models from around the world.

Tesla also just finished up its best three-month sales period in its history, delivering just shy of half a million vehicles from July to September.

SpaceX has reached an incredible milestone with its Starlink program, officially surpassing 10,000 satellites launched into low Earth orbit since starting the program back in 2019.

Last Sunday, October 19, SpaceX launched its 131st and 132nd Falcon 9 missions of 2025, one from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the other from Vandenberg, California.

The 10,000th Starlink satellite was aboard the launch from California, which was Starlink 11-19, and held 28 v2 mini optimized satellites.

The achievement was marked by a satellite tracker developed by Jonathan McDowell.

The first Starlink launch was all the way back on May 23, 2019, as SpaceX launched its first 60 satellites from Cape Canaveral using a Falcon 9 rocket.

Of the over 10,000 satellites in orbit, the tracker says 8,608 are operational, as some are intentionally de-orbited after becoming faulty and destroyed in the atmosphere.

SpaceX has truly done some really incredible things during its development of the Starlink program, including launch coverage in a global setting, bringing along millions of active subscribers that use the service for personal and business use, locking up commercial partnerships, and more.

Starlink currently operates in around 150 countries, territories, and markets and is available at least somewhere on all seven continents.

Additionally, Starlink has over 5 million subscribers worldwide, and 2.7 million have joined the program over the past year. It has revolutionized internet access on commercial aircraft as well, as several high-profile airlines like Qatar and United, among many others, have already installed Starlink on some of their planes to deliver more stable connectivity for passengers and crew.

SpaceX has the approval to launch 12,000 Starlink satellites from the FAA, but it plans to bring over 30,000 to its constellation, giving anyone the ability to have access to high-speed internet.

Tesla Full Self-Driving (Supervised) v14 has been out for several weeks now, and there are a tremendous number of improvements, as we have now reached the fourth iteration of the semi-autonomous software.

Tesla began the v14.1.4 launch last night, which included minor improvements and addressed brake-stabbing issues many owners have reported. In my personal experience, the stabbing has been awful on v14.1.3, and is a major concern.

However, many things have improved, and only a couple of minor issues have been recurring. Many of the issues v13 addressed are no longer an issue, so Tesla has made significant progress.

Here are some of the most notable improvements Tesla made with v14 from v13:

Better Lane Switching on Highways

One of my biggest complaints with v13 was that the “Hurry” Speed Profile would often stay in the left lane, even when there were no passing cars. The legality of cruising in the left lane fluctuates by jurisdiction, but my personal preference is to drive in the right lane and pass on the left.

Advertisement

That said, Tesla has improved FSD’s performance with more courteous lane behavior. It no longer camps in the left lane and routinely gets back in the right lane after passing slower cars.

More Awareness for Merging Traffic and Makes Courteous Moves

There have been times when FSD has been more aware of merging traffic, and even cross traffic, than most human beings.

Here are a few examples –

Full Self-Driving lets a car out of cross traffic during a busy time of day. This road tends to get very congested, especially during rush hour, so the car that was let in by FSD would have been sitting there for likely a minute longer if my Tesla had not let him in:

Advertisement

A busy, four-lane expressway with a quick exit on the far side of the highway for this merging vehicle. I’ve seen some drivers be extremely inattentive and travel at the same speed as merging cars, making their entry onto the expressway less seamless. FSD doesn’t do that; it makes way for merging cars:

More Confident Driving Around Mail Trucks…and Amish

I encounter a lot of Amish in my area of Pennsylvania, and they commonly use both shoulders and the road, so traffic can get congested at times.

In the past, I’ve taken over when encountering Amish buggies, mail trucks, or other vehicles that are moving slowly or making frequent stops. I have felt it is more logical to just take over in these situations.

I decided not to yesterday on a long drive through Lancaster, PA, and the FSD did a wonderful job of confidently overtaking these vehicles:

Advertisement

This was really impressive and fun to see. There was a slight stutter during one of the three instances, but overall, I didn’t have any concerns.

Object Avoidance

On v13, I almost let the car drive into a fallen branch in the middle of the road. A mile later, the car swerved out of the way for horse droppings. It was a beautiful, clear morning, and the fact that the car did not try to avoid the branch, but did steer away from poop, was concerning.

Advertisement

Tesla has obviously done a great job at refining FSD’s ability to navigate around these road hazards. Last night, it swerved around a dead animal carcass in the middle of the highway. I didn’t see it until we were already going around it:

It was awesome to see this and never feel alarmed by the sharp movement. The maneuver was smooth and really well done.

Better Speed Consistency

With v13, I felt I had to constantly adjust the Speed Profile, as well as the Max Speed setting, when using FSD. With V14, I don’t feel like I am making as many adjustments.

Tesla axed the Max Speed setting altogether with v14, which was a good move, in my opinion. Choosing the Speed Profile is now more intuitive by using the right scroll wheel. If the car is traveling too fast or too slow, just change the profile.

Three things Tesla needs to improve with Full Self-Driving v14 release

V13 had some issues with local roads, and I felt it would travel at strange speeds. In a 45 MPH zone, it would sometimes take a long time to reach 40 MPH, then hover between 43 MPH and 47 MPH. It would then fluctuate between those two speeds, frustrating drivers behind me, understandably.

V14 gets up to speed much better and travels at speeds I’m much more comfortable with on both local roads and highways.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/new-tesla-model-y-winter-logo-1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 13:59:31.772955

Supporters say the development could bring jobs and much-needed tax revenue to the rural area. Concerns about water usage, environmental impact and potential tax increases have dominated local conversations.

“We’re lacking water all over this country,” a Young County resident said. “The environmental impact this will have on southwest Young County is just going to be devastating.”

On October 9, a “concerned citizens” meeting turned tense as residents questioned those involved with the project. Locals like John Paclik voiced fears about long-term damage to the area’s natural resources.

“The land here is mainly rangeland, productive for livestock and wildlife,” Paclik said. “What’s going to happen when they take all the trees off and remove all the grass?”

Ryan Mote, who hosted another community gathering on his family’s property overlooking the proposed site, said the public deserves transparency and open discussion.

“I’m a big fan of free speech — either side is welcome to come and see the property,” Mote said. “Officials talk about jobs and the economics of the deal, but the commitments we’ve seen from past projects haven’t matched what was promised. So we’re skeptical.”

Young County Judge Win Graham acknowledged both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the data center proposal. He said county officials are continuing to review the project before making a final decision.

A petition opposing the data center has already gathered more than 900 signatures in just one week, reflecting the intensity of local opposition.

Supporters of the project argue that the data center could boost the county’s long-term economic prospects by expanding infrastructure and increasing tax revenue. Opponents, however, remain unconvinced.

For now, the future of the data center — and the direction of Young County’s development — remains undecided.

Minister for the Ecological Transition Monique Barbut stated that France’s energy model must be based on a combination of civil nuclear power and renewable energy sources, rejecting accusations of hostility towards nuclear. Speaking during a hearing at the National Assembly, she explained that energy supply security cannot be guaranteed by relying on a single technology.

“I believe that our energy system needs both legs to walk: renewables and nuclear,” she declared before the Sustainable Development Committee. She was responding to criticism from deputy Sébastien Humbert of the Rassemblement National, who cited her former leadership at WWF France to accuse her of anti-nuclear positions.

An expanded approach to energy production

Monique Barbut defended the idea of a diversified system, citing wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy as essential components of the energy mix. “It is impossible to rely on a single energy source if we want to maintain our energy sovereignty,” she said, calling for all options to be developed.

Appointed on October 13 as Minister for the Ecological Transition, Biodiversity and International Climate and Nature Negotiations, she holds her first government position after a career in the French and international civil service. At 69, she identifies as a member of civil society motivated by conviction.

Budgetary pressures and political trade-offs

The 2026 draft finance bill, criticised by several left-wing deputies for what they see as insufficient funding, was also discussed. The minister acknowledged that the proposed budget had not been drawn up by her team, but described it as a “black-and-white dream” in light of the current economic climate. She called on MPs to turn it “into colour”.

She also emphasised the structural role of the State in the energy transition, stating that the government is not a direct funder but a regulator responsible for setting the rules that guide private and public investment towards appropriate energy pathways.

Government positioning and political message

Monique Barbut recalled that her participation in the government is rooted in a desire to act for a “concrete and accessible” environmental policy, without opposing ecological goals to social priorities. She cited extreme weather events and accelerating glacier melt as urgent signals, while refraining from using these observations as activist rhetoric.

“There is a path to a practical, everyday ecology that is accessible to the French,” she affirmed, reiterating her commitment to aligning energy efficiency, social equity and industrial coherence.

The Trump administration has said this year that it is investigating whether offshore wind farms pose a national security threat.
At least half a dozen Cabinet members, including Burgum, are probing the impacts of offshore wind on their departments.
Despite efforts to stop the wind projects in New York and Rhode Island, both are going forward.","When Donald Trump warned that wind farms were 'eagle graveyards' he was mocked by liberals, but now a cabinet secretary is warning that as well as harming wildlife, they threaten America's troops.

In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum warned that the towers — which dwarf the Statue of Liberty — can interfere with critical military radars.

Burgum said the Department of Defense is investigating the potential threat, while the FAA fears they could disrupt systems at commercial airports along the East Coast, particularly in the densely populated northeast.

The man in charge of America's 2.5 billion acres of offshore land also chided Democrats for turning a blind eye to the ecological concerns posed by renewable energy sources while sprinting away from fossil fuels.

'The Biden administration bypassed serious biological opinions that were putting out warnings about these offshore wind towers,' Burgum shared.

'Offshore wind is some of the highest cost electricity we can produce. Now it's becoming quite clear that there's enormous damage to marine fisheries, to marine mammals like whales.'

The secretary in charge of US federal lands, natural resources and cultural preservation stressed how the projects need to be re-examined due to threats to marine animal welfare and the efficacy of offshore energy.

'When you're pounding into the ocean floor to build a pillar for one of these gigantic wind towers, many of them taller than the Seattle Space Needle, when you're doing that, it can produce decibels up to 220 decibels,' the secretary explained.

'That would just destroy your hearing if you were at a concert. I mean, 100 decibels higher than what would even be the loudest cheering you'd see at a sports event.'

Despite this, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has said it has found no links to offshore wind farms and whale deaths, though it admits that studying 'acoustic trauma, which could result from close exposure to loud human-produced sounds, is very challenging to assess.'

The Trump administration has said this year that it is investigating whether offshore wind farms pose a national security threat.

Trump has long hated windmills, believing they are an eyesore that threaten some of America's most beloved wildlife, including the bald eagle.

'You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go. Take a look. Go under a windmill someday. You'll see more birds than you've ever seen in your life... In California, they were killing the bald eagle. If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years. A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true,' the president told a Turning Point USA summit in 2019.

He was mocked by leftists after a news conference in January when he warned that the windmills are 'driving the whales crazy'.

Trump cited a series of beached whales in Massachusetts where he claimed the confused mammals had been driven ashore by wind farm noise pollution.

At least half a dozen Cabinet members, including Burgum, are probing the impacts of offshore wind on their departments.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Environmental Protection Agency boss Lee Zeldin and Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy are also involved, the New York Times reports.

Their effort makes good on an executive order signed by Trump on his first day in office to review the many offshore wind projects approved by Joe Biden.

In total, at least 11 different offshore wind leasing projects with over 1,000 turbines were approved to be built along US coastlines under Biden.

The projects, some of which have been canceled or paused amid the Trump administration's review of the impacts of offshore wind, were estimated to bring in enough power for millions of homes.

Under the Democrat, permits were approved for projects in Alaska, California, North Carolina, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and more.

Trump and Burgum are now trying to reverse many of those green energy deals.

'Since day one, President Trump has reversed Joe Biden's Green New Scam to restore America's energy dominance,' White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told the Daily Mail in a statement.

Though Trump has attempted to halt offshore wind projects, many of which have already been approved with construction underway, some of his attempts have not been successful.

Despite efforts to stop the wind projects in New York and Rhode Island, both are going forward.

But it's not just the damage to animals or the ugly appearance of turbines in coastal waters that are worrying the administration officials.

'There's a lot of reasons beyond just the aesthetics to be very concerned about offshore wind, but the number one for U.S. taxpayers is we were subsidizing with taxpayer dollars, massively, a source of electricity that is completely intermittent and weather-dependent,' Burgum warned.

'We've got to get back in the game now of having baseload power that's affordable and reliable.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/24/23/103301019-0-image-m-23_1761345564867.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 13:59:43.941804

This milestone, as detailed in a recent report from the Los Angeles Times, underscores a profound transformation driven by massive investments in battery storage technology. No longer are rolling blackouts a looming threat during scorching afternoons; instead, grid operators are leaning on vast arrays of lithium-ion batteries to smooth out supply fluctuations.

These batteries, often paired with solar and wind farms, store excess renewable energy generated during the day and discharge it during evening peaks when demand surges. Industry experts point to this as a game-changer, with the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) noting in its 2025 Summer Assessment that sufficient resources now mitigate risks even under extreme conditions. The absence of Flex Alerts this year builds on progress from 2024, reflecting years of strategic planning after the chaotic blackouts of 2020-2022.

The Rise of Battery Dominance

Battery capacity in California has exploded, reaching over 10 gigawatts by mid-2025, enough to power millions of homes for hours. According to the California Energy Commission, this surge has bolstered reliability, allowing the grid to handle heat waves without dipping into emergency reserves. Insiders attribute much of this to policy incentives like tax credits and streamlined permitting, which have attracted billions in private investment from companies such as Tesla and NextEra Energy.

Yet, this isn’t just about hardware; it’s a sophisticated orchestration of demand response and real-time data analytics. CAISO’s media resources highlight how batteries integrate with advanced forecasting tools to preempt shortages, a far cry from the reactive Flex Alerts of the past, which relied on public pleas to unplug appliances.

Overcoming Historical Vulnerabilities

Historically, California’s grid strained under the weight of climate-driven extremes, from wildfires disrupting transmission lines to hydroelectric shortfalls during droughts. The California ISO has long warned of these risks, but 2025’s summer proved resilient, with no alerts issued despite temperatures soaring above 100 degrees in key regions. Energy leaders, as reported in the Los Angeles Times, credit this to a diversified portfolio that includes not only batteries but also expanded clean energy imports from neighboring states.

Critics, however, caution that complacency could undermine gains. While batteries have “completely taken off,” per the same Los Angeles Times analysis, challenges like supply chain vulnerabilities for rare minerals and the need for even larger-scale storage loom. Industry forums, including those hosted by Energy Upgrade California, emphasize ongoing vigilance, urging continued innovation in grid management.

Future Implications for Energy Policy

Looking ahead, California’s model is drawing global attention, influencing utilities from Texas to Europe as they grapple with renewable integration. The Flex Alert program’s own data shows conservation calls have plummeted, signaling a maturing system where technology supplants behavioral nudges. For insiders, this evolution raises questions about pricing dynamics—will abundant storage lower wholesale rates, or create new monopolies?

Ultimately, as CAISO’s updates suggest, the state’s energy strategy is pivoting toward proactive resilience. By embedding batteries deeply into operations, California isn’t just avoiding crises; it’s redefining how modern grids function in an era of climate uncertainty, setting a benchmark for sustainable power management worldwide.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-8d30915c-0ff8-48af-ab86-3e29ec703722.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 11:58:58.180923

With 2026 models of new and returning electric vehicles officially out on the streets, a new generation of EVs is finally here. These EVs such as the Lucid Gravity, Rivian R1S and R1T and Hyundai Ioniq 5 are all natively built with Tesla’s charging connector that allows a seamless connection to its Supercharger network.

But we can’t escape adapters.

The transition to Tesla’s NACS, or North American Charging Standard, now means that every plug at public charging stations like those from ChargePoint, Electrify America, EVgo and others outside the Supercharger network now require an adapter. Even home chargers will need an extra piece of plastic to work on new EVs. Like with the “courage” Apple summoned with its transition to Bluetooth connection from wired headphones, the next few years will require endurance—because it’s getting messy.

Until now, only Tesla EVs (the Model S, 3, X and Y and Cybertruck) needed an adapter to work at every charging station outside the Supercharger network, but now a growing portion of the 4 million EVs in America (as of 2024) are barreling into dongle overload.

A Hyundai spokesperson confirmed, “the vehicles come with two adapters,” as will Lucid’s new Gravity SUV for AC and DC charging. Rivian’s 2026 models will include a J1772 adapter for Level 2 charging for its Dual, Tri and Quad vehicles and its Quad Launch Editions will have a CCS Combo 1 DC fast adapter. In a word: messy.

General Motors, Cadillac’s parent company, put out a summer blog post saying exactly that about the upcoming adapter situation, “That creates a little complication: there will be cars on the road with both standards, as well as chargers of both varieties in public and private settings.” The 2026 Cadillac Optiq will be the first GM EV to transition to NACS.

While Tesla’s Supercharger network is thriving and growing (7,753 stations housing 73,817 individual connectors, up 16% from last year), home chargers and older network plugs won’t be compatible with the newest EVs. An Electrify America spokesperson wrote in an email, “Electrify America remains committed to supporting the future of the [NACS] connector.” She went on to explain that the company is testing NACS charging at stations in Florida and Connecticut “to gain insights into the customer experience and data on the hardware.”

ChargePoint has taken more aggressive steps to escape dongle hell. Rob Newton, the network’s senior director of marketing, acknowledged in a call that in the past the “experience has been really clunky” when different charging systems are involved. ChargePoint has never provided adapters.

Instead of relying on carmakers or individual EV owners to keep up with the latest dongles, ChargePoint is changing the source. Enter the Omni Port. Introduced this summer, the newest ChargePoint stations will have the adapter built into the station itself and drivers can select what type of EV they are charging. “You want to be able to pull up to a station and have confidence it works,” Newton said.

New stations will come standard with an Omni Port, but older stations need to retrofit old connectors with a conversion kit from the company. Newton called it “future-proofing,” but it’s more about ensuring new EV owners can continue to use (and pay for kilowatt-hours from) non-Tesla charging stations.

Nearly every automaker with an electrified model announced in the past few years that it was making the inevitable shift to the Tesla charging system. And now it’s happening — dongles and all.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/10/ev-charger-knot-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:17:51.305277

Engineers in a familiar continent are looking to transform what would have been called a dead zone into a clean-energy utopia with the help of 20 million solar panels. In this article, we will examine why this move is not only important locally but globally as well.

Transition unveiled: Examining the timeline from desert to photovoltaic utopia

It is important to fully understand the topography and features of the “desert” in question before we cover the near impossible engineering feat connecting over 20 million solar panels that is looking to revolutionize energy generation from the ground up.

The desert in question was selected for a wide range of reasons, including:

Solar radiance: Solar radiance, particularly in this context, refers to the amount of solar energy that hits a particular area over a period of time. It is inevitably easy now to see why irradiation is a vital factor when engineers and researchers were making their pick.

Accessibility: This refers to how close the location of the set infrastructure or export routes can determine the viability of the project.

Ability to connect to existing infrastructure: The ability to connect the incoming energy stored and ready to use with existing grid infrastructure is also quite important to conduct thorough research on before settling on the desert location.

How the impossible came to life: logistics and technicalities exposed

Western Australia is the location of the desert that was picked. And the scale looks something like 20 million panels with a broad panel structure. This is not the first time the desert will host a technological marvel, although smaller and similar. The Merredin Solar Farm also finds its roots solidly put in place here, which spans 460 hectares and uses over 350,000 panels.

Implications of the project, particularly on Australia’s future

The possibilities that will arise from the project are immense. Residential homes, for one, will be at the greater receiving end as they are on pace to receive enough electricity that can power hundreds of thousands of homes, just like this U.S state’s powerful innovation transforming deserts. The reduction in Australia’s overall greenhouse emissions is also a huge bonus.

Internationally, Australia is going to be able to cement itself as a world leader when it comes to the topic of photovoltaic energy generation through desert incorporation. This adds it to the list of continents/countries that have started adopting green energy from the ground up.

Bottlenecks and hurdles are plaguing the road ahead

A gargantuan project such as this will most likely come chock-full of roadblocks that may range from environmental concerns to logistics. Within these issues, energy storage facilities, adequate financing, and innovative blocks might prove to later in the years when the infrastructure has been built to be insurmountable.

But it is not all doom and gloom because this project might just be the key that Western Australia has been looking for to offset its heavy dependence on fossil fuels. This goes to show that this is just not a fluke but an entire movement with one objective in mind: Revolutionize photovoltaic energy generation.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Image-26.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:03:34.991736

A simulation tool developed by researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory is helping to optimize the efficiency and speed of our power grid, according to a release.

The platform uses mathematical tools, automation, and analysis to help officials understand and predict the grid's behavior. It achieves this with less computing time and at a cheaper cost than the current approach.

Because of the vast size of North America, the complex power grid system is split into multiple sections. It doesn't fully sync up, and it's not singularly managed by the federal government, so it's difficult to fully prepare the power supply during natural disasters and extreme weather events when the grid can be vulnerable.

Today, the speed and demand of the grid are evolving faster than its infrastructure can handle. The new tool will allow for grid management methods to be analyzed quickly and accurately without risking equipment, electrical service, or worker safety.

It could also help expand the capacity of the grid to generate and move electricity in different ways. Ultimately, this will help operators prevent blackouts and unsafe operating conditions and could better support the huge power requirements of AI and crypto data centers.

""We are trying to understand electronics and systems in a way that mimics their real behavior with higher fidelity,"" said Phani Marthi, a researcher at Oak Ridge.

""Analysis with the RE-INTEGRATE tool can give us new insights into how to consistently prevent or stop cascading blackouts and brownouts.""

A more efficient power grid could lower the cost of electricity for consumers, saving you money on utility bills every month. These improvements will also reduce energy pollution and protect the power supply during severe weather.

Hyper-scale data centers are classified as those with over 100,000 square feet and consuming 100 megawatts.
“A Facebook, an Amazon — the big data centers will want direct fiber connectivity.” A map published last week by the Wall Street Journal using Department of Energy information showed data centers across the United States.
Some data centers do have flexibility in their need for electricity, while others must respond immediately to needs of their consumers.","Data centers in Colorado have been almost exclusively located along the Front Range, more narrowly yet between Colorado Springs and Boulder County.

In other words, they have arrived at exactly those places within the state that have prosperous economies, jurisdictions even struggling with the challenges imposed by growth.

Might data centers make their way to rural areas of Colorado?

Leaders of several electrical cooperatives offer mixed responses. Some report getting interest already, others not.

Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Colorado’s second largest electrical provider, hopes to prime the pump. It has filed a proposal with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a tariff that it believes will interest developers. It’s called HILT, which stands for high-impact load tariff. It is designed for demands of 45 megawatts or more.

Meanwhile, several state legislators continue to hone bills they expect to introduce into the next legislative session. In the last legislative session, one bill proposed incentives for data center development in some locations. Others thought that the state needed guardrails to ensure other that customers — as well as land and especially water resources — are not imperiled. (Look for a deeper story on that in coming days in Big Pivots).

“Absolutely,” said Duane Highley, the chief executive of Tri-State, in an interview with Big Pivots on Oct. 7 when asked about potential for data centers in places like Craig or Fort Morgan. “Our members have actually had quite a bit of interest across our entire footprint. So definitely not just the urban areas.”

The Westminster-based cooperative provides wholesale power to 40 electrical cooperatives and public power districts in Colorado and three adjoining states.

“Some of our high-elevation members get a lot of interest because of the cool air and less need for cooling a data center,” he said. This, he added, is particularly true in Wyoming, where Tri-State has 10 member cooperatives. It supplies electricity to 16 cooperatives in Colorado.

Tri-State does not deliver electricity to Craig and Hayden, although it does operate three coal-burning units at Craig. It plans a gas-fired power plant there after the coal units get retired. The first unit is scheduled to retire later this year and the final two before the end of 2028.

At 6,200 feet in elevation, Craig is consistently cooler than the Front Range. It is often below zero during winter nights, sometimes far below.

“I guess Craig would be an excellent spot,” said Highley. He cited the existence of a “really big substation” as well as transmission.

“So if anybody wants to start a conversation around Craig, we will have the tariff in place to allow that to happen. ”

Highley reported that Tri-State has had four gigawatts of requests on its system from data centers. Tri-State has a generating capacity of 2.5 gigawatts from Wyoming to Arizona. Not all that demand will materialize, Highley hastened to add. “A lot of them are just shopping, but I have to think that some part of that is real.”

A spot check by Big Pivots of electrical cooperatives in Colorado reveals little of substance — yet.

“We really haven’t had any inquiries about data centers in the Mountain Parks service territory to date,” said Virginia Harman, the chief executive of Granby-based Mountain Parks Electric. “That doesn’t mean they won’t happen.”

In Buena Vista, Jon Beyer, the general manager of Sangre de Cristo Electric, has the same report. “We are not getting any inquiries anywhere in the Arkansas Valley. Land prices are pretty expensive, and electrical infrastructure is probably not robust enough for stuff of that size. Finding employees is a challenge as well,” he said.

“Coops along the Front Range — Poudre Valley, United Power, Mountain View, maybe even San Isabel, I would guess they have all received inquiries, folks kicking the tires.”

In western Colorado, Delta-Montrose Association has at least heard a little bit of interest via upstream electrical providers but “nothing to take to the bank,” said Kent Blackwell, the chief administrative officer. “The fact that we have even heard any out there is shocking to me, this far removed from urban centers.”

Different sizes

Data centers do come in different sizes and flavors. Micro data centers generally are those in places of 5,000 square feet or less. Small comes in at 20,000 square feet. Hyper-scale data centers are classified as those with over 100,000 square feet and consuming 100 megawatts.

QTS, Colorado’s most high-profile data center, seems not to have divulged its square footage but has a 67-acre campus in Aurora, near the intersection of I-70 and E-470, and a demand of 117 megawatts. However, it still ramping up, with a 10-year expansion.

Many data centers are even larger. Meta (Facebook) has a data center in Oregon that covers 4.6 million square feet. A data center in Inner Mongolia covers 10.7 million square feet.

These definitions and other information, by the way, come in part from Google AI reports (which makes those of us who are actual providers of diminished relevance — or at least uncompensated.) They could be wrong — as AI often is. Of course, newspapers were never wrong, were they?

Tri-State’s Highley said he has talked with developers covered by non-disclosure agreements. “I can’t share who they are, but I’ll just say I’m inspired by them,” he said. “They have a lot of money, and they do have the ability to execute. I also believe they’re shopping multiple locations at once, and so it’s a little bit of competition.”

Will this new HILT tariff from Tri-State — assuming it is approved by FERC — become a model for others? Highley said he got a call from a White House office in late September. The individual had lots of questions about Tri-State’s FERC filing. The individual had read Tri-State’s FERC filing in detail.

“Why do you care so much? Why are you calling me?” Highley asked. ” And he said, ‘Because I think this tariff that you filed could set a precedent for the industry nation-wide.”

Highley said he has not noticed another large-load tariff approved at FERC, although he has seen two that were rejected. “I don’t think we have it perfect, but we think we’re moving down a good path. We had input from developers and from our own co-op members to design this.”

Stranded assets?

Will this interfere with Tri-State’s plans to decarbonize? It expects to be at 50% carbon free electricity by year’s end and 70% by 2030. No, said Highley. Tri-State can meet new demand with solar, wind and battery storage. It also plans another natural gas plant near Craig, pending approval by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission.

Tri-State and its members would also allow data center developers to produce part of their own generation. That tariff is called bring-your-own-resource, or BYOR. A developer might have better access to supply chains, Highley said. “Again, some of these hyper-scalers have such a big checkbook they can buy their way to the front of the line. ”

HIghley said the Tri-State’s tariff will ensure that it has the capacity to back up the data center developer while getting properly compensated, so no other members subsidize the project.

A September presentation by Matt Fitzgibbon, Tri-State’s vice president of planning and analytics, tells a slightly nuanced story. A slide deck reported “limited potential” for stranded assets resulting in financial risk to Tri-State and its members while enabling “economic development across our members’ systems at an unprecedented level and pace.”

This gets at the heart of one concern about data centers, as illustrated in the Xcel filing with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission last year. How much of the prospective demand from data centers is real? And if it is not real, who will be left holding the bag if a utility spends gobs of money building new generating capacity? How much risk will be put on ratepayers, in the case of Xcel, or in the case of cooperatives, members?

In Durango, Chris Hansen, the chief executive of La Plata Electric since November, foresees data centers arriving in more rural parts of Colorado.

“We have had significant discussions with three different data center operators who are interested in southwest Colorado,” he reported. “We are making sure that we are open for business and communicating our opportunities in the near term, in the next 24 months, and those requiring more lead time of three, four or five years.”

Data centers, he said, “are most focused on low cost of power and availability of water for cooling. Those are very high on their list.”

And Colorado’s sales tax policy will not make it a higher cost for developers when they are buying hundreds of millions of dollars for chips. “That is something that is relevant for them as they make their decisions.”

Hansen said he believes that data center demand can be met in ways that are highly beneficial to existing customers and the electrical system more broadly.

Some rural places could be limited by lack of sufficient fiber connectivity to more urban areas. Hansen acknowledges that but points out that data centers can have different needs. As for southwest Colorado, it is well connected.

Delta-Montrose’s Blackwell sees his cooperative being in a good position to interest data center developers. It has fiber connectivity to Denver, Salt Lake City and Albuquerque. “A Facebook, an Amazon — the big data centers will want direct fiber connectivity.”

A map published last week by the Wall Street Journal using Department of Energy information showed data centers across the United States. Texas has, well, Texas-sized dots and maybe bigger. Virginia, with its data center alley, is well represented. But you see almost no dots of any size in the Rocky Mountain states beyond the urban areas with the exception of Cheyenne.

Hansen said he believes electrical cooperatives are positioned to meet demand that investor-owned utilities in urban areas cannot.

“Larger investor-owned utilities around the country are not in great position to meet demand. That is the trend I am seeing. Rural co-ops can move fast, as they don’t have to necessarily go through PUCs. Those things help make rural areas more attractive.”

Lots of shopping, little commitment

In Southwest Colorado, the data developers have been looking to get started at 50 to 100 megawatts. If things go well, they might want to grow to data centers of a gigawatt or more.

Data centers come in different flavors, said Hansen. Some data centers do have flexibility in their need for electricity, while others must respond immediately to needs of their consumers.

Then there is the bring-your-own power approach. The Wall Street Journal article on Oct. 15, “AI Data Centers, Desperate for Electricity, Are Building Their Own Power Plants,” noted the problems of building transmission and other infrastructure.

“Tech companies in the AI race need power, and lots of it. They aren’t waiting around for the archaic U.S. power grid to catch up,” reports Jennifer Hlller.

Data centers long took power for granted, a consultant told the Journal. “But that’s no longer possible given the city-sized amounts of electricity needed to train AI models. One data center can devour as much electricity as 1,000 Walmart stores, and an AI search can use 10 times the amount of energy as a Google search,” Hiller said.

Hence, they have taken to building their own power generating sources, often gas plants.

The downside to that, as Hansen pointed out, is that the data center developers could still need the reliability of the broader grid. “It’s a balancing act,” he said.

While Hansen in Durango has just started getting inquiries from data center developers, Mark Gabriel, chief executive of Brighton-based United Power, has been fielding inquires for two or three years.

The electrical cooperative covers 900-plus square miles from the foothills of the Rockies to the oil and gas territory of the Wattenberg Field. But it also serves land near DIA as well as along the fast-developing I-76 and I-25 corridors.

As such, United has been getting lots of “tire kickers.” Now, says Gabriel, United actually expects something to come of the talk. Two operators with large load demands have committed to the $650,000 up-front fees, two more are in active negotiations, and several others are talking with United.

“We anticipate at least one to come to fruition,” said Gabriel.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3507d39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/740x389+0+52/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2Fc4%2F8b1e1a2a45bf83c4ff2be50edb97%2Fimg.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:03:16.868140

In part, that’s because the roughly 64,000 federal military and civilian employees in Louisiana make up only about 3% of the state’s total workforce.
Also insulating the broader economy from the effects of the shutdown is the fact that the largest federal programs, Medicare and Social Security, have not been touched.","In his day job as president of Woodward Interests, Bill Hoffman hasn’t much noticed the federal government shutdown. His New Orleans real estate development firm is still planning projects, like the redevelopment of the former Lindy Boggs Medical Center in Mid-City, and operating as usual with no disruptions to supply chains or services.

As a volunteer for Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana, however, Hoffman has seen the effects up close. He's worked with the nonprofit organization's leadership to identify new funding sources at a time when more people around New Orleans need food assistance and federal support is drying up.

He fears it’s about to get a lot worse.

Thousands of federal workers in the state have been furloughed or are working without a paycheck. Loans and other federal funding sources are no longer flowing. And beginning Nov. 1, food stamps benefits — which help put food on the table for nearly 19% of Louisianans and more than 1 in 5 people in New Orleans — are set to run out.

The severity of that potential loss in food support prompted Gov. Jeff Landry on Friday to issue an emergency order aimed at helping him replace that federal funding with state dollars. But Second Harvest worries that food banks and other service agencies, still reeling from federal budget cuts earlier this year, will continue to see a strain.

“We’re already seeing more federal workers coming to us, and that number is going to grow,” said Hoffman, who also serves as Second Harvest board chair. “We will start to see this ripple out into the broader economy and will all start to feel it.”

Until now, the federal government shutdown, which enters its fifth week Wednesday, has mostly been a problem for the nation’s millions of federal employees, who have been furloughed or, in the case of air traffic controllers and other essential employees, forced to work without pay. States like Virginia or Maryland, which have high numbers of federal workers, feel it acutely.

In Louisiana, the impact has been more muted because the federal workforce is relatively small — a little under 20,000 civilian workers — and President Donald Trump’s administration has selectively shifted funds to ensure that some employees, like active duty troops, continue to get paid. At least for now.

But economists and public policy groups say a quiet storm is brewing. Louisiana is already one of the poorest states in the nation, with a higher percentage of residents on federal assistance than almost any other. The longer the shutdown drags on, the greater the impact will be across the state, as furloughed workers and those who rely on federal assistance tighten their belts and brace for potentially unprecedented times.

“The dominoes are about to start falling,” said economist Stephen Barnes, executive director of the Blanco Public Policy Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “Once they do, it’s going to be very challenging for families across the state.”

Stopgaps in place

Experts say it’s not surprising that many across Louisiana in the private sector haven’t felt the effects of the shutdown yet. In part, that’s because the roughly 64,000 federal military and civilian employees in Louisiana make up only about 3% of the state’s total workforce.

Some are still collecting paychecks, or were until last week.

Others have been helped by institutions like Keesler Federal Credit Union, based in Biloxi, Mississippi, which is offering paycheck protection relief to the mostly federal government employees that make up its membership. So far, about 1,535 members have enrolled in the plan, which will cover them for 90 days, according to Keesler spokesperson T. Bradley Keith.

Also insulating the broader economy from the effects of the shutdown is the fact that the largest federal programs, Medicare and Social Security, have not been touched. Neither has Medicaid, though the extension of tax credits to help low-income patients afford health insurance is at the heart of the dispute between Democrats and Republicans in Congress that led to the shutdown.

“The two big programs and Medicaid are safe for now,” said Jan Moeller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, a think tank that advocates for inclusive economic policies. “So, in a state like Louisiana, which has a huge amount of federal money but not a huge number of employees, it is going to be hard to see the effects of the shutdown in most communities.”

Just because the effects of the shutdown are not widely visible, however, doesn’t mean they’re not being felt in various pockets of the economy, Moeller said.

The National Flood Insurance Program is shuttered, which means new homeowners are unable to buy into the program, and the state’s existing 400,000 policyholders aren't able to increase their coverage.

Louisiana’s 25,000 farmers have been unable to get a loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, apply for a conservation program or receive a market report, hampering their ability to plan for the upcoming planting season.

And the state’s nearly half a million small businesses have been unable to access loans through the Small Business Administration, though data released by the SBA last week showed that only 12 loan applications totaling about $7.2 million in Louisiana went unprocessed last week because the agency was closed.

Stretched thin

If federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, runs out, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned, the shutdown will become real for a lot more people across Louisiana.

More than 800,000 people in Louisiana receive SNAP benefits. That’s more, as a percentage of the population, than almost any other state in the nation

On Wednesday, Landry, a Republican, said the state would shut the program down next month, blaming Democrats in Congress for the stalemate that has led to the current funding crisis.

On Friday at the Harry Tompson Center, a day shelter in New Orleans, Marcus, a New Orleans East resident and licensed practical nurse by training who declined to give his last name, said the political finger-pointing among elected officials is frustrating.

The monthly SNAP benefits he has received for the past two years since he lost his job barely puts food on the table now. If he loses them, the 64-year-old says his cellphone is about the only “luxury” item he could trim from his monthly expenses.

“I don’t know how much more I can stretch,” he said. “I guess I’ll be shopping more at Dollar Tree and coming more to the food pantry.”

Food pantries, however, are already hard-pressed. At an event at Second Harvest last week, Chief Strategy Officer John Sillars said the food bank will receive about 5.8 million fewer pounds of food from the federal government this year than it did last due to federal funding cuts since Trump took office.

As a result, Second Harvest will provide about 5 million fewer meals to a food-insecure population that had grown by 30,000 even before the shutdown.

U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, who visited Second Harvest last week to call attention to the growing crisis, said he’s worried about “the avalanche effect” that will happen if the shutdown persists.

“It impacts our families but also the grocer, the person who is stocking the shelves, the person who is selling the milk, the cereal, the eggs, the bread,” Carter said.

Landry's announcement Friday that the state would work to continue SNAP benefits for the time being was a welcome development that will mitigate the worst outcomes for the state's neediest residents, policy experts said. But more pain is on the way if the shutdown doesn't end soon.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/ca/1ca0cea8-5e4f-5d91-9b31-58b7d15657be/68f92888886a7.image.jpg?crop=1752%2C920%2C0%2C131&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-26 11:19:42.664700

Heat domes are high-pressure systems that act like lids trapping hot air over a region. According to NOAA’s National Weather Service, they can raise surface temperatures for days or even weeks.

During the summer of 2025, the United States set new records for power demand under a persistent dome. In July, demand in the United States topped 750 gigawatts on some record-breaking afternoons, with power providers scrambling to meet peak loads while infrastructure came under strain.

When energy systems are overstretched, the risk of brownouts or blackouts increases. In addition to the human health toll of extreme heat, an overtaxed grid poses significant business and economic risks by driving up costs, limiting output, and damaging critical infrastructure.

Heat domes and the climate connection

Heat domes are becoming stronger and lasting longer. According to entities such as the World Meteorological Organization, climate change makes certain extreme heat events at least twice as likely.

One study of the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome found it was 86% stronger than it would likely have been without human-driven climate change.

Heat increases energy demand

When heat domes roll in, the grid starts sweating right along with the rest of us. Air conditioners, commercial coolers, refrigerators, and fans all crank up, slurping electricity like marathon runners gulping water. During the 2025 heat wave, U.S. power demand set records from coast to coast.

Peak demand shifts depending on the time of day and where you are. In the Mid-Atlantic, transformer banks hum under the strain in late afternoons. In California, it’s the early evening AC surge that pushes the grid into ""brace yourself"" mode, sometimes triggering conservation alerts or rolling blackouts.

These spikes aren’t just abstract numbers — they come with a price tag. Utilities shell out extra generation costs and pay hefty premiums in capacity markets. For businesses, unmanaged peaks can mean skyrocketing energy bills, interrupted production lines, and even data centers throttling performance to keep the servers from cooking.

How heat impacts grid infrastructure

National lab studies funded by the U.S. Department of Energy consistently flag heat as a key stressor on electric grid infrastructure. Heat affects generation equipment and transmission lines, creating multiple points of vulnerability.

Impact on power plants

Thermal plants — power plants that generate electricity by heating water into steam to drive turbines — lose efficiency during extreme heat

Turbines and generators overheat, producing less power when the inlet air is hotter

Impact on solar panels

Output declines with rising temperatures — each degree over 25°C (77°F) reduces efficiency

Above 40°C (104°F), reductions intensify, especially with dust buildup or poor airflow

Impact on transmission lines and equipment

Hot lines sag more, increasing the risk of faults

Transformers and switchgear run hotter, risking breakdowns and accelerating wear

Cooling systems may struggle to keep up, further stressing components

The overall effect is that these pressures increase the likelihood of operational failures, including brownouts or full blackouts.

Vulnerabilities in the U.S. power grid

Aging infrastructure

The U.S. grid is uneven in age and robustness. Many regions rely on decades-old wiring and transformers, with some components well past their intended lifespan. Others, like the Southwest and Midwest, are especially hard-hit during heat due to slower infrastructure upgrades and sprawling service areas that complicate maintenance.

Regional weak spots and interconnection issues

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) oversees grid reliability standards and has repeatedly warned about regional weak spots and poor interconnection.

Weak tie lines (power lines that connect different regions of the grid to share electricity) in the Midwest limit the ability to move excess generation from other states during heat spikes. Sunbelt states sometimes lack capacity margins when demand surges, forcing utilities to issue conservation alerts.

A combination of heat, aging equipment, and limited investment

As NERC alerts show, outdated infrastructure can’t always adapt quickly to heat domes. This vulnerability is compounded by limited investment in grid hardening and modern control systems. That weakness creates risk for widespread outages when high demand, aging equipment, and extreme weather events collide, potentially leaving millions without power.

Cybersecurity vulnerabilities

Adding to these physical weaknesses, the grid's increasing digitalization and reliance on connected control systems have made it a prime target for cyberattacks. According to NERC, the number of vulnerable points in the grid's software and hardware grew by roughly 60 per day, reaching between 23,000 and 24,000 annually — significantly expanding the potential attack surface for state-sponsored or criminal actors.

What’s being done about heat domes?

Grid operators and regulators are using both short-term and long-term strategies to limit vulnerabilities and plan for the future.

Short-term: Approaches include demand response programs that pay businesses to cut usage at peak hours. Public heat alerts urge consumers to shift usage to cooler times. Utilities also balance loads through real-time coordination and distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar and local batteries.Long-term: Federal funds are under review to finance grid modernization. Batteries and storage are being added to smooth peaks. Legislation such as the BIG WIRES Act aims to strengthen transmission across regions. Regional grid operators, including CAISO in California, PJM in the Mid-Atlantic, and MISO in the Midwest, have launched heat wave prep plans and capacity-upgrade roadmaps.

Economic effects of heat domes

Heat domes drive higher costs for utilities and consumers. As peak electricity prices jump, bills go up. Utilities may pass those expenses on through rate increases, sometimes prompting public backlash.

Manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare industries also feel the squeeze. Hospitals and data centers need reliable cooling. Crop irrigation systems and automated greenhouses rely on grid power. Amid extreme heat, some facilities face rationing or must run expensive backup generators.

Energy price spikes often coincide with heat waves. Market data show wholesale prices doubling or tripling in some regions during peak events. That volatility can affect broader economic activities, especially in heat-sensitive sectors.

Ley’s attempt to turn the tables on the government after weeks of opposition infighting came as the government confirmed the environment minister would be able to overrule the new regulator, to be known as the National Environment Protection Agency, on major project approvals.

Flagging an intense period of negotiations during the remaining weeks of the parliamentary year, Environment Minister Murray Watt declared the nation’s environment laws were “broken”.

“Of course we’re open to amendments being put forward and I expect that we’ll see some in the coming weeks, but people should be under no illusions that we will be passing these laws through the parliament,” Watt told Sky News on Sunday.

“The only question is how quickly we do it and who we do it with. We’ve said all along that we are open to passing this legislation with either the Coalition or the Greens.”

Watt is expected to reveal more details on Monday and to introduce legislation to the House of Representatives on Thursday.

He quickly shot down the idea of carving up the bill, saying: “Splitting the bill would weaken environmental protections and would remove the certainty that business is looking for.

“It would mean more habitat destruction, more species threatened, no independent regulator and slower approval times.”

The government shelved plans to create a new environmental protection agency before the May election, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese replaced Tanya Plibersek with Watt to revive the reform process.

In a letter sent to Albanese on Sunday, Ley and opposition environment spokeswoman Angie Bell say the proposed reforms “risk adding further complexity and uncertainty, creating a handbrake on investment without delivering commensurate environmental gains”.

“In the interests of delivering on improved environmental laws and the urgent need for clearer and more consistent approvals, I propose that the government split the bill into two parts,” Ley and Bell wrote.

“The Coalition stands ready to achieve meaningful reform that protects the environment while removing unnecessary duplication and delay.”

Ley said the first tranche of legislation should focus on practical measures to streamline approvals, separating this part of the bill “from the broader, more contentious environmental elements of the legislation would allow parliament to make immediate progress on areas that can genuinely help unlock investment and growth”.

Ley was environment minister when former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel issued a review calling for an overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

Coalition divisions over the environment are set to flare up again when Nationals senator Matt Canavan presents details of his and colleague Ross Cadell’s report into net zero to the party on Monday.

Canavan, a passionate supporter of coal mining, said it was clear Australians were not “getting a good deal from net zero” but he said he had not commissioned any economic modelling to inform his report.

“The lived reality of net zero is clear. It is not working for the Australian people,” he told the ABC’s Insiders program.

Resources Minister Madeleine King has said a failure to pass the bill could delay the approval of rare earths mines, undermining a landmark critical minerals agreement signed by Albanese and US President Donald Trump last week.

On Sunday, the Business Council of Australia called for changes to environmental laws to prevent a “damaging investment cliff” caused by a downturn in infrastructure investment.

“Whether it’s housing, renewable energy, health and care services or technology infrastructure, the [environmental protection] system is delaying investment into projects we need for the future,” BCA chief executive Bran Black said.

Greens environment spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said: “From what we have seen thus far, these changes have been written by the minister to satisfy big business, the miners and the logging companies.

“There’s nothing in this package that protects native forests or protects our climate.”

Hanson-Young said the Greens were open to negotiations on the legislation, but she said: “I’ve said right from the beginning: we need to protect our forests and to protect our climate and any piece of legislation that doesn’t do those things is not worth the paper it’s written on.”

The government also said it would begin consulting on possible updates to Australia’s copyright laws to ensure Australian writers and artists are fairly compensated if artificial intelligence companies use their work to inform their models.

Attorney-General Michelle Rowland said any reforms would not include a so-called “text and data mining exception” proposed by the Productivity Commission and fiercely opposed by the Australian creative sector.

In Illinois, the Chicago Teachers Union won a contract with the city’s schools to add solar panels on some buildings and clean energy career pathways for students, among other actions. In Minnesota, the Minneapolis Federation of Educators demanded that the district create a task force on environmental issues and provide free metro passes for students. And in California, the Los Angeles teachers union’s demands include electrifying the district’s bus fleet and providing electric vehicle charging stations at all schools.

Those are among the examples in a new report on how unionized teachers are pushing their school districts to take action on the climate crisis, which is damaging school buildings and disrupting learning. The report — produced by the nonprofit Building Power Resource Center, which supports local governments and leaders, and the Labor Network for Sustainability, a nonprofit that seeks to unite labor and climate groups — describes how educators can raise demands for climate action when they negotiate labor contracts with their districts. By emphasizing the financial case for switching to renewable energy, educators can simultaneously act on climate change, improve conditions in schools and save districts money, it says.

As federal support and financial incentives for climate action wither, this sort of local action is becoming more difficult — but also more urgent, advocates say. Chicago Public Schools has relied on funding for electric buses that has been sunsetted by the Trump administration, said Jackson Potter, vice president of the Chicago Teachers Union. But the district is also seeking other local and state funding and nonprofit support.

Bradley Marianno, an associate professor in the College of Education at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said that educator unions embracing climate action is part of a move started about 15 years ago in which more progressive unions — like those in Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere — focus on “collective good bargaining,” or advocating for changes that are good for their members but also the broader community. But this approach is unlikely to catch on everywhere: “The risk lies in members feeling that core issues like wages and working conditions are being overlooked in favor of more global causes,” he wrote in an email.

I recently caught up with Potter, the CTU vice president, about the report and his union’s approach to bargaining for climate action. Collaborating with local environmental and community groups, the Chicago Teachers Union ultimately succeeded in winning a contract that calls for identifying schools for solar panels and electrification, expanding indoor air quality monitoring, helping educators integrate climate change into their curriculum, and establishing training for students in clean energy jobs, among other steps.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The report talks about contract negotiations being an underused — and effective — lever for demanding climate action. Why do you see that process as such an opportunity for climate action?

On the local level, our schools are 84, 83 years old on average. There is lead paint, lead pipes, mold, asbestos, PCBs, all kinds of contamination in the HVAC system and the walls that require upgrades. By our estimate, the district needs $30 billion worth of upgrades, and right now I think they spend $500 million a year to just do patch-up work. We’re at a point where it’s a system fail of epic proportions if we can’t figure out a way to transition and make things healthier. And so if you’re going to do a roof repair, put solar on it, have independence from fossil fuels, clean air in areas that have faced environmental racism and contamination.

We’re also dealing with a legacy of discrimination and harm, and that is true of the nation. So how do we get out of this and also save the planet and also prevent greater climate events that further destabilize vulnerable communities and put people at risk? It made sense for us to use our contract as a path to do both things — deal with this local crisis that was screaming for new solutions and ideas, in a moment when the climate is on fire, literally.

How challenging was it to get educators to view climate issues as a priority? There are so many other things, around pay and other issues, on the table.

When we started, it almost felt like people in the membership, in the community, viewed it as a niche issue. Like, ‘Oh, isn’t that cute, you care about green technology.’ As we figured out how to think about it and talk about it and probe where people were having issues in their schools, it became really obvious that when you started talking about asbestos, lead and mold remediation — and helping communities that have been hit the hardest with cumulative impacts and carcinogens and how those things are present in schools — that became much more tangible. Or even quality food and lunch and breakfast for students who are low-income. It went from bottom of the list to top of the list, instantaneously.

Your contract calls for a number of climate-related actions, including green pathways for students and agreements with building trade unions to create good jobs for students. Tell me about that.

We’re trying to use the transformation of our facilities as another opportunity for families and students in these communities that have been harmed the most to get the greatest benefit from the transformation. So if we can install solar, we want our students to be part of that project on the ground in their schools, gaining the skills and apprenticeship credentials to become the electricians of the future. And using that as a project labor agreement [which establishes the terms of work on a certain project] with the trades to open doors and opportunities. The same goes for all the other improvements — whether it’s heat pumps, HVAC systems, geothermal. And for EV — we have outdated auto shop programming that’s exclusively based on the combustible engine reliant on fossil fuels, whereas in [the nearby city of] Belvidere they are building electric cars per the United Auto Workers’ new contract. Could we gain a career path on electric vehicles that allows students to gain that mechanical knowledge and insight and prepares them for the vehicles of the future?

The report talks about the Batesville School District in Arkansas that was able to increase teacher salaries because of savings from solar. Have you tried to make the case for higher teacher salaries because of these climate steps?

The $500 million our district allocates for facility upgrades annually comes out of the general fund, so we haven’t at all thought about it in terms of salary. We’ve thought about it in terms of having a school nurse, social worker, mental health interventions at a moment when there is so much trauma. We see this as a win-win: The fewer dollars the district has to spend on facility needs means the more dollars they can spend on instructional and social-emotional needs for students. In terms of the Arkansas model, it’s pretty basic. If you get off the fossil fuel pipelines and electric lines and you become self-sufficient, essentially, powering your own electric and heat, there is going to be a boon, particularly if there are up-front subsidies.

Math and climate change

When temperatures rise in classrooms, students have more trouble concentrating and their learning suffers — in math, in particular. That’s according to a new report from NWEA, an education research and testing company.

The report, part of a growing body of evidence of the harms of extreme heat on student performance, found that math scores declined when outdoor temperatures on test days rose above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Students in high-poverty schools, which are less likely to have air conditioning, saw declines up to twice as large as those in wealthier schools.

The learning losses grew as temperatures rose. Students who took tests on 101-degree days scored roughly 0.06 standard deviations below students who tested when temperatures were 60 degrees, the equivalent of about 10 percent of the learning a fifth grader typically gains in a school year.

It’s not entirely clear why student math scores suffer more than reading when temperatures rise. But Sofia Postell, an NWEA research analyst, said that on math tests, students must problem-solve and rely on their memories, and that kind of thinking is particularly difficult when students are hot and tired. Anxiety could be a factor too, she wrote in an email: “Research has also shown that heat increases anxiety, and some students may experience more testing anxiety around math exams.”

The study was based on data from roughly 3 million scores on NWEA’s signature MAP Growth test for third to eighth graders in six states.

The report urged school, district and state officials to take several steps to reduce the effects of high heat on student learning and testing. Ideally, tests would be scheduled during times of the year when it wasn’t so hot, it said, and also during mornings, when temperatures are cooler. Leaders also need to invest in updating HVAC systems to keep kids cool.

“Extreme heat has already detrimentally impacted student learning and these effects will only intensify without action,” wrote Postell.

Mea culpa: A quick note to say I got two things wrong in my last newsletter — the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council was incorrect, as was the number of hours of learning California students have missed so far this year. It’s more than 54,000.

A college aims to start training 200 new students in the coming months, to develop skilled workers needed in the transition to clean energy.

Those studying at Pembrokeshire College could then fill some of the 15,000 new jobs ministers hope will be created in Wales.

But senior Welsh government advisor David Clubb says UK ministers plan to spend billions on ""unproven technology"" such as carbon capture, when the initial focus should be on home insulation to help bring down bills for the public.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he stands by his pledge to reduce energy bills.

National Infrastructure Commission chairman Mr Clubb believes the initial focus should be Wales' ""oldest housing stock in western Europe"" which he believes leaves many in fuel poverty.

""For Wales, probably the first thing we should be doing is looking at a programme of insulation, and UK government should be putting money into that,"" Mr Clubb said.

Ministers have talked about a £20 billion investment in carbon capture and storage, which he said is ""likely not going to make a big impact on our ambitions for net zero by 2050"".

Mr Clubb, a green energy technology expert, said it was far better to invest first in making homes warmer and easier to heat ""than to be spending huge sums of money, which will create jobs, yes, but in a very localised area"".

One of the areas to benefit from clean energy investments is Pembrokeshire College, in Haverfordwest.

Its hoping to start training 200 new students in the coming months in trades from plumbing to engineering.

It is part of a pilot scheme to develop skilled workers needed in the transition to clean energy that ministers say will bring 15,000 new jobs to Wales.

Theo Butland-Smith, 17, from Monkton said he believes there will be a ""lot of money"" in the new green jobs.

""[There is] a lot of opportunity so I thought I might as well pursue it, and I've enjoyed it ever since,"" he said.

Welding student Bethany Price, also 17, from Haverfordwest, is hoping to end up in a clean energy job.

""It's amazing how far they've come with everything,"" she said.

""I'm just excited to be part of that new whole thing going on.""

Mr Clubb welcomes the jobs, but questioned whether large scale green projects will benefit Wales.

""For me, and the Infrastructure Commission... we're disappointed that ownership of these projects is not being considered,"" he said.

Most projects are owned outside of the country, he said, with only a few developed by the the community energy sector and small companies in Wales.

""We would like to see a renewable energy bill that gave the opportunity for local organisations and people to buy into projects,"" he said.

Sam Kurtz, the Conservatives' economy and energy spokesperson and Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MS, also welcomed the new investment but raised concerns about the implications for oil and gas.

""We need to look at this in the wider context of where energy bills have got to after Labour have come to power, and that promise of cutting £300 off energy bills,"" he said.

""Energy bills are now nearly £200 more expensive in the 12 months since the General Election, so the promise of jobs is welcome, but the alienation of our traditional oil and gas industries as well, is driving up the cost of people's bills.""

The Welsh government welcomed the clean energy jobs, saying they are ""central"" to the its vision for Wales .

A spokesperson said: ""The impact of high energy prices in recent years shows that it is essential for us to improve our energy security and reduce our dependence on imported energy.

""With our abundance of natural resources, Wales is in an ideal position to accelerate our renewable energy contribution and at the same time address climate change challenges.

By Ambali Abdulkabeer

As the largest economy and most populous nation in Africa, Nigeria stands at a critical energy crossroads. For decades, the country has been shackled by a heavy reliance on imported petrol and diesel, a dependency that drains vital foreign exchange, pollutes the environment, and constrains economic growth. In response, the government is championing a strategic pivot towards Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)—a cleaner, cheaper gaseous fuel. This transition represents more than a mere policy shift; it is a vital national imperative with the potential to redefine Nigeria’s energy landscape. However, the path to a CNG-powered future is fraught with challenges that demand urgent and strategic action.

The case for CNG is compelling, anchored in a triad of economic, environmental, and operational benefits. Economically, CNG offers a much-needed respite. With estimates suggesting cost savings of 20-30% compared to petrol and 30-40% compared to diesel, its adoption could significantly reduce the financial strain on both individual households and the national treasury. This is a crucial buffer against the inflationary pressures exacerbated by the removal of the fuel subsidy, putting money back into the pockets of Nigerians and freeing up billions in foreign exchange currently spent on fuel imports.

Environmentally, the shift is a step in the right direction. As a cleaner-burning fuel, CNG produces markedly fewer emissions than its liquid counterparts. The government’s claim that it could mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% points to a tangible opportunity to improve urban air quality and align with global sustainability goals. Furthermore, for vehicle owners, CNG offers practical advantages: it leads to less engine wear and tear, reduces maintenance costs, and extends engine life, presenting a more efficient and reliable alternative for the transportation sector.

Initiatives like the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas Initiative (PCNGi) and partnerships with private firms to develop infrastructure and financing for vehicle conversions signal a welcome commitment. Yet, despite this political will and the evident benefits, the widespread adoption of CNG faces formidable barriers.

The most immediate obstacle is the stark lack of infrastructure. Nigeria currently has only a handful of CNG refueling stations, concentrated largely in urban centers. This sparse and uneven distribution creates a “chicken and egg” dilemma: consumers are hesitant to convert their vehicles without a reliable network of stations, and investors are reluctant to build stations without a critical mass of CNG vehicles. This infrastructure gap effectively sidelines a vast portion of the population, particularly those in rural areas, from the transition.

Compounding this is the prohibitive upfront cost of conversion. With prices ranging from N300,000 to N600,000 per vehicle, switching to CNG remains a distant dream for the average Nigerian. Without substantial financial incentives, this barrier will keep CNG as a luxury for the few rather than a viable option for the many. This challenge underscores a fundamental truth: possessing substantial natural gas reserves is not enough; it requires intentional investment and sound policy to translate this resource into tangible economic relief.

Furthermore, a significant information deficit and lingering safety concerns threaten to derail public acceptance. Many Nigerians are simply unaware of CNG’s benefits or are skeptical due to a lack of targeted education. This skepticism is often compounded by legitimate fears about safety, given CNG’s flammability. Recent CNG-related accidents have heightened these concerns, highlighting the non-negotiable need for stringent safety protocols, certified technicians, and public awareness campaigns to build trust in the technology.

For Nigeria’s CNG revolution to move from policy paper to palpable reality, a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach is essential. The government must take the lead by deepening investment in core infrastructure. This means accelerating the rollout of refueling stations along major highways and in urban centers, while incentivizing private sector participation to ensure nationwide coverage.

Simultaneously, making conversion affordable is paramount. The government should introduce a robust package of incentives, including tax breaks, subsidies, and low-interest loans, to bring the cost of conversion within reach of the average motorist and commercial transport operators.

Finally, building public trust through education and safety enforcement is critical. A sustained nationwide awareness campaign is needed to clearly articulate the economic and environmental advantages of CNG. This must be coupled with the strict enforcement of safety standards for kits, installations, and refueling stations, ensuring that the transition is not only popular but also safe.

The journey to a CNG-powered Nigeria is a marathon, not a sprint. It demands more than just political announcements; it requires relentless execution, significant capital investment, and a steadfast commitment to public engagement. By tackling the infrastructure deficit, alleviating the financial burden on citizens, and prioritizing safety and awareness, Nigeria can unlock the immense potential of CNG. Success in this endeavor would mean more than just cheaper fuel; it would signal a decisive break from a burdensome past, fueling a more sustainable, self-reliant, and prosperous future for all Nigerians.

How much has renewable energy grown, and why?","Does anyone still remember the Cheney energy report? Early in the George W. Bush administration a task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney released a big report offering recommendations for energy policy. There was a lot of controversy at the time — you might even call it a scandal — over Cheney’s secretiveness, his refusal to reveal how much role corporate interests played in writing the report, whose conclusions might be summarized as “drill, baby, drill.”

Those were innocent days. These days we have much bigger scandals multiple times a week.

But politics aside, what’s notable about that 2001 report, put together by men who regarded themselves as hard-headed realists, is that it envisaged an energy future reliant almost entirely on fossil fuels plus a bit of nuclear energy. The report grudgingly admitted that technological progress had reduced the costs of renewable energy, but still saw solar and wind as trivial for our energy future:

By 2020, non-hydropower renewable energy is expected to account for 2.8 percent of total electricity generation.

Here’s what actually happened:

Today’s primer will be devoted to the rise of renewable energy. This is, of course, a deeply politicized subject: Donald Trump and his officials hate, just hate wind and solar power, and there are many people who still refuse to believe that renewables can be practical even as renewables keep growing around the world, in fact accounting for the bulk of growth in electricity generation. But I’ll leave detailed discussion of where those attitudes come from for the next primer.

For today I want, instead, to focus on the economics of renewable energy. How did energy sources that a generation ago were widely dismissed as hippie fantasies become a major source of electricity? What are these sources’ future prospects, and how will their growth be affected by policy?

Beyond the paywall I’ll address the following:

1. How much has renewable energy grown, and why?

2. Why did the cost of renewables fall so much, so fast?

3. What role has policy played in the rise of renewables?

Today’s primer is intended as the first part of a two-part series. Next week I’ll ask, among other things, why there’s still so much U.S. political opposition to green energy; whether that opposition can stall the energy transition in America, and how this will affect geopolitics as China races ahead. I’ll also need to talk about whether renewables are driving up electricity prices and how we will (or won’t) cope with the extraordinary energy demands of generative AI; and more.

Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.
The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown.
“I will not support a shutdown deal that strips healthcare from tens of thousands of my constituents,” she said.","Twenty-two days into the government shutdown, California Rep. Kevin Kiley spent an hour of his morning in Washington guiding a group of middle school students from Grass Valley through the empty corridors of the U.S. Capitol.

Normally, one of his staff members would have led the tour. But the Capitol is closed to all tours during the shutdown, unless the elected member is present. So the schoolchildren from Lyman Gilmore Middle School ended up with Kiley, a Republican from Rocklin, as their personal tour guide.

“I would have visited with these kids anyway,” Kiley said in his office after the event. “But I actually got to go on the whole tour of the Capitol with them as well.”

Kiley’s impromptu tour is an example of how members of California’s congressional delegation are improvising their routines as the shutdown drags on and most of Washington remains at a standstill.

Some are in Washington in case negotiations resume, others are back at home in their districts meeting with federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay, giving interviews or visiting community health centers that rely on tax credits central to the budget negotiations. One member attended the groundbreaking of a flood control project in their district. Others are traveling back and forth.

“I’ve had to fly back to Washington for caucus meetings, while the opposition, the Republicans, don’t even convene and meet,” Rep. Maxine Waters, a longtime Los Angeles Democrat, said in an interview. “We will meet anytime, anyplace, anywhere, with [House Speaker Mike] Johnson, with the president, with the Senate, to do everything that we can to open up the government. We are absolutely unified on that.”

The shutdown is being felt across California, which has the most federal workers outside the District of Columbia. Food assistance benefits for millions of low-income Californians could soon be delayed. And millions of Californians could see their healthcare premiums rise sharply if Affordable Care Act subsidies are allowed to expire.

For the California delegation, the fallout at home has become impossible to ignore. Yet the shutdown is in its fourth week with no end in sight.

In the House, Johnson has refused to call members back into session and prevented them from doing legislative work. Many California lawmakers — including Kiley, one of the few GOP lawmakers to openly criticize him — have been dismayed by the deadlock.

“I have certainly emphasized the point that the House needs to be in session, and that canceling a month’s worth of session is not a good thing for the House or the country,” Kiley said, noting that he had privately met with Johnson.

Kiley, who represented parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe, is facing political uncertainty as California voters weigh whether to approve Proposition 50 on Nov. 4. The measure would redraw the state’s congressional districts to better favor Democrats, leaving Kiley at risk, even though the Republican says he believes he could still win if his right-leaning district is redrawn.

The Senate has been more active, holding a series of votes on the floor and congressional hearings with Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The chamber, however, has been unable to reach a deal to reopen the government. On Thursday, the 23rd day of the shutdown, the Senate failed to advance competing measures that would have paid federal employees who have been working without compensation.

The Republicans’ plan would have paid active-duty members of the military and some federal workers during the shutdown. Democrats backed a bill that would have paid all federal workers and barred the Trump administration from laying off any more federal employees.

“California has one of the largest federal workforces in the country, and no federal worker or service member should miss their paychecks because Donald Trump and Republicans refused to come to the table to protect Americans’ health care,” Sen. Alex Padilla said in a statement.

Working conditions get harder

The strain on federal employees — including those who work for California’s 54 delegation members — are starting to become more apparent.

Dozens of them have been working full time without pay. Their jobs include answering phone calls and requests from constituents, setting the schedules for elected officials, writing policy memos and handling messaging for their offices.

At the end of October, House staffers — who are paid on a monthly basis — are expected to miss their first paycheck.

Some have been quietly told to consider borrowing money from the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union, which is offering a “government shutdown relief loan program” that includes a no-interest loan of up to $5,000 to be repaid in full after 90 days.

The mundane has also been disrupted. Some of the cafeterias and coffee carts that are usually open to staffers are closed. The lines to enter office buildings are long because fewer entrances are open.

The hallways leading to the offices of California’s elected officials are quiet, except for the faint sound of occasional elevator dings. Many of their doors are adorned with signs that show who they blame for the government shutdown.

“Trump and Republicans shut down the government,” reads a sign posted on the door that leads into Rep. Norma Torres’ (D-Pomona) office. “Our office is OPEN — WORKING for the American people.”

Rep. Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Torrance, posted a similar sign outside his office.

Rep. Vince Fong, a Republican who represents the Central Valley, has been traveling between Washington and his district. Two weeks into the shutdown, he met with veterans from the Central Valley Honor Flight and Kern County Honor Flight to make sure that their planned tour of the Capitol was not disrupted by the shutdown. Like Kiley’s tour with the schoolchildren, an elected member needed to be present for the tour to go on.

“His presence ensured the tour could continue as planned,” Fong’s office said.

During the tour, veterans were able to see Johnson as well, his office said.

Shutdown highlights deep divisions

California’s congressional delegation mirrors the broader stalemate in Washington, where entrenched positions have kept both parties at a negotiation impasse.

Democrats are steadfast in their position that they will not agree to a deal unless Republicans extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits expiring at the end of the year, while Republicans are accusing Democrats of failing to reopen the government for political gain.

Kiley is one of the few Republicans who has called on Johnson to negotiate with Democrats on healthcare. Kiley said he thinks there is a “a lot of room to negotiate” because there is concern on both sides of the aisle if the tax credits expire.

“If people see a massive increase in their premiums ... that’s not a good thing,” he said. “Especially in California, where the cost of living is already so high, and you’re suddenly having to pay a lot more for healthcare.”

Rep. Robert Garcia, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, in a press event Wednesday with five other California Democrats talked about the need to fight for the healthcare credits.

Garcia, of Long Beach, said he recently visited a healthcare center in San Bernardino County that serves seniors with disabilities. He said the cuts would be “devastating” and would prompt the center to close.

“That’s why we are doing everything in our power to negotiate a deal that reopens the federal government and saves healthcare,” he said.

As the shutdown continues, many Democrats are digging their heels on the issue.

At an Oct. 3 event outside of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, for instance, Rep. Laura Friedman held a news conference with nurses and hospital staff and said she would not vote for a bill to reopen the government unless there is a deal on healthcare.

Last week, the Glendale Democrat said her position hasn’t changed.

Tabi says that they are already in “advanced discussions with partners in Southern, Central, and East Africa to identify suitable hydropower reservoirs and inland water bodies for similar floating solar installations.","JOHANNESBURG - Granville Energy, a pan-African renewable-energy company, has signed a US$1.1 billion Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited.

The deal will see Granville Energy develop Africa’s first 1 GW floating solar power plant at Kainji Dam, Nigeria — one of the continent’s largest and most ambitious renewable projects to date.

Under the agreement, Granville Energy will serve as developer and constructor of the project, while Mainstream Energy Solutions will act as the power off-taker, responsible for purchasing and distributing the generated electricity.

The project begins with a 100 MW pilot phase (US$110 million) and will expand to 1 GW, making it the largest floating solar facility in Sub-Saharan Africa and among the biggest globally. It aims to strengthen regional energy security, drive industrialization, and create thousands of jobs through local manufacturing of solar components.

The initiative directly supports Africa’s decarbonization targets and advances the African Union’s Agenda 2063 goals for sustainable, inclusive growth.

Floating solar technology is an alternative method of generating electricity that uses panels installed on infrastructure that is located on bodies of water like dams and reservoirs. It has the benefit of generating clean electricity through the solar panels, while the water beneath them serves to cool them. This helps to improve the efficiency of the solar panels and can even contribute to improving water quality.

Tabi T. Tabi, CEO of Granville Energy, explains why this is agreement is such a game-changer for Africa. “For Africa, this is a game-changer because it makes use of existing water infrastructure like dams and reservoirs, without competing for land that’s needed for agriculture or housing. It’s smart, space-efficient, and perfectly suited to our climate and development needs. It also helps reduce evaporation losses from the dam and improves the long-term sustainability of the water resource — so it’s a win for both energy and the environment.”

Given recent conversations about the scale of Africa's energy sector and how that can serve to improve local economies and generate jobs, Tabi has expressed a commitment to the local manufacturing of solar panels and to strengthening the African continental ecosystem.

According to him, the project represents more than electricity generation, but the opportunity to create jobs, both directly and indirectly. It also represents an opportunity for more African countries to move away from an import-model of the skills and technologies used in the African energy sector.

This is part of his and his company’s vision of a “solar value chain” across Africa. When asked about this vision, Tabi says that “The Kainji project is our blueprint for that vision. By integrating design, manufacturing, construction, and operation all within Africa, we’re proving that the full value chain can exist here. Ultimately, we want to see African countries trading clean-energy components with each other — building regional resilience and reducing dependency on imports.”

The first phase of the project, which is expected to generate up to 100 MW of clean energy, will begin once the agreement is finalised and will be looking at generating energy within the next two years. This will be the pilot phase and will provide the first wave of new jobs, skills, and more reliable energy to the people of West Africa.

Once in place, Granville will be scaling up to 1 GW generation capacity, and each phase will introduce with it a new wave of jobs and skills to the continent.

But this is just the beginning. Tabi says that they are already in “advanced discussions with partners in Southern, Central, and East Africa to identify suitable hydropower reservoirs and inland water bodies for similar floating solar installations. Our goal is to create a network of hybrid solar-hydro systems across the continent — scalable, sustainable, and led by Africans. This isn’t a one-off success story; it’s the start of Africa’s clean-energy industrialisation journey.”

Technology diversification and regional focus The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve.","An influential report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) provides a detailed analysis of the global landscape for sustainable fuels.

The assessment prepared to support COP30 suggests that the utilisation of sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels could quadruple by 2035.

This growth is contingent on the complete implementation of existing and newly announced policies alongside substantial investment and innovation.

According to the IEA's analysis under the leadership of Executive Director Fatih Birol, the IEA is advocating for sustainable fuels to become a critical component of the future global energy mix.

The report examines the necessary pathways to accelerate the production and use of biofuels, biogas and hydrogen-based fuels across key sectors like transport, heavy industry and power generation.

Sustainable fuel production and policy

Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels comprising nearly 80% of this figure.

In 2024, these fuels contributed to a reduction in global oil demand by approximately 2.5 million barrels per day and decreased the reliance on imported transport fuels for some nations by 5-15%.

The report notes that ""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled"".

However, the current trajectory points towards gradual progress rather than the rapid acceleration needed to meet climate targets.

The IEA presents an accelerated case scenario where planned policies are fully legislated, market barriers are dismantled and production capacity is expanded. Under these conditions, sustainable fuel use could nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and increase to 28 exajoules by 2035.

The transport sector would continue to be the main source of demand, making up half of sustainable fuel consumption in 2035.

This would cover 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation and 35% of shipping needs.

The private sector also recognises the importance of government backing.

Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of RegenRate, says: ""We need policy on our side.

""We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality"".

Cost challenges and investment needs

A major hurdle is that sustainable fuels are currently more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts.

For instance, electrolytic hydrogen is about 3.8 times more costly and biomethanol is 3.7 times the price of conventional fuels.

Despite these higher costs, the impact on consumer prices is expected to be modest. A 15% blend of sustainable aviation fuel could raise ticket prices by 5-7% while steel produced with low-emissions hydrogen would add less than 1% to the price of an electric vehicle.

The report stresses that ""policies that address only one dimension risk leaving critical gaps,"" calling for integrated frameworks that combine long-term demand signals and support for new technologies.

To achieve this accelerated deployment, cumulative investments from 2024 to 2035 could reach US$1.5tn. This investment would also fuel job growth, with direct employment projected to almost triple to around two million jobs by 2035.

Liquid and gaseous biofuels would account for two-thirds of this increase. Data shows investment in sustainable fuels grew by 20% between 2023 and 2024, spurred by policies in the United States and Brazil for liquid biofuels and the European Union's REPowerEU Plan for biogas.

Technology diversification and regional focus

The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve. While liquid and gaseous biofuels are expected to retain a two-thirds share in 2035, low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives are projected to grow from just 1% today to one-third of total use.

This change highlights a substantial increase in funding for hydrogen-based solutions.

""With US$1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035 and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping chemicals and beyond,"" explains Antonio Villaluenga, Vice President of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International.

It is important to recognise that investment strategies will differ based on geography and resource availability. The report suggests that ""National shares, mixes and volumes would still vary widely depending on regional conditions"".

The IEA concludes that no single fuel or feedstock can satisfy global demand alone. Instead, a unified effort is required to drive progress across multiple fronts, including expanding established markets, developing new ones and commercialising emerging technologies.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:18:22.475849

Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period.","Connecticut, along with the rest of New England, has long recognized that its energy future lies in cleaning up the electricity sources in its power grid.

And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.

The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?

Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.

“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.

“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.

But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.

DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.

But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.

“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.

Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.

“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said.

Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.

“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“

But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.

“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.

Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.

“We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.

“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.

If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.

But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.

How dead is offshore wind?

Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.

Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.

“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.

“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”

Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.

Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.

“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”

Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.

A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes.

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.

The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.

A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”

“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.

He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.

“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.

“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.

“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.

“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.

Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.

“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.

“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.

The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.

In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.

Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.

Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”

What about solar?

Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.

But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.

Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.

New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.

It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.

“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”

Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.

Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.

It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.

“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.

“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.

Massachusetts is already doing that.

“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.

Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank.

“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”

She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”

DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.

In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.

Solutions

Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions.

“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.

She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”

Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.

“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.

If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.

“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.

Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.

“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.

For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.

“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”

Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway.

“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”

In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.

The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.

But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue.

“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.

Dykes sees the same challenge.

“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”

The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wind-Turbine-Towers.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:02:08.463693

With support from industry giants like Meta, Nucor and Toyota Tsusho America, the company sets out to prove that clean iron can be scaled to meet demand from sectors such as automotive and data centre construction.

A lower-carbon path for data centre steel

As digital infrastructure continues to grow globally, data centres consume ever larger volumes of steel, a material responsible for around 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from coal-fuelled blast furnaces.

Electra proposes a cleaner route. Instead of using heat and coal, the company’s process, known as electrowinning, uses electricity from renewable sources to extract iron from ore.

This electrochemical method operates at a temperature roughly equal to that of a cup of coffee, avoiding the high heat and fossil fuels that drive emissions in conventional steelmaking.

The company plans to open a 130,000-square-foot demonstration plant in Jefferson County, Colorado, by mid-2026.

The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 500 metric tonnes of iron each year. Funding includes US$50m from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, US$186m in private investment and an US$8m tax credit through the Colorado Energy Office.

“We started Electra to fundamentally reinvent the way the world makes iron and tackle one of the biggest sources of industrial emissions, but we’ve always known we could not do it alone,” says Sandeep Nijhawan, Co-Founder and CEO of Electra.

Toyota Tsusho America, a trading company connected to the Toyota Group, will distribute the clean iron to steelmakers serving the automotive industry. Germany’s Interfer Edelstahl Group plans to use it in its speciality steel manufacturing.

Meta, meanwhile, approaches the partnership differently. Rather than buying the iron directly, the technology firm signs an agreement to acquire environmental attribute certificates from Electra. These certificates allow Meta to account for the emissions reductions from clean iron production in its sustainability reporting.

“Meta is excited to partner with Electra to drive the development of low-carbon iron and steel – essential materials for building data centres – manufactured right here in the US,” writes Devon Lake, Head of Net Zero Strategy at Meta.

This ability to use lower-quality ores that are typically uneconomical adds flexibility to the supply chain. It also enables the process to align with renewable energy availability, making it suitable for companies like Meta that operate on intermittent clean power.

Electra sources 100% of its electricity from renewable energy for its Boulder pilot facilities and plans to do the same for the new Jefferson County plant.

Founded in 2020 by Sandeep Nijhawan and Quoc Pham, Electra already runs two pilot sites and is now looking for a location for its first commercial-scale manufacturing plant, which it aims to bring online by 2029.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/247299b0eb8460ed7690c037395679b6:33b4c084c7fceaf657aa0c1ef39dc399/electra-electroplating-two-men-in-factory.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:18:26.024938

That happens because this data is being transmitted through and from data centers.” Cloud computing took off, driving the demand for more expansive data centers.
That brings us to today, which analysts say is still the early stages of AI data center development.
Virginia’s transformation into the data center capital of the world could be regarded as a business success story when measured by the dollars invested.","ASHBURN, Va.—Driving up the six-lane Route 28 in Loudoun County, Virginia, there’s a dark blue one on the left. Further up the way in a small clearing of trees, there’s a gray one on the right. Across the landscape, metal cables criss-cross in every direction to connect power to the sprawling buildings.

They’re not big-box stores like Ikea or Target. They’re bigger. They’re data centers that house the computers processing the internet and artificial intelligence. And they’re all over these suburban counties outside of Washington, D.C.

Virginia, especially Northern Virginia, leads the world in development, far outpacing other top markets such as Beijing.

So how did it happen that this region came to dominate data centers, an industry whose growth now fuels debates about electricity bills, climate change and the role of technology in our lives? The answer is a combination of government support, the presence of infrastructure used by internet pioneers such as America Online, cheap electricity and the availability of land.

“There was all that land next to Dulles airport that was unused, and so it was cheap, available and large enough, and getting a major internet connection was easy,” said Shane Greenstein, a professor at Harvard Business School who has written about the economic geography of data centers.

Considering those factors, it’s “really not a surprise” that Virginia took the lead and maintained it, he said.

Now, with the rise of AI, the size of some recent and planned data centers exceeds even what could have been imagined a few years ago. The region and the state remain attractive locations for many of the same reasons that explained previous growth, but this is a new era in which rapid development is happening across the country.

For example, Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix have emerged as data center boom towns, although Virginia’s current infrastructure and slate of future projects are deep enough that no city or region will overtake it any time soon.

The state had 6,247 megawatts of data centers and 2,610 megawatts under construction as of June, according to a report from the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. Together, those 8,857 megawatts are nearly triple the operating and under-construction capacity of the next market, Columbus.

But the most striking figure for Virginia in the report is the 24,103 megawatts for planned data center capacity.

No market in the world comes anywhere close to this.

Behind those big numbers is a small one. Data centers don’t need many employees, and they had just 12,140 operational jobs in Virginia in 2023, according to figures from the Northern Virginia Technology Council, a trade group. For context, that’s slightly less than the number of school bus drivers in the state that year. If we zoom out to include all jobs that have direct or indirect ties to data centers in the state, the number rose to 78,140, including operations, construction and other roles.

Environmental advocates have argued that the costs of this development far exceed the benefits. The downsides are local, including vanishing farmland, and national, with electricity demand rising at a pace that is incompatible with the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Chris Miller, president of the Piedmont Environmental Council, points to a 2.2-million-square-foot proposal that would’ve needed 800 megawatts in Remington, Virginia, a rural town of about 600 people located just south of Loudoun County. The developers withdrew their pitch and expect to submit plans for a smaller data center less than half that size. But the initial proposal would’ve gobbled up nearly as much power as a rural state.

“There’s a lot of ways you can produce a gigawatt but at the end of the day, the impacts start to add up because of the scale of the amount of power that is,” Miller said. “The only way I can help people wrap their heads around how big it is, is that’s almost the entire peak load of the state of Vermont.”

Paving the Information Super Highway

The scale of this industry, measured in dollars, acres and gigawatts, has grown at a staggering pace. It’s unrecognizable when compared to its early days.

Virginia was well-positioned to be a hub for the early internet because of its proximity to the federal government in Washington, D.C., and the research institution now known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the 1960s, the agency led a project to develop ARPANET, a computer network that was a building block for the internet.

Various businesses with ties to the early internet were located in the D.C. area, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that one of them, America Online, broke through to become a giant. The company was based in Fairfax County and then moved a short distance to Loudoun County in 1996, helping to transform a mostly rural area.

A 1997 Time magazine cover demonstrates the prominence of America Online, with its chairman, Steve Case, smirking in a photo illustration with data cables attached to his body. The cover line was: “AOL’s Big Coup,” about the company’s recent purchase of CompuServe and its attempts to fend off competition from Microsoft.

America Online’s presence in Loudoun County attracted other internet businesses and contributed to investment in fiber-optic cables, enabling the easy movement of data.

In 1998, a start-up called Equinix built a data center in Northern Virginia to serve America Online and other companies. It was a novel concept, a building that would store data for other companies. The facility was likely the region’s first data center and Equinix remains a major player in its industry.

Following the dot-com bust in 2000 and the rise of internet activity, like shopping from a couch, Loudoun County began marketing vacant buildings, including some vacated because of the decline of America Online. The buyers included some of the first-generation internet giants, such as Amazon, which opened its first data center in the region in 2006.

Much of this activity was to support cloud computing.

“The world’s changed,” said Buddy Rizer, a Loudoun County economic development official, in a video posted in 2012. “Everyone wants whatever information they have right now from wherever they are and the only way you can do that is to store it in the cloud. Cloud computing is one of those terms that everybody seems so excited by or mystified by. It’s really pretty simple: All of your information is available to you anywhere, at any time. That happens because this data is being transmitted through and from data centers.”

Cloud computing took off, driving the demand for more expansive data centers.

Dominion Energy, Virginia’s biggest electric utility, played a role in attracting this new development by offering competitive electricity prices to big power users, which were lower than those in many competing markets.

In 2008, Virginia lawmakers approved legislation that established the state’s sales and use tax exemption on certain data center equipment. Companies that invested at least $75 million in a locality with an unemployment rate above 4.9 percent were eligible. This provided a financial incentive for companies to invest in the state and was one of several state and local government actions that helped to accelerate development.

Two years later, Microsoft announced a $500 million center in the bill’s sponsor district in Southside near the North Carolina border.

The projects that followed required more space than before, reflecting the rising demand for cloud computing and other data storage. Amazon, Facebook and Google spent billions of dollars to build data centers in Northern Virginia and elsewhere in the state.

Amazon’s investment was notable for its level of commitment, including an announcement in 2018 that it would spend $2.5 billion on a second headquarters in Arlington, a Northern Virginia city, to go along with its main headquarters in Seattle. The company followed it up with $35 billion in spending for data centers across the state.

The trend had become clear, with these gigantic boxes visible from main roads.

Regulatory filings show how this industry grew into a gigantic electricity consumer. In 29024, Virginia data centers served by Dominion had demand of 3,583 megawatts, which is nearly seven times more than in 2013.

The utility has said that data centers are the main reason it is projecting a drastic increase in demand to serve all of its Virginia customers, rising from 17,300 megawatts last year to 26,600 megawatts by 2039.

The scale of this growth is largely because of the emergence in the early 2020s of a new kind of data center that runs the computer models for artificial intelligence. Most new AI data centers are larger than those used for cloud computing and require much more electricity.

That brings us to today, which analysts say is still the early stages of AI data center development. The factors that helped Virginia secure its initial foothold have contributed to forecasts of its sustained momentum.

Was This Worth It?

Virginia’s transformation into the data center capital of the world could be regarded as a business success story when measured by the dollars invested.

Loudoun County officials point to data centers providing $1 billion in annual local tax revenue, funding about one-third of the county’s budget. Elected leaders have lowered the residential tax rate by 48 cents per $100 since 2012, saving the average Loudoun homeowner $3,000 to $4,000 per year.

But the state has reached a point where it’s a mainstream viewpoint to question whether the benefits of this development boom are enough to justify the costs of lost land, increased water consumption for cooling, rising carbon emissions, worsening climate disasters and the potential for surging electricity bills.

“The world’s largest data center market is facing increasing pushback from multiple directions,” according to the development report from Cushman & Wakefield.

Some of the most intense resistance is in Loudoun County, which has taken steps to increase regulatory scrutiny of new projects and give the public more opportunities to voice concerns about proposals. Development has become a campaign issue in local elections.

“People are overwhelmingly unhappy” about the pace of development and changes to the landscape, said Nan McCarry, who was born and raised in Loudoun County. She is now a volunteer for conservation organizations.

She remembers Ashburn as a tiny village when she was a child in the 1960s and has watched it transform into a magnet for property developers because of its proximity to Washington. She lives in western Loudoun County, which retains much of its rural charm, but also views the area as threatened by the encroachment of home construction and data centers.

One of the most ardent critics of the data center boom has been the Piedmont Environmental Council, an advocacy group for Virginia’s Piedmont region, which runs down the center of the state and includes Loudoun County.

Miller, the council’s president, acknowledges that data centers have helped the region in some ways.

“Loudoun County has benefited dramatically, no question,” he said. “What they’ve been able to do is pay for a lot of schools, and a lot of public services,” Miller said.

But he thinks the downsides could outweigh the benefits, especially when planning for continued development.

The downsides include increased electricity rates. Virginia’s utility regulator, the State Corporation Commission, is reviewing Dominion’s request to increase the typical household bill by about $21 per month by 2027 because of grid upgrades, inflation and supply chain issues, a 15 percent increase.

To meet this demand, Dominion is proposing a substantial ramp-up in power plant construction with solar and natural gas as its primary energy sources.

Another concern is damage to ecosystems and the rapid loss of rural land.

The state’s Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission, a policy research arm of the legislature, studied the economic and environmental impacts of data centers. The report suggested that the industry could cause energy demands in Virginia to triple, while adding “74,000 jobs, $5.5 billion in labor income, and $9.1 billion in GDP to Virginia’s economy annually.”

But it stopped short of a forecast of land and water needs and potential air-quality impacts, Miller noted.

“We’re very worried,” Miller said of the lack of information about potential adverse effects. “It’s not that we can’t do a better job. It’s that we’re not even taking the first steps in that direction. … What I often say is, you gotta own the fact that you’re really having a transformational impact. Let’s do a full cost evaluation and make sure that the net benefit is what you think it is.”

The dilemma for Virginia is that becoming the data center capital of the world has come with inevitable consequences, such as environmental impacts, and still-undefined risks, including questions about whether these big boxes along the road make business sense.

The concentration of data centers resurfaced as a concern last week when Amazon Web Services outages disrupted services for a number of companies across the internet. The issue stemmed from Amazon’s data centers in its “US-EAST-1” zone, based in Northern Virginia.

“We urgently need diversification in cloud computing,” Corinne Cath-Speth, head of digital for Article 19, a free speech advocacy group, said in a statement.

Greenstein, the Harvard professor, said any discussion of the pluses and minuses of data centers needs to acknowledge that they are essentially self-operating. So while Virginia may be the national leader in data centers, the number of jobs is small compared to the enormity of land use and power use.

“My standing joke about data centers is they’re a very big building with a very small parking lot,” he said. “They just don’t employ a lot of people relative to their scale of size.”

So data centers can fill the landscape without having nearly as significant an effect on the number of customers at local restaurants or other benefits that usually come with business investment.

Greenstein also has questions about the viability of the gigantic new data centers cropping up around the country. This aligns with broader concerns among analysts about whether there is an AI investment bubble in which companies will be unable to make enough money to justify their costs and that current technologies may have short shelf lives.

“In 10 years, will we look back on this as foolish, because the output from these things arguably have limited lifespans?” Greenstein asked.

From lobbying Congress for liability protection to suing states over their climate liability laws and lawsuits, attempts to shield Big Oil from potential liability and to shut down climate accountability initiatives are advancing on multiple fronts.

“The effort has escalated dramatically in the past six or seven months,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, an organization that advocates for holding fossil fuel companies accountable for selling products they knew were dangerously warming the planet.

Pushback to liability initiatives from fossil fuel interests is not new. But the political landscape has shifted dramatically this year as the second Trump administration works to reward loyalists and campaign donors, including fossil fuel interests.

The oil and gas industry spent $445 million during the last election cycle to influence President Donald Trump and Congress, including $96 million on Trump’s re-election campaign, according to the progressive advocacy group Climate Power.

“What has changed is that there is a new administration,” said Lisa Graves, founder and executive director of True North Research, a national investigative watchdog group. And the Trump administration, she said, “is continuing to defend the fossil fuel industry and assail anyone who dares try to hold them accountable.”

Over the past eight years, communities across the country have filed tobacco-style lawsuits targeting ExxonMobil and major players in the fossil fuel industry, seeking to recover damages for localized climate impacts or to force companies to cease greenwashing and other misleading behavior.

More than 30 of these lawsuits brought by municipal, tribal and state governments are working their way through the courts, and several are now closer than ever to reaching trial.

At the same time, some states are enacting or considering so-called climate superfund legislation that would hold large fossil fuel companies strictly liable for climate damages and require them to help pay for a portion of climate change costs incurred by state governments. Vermont and New York both passed climate superfund laws last year, and similar legislation is pending in a handful of other states.

In response to these budding accountability efforts, the fossil fuel industry, the Trump administration, Republicans in Congress and GOP attorneys general are mounting what Wiles describes as a “massive orchestrated campaign” to try to stop climate liability laws and lawsuits in their tracks, and to push for legal immunity akin to what gun manufacturers received two decades ago. Trump’s Department of Justice has even filed highly unusual, if not unprecedented, lawsuits against Vermont and New York seeking to overturn their climate superfund statutes.

“It’s just this superbly choreographed effort on the part of the oil industry and its allies to get gun-industry-style legal immunity for all the damage that they’ve caused,” Wiles told Inside Climate News.

Oil Industry Is Lobbying Congress for a Liability Shield

Among the climate liability lawsuits inching closer to trial: a consumer protection case brought by Massachusetts against ExxonMobil, and suits seeking damages filed by Honolulu, Hawaii, and Boulder, Colorado.

As reported by The Wall Street Journal earlier this year and confirmed by The New York Times last month, industry representatives are lobbying Congress for a liability shield of some kind.

The details remain unclear. But the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, reports lobbying on “draft legislation related to state efforts to impose liability on the oil and gas industry,” while disclosures from ConocoPhillips show that the company has lobbied on the matter of “state superfund legislation,” including draft legislation in Congress addressing it.

Neither API nor ConocoPhillips responded to requests for comment.

Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor of law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told Inside Climate News that he thinks immunity provisions for the fossil fuel industry are unlikely to pass the Senate.

But the fact that the fossil fuel industry is lobbying for legal protections suggests to Wiles that the industry realizes it could be facing serious legal jeopardy. “Let’s be clear. You don’t seek a [liability] waiver unless you know you’re guilty,” Wiles said.

Over the summer, language emerged in a draft House Appropriations Committee spending bill that specifically would prohibit the District of Columbia from using funds to enforce its consumer protection law “against oil and gas companies for environmental claims.” The bill that included this provision passed the committee but was not brought to the full House for a vote.

But climate accountability advocates say the provision was still alarming because it effectively would have shut down D.C.’s ongoing consumer protection lawsuit against Big Oil. That suit, filed in 2020, alleges that several major oil companies lied to consumers about the climate risks of their products and that they continue to mislead consumers through greenwashing campaigns. In April the D.C. Superior Court rejected the companies’ motions to dismiss the suit.

Anne Havemann, deputy director and general counsel at Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the appropriations provision “is a threat to this ongoing lawsuit.”

“If [D.C.] can’t use any money to prosecute these cases and advance these cases, then it effectively can’t work on them,” she said.

Big Oil Lawyers Seek Supreme Court Intervention

A parallel effort to skirt accountability is playing out in the courts. Fossil fuel companies are vigorously defending themselves in climate liability lawsuits, and they have seen some success in recent months getting cases dismissed by state trial courts.

Now Boulder’s lawsuit is back before the nation’s highest court on a fresh petition from the oil company defendants, after Colorado courts, including the state Supreme Court, refused to dismiss the case. The question posed by the companies in their petition is whether federal law precludes such state law claims.

It is unclear whether the Supreme Court will take up the case this time.

In January the Supreme Court denied a similar petition from oil companies in a case brought by Honolulu. Courts in Hawaii have rejected the companies’ bids to have the case dismissed, and with the Supreme Court declining to intervene, Honolulu’s case is advancing toward a trial.

Parenteau said the prospect of facing a trial and a potential adverse verdict likely has the oil companies extremely worried. “They’re certainly frightened of a trial just from a reputational standpoint,” he said.

The new petition in the Boulder case now offers the Supreme Court another opportunity to step in. Should the justices decide to intervene, legal experts say that it could essentially shut down all climate liability attempts.

“If they do step in, that’s huge. That changes everything,” Parenteau said. “That is the end game.”

“In one fell swoop it could get rid of all of these cases,” said James May, a law professor at Washburn University.

On Oct. 9, over 100 Republican House members submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court backing oil companies ExxonMobil and Suncor in their petition to block Boulder’s lawsuit from moving forward. It is the first time that Republicans in Congress have called on the Supreme Court to intervene in this litigation and to shut down not just this one lawsuit but all others like it.

“In recent years, multiple state and local governments have launched a courtroom war against the American energy industry,” the brief asserts in its opening. “It must stop now.”

The 103 Republican House members who signed onto the brief argue that the municipal and state lawsuits against oil and gas companies are trying to “dictate national energy policy” and that only the federal government has the authority to regulate transboundary greenhouse gas emissions.

“They are arguing that it’s solely EPA’s role to regulate greenhouse gases, but the Trump administration is attempting to eliminate that role by revoking the Endangerment Finding. If that revocation goes through and survives in the courts, it will greatly weaken the oil companies’ preemption defense,” Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told Inside Climate News.

“This full-court press to block these lawsuits shows that the oil companies and their allies in Congress are really nervous about what would come out if any of these cases actually went to trial,” Gerrard added.

Trump Administration on the Offensive

The Trump administration, through its Department of Justice, is fully backing the fossil fuel industry in climate liability litigation, filing amicus briefs, for example, in cases now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court and the Maryland Supreme Court.

But its efforts to shield the industry from accountability extend beyond friend-of-the-court briefs.

Following a White House meeting where oil company executives raised concerns about state climate laws and lawsuits, Trump issued an executive order in April directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to try to put a stop to these legal initiatives.

In response, the DOJ then sued four states, including preemptive suits brought against Hawaii and Michigan before either state had filed such a lawsuit (Hawaii sued major oil companies the next day). The DOJ’s other lawsuits targeted Vermont and New York to try to strike down their climate superfund laws, which are based on the “polluter pays” logic of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program aimed at forcing polluting companies to remediate damage from toxic waste sites.

Advances in a field known as climate attribution science have made the “polluter pays” aspect of the superfund laws possible, enabling scientists to quantify the individual contributions of major fossil fuel producers to climate impacts such as sea level rise and heat waves.

The DOJ has now filed motions for summary judgment in both of these lawsuits, asking federal courts to permanently block the states’ climate superfund laws.

“Vermont’s flagrantly unconstitutional statute threatens to throttle energy production, despite this Administration’s efforts to unleash American energy. It’s high time for the courts to put a stop to this crippling state overreach,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement issued by the DOJ on Sept. 16.

Havemann, with the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, told Inside Climate News that the current Trump administration seems to be taking a more aggressive approach to protecting the fossil fuel industry and to fighting attempts to hold it accountable.

“The Trump administration has come in and used many different tools in its toolbox to go after these accountability lawsuits and the laws that also seek to hold the biggest polluters accountable for climate damages,” she said. “It’s very much on the radar of the Trump administration in a way that it has not been in the past.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“Enter the Dragon”

With U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) holding the gavel, climate litigation came up as the subject of a Republican-led congressional hearing this summer before a Judiciary Committee subcommittee.

The hearing’s provocative title: “Enter the Dragon—China and the Left’s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance.”

Cruz used the hearing to attack climate liability lawsuits and claim that they are a nefarious left-wing plot that is in part funded by, and that benefits, the Chinese Communist Party. “Both China and the Democrats want to bankrupt the American energy industry,” Cruz said during the hearing.

NPR’s Michael Copley reported last month that “Cruz’s office has not offered evidence that China or a China-linked nonprofit that Cruz identified by name has funded climate lawsuits in the United States.”

In response to that reporting, Cruz told Inside Climate News that “NPR deliberately ignored objective facts.”

“The Chinese Communist Party uses cut-outs and ‘nonprofits’ to shape U.S. energy policy, funding propaganda, advocacy, and litigation that harm American workers,” Cruz said in an emailed statement, which was also included in the NPR story after it was published. The “China-linked nonprofit” referenced in the NPR story, Energy Foundation China, does fund some climate initiatives, Cruz said in his statement.

“In January 2024, three House committee chairs opened an investigation into Chinese influence, citing EFC’s ties and funding of groups like [the Natural Resources Defense Council] and RMI,” he added.

A spokesperson for RMI, a nonprofit group working on the global energy transition, said that the organization “does not participate in litigation.” RMI’s “work supported by Energy Foundation China, which is a U.S. based charitable organization, is focused squarely on the energy transition inside of China,” the spokesperson added.

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a nonprofit group that works to protect public health and the environment, does some “work in China for one reason: there’s not a single global environmental problem that can be fixed unless China is part of the solution,” NRDC spokesperson Josh Mogerman said. He added that the organization “does not fundraise in China” and that “money from China does not fund NRDC litigation in the United States, period.”

Cruz, who represents the country’s biggest oil and gas producing state, did not respond to Inside Climate News’ question about whether he supports immunizing oil companies from liability.

GOP Attorneys General Enter the Fray

During the Cruz-led hearing, the Republican attorney general for the state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, testified as one of the majority witnesses. He referenced the New York and Vermont climate superfund laws, claiming these statutes impose extraterritorial regulation on energy companies, and mentioned that his state and other Republican-led states are suing to try to overturn these state laws.

“We will continue these fights in court as state attorneys general. But we do need some help from Congress,” Kobach said. He suggested that Congress could legislate to expressly preempt state climate laws like the climate superfund laws.

Kobach and 15 other Republican state attorneys general also made this suggestion, along with several other recommendations for congressional action, in a letter addressed to Bondi, the U.S. attorney general.

The June 12 letter references Trump’s executive orders to “unleash” fossil fuels and protect the fossil fuel industry from “state overreach.” The letter says its purpose is to “suggest additional steps” the Department of Justice could take to effectuate these orders and assist in the “fight against anti-energy interests.”

Specifically, the Republican AGs suggest the DOJ could recommend legislation to reinforce federal preemption of state climate liability laws or lawsuits; restrict federal funding for states seeking to impose liability on energy companies; create a right of removal to federal district court for climate suits; and, among other items, stop “activist-funded climate lawsuits” with a liability shield, similar to the law that granted immunity for gun manufacturers.

Wiles, with the Center for Climate Integrity, said it is especially striking to see Republican attorneys general explicitly recommend a similar liability shield for fossil fuel companies. “The attorneys general actually called for Congress to enact a gun-style liability waiver for the oil industry,” he said. “We saw how that [gun industry immunity] ended up. It certainly was not helpful in curbing gun violence or in serving any public interest objective.”

The coordinated litigation strategies and actions of Republican state attorneys general in defense of fossil fuel and other industries stem from an organization called the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), which Graves said was created in the wake of the tobacco industry being held accountable through the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement.

The organization, which currently lists 29 Republican state attorneys general as members, has been funded through donations from conservative judicial activists like Leonard Leo as well as from corporate interests including those in the fossil fuel industry. The American Petroleum Institute gave over $125,000 to RAGA in 2024, and in the first six months of this year Chevron’s Policy, Government and Public Affairs division donated $25,000 to the organization, for example.

Graves describes RAGA as a “pay-to-play organization.”

“It has a pay sheet listing what kind of access you get to attorneys general based on how much you give,” she told Inside Climate News.

“These attorneys general use the prestige of their office and their power and the resources that their taxpayers are providing to serve the interests of industry, select industries that they are most tied to, and that certainly includes the fossil fuel industry,” Graves added.

The Republican Attorneys General Association did not respond to a request for comment.

“A Perilous Moment”

The intensifying backlash to climate accountability efforts coming from the fossil fuel industry and its political defenders is happening at a time when some political scholars warn that the U.S. is sliding into some form of authoritarianism, which advocates say magnifies the challenges of holding powerful interests to account writ large.

“It’s a perilous moment for democratic norms and institutions,” said Kathy Mulvey, accountability campaign director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Anybody who is pursuing policy change or litigation for accountability or enforcement is counting on the courts to be a real backstop for democratic institutions,” Mulvey told Inside Climate News.

Should the fossil fuel industry somehow succeed in securing legal immunity, Wiles said it “would be consistent with the erosion of the rule of law that we’re seeing.”

“No industry should be above the law,” he added.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2164018073-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:02:12.897756

GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is right to call out the political establishment for closing plants and blocking new ones. Regardless of who wins the state’s governor election, the issue of rising energy costs won’t disappear — and this problem is not confined to the Garden State either.

BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUILD THE AI BOOM

California offers an even clearer cautionary tale. State leaders waged war on traditional energy, shutting down nuclear plants, choking off natural gas projects, and driving out refineries with red tape. The result? Californians now pay the second-highest electricity rates in the nation, just behind Hawaii — a direct consequence of letting ideology trump common sense.

These decisions have failed ratepayers. Everyone knows power demand is growing faster than supply. Forty years ago, households mainly powered lights, TVs, and refrigerators. Today, that same grid must handle smartphones, laptops, routers, security systems, electric cars, and a flood of AI-driven data centers that will multiply electricity demand exponentially. Yet, our leaders have allowed coal plants to close, nuclear facilities to be dismantled, and new pipelines to be blocked — even as the country’s appetite for power explodes.

The Southeast, however, has made better decisions. Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, Louisiana, and Alabama are proving that reliable, affordable, and abundant energy is still possible in America.

Mississippi has just broken ground on the Delta Blues Advanced Power Station — the state’s first new natural gas plant in 50 years — set to become operational in 2028. Gov. Tate Reeves (R-MS) is also charting the course toward the next generation of nuclear power because he understands that nuclear power is among the safest and most efficient sources of power in the world.

Florida, which has four commercial reactors in operation today, is building new gas-fired generation and looking ahead to small modular reactors to accommodate its increased population base and business. Georgia has gone a step further by adding a new nuclear unit in the past year — the first in a generation — and will do it again. That’s leadership.

This forward-looking approach is already paying dividends. By ensuring reliable power, Southeastern states are attracting new manufacturing, data centers, and high-tech investment that blue states can only dream of securing. A single hyperscale data center can generate hundreds of millions in annual economic activity and support thousands of local jobs. Georgia’s own study found that one new facility alone would generate $431 million in yearly output and nearly 2,000 jobs. It’s no wonder AVAIO Digital, a data center developer, just announced a $6 billion data center investment in Mississippi — because the state can actually power it.

These massive new industries need consistent baseload power that renewable energy alone can’t yet provide. They need real, dependable energy. To do so, they need to save current power plants, constructing new natural gas infrastructure, hastening new nuclear projects, and investing in a robust transmission network. States that act decisively to build capacity will win the jobs, the investment, and the future. Those that don’t will face decreased reliability and economic decline.

ENERGY ABUNDANCE, NOT NET ZERO, WILL LOWER ELECTRICITY PRICES

New Jersey and California show what happens when states ignore capacity constraints, while Mississippi and Georgia demonstrate the benefits of planning ahead. States that expand their generation capacity will attract investment, while states that block new projects will continue to see rising costs and slower growth.

Nevertheless, thanks to conservative leadership in the Southeast, America still has a region ready to power its future and remind the rest of the country what real energy leadership looks like. Now it’s time for the rest of the country to follow suit.

In a special meeting during the summit, 37 mountain town leaders signed a joint statement committing to working together to reduce emissions, transition to clean energy, and protect their communities’ natural environments that are on the front lines of climate change.
The joint statement emphasizes speed as a critical piece of climate action in order to combat the growing risks.
By sharing strategies, expertise, and data, the 37 leaders who signed the statement aim to ensure every community has the resources they need.
According to Berman, solving climate issues boils down to electrifying everything and ensuring that power comes from clean energy.","The Mountain Towns 2030 Climate Summit in Breckenridge this month saw Basalt Town Council Member and Aspen One Senior Sustainability and Philanthropy Manager Hannah Berman join Aspen Mayor Pro Tem John Doyle, Pitkin County Commissioner Francie Jacober, and 34 other elected leaders from mountain communities across the country to pledge to work together in the face of climate change.

Founded in 2019, the summit supports mountain, ski resort, and rural communities moving toward collective net-zero carbon emissions through collaboration, shared resources, and measurable action. The Oct. 8 summit hosted more than 600 leaders from 61 mountain communities and 37 ski resorts.

In a special meeting during the summit, 37 mountain town leaders signed a joint statement committing to working together to reduce emissions, transition to clean energy, and protect their communities’ natural environments that are on the front lines of climate change.

“Aspen has lost one month of winter since 1980 due to climate change — that’s a month hit to the sport that anchors our local economy and our way of life,” Berman told The Aspen Times in an email. “It’s also a financial issue because increasing wildfire risk has jacked up our home insurance premiums, not to mention the multi-million dollar cost of fighting wildfires.”

She remembered the 2018 Lake Christine Fire in Basalt that burned three homes, which included the home of a volunteer firefighter who was fighting the fire.

“Frankly, it’s not fair that our communities must shoulder the costs and impacts of increased wildfires and more erratic weather when the fossil fuel industry is responsible for causing that damage,” she said. “If a company dumped toxic waste into a river, they’d have to clean it up or pay into the superfund program. But thus far in Colorado, when climate change causes damage, that comes out of the pockets of local working families and government.”

The joint statement highlights shortened winters, vanishing snowpack, escalating wildfires, worsening drought, and flash floods as direct threats that “are no longer warnings of a distant future: they are here, they are now.” According to the statement, climate action is a necessity to support public health, local economies, and mountain landscapes.

The statement also underscores the need for local leaders to commit to climate action quickly as federal leaders “delay and deny.”

The statement continues, “Their inaction leaves us no choice but to lead … As elected leaders of mountain communities, we’re bonded by a deep love for our natural settings and an intense responsibility to protect them. Therefore, we pledge to work together to accelerate climate solutions at the local and regional level, building a nationwide subnational movement powerful enough to drive emissions to zero.”

For Berman, she noted that one of the reasons she ran for town council at 27 years old was because she felt the government wasn’t effectively addressing climate, an issue she stressed disproportionately impacts young people.

“So climate has always been a top priority for me, and it’s heartening to see local governments getting things done on building decarbonization, public transit, and clean energy,” she said.

The joint statement emphasizes speed as a critical piece of climate action in order to combat the growing risks. By sharing strategies, expertise, and data, the 37 leaders who signed the statement aim to ensure every community has the resources they need.

“Climate is a time sensitive issue, so unless we’re acting with urgency, we’re not solving the problem,” she said.

According to Berman, solving climate issues boils down to electrifying everything and ensuring that power comes from clean energy. She said that her biggest takeaway from the summit came from Holy Cross CEO Bryan Hannegan, who reinforced that Holy Cross is “racing” toward 100% clean energy and need local governments to make electrifying buildings and transit systems a priority.

“Buildings are two-thirds of our region’s carbon emissions and if new residential construction is all-electric, it will have no carbon impact by the time Holy Cross reaches 100% clean power,” Berman said. “That’s why I strongly support Basalt’s work to adopt an all-electric building code for new residential construction. Renovations are hard and expensive, which means we need to focus on building things right in the first place.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/10/25104627/20251007-Climate-Summit-KUS186-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 06:18:37.541115

The newly installed 1,200-panel rooftop solar system is expected to generate nearly 1 million kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually—enough to power about 90 single-family homes in Florida. The system will meet roughly 75% of the total energy needs for the entire property, which includes both the bustling food truck park and the neighboring Visitors Flea Market.

“This investment in solar isn’t just about reducing our carbon footprint; it’s a commitment to long-term self-sustainability for our food truck owners and our customers,” said Nadeem Battla, owner of World Food Trucks. “By cutting power costs and gaining energy independence, we’re creating a smarter business model that benefits our vendors, our guests, and the entire community.”

Beyond energy savings, the new solar infrastructure will enhance resilience. In the event of a hurricane or other power outage, World Food Trucks will be able to continue operations safely using solar power, offering a vital gathering place for first responders and residents.

Restaurants typically consume up to ten times more energy per square foot than other commercial properties, but World Food Trucks’ large-scale renewable conversion demonstrates how solar energy can support even high-demand businesses without disrupting operations. The project is projected to reduce utility costs by approximately $19,600 annually, a substantial savings for a family-operated business that supports dozens of small, primarily minority-owned food trucks.

The project was made possible by a $601,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Energy for America Program, which funds renewable energy and efficiency projects for rural businesses. Additional support came from Climate First Bank and Duke Energy, which provided expertise and financing tools to bring the project to life.

PASADENA, CA, UNITED STATES, October 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Vicinia.io, a leader in digital twin and spatial intelligence solutions, announces the expansion of its platform with an enhanced Asset & People Intelligence Suite. This new release empowers organizations to achieve real-time asset tracking, people tracing, and operational visibility across campuses, workplaces, healthcare systems, and municipalities.

As modern facilities become more complex, organizations are demanding smarter ways to manage assets, understand people movement, and optimize building performance. Vicinia’s platform transforms static maps into interactive digital twins — dynamic, data-connected environments that reveal how assets and individuals move, interact, and shape operational outcomes.

Real-World Scenarios Driving Innovation

At a major university campus, facilities staff struggled to keep track of thousands of shared lab devices and classroom tools. Without a unified asset management system, misplaced equipment and redundant orders quietly increased annual costs. By using Vicinia’s digital twin platform, every item now appears on a real-time asset map — showing what’s in use, what’s idle, and even where maintenance is needed.

In a corporate innovation hub, safety teams needed a faster way to locate employees during building drills and equipment checks. Vicinia’s people tracing technology and IoT sensors provided immediate insight into occupancy and movement patterns — reducing search times and improving emergency response.

And in a city cultural complex, operators faced unpredictable visitor flow and congestion. Vicinia’s spatial intelligence dashboard visualized crowd movement, helping planners adjust signage and traffic paths on the fly to improve guest experience and accessibility.

These stories reveal a shared challenge across industries: the need for connected intelligence that unites people, places, and assets through live data.

By combining real-time asset intelligence with people movement analytics, Vicinia is helping organizations run safer, more efficient, and more connected operations.

Turning Data Into Action

The new suite integrates seamlessly with Vicinia’s wayfinding, tours, parking, and workspace solutions, creating a unified operational overview. Using IoT sensors, BLE tags, and predictive analytics, Vicinia enables teams to:

• Track assets and people in real time across multi-building or multi-site facilities.

Combining reasoning with 360-degree camera vision is what Musk believes will give Tesla’s autonomous vehicles a major edge in urban navigation.
Investor Spotlight on Musk’s Control and Pay Package Beyond autonomy, Tesla’s earnings call turned to another high-stakes topic: Musk’s pay and voting control.
That level of control, Musk argued, is necessary to protect the company’s vision—particularly in AI and robotics.","CEO Elon Musk confirmed the move during Tesla’s recent third-quarter earnings call, adding that steering wheels and pedals will be phased out entirely in 2026.

The robotaxi expansion will depend on regulatory green lights, but Musk has made it clear that Tesla is ready to scale. With plans to push into eight to ten more metro areas, including regions in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona, the company is steering straight into the competitive arena of autonomous mobility—with or without external pressure.

This announcement drops into an already complex landscape for Tesla. As regulatory scrutiny and public skepticism continue to shadow the rise of full self-driving (FSD) systems, Musk doubled down on safety, stating that Tesla would remain cautious even without being forced to. Still, the timeline he presented suggests a company eager to shed human intervention sooner rather than later.

Safety Drivers to Disappear, Controls to Follow

Musk was deliberate, if somewhat loose, with the timeline: safety drivers will exit Tesla’s Cybercabs in Austin “within a few months” or “by the end of the year,” depending on interpretation. According to Autoweek, Tesla is also waiting for regulatory approval to do the same in the San Francisco Bay Area, although there’s no rush to implement the change there.

In parallel, Tesla will begin assembling Cybercabs without steering wheels or pedals starting in 2026. Musk described this evolution as part of a broader vision to transition away from the “horseless carriage” mentality still shaping modern car design. That said, the automaker will continue building traditional Teslas with full controls for customers who still want to drive, emphasizing the divide between its consumer vehicles and the autonomous fleet.

Musk didn’t specify whether the Cybercabs will take the form of the two-door coupe prototype previously revealed or be stripped-down Model Ys. Either way, the transition represents a bold reshaping of how Tesla views transportation hardware—and who is supposed to control it.

Software Updates Bring Smoother Rides and “Reasoning”

As Tesla edges closer to full autonomy, software development remains central. Musk advised users to hold off on downloading Full Self Driving (FSD) version 14.0, recommending instead to wait for version 14.2, which he claims will offer smoother and more comfortable driving behavior. The improvement reportedly includes less jerky acceleration and overall better handling.

In an unusual claim, Musk said upcoming versions—14.3 or 14.4—will introduce “reasoning” capabilities to Tesla’s FSD. This, he explained, will allow the system to outperform humans in certain tasks, such as spotting empty parking spaces. Combining reasoning with 360-degree camera vision is what Musk believes will give Tesla’s autonomous vehicles a major edge in urban navigation.

These updates are framed as incremental improvements, yet they point toward a broader shift in how Tesla intends to scale its robotaxi service without human backup. While regulators have yet to weigh in on the latest FSD versions, Tesla appears to be preparing the foundation for a driverless future—one software release at a time.

Investor Spotlight on Musk’s Control and Pay Package

Beyond autonomy, Tesla’s earnings call turned to another high-stakes topic: Musk’s pay and voting control. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja urged investors to support Musk’s leadership in two votes set for November 6. At the heart of this push is a compensation plan that would award Musk an additional 12% of Tesla stock, raising his total stake to 25%. That level of control, Musk argued, is necessary to protect the company’s vision—particularly in AI and robotics.

Musk said his aim was to have “enough voting control to give strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.” He also fired back at Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, two index funds that recommended rejecting the proposal, and claimed the power would help prevent Tesla’s Optimus robots from falling into the wrong hands.

The call ended with a nod to Musk’s broader ambitions. He once again promoted Tesla’s AI chips, the Optimus project, and a new mission slogan: “sustainable abundance.” Despite a 9% dip in EBITDA to $4.23 billion, Tesla’s third-quarter gross revenues climbed to $28.1 billion, boosted by the final months of U.S. EV tax credits. Even as those incentives expire and the domestic EV market stalls, Musk expects global production to hit 3 million annually in under two years.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-Cybercab-Laser-Headlights.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 07:18:00.070838

The environment minister, Murray Watt, set out on Sunday the powers of the environment protection agency, under a bill to rewrite the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act due in parliament this week.
Previously, the environment minister has made decisions on projects either directly or via an official acting under delegated powers.
The peak green group favoured a model in which the minister set nature protection rules and then EPA assessed projects against them.
The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the EPA would become “another branch of government bureaucracy” if it didn’t have strong laws to enforce.","The environment minister will still be responsible for approving projects under new federal nature laws, after Labor rebuffed calls for a completely independent watchdog with full decision-making powers.

The retention of ministerial decision-making powers satisfies a key demand from the Coalition and industry and is not opposed by the Greens.

But it has been criticised by environmentalists, who argue the model could allow developers to exert pressure on the minister.

The environment minister, Murray Watt, set out on Sunday the powers of the environment protection agency, under a bill to rewrite the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act due in parliament this week.

Watt’s hopes of passing the laws before Christmas were dealt a blow last week after the Coalition and Greens criticised separate aspects of the draft laws, denying Labor a clear path through the Senate and setting up a political fight in the final three sitting weeks of the year.

The Coalition argue the laws are anti-business, while the Greens claim the opposite, accusing Watt of drafting laws that have “big business and the mining companies’ fingerprints all over it”.

Speaking on Sky News on Sunday morning, Watt said the government was open to considering amendments but was adamant the revamp would not collapse for the second time in 12 months.

“People should be under no illusions … we will be passing these laws through the parliament,” Watt said. “The only question is how quickly we do it and who we do it with.”

One of the most contentious parts of the reforms has been the scope of the promised federal environment watchdog, with industry and environmentalists at odds over whether an independent agency – rather than the minister – should be responsible for approving projects.

Previously, the environment minister has made decisions on projects either directly or via an official acting under delegated powers.

In practice, the minister personally considers only a small number of significant applications, such as Woodside’s North-West shelf extension and the Robbins Island windfarm. Departmental officials sign off on more than 90% of decisions.

The new regime will be largely the same, except that rather than delegating decisions to a departmental bureaucrat, that responsibility will fall to officials in the new EPA.

The decisions that are taken by the minister will be based on advice from the EPA rather than department officials.

The new agency, to be officially known as the National Environment Protection Agency (NEPA), will have other functions that are independent of the minister, including policing nature laws and monitoring compliance with a project’s conditions.

“An independent NEPA will have strong compliance and enforcement oversight to better protect our precious environment and ensure those who seek to illegally destroy it pay a high price,” Watt said.

The Australian Conservation Foundation acting chief executive, Paul Sinclair, was disappointed the proposed EPA was not fully independent.

The peak green group favoured a model in which the minister set nature protection rules and then EPA assessed projects against them.

“Arm’s length decision making is better for nature and better for business,” he said.

The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the EPA would become “another branch of government bureaucracy” if it didn’t have strong laws to enforce.

With a “climate trigger” that could block or restrict fossil fuel projects officially off the table, Hanson-Young signalled the Greens were prepared to negotiate with Labor on other mechanisms to address climate impacts.

Under the new laws, proponents of heavy polluting projects would be required to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and how they intend to mitigate them as part of the application process.

But the laws would not force decision-makers to consider those potential climate impacts, meaning projects such as Woodside’s North-West Shelf extension could still be approved under the new regime.

“They’ve taken the climate trigger off the table because they’re doing the bidding of the fossil fuel companies,” Hanson-Young said.

“Now if we negotiate, the government’s going to have to come up with what they are prepared to do to protect the climate and to protect our forests.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e570dc85bd9efe9af6854270cd251075ce28ebd1/564_0_5641_4515/master/5641.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c10b16ae5399607aab9384c5d9642e8",N,,2025-10-26 02:58:02.568425

By Jonathan Eberle |

Arizona Public Service (APS) is seeking to raise electricity rates by 14% starting in 2026 — a move the Arizona Free Enterprise Club (AZFEC) argues would unfairly burden Arizona families while subsidizing costly “green energy” initiatives and the early closure of a key coal plant.

According to filings with the Arizona Corporation Commission, APS attributes the proposed rate increase largely to battery storage projects and the early retirement of the Cholla Power Plant. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club filed an official response criticizing APS for attempting to block the organization’s intervention in the case, while allowing environmental groups such as the Sierra Club to participate. “APS has no issue letting radical groups like the Sierra Club into their hearings, but they’re trying to block the one organization fighting for Arizona families,” said AZFEC President Scot Mussi.

Mussi contends APS’s “carbon free” and “carbon neutral” commitments over the past five years have shaped their energy plans — including their Integrated Resource Plans and large-scale renewable energy projects — resulting in higher costs for consumers. “For years, their voluntary commitments have very likely increased costs for Arizona ratepayers,” the organization said in its filing.

Two days after filing its response, the Arizona Free Enterprise Club announced it had been officially granted intervention in the APS case. This designation allows AZFEC to participate directly in proceedings, making it the only organization representing ratepayers who oppose the rate hike.

In the ruling, the Administrative Law Judge overseeing the case described the Club as “the lone proponent” of an energy approach emphasizing reliability, affordability, and independence — priorities the group says align with President Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” agenda.

“While others are lobbying to shut down Arizona’s coal plants and pour billions into unreliable Green New Scam projects, we’re standing up for the ratepayers who will be left to foot the bill,” Mussi said. “We’re proud to be the only organization in this case fighting to keep Arizona’s energy secure, affordable, and free from political interference.”

The Club’s participation ensures that Arizona ratepayers have a voice during the proceedings, according to Mussi and AZFEC Deputy Policy Director Greg Blackie. “This isn’t about politics — it’s about protecting Arizona families and ensuring that our state doesn’t fall victim to the same radical energy policies destroying affordability across the country,” said Blackie. “We intend to shine a light on the real costs, the real numbers, and the real consequences of this so-called green transition.”

The case before the Arizona Corporation Commission will determine whether APS can move forward with its proposed rate hike. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club says it plans to continue pressing for “transparency, accountability, and energy freedom,” ensuring that “ratepayers are not forced to fund reckless green energy policies.”",https://azfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cropped-favicon-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 08:58:02.539380

The project combines Coolsheet’s heat-exchange solar technology with Capral Aluminium’s Australian-made components, creating a system designed to generate both electricity and usable heat from a single rooftop array.

Located above Sydney Harbour, the redeveloped complex will use the system to capture the sun’s light and heat simultaneously. While conventional photovoltaic panels typically convert only about 25 per cent of sunlight into electricity, Coolsheet’s panels reclaim the remaining thermal energy using a lightweight aluminium water jacket mounted behind each PV module. The captured heat can then be stored in hot-water tanks or used to pre-heat water for heat pumps. Cooling the solar cells also increases electrical efficiency and extends panel life — enabling a dual-output energy platform that maximises solar potential.

At North Sydney Olympic Pool, the installation links Coolsheet’s heat exchangers to the rear of 206 solar modules rated at 550 W each, creating around 114 kWe of electrical capacity and producing two to three times that amount in thermal energy. The output will help maintain water temperatures for over three million litres across five pools, forming part of the site’s all-electric heating network.

The system aligns with North Sydney Council’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035, and the extra power from cooled panels is expected to offset the system’s own pump energy use.

“Coolsheet is proud to partner with North Sydney Council on this landmark project,” said Tom Hoole, Founder and CTO of Coolsheet. “It’s been a complex construction program but now, as the site nears completion, it’s clear this will be a world-class facility showcasing how renewable heat can be built into public infrastructure.”

Coolsheet, founded in Sydney, is Australia’s first PVT manufacturer and among only about 50 globally. Its patented system has undergone validation testing at UNSW Sydney, supporting local manufacturing and deployment of renewable heat technologies. “The opportunity for Australian industry is significant,” said Doug Smith, Chairman of Coolsheet. “By capturing more of the sun’s energy through both electricity and heat, we can help manufacturers improve efficiency, reduce energy costs, and strengthen energy resilience all while supporting local jobs and clean technology manufacturing.”

The system’s backbone relies on precision-engineered aluminium extrusions supplied by Capral, built for durability and corrosion resistance in outdoor environments. “As an Australian manufacturer with a national extrusion and distribution footprint, Capral is focused on enabling the country’s rapidly developing renewables sector,” said Tony Dragicevich, CEO of Capral. “Our role is to bring local expertise, consistent quality and responsive supply to projects like this — supporting innovators with the engineered aluminium solutions they need to deliver clean-energy outcomes at scale.”",http://www.alcircle.com/api/media/1761399167.81509_Coolsheet_0_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 03:17:34.366029

Under the redesigned legislation — expected to be introduced to Parliament on Thursday — Murray Watt will announce the creation of Australia’s first National Environmental Protection Agency.

Senator Watt on Sunday said the NEPA would oversee compliance and enforcement but, unlike the failed Nature Positive reforms proposed by predecessor Tanya Plibersek, the minister of the day would still be ultimately responsible for project approvals.

“An independent (National Environmental Protection Agency) will have strong compliance and enforcement oversight to better protect our precious environment and ensure those who seek to illegally destroy it pay a high price,” Senator Watt told Sky.

“But importantly, the minister of the day would still be ultimately responsible for approval decisions, a move that is backed by all sides of politics.”

The NEPA would also have the powers to issue stop-work orders, to act proactively in the case of unacceptable environmental risks.

“The thing about stop work orders — we currently don’t have the power under our national environmental law if we know that someone is about to go and bulldoze all sorts of trees with koalas or other threatened species,” Senator Watt explained.

“We don’t have the power to get in there before that destruction occurs.

“All we can do at the moment is actually fine someone after the event.

“Now, I think most Australians would agree that it’s probably a good idea that if someone is about to do the wrong thing by the environment, we should have the power to stop that from happening first, rather than coming in after the event.”

Senator Watt said the redesign of the outdated 1999 Act aimed to deliver “a balanced package” for faster approvals, stronger environmental protection, and greater accountability and transparency.

He also criticised the Coalition’s lack of support leading up to the coming sitting week after Opposition Leader Sussan Ley warned his amendments would be a “handbrake” on investment.

In her commentary, Ms Ley also raised concerns over the definition of “unacceptable impact” in the laws, and that the legislation was being rushed.

Shadow Environment spokeswoman Angie Bell accused Senator Watt of being “short on detail” and said without further transparency the laws didn’t appear balanced.

She told Sky on Sunday there had already been “grave concerns” from across the spectrum — from environmental groups to resource sector representatives.

“The Minister’s saying that it’s balanced. Well, the way we’re looking at it is — it’s not balanced at the moment. It’s short on detail,” she said.

Her Coalition colleague Susan MacDonald also expressed concern the proposed changes would undermine national prosperity and push Australian jobs offshore.

“Just because the minister says that these (laws) are going to be better for the environment does not make that true,” the Shadow Resources spokeswoman said.

“What we’re trying to caution the Government on is not to rush through legislation.”

Senator Watt labelled the criticism as beyond belief from a party that claims to stand up for the interests of Australian business.

“What we’re trying to do through these reforms is deliver a balanced package that actually delivers real improvements for our natural environment and real improvements for business,” he said.

“They say they’re a party of business. We know the part that business wants these reforms to be put in place to streamline approvals.

“I cannot believe some of the things that we’re hearing from the Coalition.”",https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20473571/3fbcec2ccd172347f5903e497567a1a967557aa8-16x9-x0y192w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200,N,,2025-10-26 02:58:07.116493

CPS Energy customers should be disappointed with this very un-public move from their public utility.""
CPS Energy is on the verge of updating its generation plan—a process intended to determine which energy sources will power San Antonio in the years to come.
""Every megawatt of energy we save is a megawatt CPS Energy doesn’t have to buy.
The September purchase was not the first time CPS Energy made a major acquisition without public engagement.","As storms swept through San Antonio and South Texas on October 25, 2025, thousands of CPS Energy customers found themselves without power, highlighting both the challenges and controversies facing the nation’s largest municipal electric and gas utility. The outages, which at one point affected nearly 4,000 residents, arrived just weeks after CPS Energy’s surprise announcement of a $1.4 billion purchase of four methane gas power plants—an acquisition made without public input, according to multiple sources including Public Citizen and local news outlets.

For many San Antonians, the immediate concern was getting the lights back on. According to CPS Energy’s outage map, 43 active outages initially left 3,939 residents in the dark as the storms rolled in. By 10:15 a.m., the number of outages had climbed to 58, though the number of affected residents had dropped to 1,768 as crews worked to restore service. The hardest-hit areas included Leon Valley, with four active outages reported.

CPS Energy took to social media to reassure residents. ""Work crews will be responding to any reports of possible downed power lines and outages this morning. Delays in restoration may occur due to weather and road conditions, so please know that workers will also be prioritizing safety conditions during the morning storms,"" the utility stated. Residents were urged to report downed power lines by calling 210-353-HELP (4357), a reminder of the hazards that come with severe weather and aging infrastructure.

The National Weather Service had issued a flood watch from 7 p.m. on October 24 through 1 p.m. the next day, warning that rainfall totals could reach up to five inches in some spots, raising the risk of flooding in rivers, creeks, and low-lying areas. Road closures compounded the difficulties for residents and repair crews alike: Old Fredericksburg Road and Burshard Road were blocked off for ongoing construction, closures expected to last several more months.

While the storms and outages were the most immediate concern, a deeper debate was unfolding in San Antonio over the direction and transparency of CPS Energy’s long-term planning. The utility’s September announcement of a $1.4 billion purchase of four methane gas power plants in the Houston area surprised many—including clean energy advocates and everyday ratepayers—because the decision was made behind closed doors. DeeDee Belmares, a clean energy advocate with Public Citizen and former member of the CPS Energy Rate Advisory Committee, voiced the frustration felt by many: ""How did such a major decision happen behind closed doors? CPS Energy customers should be disappointed with this very un-public move from their public utility.""

CPS Energy leadership has defended the purchase, arguing that acquiring existing gas plants, rather than building new ones, could save customers $2 to $4 a month on their bills. These projected savings are based on cost comparisons with new construction, but critics question the reliability of such estimates. As Belmares pointed out, ""Gas prices are volatile and can be affected by geopolitical events, supply chain disruptions, and severe weather, as seen during the deadly winter storm of 2021 which resulted in billions of dollars in new charges to Texans."" The memory of that storm—when frozen methane gas supply chains left Texans with soaring bills that will linger for years—remains fresh for many in the region.

Beyond the question of cost, the lack of public input in such a consequential decision has raised alarms about transparency and accountability at the utility. The only formal avenue for community engagement is the CPS Energy Community Input Committee, but its meetings are not open to the public, and only summaries are made available online. ""This lack of transparency in a public utility should alarm ratepayers,"" Belmares wrote in a recent op-ed, echoing concerns voiced by other local advocates.

Compounding the frustration is the timing of the purchase. CPS Energy is on the verge of updating its generation plan—a process intended to determine which energy sources will power San Antonio in the years to come. But with $1.4 billion already committed to additional fossil fuel capacity, some stakeholders feel the outcome has been preempted. ""The update should have been the opportunity for stakeholders to engage with CPS Energy on any expensive fossil fuel expansion plans and the issues of sustainability, affordability and reliability of all power sources,"" Belmares argued.

San Antonio’s experience is not unique. Across Texas and the nation, utilities face mounting pressure to balance reliability, affordability, and sustainability. The Sustainable Tomorrow Energy Plan (STEP), already in place in San Antonio, offers incentives for energy efficiency upgrades—everything from insulation to new appliances—while the Casa Verde weatherization program provides free improvements to income-qualified customers. These programs, advocates say, not only help customers save money but also reduce demand on the grid, making the system more resilient to shocks like the 2021 winter storm.

""Every megawatt of energy we save is a megawatt CPS Energy doesn’t have to buy. It’s a win for everyone,"" Belmares noted. The savings from such programs are permanent, unlike the unpredictable costs of natural gas, which can spike due to global events or extreme weather.

The September purchase was not the first time CPS Energy made a major acquisition without public engagement. In May 2024, the utility purchased three gas plants from Talen Energy in Laredo and Corpus Christi for $785 million, again with little warning to the public. The pattern of sudden, high-stakes decisions has left some residents and advocates wary of what comes next.

As the city recovers from the latest round of storms and outages, the broader questions about CPS Energy’s future remain unresolved. Will the utility embrace a more transparent, participatory approach to decision-making? Can it balance the needs for reliability and affordability with the imperatives of climate action and public health? For now, San Antonio’s residents are left waiting—not only for the power to return, but for a voice in the decisions that will shape their energy future for decades to come.

The events of October 25 served as a stark reminder of the stakes involved. As climate-driven storms become more frequent and intense, and as energy markets grow more volatile, the choices made by public utilities like CPS Energy will have far-reaching consequences—for pocketbooks, for the environment, and for the very definition of what it means to serve the public interest.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/LSKeF8L2wcAOTskn8PIdVYLXSFA=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F219aacd8-ccfa-4402-b483-2fb19a07e017.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 10:03:24.930079

There’s barely an Australian who hasn’t been affected by one extreme weather event or another, some badly. Some have lost their lives, their homes or both.

The seas around our country are suffering a marine heatwave. Just a few degrees above normal is causing these climate change-fuelled warmer oceans to put our weather on steroids, intensifying heat, rainfall and wind.

And that intense rainfall will lead to increased plant growth, so another record bushfire season is inevitable at some point.

But this is really only the beginning: global warming has reached an average of nearly 1.5C, and we’re set to see warming of at least 2.7C by the end of the century if we don’t take more action.

How this warming will affect Australia was set out very clearly in the National Climate Risk Assessment report released last month: everything and everyone will be affected. Many sectors assessed are already experiencing moderate to high risk and if global warming is allowed to reach 2C most sectors will face very high to severe risk. Health and social support and natural systems will be severely affected – coral reefs will be all but extinct at 2C of warming.

Australians have a clear and obvious interest in the world taking action to peak global warming as close as possible to the Paris agreement’s 1.5C limit.

Never has there been a stronger need for rapid global decarbonisation; never has there been a stronger need to rid ourselves of fossil fuels and undertake a global transition to clean, renewable energy.

It’s there, and it’s available. Renewables have now taken over coal in global electricity generation. China’s emissions (and therefore the globe’s) may have peaked this year. And the cost of renewables, battery storage and EVs, thanks to a massive uptake in China, is plummeting. It’s never been cheaper.

And all the economics point to the cost of a global energy transition costing exponentially less than the ongoing – and building – costs of dealing with devastating climate change impacts.

So what’s getting in the way of this energy revolution? The biggest barrier to the global energy transition is the fossil fuel industry and its relationship with governments.

When I say fossil fuels, it’s not just coal and oil but also fossil gas, which a number of governments – including ours – have allowed themselves to be convinced is needed for this global transition.

But it absolutely is not, and it’s getting in the way and risks locking the world into warming of 2.5C – or more. Gas is a fossil fuel and needs to be reduced rapidly now and effectively out of the energy system by 2050 and the power sector a decade earlier.

Yet Australia wants to continue selling more of this gas to Asian markets in the form of liquefied natural gas or LNG all the way through to 2070, having just approved Woodside’s North West Shelf project to carry out this work. And LNG is much more energy-intensive than conventional gas, because of the processing it undergoes to ready it for export.

So if Indonesia builds a new gas-fired power station that burns Australian LNG (on-sold to them by Japan), this will keep Indonesia hooked on fossil gas for the 40-year lifetime of that power plant, locking in carbon emissions – or closing it early, leaving furious investors out of pocket.

The alternative is renewable energy firmed by storage that’s cheaper and more effective and will be better for the Indonesian economy and better for the planet. But this now risks being locked out by LNG.

Across Asia, Australia and Japan are touting their fossil gas wares, trying to convince their potential customers that they can just adopt carbon capture and storage (CCS) to deal with the emissions. Indeed the promised deployment of CCS is being used as a justification for allowing new fossil gas development.

But we know – and they must know – that this technology is failing. It is costly, complex and unreliable. It doesn’t work to get emissions to real zero, where they need to be; the rate of emissions capture is usually much lower than industry claims; the cost is very high, compared with clean alternatives, and is unlikely to reduce in cost over time.

The costs of renewable energy and storage will continue to reduce substantially over time as this industry scales up. Why spend all this cash buying fossil fuels and trying to bury emissions when renewables are now so much cheaper, and the fuel is both infinite and free? Let’s not forget the fossil fuel industry needs governments to carry the liability for this storage for many centuries into the future.

Australia has the know-how and the opportunity to help lead the global energy transition to a clean energy future, we have abundant critical minerals, we could export green hydrogen, and we have an endless supply of sun and wind that could power this future.

But first we need to take our foot off the gas.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aeeea3628bd738ffca81aa8259ca9d79fba5bcf/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3763250e18db0caf696523b82fde585e",N,,2025-10-26 00:18:07.929586

Why are renters more exposed to climate risks than homeowners?

TG, via email

Climate change poses a growing threat to human civilization by rapidly altering our environment and increasing the frequency, intensity, and destructiveness of natural disasters. Our homes are at the forefront of these challenges, facing rising energy costs to regulate extreme temperatures and increased risks of property damage from storms and floods. Among the most vulnerable are the third of Americans who rent rather than own their homes. When disaster strikes, renters are often left unprotected, with limited options for relocation or recovery. Notably, the areas with the highest concentration of renters also tend to face the most severe climate-related risks. This trend is particularly evident in Florida and California, where 88 and 79 percent of rental units, respectively, are in high-risk areas. After a disaster, renters frequently endure further hardship through sudden rent increases or evictions, exacerbating their vulnerability.

Government agencies like FEMA, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offer various forms of disaster relief for homeowners, including low-interest loans, nutrition assistance, short-term Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and rebuilding grants. However, renters receive little to no comparable aid. Beyond lacking direct assistance, renters have minimal control over post-disaster repairs, as landlords often opt for the fastest, cheapest fixes rather than investing in long-term, sustainable renovations.

To improve the safety and security of renters, disaster relief programs must incorporate targeted support and protections. In high-risk areas, expanding hazard-resistant building initiatives can ensure new construction and renovations prioritize climate resilience. Strengthening tenant protection laws can prevent post-disaster rent spikes and evictions, offering stability to those most affected. Also, lawmakers should require landlords to make climate-resilient upgrades, like using flood-resistant materials, improving insulation and modernizing energy systems. Expanding government relief programs to include rental assistance and temporary housing solutions can also help renters recover more effectively.

There are many ways individuals can contribute to renter protection: advocating for policy reforms; pushing for legislation that prioritizes renter protections; supporting tenant organizations; participating in community preparedness efforts. Also, raising awareness about available assistance programs, insurance options and renters' legal rights empowers individuals to make informed decisions and protect themselves. By taking these steps, individuals can help foster a more equitable and resilient housing system that ensures renters are not left behind in the face of climate change.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency approved a five-year permit allowing AquaBounty to install two mile-long pipelines near Pioneer. One would draw groundwater from a local aquifer, while the other would discharge wastewater into the east branch of the St. Joseph River.

According to the permit, it was officially granted on Sept. 12, with an effective date of Oct. 1. The permit remains valid through Sept. 30, 2030.

Residents who have followed the project closely say they were blindsided by the news. Members of the Williams County Alliance, an environmental advocacy group, said they were told they’d be notified when any new permits were issued. However, the approval was never announced publicly on the Ohio EPA’s website, AquaBounty’s website or the village of Pioneer’s page.

In a statement to WTOL 11, the Ohio EPA acknowledged that no public notice was issued and attributed the lapse to “an internal oversight.”

The EPA's statement:

""Ohio EPA, due to an internal oversight, did not issue a public notice regarding the issuance of AquaBounty’s permit.

It is our practice to release such notices, though not required by law, and we regret that this practice was not followed. We are continuing to look into this matter.

The permit holds the protection of human health and the environment as top priorities.""

Sherry Fleming, a leader with the Williams County Alliance, criticized the lack of transparency.

“This lack of a required simple notification to the public by the Ohio EPA illustrates how disconnected the state government is to the communities that will live with the impacts from this project every day,” said Fleming. “We deserve better.”

AquaBounty halted construction of its Pioneer facility in June 2023, citing financial challenges and rising construction costs. The company has not said if or when work on the site will resume.

On top of that, $25,000 is simply being moved from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund, so there’s no actual net budget increase for that.
Board member Olin Wilson-Thomas suggested that the group recommend raising the wheel tax, at least on “large, polluting cars,” to add money to the Sustainability Fund.
Board members also debated if a wheel tax increase should be income-based to avoid penalizing low-income residents more likely to drive older cars.
Other board members didn’t raise any objections to that.","Evanston’s Environment Board agreed at its meeting Thursday night to ask the City Council to keep $100,000 in annual wheel tax revenue in the city’s Sustainability Fund instead of moving it to the General Fund, which officials have proposed to help balance the 2026 budget.

The city created the Sustainability Fund in 2022 to set aside money specifically for staff positions, programs and projects that advance the Climate Action and Resilience Plan (CARP) and other environmentally friendly initiatives. During its Oct. 23 meeting held at Morton City Hall, the Environment Board reviewed how the city’s proposed 2026 budget would impact that fund specifically. City Council is expected to discuss the budget on Monday evening as well.

In their 2026 proposal, the city is asking all departments to cut expenses by 3% in the face of budget uncertainty.

The Environment Board objected to this idea at Thursday’s meeting, with members saying they felt the move would set a bad precedent and hurt sustainability efforts, especially since the budget proposal shuffles some programs from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund without providing additional revenue to pay for them.

Councilmember Jonathan Nieuwsma (4th Ward), who previously sat on the board and attended the meeting as a de facto liaison, suggested that members pass a resolution to send a message to the council.

While members agreed on what they objected to, they struggled over how specific they should get in their feedback and whether to suggest revenue solutions. The board ultimately voted for members James Cahan and Gennifer Geer, who drafted potential resolutions as the meeting went on, to send what they came up with to board co-chairs Katarina Topalov and Paula Scholl. The co-chairs would then “synthesize” these drafts into something to send to council in time for Monday’s meeting.

Sustainability Fund plans

Overall, the Sustainability Fund includes a projected $262,000 in revenue, not counting $730,450 transferred from other funds, and about $1.5 million in expenses. Cara Pratt, the city’s sustainability and resilience manager, said some changes in revenues and expenses reflect one-time grants being spread out over multiple years and errors that will be corrected in later drafts. On top of that, $25,000 is simply being moved from the General Fund to the Sustainability Fund, so there’s no actual net budget increase for that.

But other changes do reflect real funding gains and losses.

For example, the proposed budget assumes that a $250,000 U.S. Department of Energy grant to help implement the Healthy Buildings Ordinance isn’t coming — simply because, given the second Trump Administration’s priorities, it’s not something Evanston can count on.

“I don’t know if or when we’ll get it,” Pratt said Thursday.

Additionally, the budget also calls for shifting money around in a way that would result in a net reduction in Sustain Evanston grants.

The Sustainability Fund is also getting a $30,450 increase in transfers from Northwestern’s Good Neighbor Fund to keep up with inflation, and it would get a $15,000 increase in funding for seasonal employees to hire interns in the Transportation and Mobility Division.

But it was the proposal to keep $100,000 in the General Fund that dominated Thursday’s discussion. Topalov said she worried that this move could become an annual occurrence, which would hurt sustainability initiatives in the long term.

“There was a reason why we decided, you [City Council] decided, that there would be an earmarked pot of money that goes toward sustainability,” she said.

Nieuwsma replied that, if the board is against the move, it should let the council know.

“That feedback would be worth something,” he said.

Board member Olin Wilson-Thomas suggested that the group recommend raising the wheel tax, at least on “large, polluting cars,” to add money to the Sustainability Fund. Scholl said that might be worth discussing at a future meeting, and suggested that the board stick to the wheel tax funding issue for now.

This led to a long discussion over the statement to send to City Council, and if it would be more powerful to keep the comments simple or to offer a funding solution as well. Board members also debated if a wheel tax increase should be income-based to avoid penalizing low-income residents more likely to drive older cars.

Nieuwsma urged simplicity.

“The simple message the council will hear is don’t defund sustainability,” he said.

Deconstruction Ordinance

Earlier in the meeting, the board revisited an ongoing discussion on the city’s progress in meeting CARP goals, especially those items that were supposed to be completed this year.

One of those time-sensitive goals was for the city to propose, but not necessarily pass, a Preservation/Deconstruction Ordinance — in other words, an ordinance that would require buildings to be taken apart rather than demolished so that materials can be saved for reuse or recycled.

Nieuwsma wondered if that kind of ordinance is something the city should realistically pursue at the moment, given that the Rebuilding Exchange recently shut down after a $4 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant it was counting on ended up in limbo.

He said that working with the Rebuilding Exchange would’ve “offered some carrots for contractors,” but now, the city would be left with nothing but sticks.

Board member Gul Agha asked if the Rebuilding Exchange could come back.

“When the administration changes,” Topalov answered. “They lost $4 million in grants.”

Nieuwsma said that, with “such a local asset” out of commission, he wanted to get the board’s sense of “where we might get more bang for our buck.”

“Making sure the enforcement is there” for the Healthy Buildings Ordinance, Geer replied.

Other board members didn’t raise any objections to that.

“I’m inclined to put it on the shelf, for now,” Nieuwsma said.”[Implementing] HBO is going to take everybody’s time and energy.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9437-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 00:58:16.381987

I just finished the Kamala Harris memoir about the 2024 election, 107 Days. I come away from reading it even more unsettled than ever about the dystopian state of our democracy under President Donald J. Trump and his Project 2025 backers.

Private companies and US citizens are hesitant to practice free speech. Partisan politics are restricting the lives and livelihoods of federal workers — the three-week federal shutdown risks critical systems on which millions of people in the US depend. It could weaken government technology infrastructure for years to come.

MAHA’s fake science is in, researchers and scientists are out.

The Energy Department has published a report that pooh-poohed the severity of climate change. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has committed to rewriting past policy reports on climate science.

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy within Trump’s Department of Energy has a whole slew of words that are no longer allowed to be uttered during his reign. They include “climate change,” “green,” “decarbonization,”“energy transition,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “emissions,”“sustainability/ sustainable,” “carbon/CO2 ‘footprint’” and “tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies.”

Shoot. We here at CleanTechnica wouldn’t have much to write about if our editors implemented such word restrictions.

Meghan Pazik, senior policy advocate with Public Citizen’s Climate Program, disputes the Trump word bans. Pazik describes how they’re part of a larger agenda of the “administration’s suppression of science, weaponizing deliberate uncertainty, and reiterating once more its authoritarian agenda.” Word bans, she continues, “are conscious decisions that change public discourse and are “a direct, intentional attack on evidence-based science and independent thought which are essential tools for holding governments accountable.”

Democrats Must Speak Out Loudly about the Real Costs to US Citizens

The Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution (Article VI, clause 2) states that the Constitution, treaties, and federal law “shall be the supreme Law of the land.” Underpinning respect for the Constitution is the belief that democracy is worth defending. “But there’s a foundational requirement for it to function that we rarely talk about explicitly, perhaps because it seemed too obvious to require articulation,” deconstructs Chris Armitage, the founder of The Existentialist Republic. “We have to agree about what has actually happened in the world.”

In our post-truth era, agreement is quite hard to come by.

The Climate Action against Disinformation coalition, which comprises 90 climate and anti-disinformation organizations, argues that the digital information landscape is “dangerously polluted, obscuring the truth and delaying the urgent action we need to protect our future.” Rather than found on the fringes of public discourse, evidence suggests that dystopian narratives are becoming “even more mainstream, more violent, and more impactful through repetition.”

I call the originators of climate disinformation “climate entrepreneurs.” They’re online influencers who promote conflict around fossil fuel-driven pollution, and they do so for profit. They make a living from stirring up controversy about renewables and a net zero future. They bombard social media networks with culturally appealing narratives and incite confusion and anger in an effort to undermine common-sense climate governance.

One area that must be made transparent in the face of such subterfuge is how each current government agency closure has detrimental and domino effects on climate action. “This will not only affect research and policy directly, it will also affect what we see and don’t see, and what we say and don’t say,” Rakesh Bhandari, associate director of interdisciplinary studies at the University of California, Berkeley, reminds Politico.

Where does federal power end and state authority begin?

“The state has this power in virtue of its legitimate and cognitive authority,” Bhandari explains. The 10th Amendment to the Constitution was added by the founders in response to anti-Federalist anxieties about an overbearing central government. They added this language to emphasize that the government possessed only limited powers and everything else — including the broad “police power” to regulate health, safety, morals and general welfare — remained with the states. States are currently wallowing in the dirty waters flowing out of the federal government, though.

Some may argue that Democrats have alienated potential conservative voters by refusing to focus on centrist issues. Erica Payne, founder and president of Patriotic Millionaires, disagrees passionately.

“Democrats have absolutely, positively NOT moved too far left in terms of what people want for the economy. The complete opposite is true. People want a higher minimum wage. They want higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Their support for labor unions is at a 60-year high. They want something to be done about out-of-control CEO pay. Want a wildly popular agenda that cuts across party lines? Start there.”

Don’t Let ‘Em Forget about the Damage of Fossil Fuels

Trump has installed more than 100 fossil fuel insiders, renewable energy opponents, corporate lobbyists, and far-right think tank alumni across nine agencies during his second term. Dependence on fossil fuels both as feedstock and a source of energy and is at the heart of the intertwined global crises relating to plastics, climate, and toxic emissions.

Yet supporting Big Oil flies in the face of all evidence about how essential clean energy is to ensuring energy security, safeguarding communities, and protecting our planet’s health. Right-wing politicians, lobbyists, and fossil fuel influence groups behind anti-ESG bills are continuing to block companies from responding to climate risk, even as climate impacts accelerate and the costs become unavoidable for investors, pension holders, municipalities, and taxpayers.

“Democrats are pretty silent about what matters most to the GOP: the protection of fossil fuels,” UC Berkeley’s Bhandari adds. Oil, coal, and gas dump carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. Fossil fuels come with a damaging and costly downside: they are warming our planet faster than anything we have seen in the geological record. They also cause other forms of pollution that severely harm human health.

It’s also noteworthy that today’s fossil energy system is incredibly inefficient: almost two-thirds of all primary energy is wasted in energy production, transportation, and use — that’s before fossil fuel has done any work or produced any benefit. Over $4.6 trillion per year, almost 5% of global GDP and 40% of what the world spends on energy, is wasted due to fossil fuel inefficiency.

Celebrate Solar & Battery Storage, Over & Over

Trump 2.0 is in the midst of a war on climate change research, which parallels goals of fossil fuel companies. Yet more US homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

At a time in which electrification of transport, industry reshoring, and surging data center growth are driving up both energy use and peak demand across North America and Europe, clean energy is now the least costly form of new generation to build. Technology like battery storage is helping to make solar and wind more practical. These are facts.

“Solar and storage are the cheapest, fastest ways to bring much-needed affordable power to communities, as electricity demand and costs surge,” says Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for clean energy at Environmental Defense Fund. Pulling the plug on projects without explanation won’t lower electricity bills for families and businesses, and restricting the supply of cheap electricity only makes the problem worse, Kelly explains. “Instead, the Trump administration is doubling down on costly fossil fuels like coal, opening up new federal lands for coal mining and handing out over $600 million in subsidies to keep polluting, aging coal plants on life support.”

With the Trump administration two-tiered approach to energy permitting, “Polluting, expensive fossil fuels get ‘concierge, white glove service,’” Kelly continues, “while cheap renewables and storage get freezes, delays, and cancellations.” The result? More asthma-causing pollution. Fewer clean energy investments that create jobs right now.

Renewable energy came to the rescue in the summer during New England heat waves. Solar panels on homes, schools, businesses, and larger arrays provided up to 22% of the region’s power. That amounted to nearly double the daily average. This reliable output stabilized the grid and saved customers tens of millions of dollars on some of the hottest days in memory. These are the types of climate facts that we need to be stating and restating, over and over again.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dystopian.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:57:55.435241

Henning, Gonzaga University",,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/city-one-hundreds-expecting-federal-140647415.html,"Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community.
A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well.","In June 2021, a deadly heat wave pushed temperatures to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in Spokane, Washington, a northern city near the Idaho border where many homes weren’t built with central air conditioning.

As the heat lingered for over a week, 19 people died in Spokane County and about 300 visited hospitals with signs of heat-related illnesses.

Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region. To help save lives, the city teamed up with my university, Gonzaga, to start preparing for a hotter future.

We were excited and relieved when the community was awarded a US$19.9 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help it take concrete steps to adapt to climate change and boost the local economy in the process. The grant would help establish resilience hubs with microgrids and help residents without air conditioning install energy-efficient cooling systems. The city doesn’t have the means to make these improvements on its own, even if they would save lives and money in the long run.

Less than a year later, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the funding.

Spokane’s grant wasn’t the only one eliminated – about 350 similar grants that had been awarded to help communities across the country manage climate changes, from extreme heat and wildfire smoke to rising seas and flooding, were also terminated on the grounds that they don’t meet the White House’s priorities. Many other grants to help communities have also been terminated.

Many of the communities that lost funding are like Spokane: They can’t afford to do this kind of work on their own.

Why cities like Spokane need the help

Like many communities in the American West, Spokane was founded in the late 19th century on wealth from railroads and resource extraction, especially gold, silver and timber.

Today, it is a city of 230,000 in a metro area of a half-million people, the largest on the I-90 corridor between Minneapolis and Seattle. In many ways, Spokane could be on the cusp of a renaissance.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a $48 million grant to develop a tech hub that could put the Inland Northwest on a path to become a global leader in advanced aerospace materials. But then, in May, the Trump administration rescinded that grant as well.

The lost grants left the economy – and Spokane’s ability to adapt fast enough to keep up with climate changes – uncertain.

This is not a wealthy area. The median household income is nearly $30,000 less than the state average. More than 13 out of every 100 people in Spokane live in poverty, above the national average, and over 67% of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunch.

The city is a light blue island in a dark red sea, politically speaking, with a moderate mayor. Its congressional district has voted Republican by wide margins since 1995, the year that then-House Speaker Tom Foley lost his reelection bid.

Lessons from the 2021 heat dome

The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community. The newly formed Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water and the Environment brought together a coalition of government and community partners to apply for the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program. The grants, funded by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, were intended to help communities most affected by pollution and climate change build adaptive capacity and boost the safety of their residents.

A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well. People just weren’t showing up. Our research found that the best approach is to strengthen existing community facilities that people already turn to in moments of difficulty.

Half the $19.9 million award was for outfitting five resilience hubs in existing libraries and community centers with solar arrays and battery backup microgrids, allowing them to continue providing a safe, cool space during a heat wave if the power shuts down.

Another $8 million in grant funding was meant to provide 300 low- to moderate-income homeowners with new high-efficiency electric heat pump heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, providing more affordable utility bills while improving their ability to cool their homes and reducing fossil fuel emissions.

Communities are left with few options

Now, this and other work is at risk in Spokane and cities and towns like it around the country that also lost funding.

According to the Trump administration, the program – designed to help hundreds of communities around the country become safer – was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

A class action lawsuit was recently filed over the termination of the grants by a coalition that includes Earth Justice and the Southern Environmental Law Center. If the case is successful, Spokane could see its funding restored.

Meanwhile, the city and my team know we have to move fast, with whatever money and other resources we can find, to help Spokane prepare for worsening heat. We formed the Spokane Community Resilience Collaborative – a partnership between community organizations, health officials and the city – as one way to advance planning for and responding to climate hazards such as extreme heat and wildfire smoke.

As concentrations of heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, both the frequency and severity of heat waves increase. It is only a matter of time before another deadly heat dome arrives.

The EPA’s decision effectively halted plans to deploy 21 megawatts of solar generation and 55 megawatt-hours of battery storage across the Virgin Islands. The termination letter issued to VIEO included an immediate “Stop Work” order, forcing all related activities to cease.

Despite the setback, Energy Office Director Kyle Fleming said his agency remains committed to strengthening the territory’s energy resilience. “VIEO will yet be able to materially enhance electrical resilience in the territory,” Fleming said, pointing to other federally funded efforts such as the Community Electrical Innovations (CEI) program.

Even as large-scale funding was withdrawn, VIEO celebrated a milestone in residential renewable energy this year. The agency completed 12 home solar and battery installations through its Solar Plus Financing (SPF) Pilot Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

The SPF initiative offers 1 percent interest, zero-down loans in partnership with the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority (VIEDA), allowing residents to finance rooftop solar systems and battery storage. On average, homeowners received about $28,000 to install 5.5 kW of solar panels with 14 kWh of storage.

Participants have already reported significant benefits. St. Thomas resident David Miles said the transition has not only lowered his WAPA bills but made outages virtually invisible. “My experience is that I am so grateful that I have these solar panels,” he said. “Because you don’t even know that the power is out. You can just feel a light flicker, and then I hear a generator start across the street and then I know the power is out.”

VIEO originally designed the SPF program as the first of several efforts to expand access to renewable energy and narrow the territory’s socioeconomic energy gap.

One of the agency’s remaining major initiatives is the Community Electrical Innovations (CEI) grant, a $10 million program administered through the Virgin Islands Housing Finance Authority (VIHFA). The program aims to strengthen the energy resilience of facilities that serve children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups.

Following the July application deadline, 29 facilities were provisionally approved to receive solar and battery systems. The first phase will focus on Head Start centers and daycare facilities serving over 500 children territory-wide. Nine institutions on St. Thomas and St. Croix have already begun soliciting bids for design-build solar systems, with public tenders expected to open in November.

VIEO is also advancing efforts to improve territorial solar design and access. In early October, the agency selected DNV Energy as a consultant under RFP BD-25-270-2701-581, to assist with the development of community microgrids and rooftop solar financing models. The partnership will help design programs that ensure affordable access to renewable energy while positioning the Virgin Islands for future federal funding.

Additionally, the office finalized evaluations for RFP BD-25-270-2701-599, selecting Carib Sun Energy to build a microgrid system at WTJX’s Mountaintop broadcast tower on St. Thomas.

The project, funded by the Department of the Interior’s Energizing Insular Communities Grant, will feature a 70 kW solar array, 500 kWh battery system, and a microgrid controller integrated with the site’s existing diesel generator. Once completed—within roughly nine months of its official start—the system is expected to save the broadcaster $6,000 a month in electricity costs while ensuring uninterrupted transmission from one of the territory’s most critical communication points.

Despite the EPA grant withdrawal, Fleming said the Energy Office’s mission remains unchanged: to pursue affordable, resilient, and sustainable power for residents and essential community services.

“The VIEO continues to advance a diversified portfolio of solar and battery initiatives, leveraging alternative funding, strengthening public-private partnerships, and moving priority projects from planning to deployment,” Fleming stated.

With several projects underway and new federal partnerships emerging, VIEO says its focus will remain on “near-term, high-impact installations that deliver reliability, affordability, and resilience” to the Virgin Islands’ energy landscape.",https://viconsortium.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/Maria-Perez-solar-roof.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 21:18:08.612825

EVXL’s Take We’ve been tracking the slow-motion collapse of Chinese battery investments in America for months, and Gotion’s Michigan failure was entirely predictable.
That stockpiling now looks prescient—Gotion’s Michigan plant was supposed to supply the U.S. market, but it’ll never produce a single battery cell.","A Chinese battery giant’s plans to build a massive Michigan manufacturing plant have officially collapsed, with the state now demanding millions back after years of grassroots opposition, Chinese ownership controversies, and Trump administration policy shifts killed what was once touted as Northern Michigan’s largest economic project ever. Gotion Inc. abandoned its $2.4 billion electric vehicle battery materials plant near Big Rapids after Michigan officials declared the company in default and terminated all state incentives worth $175 million.

The failure marks the latest casualty in America’s troubled push for domestic battery manufacturing, coming just weeks after the September 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits that had promised to fuel the industry’s growth. For EV owners and enthusiasts watching the battery supply chain struggle to establish itself on American soil, Gotion’s collapse raises serious questions about whether Chinese technology and capital remain welcome in the U.S. market—or even necessary.

From $175 Million Promise To Complete Collapse

Michigan’s economic development agency announced Thursday it’s pursuing repayment of $23.6 million already spent on land purchases while suspending a separate $125 million grant that was never disbursed. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation sent Gotion a default notice in September after determining no construction or development activities had occurred on the 270-acre site for more than 120 consecutive days.

When Governor Gretchen Whitmer celebrated the October 2022 announcement, the project promised 2,350 factory jobs paying $62,000 annually—more than 50% above the local median income. The plant would have produced 150,000 tons of cathode materials and 100,000 tons of anode materials annually for EV batteries. But local opposition erupted almost immediately, focused on both environmental concerns and the company’s Chinese ownership structure.

The Michigan Strategic Fund’s September 17 letter to Gotion cited both the project abandonment and ongoing lawsuits as constituting “material adverse effect” violations of the grant agreement. The state gave Gotion 30 days to cure the defaults. That deadline passed October 17 with no resolution.

Local Rebellion Defeats State And Corporate Alliance

The Gotion saga became a case study in grassroots political power defeating entrenched interests. In November 2023, Green Charter Township voters recalled all five township board members who had supported the project, replacing them with officials openly opposed to the development. The new board subsequently rescinded support and, critically, voted to cut off access to water infrastructure essential for factory operations.

Marjorie Steele, founder of the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance that led the opposition, told reporters “What the MEDC tried to pull here in Big Rapids was just so egregious.” Residents organized protests, packed public meetings, and plastered the area with anti-Gotion yard signs, creating a political climate that made construction impossible.

Gotion fought back with a March 2024 breach of contract lawsuit against Green Charter Township. A federal judge granted Gotion an injunction in May 2024 requiring the township to honor the original agreement, but the township appealed. The legal battles stalled the project completely, with Gotion pausing environmental studies and state permitting applications.

In its October response to the state’s default notice, Gotion’s attorney Mark Heusel called the accusations “utterly false” and blamed “racist and ethnically charged stereotypes” for the township’s breach. He argued that ongoing legal expenses, property taxes, and site maintenance constituted “eligible activities” under the grant agreement, and requested a six-month suspension to negotiate an “open and candid discussion about the viability of the project.”

Political Opposition Centered On Chinese Communist Party Ties

The project became a flashpoint for growing U.S.-China tensions and skepticism about Chinese investment in critical industries. Congressman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, emerged as the project’s most prominent opponent. Moolenaar introduced legislation blocking companies like Gotion from receiving EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act—a bill that President Trump signed into law earlier this year as part of the “Big Beautiful Bill”.

Critics pointed to Gotion’s corporate structure and Chinese government connections. While Germany’s Volkswagen owns approximately 30% of Gotion High-Tech’s parent company, U.S. lawmakers maintain that China retains “effective control” through multiple individual shareholders. The company’s ties to Chinese Communist Party activities, including employee visits to party memorials and executives attending political study sessions, fueled suspicions among opponents.

Moolenaar praised Thursday’s announcement, stating the people of Green Charter Township “can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises.” For supporters of domestic battery production, the congressman’s rhetoric highlighted the impossible political environment Chinese companies now face in the United States.

Illinois Plant Proceeds While Michigan Dreams Die

The stark contrast between Gotion’s Michigan failure and its Illinois success reveals how location and local politics determine project viability. Gotion’s $2 billion Manteno, Illinois plant began production in late 2024 and has hired approximately 150 employees toward a target of 2,600 workers. The facility converted a former Kmart distribution center into a battery assembly plant producing both EV battery packs and energy storage systems.

Benjamin Howes, Gotion’s head of corporate and public affairs, said the company “remains firmly committed to its mission of driving America’s clean energy future” including at the Illinois facility. The Illinois project received $536 million in state incentives, though it too faced local opposition, including anti-Gotion candidates winning April 2025 municipal elections in Manteno.

The key difference: Illinois officials maintained support through the political turbulence, and manufacturing started before opposition could build sufficient momentum. Michigan’s project never broke ground, allowing resistance to calcify and spread.

Part Of Broader Chinese Battery Retreat From America

Gotion’s Michigan collapse fits a troubling pattern for U.S. battery manufacturing ambitions. EVXL has documented multiple Chinese-backed battery projects failing or stalling in recent months. In June, another Chinese-owned manufacturer AESC halted work on a $2 billion Kentucky plant and paused construction on a separate $1.6 billion South Carolina facility originally designed to supply BMW.

The timing couldn’t be worse for the U.S. EV industry. Federal EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 expired September 30, 2025, eliminated under Trump’s tax reform legislation. The loss of both consumer incentives and manufacturing tax credits has triggered exactly the industry contraction many analysts predicted.

Ford’s Michigan battery plant using CATL technology survived only after months of political battles over Chinese licensing deals. Rivian recently laid off 600 workers—its third workforce reduction in four months—directly citing the expired tax credits and weakening EV demand.

For automakers like Ford and GM racing to build domestic battery capacity, the collapse of Chinese investments leaves a critical gap. Chinese companies including CATL, BYD, and Gotion possess the world’s most advanced battery manufacturing technology and lowest production costs. Without Chinese capital and expertise, American battery production faces both technical challenges and cost disadvantages that could take years to overcome.

EVXL’s Take

We’ve been tracking the slow-motion collapse of Chinese battery investments in America for months, and Gotion’s Michigan failure was entirely predictable. When we covered Ford’s battles over its CATL-licensed Michigan plant back in May, the political writing was already on the wall: Chinese battery technology might be essential to the EV revolution, but Chinese ownership has become politically radioactive.

Here’s what nobody wants to say out loud: America needs Chinese battery technology and manufacturing expertise to build a competitive EV industry, but American politics now make Chinese investment essentially impossible. That’s not a bug, it’s a feature—at least according to lawmakers like Moolenaar who view any Chinese involvement as a national security threat.

The Gotion collapse reveals a deeper problem than just one failed project. Michigan taxpayers are out $23.6 million. Big Rapids lost 2,350 promised jobs that won’t materialize. And the U.S. battery supply chain just lost a major planned supplier at exactly the moment when Trump’s elimination of EV tax credits has automakers scrambling to cut costs and scale back EV production.

This is the same pattern we documented with AESC’s failed Kentucky and South Carolina plants back in June, and with another South Carolina battery plant that halted construction amid policy uncertainty. Foreign battery manufacturers arrive promising jobs and investment, politicians lavish them with subsidies, local opposition erupts over Chinese ownership, federal policy shifts, and projects die. Rinse, repeat. Michigan just added another corpse to the pile.

The timing makes this worse. Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminated the $7,500 EV tax credit effective September 30—just weeks before Michigan pulled the plug on Gotion. That’s not a coincidence. When we covered Rivian’s 600 layoffs earlier this week, we noted how the expired tax credits are forcing EV makers into crisis mode. Now we’re seeing the same policy shift kill battery supply before it even gets built.

Interestingly, back in May we reported on Rivian’s clever move to stockpile Gotion batteries before tariffs hit. That stockpiling now looks prescient—Gotion’s Michigan plant was supposed to supply the U.S. market, but it’ll never produce a single battery cell. Rivian saw this coming.

The Illinois plant’s survival offers a hint: projects that start production before opposition organizes can weather the political storm. But that’s cold comfort for the dozens of announced battery projects that haven’t broken ground yet. If Chinese companies are essentially banned and domestic companies lack the technology and cost structure to compete, who exactly is going to build America’s battery industry?

It’s an honour to be here in Reno, Nevada, speaking as New Zealand’s Minister for Resources and Minister for Regional Development – two closely intersecting portfolios in New Zealand.

I want to thank the organisers of the 2025 Indigenous Geothermal Symposium for the invitation to deliver this keynote address. I would also like to acknowledge the people of Reno-Sparks Indian Colony for undertaking the opening ceremony.

This is a special gathering. Unlike many audiences where geothermal energy must be explained from first principles, here I’m speaking to experts – engineers, researchers, technology providers, and advocates. That allows me to take a broader view: to reflect on geothermal’s past, its cultural significance, and its future potential.

New Zealand is proud to be the world’s fifth-largest producer of geothermal electricity. Our location on the boundary of the Indo-Australian and Pacific tectonic plates gives us access to a world-class geothermal resource.

But our connection to geothermal energy goes far deeper than geology. For Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, waiwhatu – geothermal water—is a taonga, a treasure. It is a place where the physical and spiritual worlds meet. Our tīpuna, or ancestors, used geothermal waters for cooking, healing, and warmth. These practices were not just practical – they were deeply spiritual, rooted in a worldview that sees the land, water, and energy as living entities.

The Pink and White Terraces, once a major attraction in the central North Island before the 1886 volcanic eruption of Mount Tarawera destroyed them, drew visitors from around the world to bathe in their restorative waters. These terraces were more than a tourist destination – they were a symbol of the natural harmony between geothermal energy and human wellbeing.

Rotorua’s spa culture, established in the 1870s, played a vital role in healing injured soldiers returning from war. The geothermal waters were seen as therapeutic, and the region became a centre for rehabilitation and recovery.

This legacy of geothermal use is woven into our national identity. It’s a story of innovation, resilience, and respect for the land.

Globally, geothermal electricity generation began over a century ago in Larderello, Italy. New Zealand engineers visited the site in 1944 and again in 1948, witnessing its rebirth after wartime destruction. Inspired, we began exploratory drilling at Wairākei in 1949, leading to the world’s second geothermal power station – and the first to harness wet steam.

That pioneering spirit continues today. We are a small country but in geothermal science, we have consistently led the way.

Today, geothermal energy is a cornerstone of the Māori economy, and Māori have a long-term vision to enhance their role in New Zealand’s energy sector. Māori have a rich cultural heritage and a deep connection to their land and natural resources. Their identity is rooted in a unique worldview that emphasises the importance of kaitiakitanga, guardianship, over the environment, demonstrated in their commitment to sustainability and community wellbeing.

Many Māori iwi (tribes) own land with significant geothermal potential, particularly in regions like the central North Island. As a result, they’ve become key players in geothermal energy projects, both as resource owners and partners in large-scale ventures.

Investment in geothermal energy supports iwi, hapū, and ahu whenua (land management) trusts, enabling innovation and investment in areas like geothermal aquaculture, horticulture, and tourism.

These ventures are not just economically significant – they are culturally affirming. They allow Māori communities to exercise rangatiratanga, or self-determination, over their resources. They create opportunities for intergenerational wealth, education, and environmental stewardship.

In this way, geothermal energy is helping to shape a future that is both prosperous and culturally grounded.

I’ve been following the statements of US Energy Secretary Chris Wright with great interest. His emphasis on ‘affordable, reliable, and secure energy’ as the foundation of national prosperity resonates deeply.

Globally, energy demand is projected to rise faster than we experienced during the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s. According to the International Energy Agency, electricity use has grown at twice the pace of overall energy demand over the last decade and is projected to rise even faster.

As AI and other technologies drive unprecedented electricity demand, the link between energy and economic strength becomes even more critical.

Secretary Wright’s concept of ‘energy dominance’ highlights the strategic importance of energy policy. I believe we are witnessing a global reset in how geothermal is positioned – especially in countries like the United States, Japan, and New Zealand.

While geothermal accounts for around 20 per cent of New Zealand’s electricity, it contributes less than 1 per cent in the US, despite the US being the largest producer by volume.

Just as the US is advancing its energy transition, New Zealand is developing a national geothermal strategy that aims to unlock the full potential of our geothermal resources to drive energy resilience and support regional and Māori economic development.

The draft strategy, released for public consultation in July, sets the goal of doubling geothermal energy use by 2040, positioning New Zealand as a global leader in sustainable geothermal innovation and supporting our transition to a low-emissions economy.

Let me now turn to supercritical geothermal – sometimes referred to as superdeep or superhot geothermal. In New Zealand, we are investing in proving its viability.

Our Central North Island, home to the Taupō Volcanic Zone, offers extraordinary advantages. Scientific research confirms that supercritical fluids lie just 5–6km, or around three miles, beneath the surface—shallower than in most other regions globally.

Supercritical geothermal has the potential to revolutionise energy generation. These fluids carry vastly more energy than conventional geothermal sources. If harnessed effectively, they could provide baseload renewable energy at a scale comparable to fossil fuels.

We know the risks. We expect challenges. But just as our engineers pioneered wet steam technology in the 1950s, we are backing ourselves to innovate again.

We’ve established a robust governance structure for this programme. Our Kiwi-based team includes top engineers, scientists, and strategic advisors.

Representatives from these groups are here in Reno and eager to connect with you.

We’ve also convened an International Review Panel.

Today I am delighted to announce that Professor Roland Horne of Stanford University has agreed to chair the panel.

As you will know, Professor Horne is one of the world’s foremost geothermal experts and is attending the Geothermal Rising Conference here in Reno. We are delighted he has agreed to lend his expertise and leadership to our project.

I’d also like to welcome the three other highly regarded members of the International Review Panel – Dr Omar Friðleifsson and Mr Kristinn Ingason both from the Iceland Deep Drilling Project. We also warmly welcome to the panel United States geochemist Dr Darrell Gallup of Thermochem Inc.

We are very pleased to have such outstanding engineering and scientific experts join us.

On that note, I would like to say we are inviting other international collaboration – particularly from US companies and researchers. We believe the Taupō Volcanic Zone can serve as a global laboratory for supercritical geothermal.

But this is not just about New Zealand. The information we gather will have global implications. They will inform policy, guide investment, and shape the future of clean energy. Globally, we’re in an energy crisis. We need more clean, renewable energy to support the electrification of transport, industry, and data infrastructure.

Supercritical geothermal offers untapped potential that would be a great step forward for clean, green, sustainable energy. New Zealand is ready to lead – offering decades of geothermal expertise, political stability, a robust regulatory framework, and strong partnerships which our indigenous Māori landowners and communities, for whom geothermal resources are deeply embedded in whakapapa (histories), wairuatanga (identity and spirituality), and tikanga (customs).

We are already seeing interest from Japan, Iceland, and other geothermal-rich nations. The opportunity to share technology, capital, and expertise is immense.

Let me be clear, we are not just drilling wells. We are building a global partnership for energy transformation.

The future of geothermal is bright. With advancing science and deeper collaboration, the opportunities before us are limitless.

We stand at a crossroads. One path leads to incremental change. The other leads to bold innovation, cultural empowerment, and global leadership.

New Zealand has chosen the latter. We invite you to walk it with us.

The event was widely seen as a wake-up call to the dangers of methane and underground natural gas storage.
Aliso Canyon was originally drilled as an oil field in the late 1930s before SoCalGas converted it to natural gas storage in the early 1970s.
Aliso Canyon is one of the largest natural gas storage facilities in the U.S.
Researchers now have a better understanding of what's in the gas that blew from Aliso Canyon and that continues to be stored in natural gas facilities around the country.","On an evening 10 years ago, Porter Ranch resident Matt Pakucko stepped out of his music studio and was walloped by the smell of gas—like sticking your head in an oven, he recalled.

Pakucko called the fire department. It turned out crews had already been up to the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility in the Santa Susana Mountains behind the neighborhood, responding to a report of a leak. Many of his neighbors were beginning to feel ill, reporting issues such as heart palpitations, vomiting, burning eyes and bloody noses.

""I swear I thought I was standing behind a 747 with its engines blowing—it was not just gas, it was an oil smell, it was a chemical smell that permeated,"" recalled Pakucko, who went on to co-found the advocacy group Save Porter Ranch. ""I couldn't stay out there for 30 seconds. It tasted like f— gasoline.""

Soon it was clear that this wasn't just a leak—it was a blowout. Over the course of 112 days, the Aliso Canyon facility would spew an estimated 120,000 tons of methane and toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. It was the worst natural-gas well blowout in U.S. history, and an environmental disaster whose effects will be unpacked for generations.

The event was widely seen as a wake-up call to the dangers of methane and underground natural gas storage. Methane, a planet-warming greenhouse gas, is about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about a quarter of all the human-caused climate change we are experiencing.

A study published by UCLA researchers in September found that women in their final trimester of pregnancy who were living within 6.2 miles downwind of the blowout in 2015 had a nearly 50% higher-than-expected chance of having a low birth-weight baby.

The blowout ushered in a wave of new regulations to strengthen the governance of natural gas storage facilities in California and the United States, as well as new tools and technology to monitor methane emissions.

But 10 years later, some Porter Ranch residents say the wounds still feel fresh, and too many promises have been broken. After the disaster, then-Gov. Jerry Brown called for the permanent closure of Aliso Canyon by 2027—a goal his successor, Gavin Newsom, called a top priority and vowed to meet even sooner.

Instead, Aliso Canyon remains open, with regulators voting in December to continue using the facility for years— probably into the 2030s—citing the need for natural gas to help maintain affordable energy rates and grid reliability in California.

The facility is a key asset for Southern California Gas. In an emailed statement, the company said the state would struggle to meet electricity demand without Aliso Canyon's storage. The site fuels 17 power plants and helps keep the lights on during the hours that can't yet be met by solar, wind and other renewable resources, the company said. Natural gas still represents about 40% of the state's electricity supply.

""There's a lot of work to do to get off natural gas and oil in California,"" said Adam Peltz, senior attorney with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. ""That work is underway, but it's not complete. If you've built an economy on fossil fuels, it takes awhile to get off of it.""

Aliso Canyon was originally drilled as an oil field in the late 1930s before SoCalGas converted it to natural gas storage in the early 1970s. Utilities often use played out crude oil fields as places to pump gas downward under pressure and hold it until it is needed.

Aliso Canyon is one of the largest natural gas storage facilities in the U.S.

In the lead-up to the blowout, SoCalGas was filling the site in preparation for the winter heating season. Crews were using tremendous force to pump gas down a well that was more than 60 years old. But a metal casing on well SS-25 had corroded, and gas began blowing out at very high volumes.

Methane is not visible to the naked eye, but aerial images captured with infrared cameras and released by the Environmental Defense Fund showed a geyser-like eruption of the flammable, climate-changing gas—making it clear to the whole world the magnitude of the disaster.

It took nearly four months for crews to stop the leak. By that time, damage was done. More than 8,000 households were temporarily displaced, businesses were shut down, and two schools were relocated for several months.

Researchers are still working to unpack the health outcomes of the event. SoCalGas, meanwhile, has paid about $2 billion in settlements and agreed to operate the facility at a lower maximum pressure.

Officials with the gas company said they have shored up the facility, including replacing the inner steel tubing on all operating wells and conducting continuous ambient methane monitoring. All wells at the site are subject to real-time pressure readings and visual inspections four times a day, among other protocols, SoCalGas said.

""Over the past 10 years, SoCalGas has conducted comprehensive safety reviews and implemented multiple safety layers that protect one of California's most important assets for energy reliability and affordability,"" the company said.

While the maximum allowable operating pressure at the site remains reduced—about 3,183 pounds per square inch compared with 3,600 pounds per square inch in 2015—state officials recently voted to let SoCalGas increase storage at the facility to 68.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas from 41 billion cubic feet, outraging many in the community.

But experts say there are silver linings to the disaster. California overhauled its underground natural gas storage regulations to make them the strongest in the nation and among the strongest in the world, according to Peltz, of the Environmental Defense Fund. The changes include more thoughtful rules for well construction, better monitoring and risk management, and improved planning and emergency response.

Congress reacted to the disaster by requiring its regulatory agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, to issue safety standards for natural gas storage nationwide. In 2016, it adopted best practices recommended by the American Petroleum Institute, which were strengthened at the beginning of this month.

Many states with natural gas storage previously had no regulations at all, Peltz said.

""On a national basis, the systems will be safer as a result of that change,"" he said.

There have been technological advancements too. The infrared aerial recording of the leak captured in 2015 was a relatively new technique at the time, but has now become commonplace. The California Air Resources Board conducted its first large-scale statewide aerial methane survey in 2016, identifying many of the largest methane sources in the state.

There have also been considerable advancements in the ability to observe methane super-emitters through satellites and remote sensors, according to Seth Shonkoff, executive director at the science research institute PSE Healthy Energy and an associate researcher at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.

""The rub is that we know more than we ever have, and we're perhaps controlling more than we would have if we didn't have the technology to see them, but we're still seeing more and more of these large-scale emission events all across the United States and all across the world,"" he said.

Methane concentrations in the atmosphere are still rising. It is streaming, often constantly, from facilities associated with the oil and gas industry, landfills and dairy farms, among other sources.

Methane isn't the only concern either. Researchers now have a better understanding of what's in the gas that blew from Aliso Canyon and that continues to be stored in natural gas facilities around the country. Although it is primarily composed of methane, roughly 99% of samples analyzed by Shonkoff and his team have contained hazardous air pollutants such as benzene, hexane and toluene, largely as a result of commingling with depleted oil and other subsurface materials.

Moving forward, he said, it will be critically important for gas companies to disclose to regulators and risk managers what their gas is composed of, so that if it leaks, responders can quickly determine the appropriate response.

""If we had had that with Aliso Canyon, we could have, within a matter of hours, understood whether people should get out of the way or stay inside, and we wouldn't have had as many people suffering from health symptoms,"" Shonkoff said.

In 2024, the Biden administration passed the first comprehensive rules to limit methane pollution by fining oil and gas developers for excessive emissions. But this year, the Trump administration revoked the rule, which it described as a tax.

At the same time, many natural gas storage facilities across the country are old and require retrofitting to meet current regulations, but such upgrades can be slow and expensive—often leaving ratepayers on the hook.

Residents near Aliso Canyon have also long feared an earthquake or wildfire in the area. The gas field sits along the Santa Susana fault and is in a high fire hazard severity zone. SoCalGas says it has numerous safety plans and procedures in place.

Perhaps the greatest tension remains between those who wish to see Aliso Canyon shuttered and the officials who say the facility is critically important to California's energy supply, which is increasingly trying to serve power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

California has committed to reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2045. But SoCalGas says it still needs Aliso Canyon.

""SoCalGas is aligned with the state of California in pursuing the technologies and infrastructure that supports California's climate plan, including clean renewable hydrogen and renewable natural gas, that could, over time with other renewable energy projects, deliver the reliability and affordability Aliso Canyon supports today,"" the utility said in a statement.

However, any decision to reduce or eliminate operations at Aliso Canyon must be based on genuine reduced demand that is permanent, the company said.

Pakucko, of Save Porter Ranch, noted that the facility was offline for two years after the blowout without an interruption in service.

""Two years!"" he said. ""And guess what? We managed without the facility.""

For others in the area, it feels like the latest in a string of broken promises.

Among SoCalGas's settlement agreements was a $120 million consent decree with the state of California requiring the utility to fund methane mitigation projects, air monitoring and other initiatives to address alleged harms caused by the blowout. About $25 million of that went toward a long-term health study on the effects of natural gas exposure, which is being conducted by researchers at UCLA. The results are eagerly awaited.

About $26 million went to a program for dairy digesters in the Central Valley, which capture methane from cow manure before it enters the atmosphere. Many had hoped those funds would be spent closer to home, including former L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who at one point envisioned the mitigation money being used to transform Porter Ranch into a net-zero community.

""That would have been so great,"" said Patty Gleuck, a Porter Ranch resident who served on the community advisory group for the health study. Instead, ""that money went to this dairy digester program that does not benefit this area.""

Like Pakucko, Gleuck recalled suffering health effects during the blowout, including a tightness in her chest and a metallic taste in her mouth that dissipated when she left the area and resumed when she returned.

She still suffers from a chronic cough and uses an inhaler, she said, adding that ""a lot of inhalers were prescribed in the area.""

""A lot of people moved away, taking a loss on their homes because they were so sick, or their family members were sick,"" she said. ""I just don't think that there has been justice.""

Dana Investment Narrative Recap

Shareholders in Dana must believe in the company’s ability to convert operational efficiency and electric vehicle content growth into sustained profitability, despite its increased concentration in the North American light vehicle market. The recent decision to close the Detroit and Auburn Hills factories signals near-term turbulence for Dana’s electrification narrative, but the closures do not appear to materially change the most important short-term catalyst: executing on existing backlogs and maintaining cost discipline. The biggest risk remains revenue sensitivity to order reductions among Dana’s largest OEM customers, as recently highlighted by these plant closures.

With these operational headwinds in mind, Dana’s continued declaration of a regular US$0.10 per share quarterly dividend stands out. This consistency could signal management’s commitment to capital returns even as challenges in both the EV segment and OEM demand affect visibility into future earnings streams.

By contrast, investors should be especially aware that the concentration of sales among a smaller group of automaker customers leaves Dana exposed if...

Dana's outlook forecasts $8.1 billion in revenue and $249.2 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on analysts' assumptions of a 6.4% annual revenue decline and an earnings increase of $221.2 million from current earnings of $28.0 million.

, a 24% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Simply Wall St Community members have published two fair value estimates on Dana, ranging from US$15.03 to US$24.57 per share. This variety of views comes as Dana faces elevated risks linked to heavy reliance on a handful of OEM relationships, highlighting how performance assumptions can differ widely among market participants.

In its complaint, ExxonMobil says it has for years publicly disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related business risks, but it fundamentally disagrees with the state’s new reporting requirements.

The company would have to use “frameworks that place disproportionate blame on large companies like ExxonMobil” for the purpose of shaming such companies, the complaint states.

Under Senate Bill 253, large businesses will have to disclose a wide range of planet-warming emissions, including both direct and indirect emissions such as the costs of employee business travel and product transport.

ExxonMobil takes issue with the methodology required by the state, which would focus on a company’s emissions worldwide and therefore fault businesses just for being large as opposed to being efficient, the complaint states.

The second law, Senate Bill 261, requires companies making more than $500 million annually to disclose the financial risks that climate change poses to their businesses and how they plan to address them.

The company said in its complaint that the law would require it to speculate “about unknowable future developments” and post such speculations on its website.

A spokesperson for the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an email that it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/68fd45f85749f8.83462006.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-25 19:03:02.351185

Headquartered in Riyadh, Nextracker Arabia will combine Abunayyan’s 75 years of leadership in water and energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region with U.S.-based Nextracker’s global market share leadership in solar power plant technologies, advanced solar trackers, and yield management and control systems.

Nextracker Arabia will build on the unique experience and expertise in clean energy and solar innovation these two organizations bring to the new joint venture. This combination will best enable the new entity to advance Saudi Arabia’s clean energy transition while helping achieve the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 to diversify the economy and strengthen local industrial capacity.

The joint venture includes sales, engineering, and operations, and will assume ownership of Nextracker’s existing manufacturing facility in the Kingdom. This initial plant will play a key role in the production and distribution of Nextracker’s integrated solar power plant technologies for major utility-scale and distributed generation projects in Saudi Arabia and across the MENA region. These technologies will include Nextracker’s advanced solar trackers, mechanical infrastructure, and yield management and control systems.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding CEO, said, “Nextracker has a proven track record of the highest performing solar power systems. Nextracker Arabia will represent a powerful new platform built on shared values of sustainability and responsibility as well as a commitment to maximizing the potential of solar energy to lead MENA’s clean energy future. Together, we can deliver highly efficient, cost-effective clean energy at scale to help drive long-term social and economic growth in Saudi Arabia and across the region.”

With this new joint venture and initial manufacturing facility, we will build a strong local supply chain that brings production closer to our customers, enhances self-reliance, and delivers the high performance and reliability that our customers value. We are proud to invest in the Kingdom’s clean energy future and Saudi Arabia’s leadership in the energy transition across the MENA region.”

By localizing the sales, engineering, manufacturing and distribution of its products in Saudi Arabia, Nextracker Arabia can most effectively contribute to increasing the important role solar energy will play in helping to achieve national and regional energy transition objectives. Saudi Arabia has a goal of deploying 130 gigawatts of clean energy by 2030, with solar playing a critical role in achieving this objective.

The MENA region is emerging as a global solar energy leader. With increasing cost competitiveness and government-backed clean energy strategies, the region is accelerating its renewable energy transition. According to the Middle East Solar Industry Association (MESIA) 2025 Solar Outlook Report, MENA’s solar capacity could exceed 180 GW by 2030. In 2024 alone, installed capacity reached 24 GWac, up 25% from the previous year, and is expected to surpass 30 GW by year-end.

Nextracker has a strong legacy of reliable performance in Saudi Arabia, starting with KSA’s first utility-scale installation, the 405 MW Sakaka Solar Park where the company’s system has demonstrated exemplary reliability. Partnering with developers in the Middle East and Africa, Nextracker has delivered more than 6 GW of solar projects across the region, including more than 3 GW in Saudi Arabia. Landmark projects with Nextracker systems include 1.17 GW of the Al Kahfah project, the 449 MW Tabarjal project, and 904 MW of the Sudair project.

Turki Al-Amri, Abunayyan Holding’s chief executive officer, is expected to serve as both chairman of the board and chief executive officer for the new joint venture. Rajeev Kashyap, senior vice president and general manager for Nextracker Middle East, India, and Africa (MEIA), is expected to serve as chief operating officer for Nextracker Arabia.

Hyundai's leadership team outlined its plans in New York, reaffirming a commitment to achieving 5.55 million global vehicle sales by 2030, with a large portion of these being electrified.

Speaking at the event, José Muñoz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hyundai Motor Company, detailed Hyundai’s transformation into a global mobility leader.

He said that electrified vehicles are expected to account for 60% of total sales, reaching 3.3 million units, with strong growth forecast in North America, Europe, and Korea. This move towards electrification is a central pillar of Hyundai’s forward-looking vision.

""In an industry facing major transformation, Hyundai is uniquely positioned to win through our unmatched combination of compelling products, manufacturing flexibility, technology leadership, outstanding dealer partners and global scale,” says José.

He adds: “We are delivering comprehensive electrified portfolios across all segments, localising production in key markets and leveraging breakthrough technologies from software-defined vehicles to next-generation batteries.”

Electrification and product portfolio

Hyundai’s strategy reinforces its target of 5.55 million global vehicle sales by 2030, with sustainability goals of EVs reaching 3.3 million units by that year. This includes the introduction of over 18 new hybrid models.

Hyundai also intends to enter one of the industry's largest segments with the launch of its first mid-size pickup truck within the next five years.

A key part of its electric vehicle expansion includes the introduction of Extended Range EV (EREV) models, scheduled for launch in 2027. Unlike conventional approaches, Hyundai’s EREVs will utilise in-house high-performance batteries.

This design could achieve full EV power performance with less than half the battery capacity of some competitors, providing full electrification over a range of more than 600 miles.

Commitment to sustainable manufacturing

These ambitions are aligned with Hyundai’s ‘Progress to Humanity’ vision.

Hyundai says this ""reflects our belief that advancing emissions-free mobility is not only sound business, but a shared responsibility to ensure cleaner air, stronger economies, and a better quality of life for future generations"".

In Hyundai's 2025 Sustainability Report, José discussed this commitment further: “Our commitment to achieving 100% renewable energy (RE100) across our businesses is taking shape through large-scale renewable energy purchase agreements in Korea, the US, and India. We’re also maximising water recycling and working towards our ultimate goal of carbon neutrality by 2045.”

This dedication extends to its manufacturing footprint. José outlined how the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA) is projected to reach a total production capacity of 500,000 units by 2028.

This expansion in Georgia, US, will involve a US$2.7bn investment over three years. Hyundai aims to produce more than 80% of vehicles sold in the US domestically by 2030, a move that will increase supply chain content from 60% to 80%.

Manufacturing improvements also include the implementation of software-defined factories, where software is central to controlling and optimising production processes for greater efficiency.

Luxury brand and financial strategy

Hyundai's luxury brand Genesis is celebrating its 10th anniversary and 1,000,000 cumulative sales. According to José, Genesis aims to reach 350,000 annual sales by 2030, expanding its presence in up to 20 European markets while strengthening US-based production and EREV launches.

Seung Jo (Scott) Lee, Hyundai’s Chief Financial Officer, detailed Hyundai’s financial strategy, which includes an increase in target revenue by 5-6%. Hyundai also adjusted its OPM target to 6-7%. A KRW 77.3tn investment is planned for research and development capital expenditure and strategic investment.

Looking ahead, José reiterated Hyundai's direction: “We’re not just adapting to change - we’re leading it. Through our commitment to electrification, our investment in software-defined vehicles, our focus on manufacturing excellence, and our dedication to treating every customer like an honoured guest, we’re building the mobility company of the future.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/2c87f83d2b1a2ea81dc18dd674d94479:fbc9afb53781f4807757d33c6620d155/mk01.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 19:18:06.445019

The older I get, the more I believe that in most instances, what we’ve often thought to be coincidences — or the referenced “blind porcine” variety — turned out to have been divinely appointed.

A few days ago, tools in hand, I was restoring a screw in the mortar at our front door. From it hangs a small sign for doorbell ringers who’d like to sell us something. The words “No Solicitors” cause some “peddlers” to pass on by. (Would that we could hang such a sign on the telephone to warn us that roofers “happen to be in the area” and inquiries if our home is for sale.) …

As I prepared to re-attach the sign, I noticed a jovial guy ringing doorbells in our cul-de-sac; there was obviously friendly banter during brief doorway conversations. As he approached our abode, I aimlessly asked a four-worded question: “What are you selling?”

He saw the sign, asking, “Do you really want to know? If you’re serious, I’m selling solar power.”

Over the past decade, I’ve had telephone solicitations from companies wanting to “set us up” with solar power, save us money, protect the environment and provide electricity when traditional delivery fails during overloads or damaged power lines. Usually, there was mention that systems would pay for themselves over two or three decades. At my age of 88, I always felt like the guy who was sentenced to 300 years in prison. Hearing the plaintiff confess that he didn’t know if he could live that long, the judge answered, “Just do the best you can.” …

“Our program conversion is provided without charge, saves you money and both delivers and stores electricity,” C. J. Pilling assured as I invited him inside. Despite my haunting too-good-to-be-true fears, he had the right answer to every question.

I called a knowledgeable friend who offered “go-for-it” advice. Sure enough, everything promised has been done on time or sooner, and our new “flat rate” monthly bill is down by 20%. We have all new electrical stuff, with solar panels on the sunny side of the roof. And, there’s more! The first three months of solar power are free.

Turns out that our panels are harnessing more power than we need; it goes back on the grid. With batteries now fully charged, we can withstand black-outs for days at a time. How smug we felt — one week after our new electrical delivery system was operative — when there was a four-hour power failure affecting a thousand homes in our part of the city. We remained “electrified.” …

And, there’s more!

The company maintains warranties and pays insurance on the system. Customers need not own any equipment to get solar and battery benefits.

I’m not used to so many upsides, and my hard-to-convince brother — far better able to detect downsides without sliding into them — is going solar himself.

He lives in Dallas, also near electrical grids vital to the solar program. Sadly, grids are not available in all states, or in all parts of Texas. …

There’s space to mention only a few advantages of solar energy, and I’m discovering more each week.

Further, I know that it’s awkward contacting someone whose job it is to reach you. Contact me if you want more information. This is kinda like bragging about gasoline mileage on an e-car, which, by the way, could be charged nightly at zero cost in my garage. But, I’m not currently fixated on buying a car that plugs in.

Near-Term Growth from Data Centers: Surging power demand from AI and data center customers is driving infrastructure spending and boosting AEP’s regulated rate base.","Overview

American Electric Power (AEP) is one of the biggest publicly traded electric utilities in the US, based out of Columbus, Ohio. Its bread and butter is regulated utility operations—think power generation, transmission, and making sure lights stay on across 11 states. That happens through subsidiaries including AEP Ohio, Indiana Michigan Power, Appalachian Power, and Southwestern Electric Power Company. AEP also runs a transmission division (AEP Transmission), which happens to control the country’s largest high-voltage grid, plus a retail energy branch (AEP Energy) for residential and business customers. Its AEP Renewables wing builds out wind, solar, and hydro projects in line with its aims to cut carbon. The US electric utility sector is known for steady cash flows, a lot of regulation, and big infrastructure spending. AEP competes with other industry heavyweights like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy, and Dominion Energy by leaning on its massive 40,000-mile transmission system and strong state-level ties. Its business model—centered on regulated rates and cost recovery—gives it a sturdy market position. surging energy demand from data centers and the broader electrification trend is creating more opportunities, but AEP still has to navigate regulatory hearings, approval processes, and shifting renewable energy rules.

Recent Performance

From October 2024 to October 2025, AEP shares delivered a 20.25% return, beating the S&P 500’s 16.53% gain. What fueled the outperformance? Strong fundamental results—commercial demand jumped 12.3%, and they exceeded first-quarter EPS targets. Toss in news of a ramped-up capital investment plan and a $1.6 billion Department of Energy loan guarantee for transmission upgrades, and investors clearly liked what they saw. The common thread: AEP’s consistent plan to benefit from soaring power usage, especially thanks to the data center and AI boom.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

AEP’s reported sales grew 6.38% in the past year, a solid showing, though still trailing the market average of 8.73%. Its five-year capital spending plan is being kicked up a notch—from $54 billion to $64 billion, with the possibility of going all the way to $70 billion under new proposals. That’s aimed at modernizing the grid, integrating renewables, and keeping up with the electricity appetite of data centers. Rate hikes tied to these projects—if regulators give the green light—should keep revenue and earnings trending up. On top of that, AEP’s geographic spread over 11 states and its growing fleet of wind and solar assets mean it has more levers for future growth.

Quality & Moat

AEP’s regulated model means reliable cash flows, reflected in its 25.67% operating margin—a notch above the market’s 18.32%. Its 6.84% return on invested capital isn’t high compared to the market average of 11.03%, but that’s typical for heavily regulated, infrastructure-heavy utilities. The management team’s got a reputation for disciplined cash spending, as seen in timely rate filings and cost recovery. Its net debt/EBITDA ratio is high at 5.25 (market average is just 1.41), thanks to big spending on new projects, but it can still comfortably cover its interest under current regulatory rules. Free cash flow has dipped negative (–3.52% yield) as spending accelerates, but AEP should be able to generate healthy cash again once all these upgrades finish and new rates kick in.

Valuation

At a forward P/E of 16.66x, AEP’s stock is priced below the market average (25.95x), offering a potential buffer for risk-averse investors. Its EV/Sales of 5.20x is a bit higher than the market’s 4.55x. That’s a nod to its high-quality regulated assets and predictable future cash flows. The lower-than-market earnings multiple makes sense given AEP’s current period of heavy spending and slow growth. Once these big investments move onto the regulated rate base, there’s a chance valuation could climb closer to industry peers.

Market Sentiment

Market mood is a bit of a mixed bag. AEP’s beta is just 0.17, which makes it one of the most defensive stocks out there with little correlation to the broader market. In the past couple of months, AEP shares have sat about 3.48% above their 50-day moving average, hinting at some gentle upward momentum. Annualized volatility at 15.48% is well below the market’s average of 25.65%, underlining AEP’s steady-as-she-goes profile. Short interest is around 4.1% of the float, with a 6.6-day cover ratio, but it’s actually falling (down 6.3% in the past month), suggesting bears are starting to back off. Institutional holders make up over 85% of the shares, showing broad support from professionals. Insiders own under 0.1%, so management’s interests are lined up with shareholders for the long run.

Key Risks

Regulatory Risk: AEP has to play by the rules in rate-regulated markets. Any unfavorable rulings from state Public Utility Commissions or federal regulators on allowed returns or how costs get passed to customers could hit revenues and profit margins.

Leverage and Interest Rates: AEP’s net debt/EBITDA of 5.25x is a lot higher than your typical company. If interest rates go up or AEP faces tough refinancing conditions, its cost of borrowing could rise and its free cash flow could tighten.

Execution of Capex Plan: Pumping $64–70 billion into new projects is no small feat. There’s always the chance of delays, higher costs than expected, or slow-moving approvals from regulators, all of which could weigh down returns.

Commodity and Operational Risks: Most of the business is shielded by regulation, but AEP still has exposure to swings in fuel costs for gas-powered plants, extreme weather disruptions, and risks linked to keeping the grid reliable.

Bull Case

Stable Regulated Cash Flows: With predictable revenue and earnings from its cost-plus rate structure, AEP protects margins and limits how much downturns can hurt.

Near-Term Growth from Data Centers: Surging power demand from AI and data center customers is driving infrastructure spending and boosting AEP’s regulated rate base.

Undemanding Valuation: A forward P/E of 16.7x gives AEP a valuation cushion compared to both its peers and the wider market.

Strong Transmission Network: Owning the nation’s largest high-voltage transmission system lets AEP benefit from FERC-approved returns—a durable competitive strength.

Defensive Profile: Low beta (0.17) and below-average volatility (15.5%) make this stock attractive for investors who want income and peace of mind.

Bear Case

Heavy Capital Expenditure: Spending heavily on new infrastructure in the near-term could keep free cash flow negative and leverage high, delaying any major credit improvements.

Regulatory Uncertainty: AEP’s ability to turn investment into profit depends on favorable rate cases. Rulings that cut allowed returns or refuse cost recovery could put a lid on earnings growth.

Modest Growth Prospects: Sales growth around 6.4% is solid for a utility, but it trails the broader market. That limits AEP’s prospects for getting awarded higher valuation multiples.

Low ROIC: Return on invested capital is below the market average, typical for utilities, but it does raise questions about how efficiently management is using shareholders’ money.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Expected around November 6, 2025. The big things to watch: updated EPS, new guidance on capex, and any updates on ongoing rate cases.

FERC Transmission Rate Case: A key decision on AEP Transmission’s cost-of-service filing is due in late 2025, which will set allowed returns on new and existing grid investments.

State Rate Cases: Pending decisions in Ohio and Texas about rate adjustments tied to grid upgrades. Expect outcomes in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Capital Plan Announcement: AEP will formally unveil its $64–$70 billion five-year capex plan in November 2025, with detailed timelines on what gets built when.

Investment Conclusion

For patient, income-focused investors, AEP offers a way to tap into steady, regulated cash flows, bolstered by its low volatility, defensive profile, and robust transmission network. Its shares look attractively priced relative to the broader market. That said, the utility is in a period of heavy investment, with leverage running high and a fair bit hanging on getting regulatory approvals right. Anyone thinking about adding AEP to their portfolio should weigh the reliability of its dividend income and growth against the risk that regulatory or execution hiccups could make free cash flow tight or slow down earnings progress.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-10-25 18:18:31.938291

“We have found that some of the suppliers were not aware that their neighbors or their suppliers are based in the region. Some within a few miles, some several miles away. They did not know,” Carrera explained. “It is a win-win because some of these companies were getting their raw materials from suppliers outside the state. So it's been a very positive outcome, one that we thought might happen.”

Carrera added: “We weren't doing this (the Binational Autocluster project) to get into the matchmaking business, but we're more than happy to help that process out.”

The RGG Business Journal secured an interview with Carrera at the end of a South Texas Manufacturers Association meeting that was held at the Harlingen Convention Center.

The executive director of STMA, Mike Willis, had asked Carrera if he had any updates to share with the audience. He did. He spoke about the early success of the Binational Autocluster project.

Willis then explained to the audience what COSTEP is and what the Binational Autocluster project is all about.

""For those of you who are not familiar, COSTEP is a regional economic development group. They go to trade shows all over the world. They try to attract companies to our region,"" Willis said.

""They are trying to map out information about all the companies on both sides of the river that are in the automotive business to help show that to foreign prospects to try to see what kind of supply chain they could have if they located to northern Tamaulipas or especially the Rio Grande Valley. So, that is what that is for.”

In his in-depth interview with the Business Journal, Carrera also spoke about his attendance of the 50th National INDEX Convention, held in Mexico City. He said it was an excellent convention. INDEX is the trade association of the maquiladora industry in Mexico.

Carrera also spoke about a site selector conference he will be attending soon in Orlando, Florida.

Here, below, is an audio recording of the interview. It includes an introduction by STMA’s Willis.

Memorandum of Understanding

Meanwhile, at the INDEX convention in Mexico City that Carrera was talking about, COSTEP signed a Memorandum of Understanding.

The agreement, with INDEX Nacional, seeks to enhance competitiveness, attract investment, and foster industrial development along the Rio South Texas–Tamaulipas corridor, or Rio South Texas, as COSTEP calls it.

Adam Gonzalez, COSTEP’s CEO, said the signing formalizes decades of cross-border collaboration between the maquiladora industry in northern Mexico and economic development organizations of South Texas. He said both institutions share a common vision: to promote sustainable industrial growth, technological innovation, and binational workforce development as drivers of regional prosperity.

“Our region has grown shoulder to shoulder with INDEX — not just through trade, but through projects, shared families, and a shared commitment to progress,” Gonzalez said. “This MOU represents our pledge to continue working together to attract investment, accelerate binational development, and strengthen the manufacturing ecosystem that sustains thousands of families on both sides of the border.”

Humberto Martínez is president of INDEX Nacional. He said the MOU highlighted reinforces a long-term strategy for competitiveness.

“The future of our region will not be built in isolation, but through collaboration,” Martínez. “This partnership with COSTEP ensures that our industry continues to expand, innovate, and generate opportunities in a global environment increasingly shaped by nearshoring.”",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20251025-164559-d0a-Rick_Carrera.JPG,N,,2025-10-25 20:03:57.742619

Hydropower contributed 27 percent of total U.S. utility-scale renewable electricity generation and 5.86 percent of total utility-scale electricity production in 2024. The U.S. first started developing its hydropower fleet in the late 1800s, long before other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.

Hydropower plants produce electricity using the elevation difference created by a dam or diversion structure. Water flows in one side and exits at a lower point, spinning a turbine, which runs a generator to produce electricity. However, of the more than 90,000 dams in the United States, fewer than 3 percent produce power, with the others being used for recreation, farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

While there is huge potential for hydropower in the United States, many of the existing facilities are getting older and more expensive to maintain. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was launched under the Biden administration provides $753.6 million to the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) for hydropower, but significantly more funding would be required to expand rather than solely maintain the country’s hydropower capacity.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects hydropower generation to rise by 7.5 percent in 2025, after falling by 241 billion kilowatt-hours (BkWh) in 2024, to its lowest generation since 2010. Generation is expected to reach 259.1 BkWh this year, to contribute around 6 percent of U.S. electricity production. Approximately half of the hydropower generating capacity in the U.S. is in the western states of Washington, Oregon, and California.

Energy experts suggest that now may be a make-or-break moment for hydropower, as several existing facilities require high quantities of funding to extend their lifespans. Almost 450 hydroelectric plants, which contribute over 16 GW of electricity in total, are due to be relicensed across the U.S. over the next 10 years. This accounts for around 40 percent of non-federal hydropower.

However, the introduction of stricter requirements will require millions of dollars to be spent on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit for existing facilities, which is forcing many companies to close operations. Many of these plants have been providing vast quantities of stable, clean electricity for decades. However, the falling costs associated with natural gas, wind, and solar power have made it increasingly difficult for hydropower to compete.

Most dams in the U.S. have an average age of 65 years, meaning they were built without the same consideration for the environment that is now expected for hydropower development. Upgrading old facilities to enable the unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife, as well as meeting other environmental standards, would be extremely expensive for operators. In addition, many of these facilities require significant investment to fix or replace turbines and other hardware that have atrophied over time.

Another barrier to relicensing is the lack of clear oversight for the sector. No single agency has full authority over hydropower. This can make the bureaucratic process for a new license extremely complex, as various agencies may have different standards and expectations for operators. At present, it takes an average of eight years to relicense an existing hydropower facility, which is far longer than for other energy sources.

In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department expanded a renewable energy rule to include hydropower, which treats facilities as new if operators reinvest a minimum of 80 percent of the facility’s market value into infrastructure upgrades, making them eligible for larger federal write-offs. Only one hydropower facility has used the federal investment tax credit to date, as, until recently, there was a lack of clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

While President Trump has been highly critical of many renewable energy sources, hydropower is one of the few clean energies that Trump appears to support. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserves the sector’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years, which could help reassure investors.

There have been some positive signs for the hydropower sector in recent months, with the signing of a $3 billion hydropower deal between Google and Brookfield Asset Management in July. Google hopes the project will provide up to 3 GW of hydropower for its data centres. The move includes 20-year power purchase agreements for two hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania. The two sites are expected to be upgraded and relicensed as part of the arrangement, and Google aims to eventually expand the deal beyond the two initial sites to other parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, the company said.

“This collaboration with Brookfield is a significant step forward, ensuring clean energy supply in the PJM region where we operate,” Google’s head of data centre energy, Amanda Peterson Corio, said in a statement.

To enable hydropower plants to continue providing a significant proportion of the United States’ clean electricity, significant funding must be contributed to the sector to make facilities eligible for relicensing. Many plants require millions of dollars in upgrades, which most operators simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, the falling cost of gas, solar, and wind power has made hydropower less competitive in recent years, despite its long history in the U.S. and significant contribution to the country’s clean energy mix.

,EVs,2025-10-25 20:02:51+00:00,EVXL.co,Read Rivian CEO's Memo On 600+ Layoffs: What He Said—And What He Didn't,"Haye Kesteloo, www.facebook.com, haye.kesteloo",,,,,https://evxl.co/2025/10/25/read-rivian-ceos-memo-on-600-layoffs/,"Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe sent an internal memo to employees Thursday announcing the company’s third workforce reduction in four months, cutting roughly 600 jobs as the electric vehicle maker struggles with collapsed post-tax-credit demand.
The Memo: Corporate Speak Meets Crisis Management In the memo viewed by Business Insider, Scaringe framed the cuts as strategic positioning rather than desperate measures.
The memo outlined two primary organizational changes, both affecting customer-facing functions that generate no revenue during Rivian’s current production constraints.
Yet Scaringe’s memo reads like a routine organizational efficiency exercise, complete with org-chart minutiae about which VP reports to which interim executive.
The corporate euphemisms—“structural adjustments,” “changing operating backdrop,” “scaling our go-to-market functions”—carefully avoid the uncomfortable truth that Rivian is in crisis mode.","Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe sent an internal memo to employees Thursday announcing the company’s third workforce reduction in four months, cutting roughly 600 jobs as the electric vehicle maker struggles with collapsed post-tax-credit demand. The carefully worded message emphasized “structural adjustments” for the upcoming R2 launch while conspicuously avoiding the financial crisis threatening the company’s survival.

The layoffs—affecting approximately 4.5% of Rivian’s 15,000-person workforce—come just one day after Scaringe promoted the company’s ALSO e-bike spinoff to media, highlighting the jarring contrast between Rivian’s public optimism and private cost-cutting. The timing speaks volumes about the EV startup’s precarious position as it races to launch the $45,000 R2 SUV in early 2026 while burning through what remains of its once-massive cash reserves.

The Memo: Corporate Speak Meets Crisis Management

In the memo viewed by Business Insider, Scaringe framed the cuts as strategic positioning rather than desperate measures. “With the launch of R2 in front of us and the need to profitably scale our business, we have made the very difficult decision to make a number of structural adjustments to our teams,” he wrote. “These changes result in a reduction in the size of our team by roughly 4.5%.”

The CEO acknowledged the human cost with measured corporate language: “These are not changes that were made lightly. With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions. This news is challenging to hear, and the hard work and contributions of the team members who are leaving are greatly appreciated.”

But what’s most revealing isn’t what Scaringe said—it’s what he carefully avoided mentioning. The memo makes zero reference to the September 30 expiration of federal EV tax credits, which eliminated up to $7,500 in savings for new EV buyers under President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” It doesn’t acknowledge this is the third layoff round since June. And it certainly doesn’t mention that Rivian has burned through more than $12 billion since its 2021 IPO, with less than $6 billion remaining and quarterly losses exceeding $1 billion.

Reorganization Details: Streamlining or Scrambling?

The memo outlined two primary organizational changes, both affecting customer-facing functions that generate no revenue during Rivian’s current production constraints.

Customer Operations Consolidation: Scaringe announced integrating Vehicle Operations into the Service organization “to create fewer customer handoffs and clearer ownership.” Delivery and Mobile Operations will fold into Sales “to ensure the purchase experience is as seamless as possible with a single touchpoint throughout the entire sales process and to delivery.”

Marketing Restructure: Perhaps most telling, Rivian is consolidating multiple marketing functions into a single organization while searching for its first Chief Marketing Officer. Until that hire, Scaringe will serve as interim CMO—adding another executive role to his plate while the company fights for survival. “While we recruit our first Chief Marketing Officer, I will be acting as Interim CMO,” he wrote.

The CEO specifically named two teams reporting directly to him during the transition: the Marketing Experiences team led by Denise Cherry and the Creative Studio team under Matt Soldan. This level of detail about org-chart reshuffling while cutting hundreds of jobs reads more like damage control than strategic vision.

What The Memo Conveniently Omits

The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs Thursday, noting they primarily target sales, marketing, and customer service departments—leaving manufacturing operations untouched as Rivian prepares for R2 production ramp-up at its Normal, Illinois facility.

What Scaringe’s memo doesn’t mention is the broader context EVXL readers already know well. We’ve been documenting Rivian’s mounting struggles for months:

These cuts follow a 10% workforce reduction in February 2024 and additional layoffs in June

Rivian reported a $1.115 billion net loss in Q2 2025 on just 10,661 deliveries

The company announced a $250 million IPO fraud settlement the same day as these layoffs

Third-quarter 2025 EV sales hit records as buyers rushed to claim tax credits before the September 30 deadline, but that temporary spike masked the coming demand cliff

The memo’s reference to a “changing operating backdrop” is corporate euphemism for “federal tax credits that propped up our industry just vanished, and we’re about to find out if anyone will pay $45,000 for an R2 without government subsidies.”

The R2 Gambit: All-In On Affordable EVs

Scaringe called the R2 “an inflection point for us to become a company of the scale we aspire to be, which is producing many millions of cars a year” during Wednesday’s ALSO unveiling event. That ambitious vision contrasts sharply with Thursday’s workforce cuts targeting the very departments needed to sell those millions of vehicles.

The R2 launches in the first half of 2026 with a targeted starting price of $45,000, positioning it against the Tesla Model Y and Ford Mustang Mach-E in the competitive compact electric SUV segment. Rivian delivered 13,200 vehicles in the third quarter—a 32% year-over-year increase—but narrowed its full-year guidance to 41,500-43,500 units amid post-tax-credit uncertainty.

The company maintains it has sufficient capital to reach R2 production, bolstered by Volkswagen’s $5 billion joint venture investment. But with quarterly losses exceeding $1 billion and production volumes still in the low tens of thousands, Rivian is betting everything on the R2 resonating with mainstream buyers who no longer receive thousands in federal incentives.

EVXL’s Take

Let’s decode what’s really happening here. Rivian just announced its third workforce reduction in four months—a 4.5% cut following previous rounds that already slashed more than 10% of staff. The company settled a $250 million fraud lawsuit the same morning it sent this memo. And it’s burning through its remaining $6 billion in cash at more than $1 billion per quarter while producing vehicles in the low five figures.

Yet Scaringe’s memo reads like a routine organizational efficiency exercise, complete with org-chart minutiae about which VP reports to which interim executive. The corporate euphemisms—“structural adjustments,” “changing operating backdrop,” “scaling our go-to-market functions”—carefully avoid the uncomfortable truth that Rivian is in crisis mode.

This isn’t restructuring. This is a company desperately trying to reach the R2 launch with enough cash and credibility intact to convince consumers they’ll be around to honor warranties. The fact that Scaringe is taking on the interim CMO role himself while searching for a permanent hire suggests either leadership churn or an inability to attract top talent to a sinking ship—or both.

We’ve seen this movie before with EV startups. Lordstown Motors collapsed. Fisker filed for bankruptcy. Lucid keeps cutting staff while surviving on Saudi money. The difference is Rivian actually builds compelling vehicles and has a legitimate manufacturing operation. But compelling vehicles don’t matter if you run out of money before reaching profitable scale.

The R2 at $45,000 without tax credits needs to be good enough to steal significant market share from Tesla, Ford, and Hyundai. That’s a massive ask for a company that’s never turned a profit, just cut hundreds of customer-facing employees, and is asking its CEO to moonlight as CMO while running product development and operations.

Read Scaringe’s memo carefully. Notice what he emphasizes—organizational efficiency, R2 preparation, streamlined customer journeys. Then notice what he doesn’t mention—the third layoff round in four months, the collapsed tax credit support, the $250 million fraud settlement announced the same day, or the very real possibility that Rivian might not survive to see the R2’s second model year.

The corporate messaging is masterful. The underlying reality is terrifying.

Water flows in one side and exits at a lower point, spinning a turbine, which runs a generator to produce electricity. However, of the more than 90,000 dams in the United States, fewer than 3 percent produce power, with the others being used for recreation, farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

While there is huge potential for hydropower in the United States, many of the existing facilities are getting older and more expensive to maintain. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that was launched under the Biden administration provides $753.6 million to the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) for hydropower, but significantly more funding would be required to expand rather than solely maintain the country's hydropower capacity.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects hydropower generation to rise by 7.5 percent in 2025, after falling by 241 billion kilowatt-hours (BkWh) in 2024, to its lowest generation since 2010. Generation is expected to reach 259.1 BkWh this year, to contribute around 6 percent of U.S. electricity production. Approximately half of the hydropower generating capacity in the U.S. is in the western states of Washington, Oregon, and California.

Energy experts suggest that now may be a make-or-break moment for hydropower, as several existing facilities require high quantities of funding to extend their lifespans. Almost 450 hydroelectric plants, which contribute over 16 GW of electricity in total, are due to be relicensed across the U.S. over the next 10 years. This accounts for around 40 percent of non-federal hydropower.

However, the introduction of stricter requirements will require millions of dollars to be spent on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit for existing facilities, which is forcing many companies to close operations. Many of these plants have been providing vast quantities of stable, clean electricity for decades. However, the falling costs associated with natural gas, wind, and solar power have made it increasingly difficult for hydropower to compete.

Most dams in the U.S. have an average age of 65 years, meaning they were built without the same consideration for the environment that is now expected for hydropower development. Upgrading old facilities to enable the unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife, as well as meeting other environmental standards, would be extremely expensive for operators. In addition, many of these facilities require significant investment to fix or replace turbines and other hardware that have atrophied over time.

Another barrier to relicensing is the lack of clear oversight for the sector. No single agency has full authority over hydropower. This can make the bureaucratic process for a new license extremely complex, as various agencies may have different standards and expectations for operators. At present, it takes an average of eight years to relicense an existing hydropower facility, which is far longer than for other energy sources.

In January, the Biden administration's Treasury Department expanded a renewable energy rule to include hydropower, which treats facilities as new if operators reinvest a minimum of 80 percent of the facility's market value into infrastructure upgrades, making them eligible for larger federal write-offs. Only one hydropower facility has used the federal investment tax credit to date, as, until recently, there was a lack of clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

While President Trump has been highly critical of many renewable energy sources, hydropower is one of the few clean energies that Trump appears to support. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act preserves the sector's access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years, which could help reassure investors.

There have been some positive signs for the hydropower sector in recent months, with the signing of a $3 billion hydropower deal between Google and Brookfield Asset Management in July. Google hopes the project will provide up to 3 GW of hydropower for its data centres. The move includes 20-year power purchase agreements for two hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania. The two sites are expected to be upgraded and relicensed as part of the arrangement, and Google aims to eventually expand the deal beyond the two initial sites to other parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, the company said.

""This collaboration with Brookfield is a significant step forward, ensuring clean energy supply in the PJM region where we operate,"" Google's head of data centre energy, Amanda Peterson Corio, said in a statement.

To enable hydropower plants to continue providing a significant proportion of the United States' clean electricity, significant funding must be contributed to the sector to make facilities eligible for relicensing. Many plants require millions of dollars in upgrades, which most operators simply cannot afford. Meanwhile, the falling cost of gas, solar, and wind power has made hydropower less competitive in recent years, despite its long history in the U.S. and significant contribution to the country's clean energy mix.

When construction begins, this project is set to transform global perceptions of solar energy. Abu Dhabi has launched the world’s first gigascale renewable energy facility capable of providing continuous, “24 hours a day, 365 days a year” electricity using only solar power paired with massive battery storage. The facility is designed to meet the surging, overwhelming demand for reliable power in the AI era and support the next industrial wave, ensuring uninterrupted electricity for advanced technologies, data centres, and the innovations shaping the future. H.H. Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes’ Affairs, oversaw the groundbreaking of the facility, which combines 5.2 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaic panels with a 19-gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery storage system, capable of generating a full 1 GW of continuous baseload power.

What makes this project a world first

The sheer size is only part of the story. Traditional renewable energy faces a simple but stubborn problem: intermittency. Solar panels only produce electricity when the sun shines, and wind turbines when the wind blows. Until now, that has limited renewables’ ability to provide stable baseload power, forcing grids to rely on fossil fuels. This Abu Dhabi project overcomes that limitation through a combination of technological innovations at scale:

Gigascale battery storage: The 19 GWh system stores solar energy produced during peak sunlight in the day and releases it consistently through night-time and cloudy periods.

Grid-forming and black start capability: The system can stabilise the grid independently and even restart it if the network fails, ensuring unparalleled reliability.

Virtual power plant operation: It functions as a coordinated network of distributed resources, optimising energy dispatch across the site in real time.

AI-driven forecasting and intelligent dispatch: Advanced algorithms predict solar output and energy demand, managing the battery automatically to maintain uninterrupted supply.

Together, these features allow renewable energy to function as a true replacement for conventional baseload power plants, rather than just a supplementary source.

Scale and impact

The project spans roughly 1.5 times the size of Manhattan, covering 90 square kilometres (34.75 square miles) in the desert of Abu Dhabi, with a capital investment exceeding AED 22 billion (USD 5.94 billion). Once operational in 2027, it is expected to:

Create over 10,000 jobs and establish new manufacturing facilities.

Avoid approximately 5.7 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually, equivalent to removing more than a million cars from circulation.

Deliver electricity at a globally competitive tariff, demonstrating that renewables can be both sustainable and economically viable.

This facility is not only a national milestone but also a blueprint for countries worldwide aiming to decarbonise while meeting the rising demand for digital and AI-driven technologies, which require a steady, uninterrupted power supply.

A blueprint for the future

Developed by Masdar in partnership with Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC), the project builds on Masdar’s two decades of experience in renewable energy across more than 40 countries. By 2030, the company aims to achieve a 100 GW global clean energy portfolio. This Abu Dhabi project represents Masdar’s largest and most technologically ambitious initiative to date, proving that renewable energy can be scaled intelligently, reliably, and sustainably. In the words of the developers, the facility is more than a solar farm or a giant battery — it is a new standard for global energy innovation, capable of delivering consistent power for the information age and supporting the next generation of technological growth.

Every time the wind stops blowing, turbines stand still. For decades, this simple reality that renewable energy only works when nature cooperates has been the industry's most logically stubborn obstacle.

Abu Dhabi broke ground on what could be the solution. The emirate just launched construction on the world's first gigascale project capable of delivering round-the-clock baseload power from renewable sources alone. When operational in 2027, the Dh22-billion facility will produce one gigawatt of continuous clean electricity—enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes by pairing what will become the world's largest battery storage system.

The scale is staggering: The project spans an area comparable to Manhattan and features a 19-gigawatt-hour battery—large enough to store energy generated during peak sunlight and dispatch it seamlessly through the night and cloudy days. It's the energy equivalent of never letting the lights flicker, regardless of the weather.

""This project aligns with the UAE's leadership vision to decarbonise and innovate,"" Ibraheem Al Mansouri, Director of Engineering at Masdar, told Khaleej Times. ""This marks the start of a new era for renewable energy globally.""

Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes' Affairs, witnessed the groundbreaking of the facility developed by Masdar and Emirates Water and Electricity Company.

The timing addresses a critical global challenge. Renewable energy intermittency has limited solar and wind adoption because the bulk power system requires continuous current to literally ""keep the lights on."" Traditional power plants burn coal or gas around the clock, providing stable baseload power. Solar and wind couldn’t do that until this project.

""Being part of Masdar's journey from the early days and continuing to deliver first-of-its-kind projects globally is inspiring,"" Al Mansouri told Khaleej Times. ""This project changes the mindset about renewable energy and proves what's possible.""

Development will create more than 10,000 jobs and establish new manufacturing facilities across the UAE. The project represents one of the largest capital investments in renewable infrastructure globally.

The breakthrough builds on Masdar's two-decade track record developing renewable projects across 40 countries. Founded in 2006, the company is targeting 100 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by 2030. This Abu Dhabi facility represents its largest and most ambitious project to date.

When operational in 2027, the project will avoid approximately 5.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually equivalent to removing over one million cars from roads while delivering electricity at globally competitive tariffs.

This summer, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, ending various tax credits a decade ahead of schedule. The credits could be used to buy electric vehicles and to install solar panels on homes.

The EV tax credit expired last month. Residential solar tax credits are still available until the end of the year. But Kathy Kuntz, director of Dane County’s Office of Energy and Climate Change, told WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” that it’s unlikely people will be able to qualify for the credits in time unless they’ve already started the process.

“There’s a difference between buying a car and getting solar on your roof,” she said. “You can go to a dealership and buy a car in a couple of hours. It takes more planning to have all of the pieces in place, the permits and everything, to install solar on your house.”

“If people haven’t started yet, it’s probably not realistic for them to take advantage of the solar tax credits at this point,” she added. “If an installer is telling you ‘no problem’ and that they can get this done by the end of the year, you need to be a smart consumer and ask a lot of questions.”

Kuntz said most solar companies her office talks with are saying they’re booked through the year.

Burke O’Neal is a managing partner for Full Spectrum Solar, a solar installation company based in Madison. He told “Wisconsin Today” that the cancellation of the solar energy tax credits is hurting his business.

“It’s certainly been a bit challenging to change course,” O’Neal said. “We were expecting the residential and commercial tax credits through 2032. We were planning additional vehicle and tool purchases and adding electrical and roof installation crews, and we’re still planning to grow but it’s going to be at a slower pace than we expected.”

O’Neal said his company is offering a 5 percent discount to people if they schedule solar installations next year instead of this year to “keep the momentum going.”

Even without solar tax credits, Kuntz said there’s still an economic incentive for installing solar panels. She said the cost of installing solar panels has dropped by 90 percent since the early 2000s. She also said it’s a similar case with EVs becoming more cost-competitive with gas-powered cars.

O’Neal is trying to stay optimistic. He said energy costs for residential homes are up 35 percent in the last four years but solar installation costs remain stable. And as massive data centers around the country continue to drive up the demand and cost for electricity, O’Neal expects solar installations will remain popular.

“Maybe we’re a lot more resilient than we first felt when we learned about these (tax credit) changes,” he said.

The installations will eventually supply approximately 152,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of clean energy per month. This will enable the bank to reduce its monthly carbon footprint by over 89,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO₂).

""This partnership reflects our mission to enable African businesses to access sustainable power through innovative financing,"" said Terje Osmundsen, CEO of Empower.

Empower is among several actors expanding Norway's presence in African renewable energy. The company has already participated in several projects in Nigeria, including electrifying the Justrite retail chain. Its model addresses the growing corporate demand for reliable power solutions amid unstable public grids and the high cost of running diesel generators.

The deal with UBA underscores the growing adoption of solar power in Africa's private sector and strengthens Empower's position in the Nigerian market.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/03b2e34ee32779eb65b4bf5945debfd6_S.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 17:18:09.920808

Speakers in Friday's symposium offered a similar prescription for addressing strain on water infrastructure: working with data center operators and developers to reduce water use, flatten out swings in demand, and reduce strain on infrastructure.","LOWER SAUCON TWP., Pa. — As a surge of data center construction strains power and water infrastructure, experts met at Lehigh University’s Mountaintop Campus on Friday to prepare for a once-in-a-generation strain on — and potentially transformation of — these critical systems.

Before Friday’s guest speakers began their lectures and panel discussions, university Provost Nathan Urban took a moment to set the stage.

Urban referenced the Mountaintop Campus building where the symposium took place. Now Iacocca Hall, it was once the Homer Research Laboratories Complex, home to Bethlehem Steel’s most cutting-edge research and development projects.

The campus and the innovation it incubated were a powerful engine of last century’s economy, Urban said, while the buildings housing the beating heart of the next era of U.S. economic might well be data centers.

Supplying these new powerhouses will take difficult-to-comprehend amounts of water and electricity, plus careful management and thoughtful development.

Making it work could shape Pennsylvania’s economic outlook for decades to come.

“It's a complex puzzle, but one that I believe we can solve,"" Urban said. ""The conversations we have today are about more than servers and algorithms and electricity generation.

""They are about shaping a sustainable and prosperous future for the commonwealth.”

And those data centers are hungry. Depending on how it is configured, a midsize data center can use as much power and water as a small city.

As developers and technology companies stand up new data centers to supply the computing power undergirding the explosion of artificial intelligence, power and water infrastructure are already under pressure, showing no signs of easing.

Power demands

One of the greatest challenges for the grid, panelists said, will be bringing on enough power generation to meet surging demand.

PJM Interconnection, the organization responsible for balancing energy supply and demand across 13 states including Pennsylvania, expects 32 gigawatts of new electricity demand across the network over the next five years.

About 30 gigawatts of that demand, PJM Senior Director of Applied Innovation and Analytics Emanuel Bernabeu said, comes from new data centers.

PPL Electric Utilities expects to more than triple its peak load over the next 10 years, from about 7.5 gigawatts to nearly 22 gigawatts.

By comparison, from 2007 to 2023, average electricity demand stayed flat as efficiency improvements roughly matched growth.

The U.S. electric grid is already struggling with enough generation capacity, leading to higher costs and more frequent emergency alerts declaring that all of the grid’s power plants are running at full capacity.

Companies that build and operate power plants selling electricity to the grid have not stepped in to fill the gap, several panelists said.

Building a new power plant is a slow and expensive process.

While it may only take a year and a half to two years to build a data center, a new power plant can take two to three times as long to bring online.

The queue for new power plants to join the PJM grid is full through 2030. Currently, the grid controller has signed off on projects adding about 50 gigawatts of generation capacity.

With no silver bullet to quickly add more power to the grid, officials responsible for managing electric infrastructure must look for ways to reduce or shift power consumption.

For example, different cooling technology may help reduce power consumption at the cost of greater water consumption.

Giant batteries can give data center operators a way to draw less power from the grid during periods of peak demand. If data centers plan ahead, they can shift non-essential work to parts of the day when they aren’t competing with, say, residential air conditioning for limited electricity.

To combat limited supply and get projects up and running faster, some data center operators opt to build their own generators, either to supplement a typical power connection or to replace it entirely.

Utility companies may not have the legal authority to force their customers to take power cuts or shift operations to times when electricity is less scarce. Instead, grid managers rely on market forces to influence behavior and keep the supply of electricity in line with demand.

When there is not enough energy to meet demand, power prices rise. As a result, electricity users try to shift or minimize use; power plants may adjust how many generators they have online.

Because the venture-capital-backed companies standing up these new data centers are so flush with cash, price-based incentives do not accomplish much, Bernabeu said, whether that's higher peak power prices or multi-million-dollar payments to secure a grid connection.

Instead, he said, these operators are more motivated by getting up and running as quickly as possible.

Utilities and grid operators will see more success building reliable energy infrastructure by working to connect customers faster if they take steps like coordinating onsite battery storage, contributing their own power generation or allowing power to be cut off in a supply crunch, Bernabeu said.

The same AI technology threatening to overwhelm the electric grid could also help protect it, as machine learning helps operators better predict demand, model the electric grid’s behavior and deal with heavy loads.

Water needs

Data centers can also strain water resources, as the facilities can use as much as three million gallons of water per day to cool its chips, said Tony Nokovich, vice president of engineering for Pennsylvania American Water.

Much of this water evaporates in the process, so large data centers must continuously replace water as it is lost.

However, a data center’s water use can vary widely depending on the temperature outside, dropping to as little as 800 gallons per day during the winter, Nokovich said.

Huge swings in water use can harm water quality, as customers draw too little water to keep pipes from stagnating, or draw too much and lower pressure in the system.

Speakers in Friday's symposium offered a similar prescription for addressing strain on water infrastructure: working with data center operators and developers to reduce water use, flatten out swings in demand, and reduce strain on infrastructure.

Pennsylvania’s water infrastructure faced a similar explosion of demand with the beginning of the shale fracking boom about a decade and a half ago.

The fracking process requires large amounts of water, typically in more remote areas with limited amounts available. Meeting that demand required the same sort of thinking water infrastructure managers will need to address data centers, like installing on-site storage tanks to spread out a driller’s water needs over time.",https://static.lehigh-v.lehigh-valley.production.k1.m1.brightspot.cloud/dims4/default/45a71ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3273x1718+0+61/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flehigh-valley-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2Fd2%2Fa504cf14444ba085b3e44d21fe85%2Fpxl-20251024-145959284-mp.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:58:17.509863

The truck that once sparked year-long waitlists is now drawing dealer sighs and auction floors more than showroom excitement.

Via email, Xie said: “Right now, (Kelley Blue Book) prices for the Cybertruck are still inflated, and the demand just isn’t there.
Because demand has cooled and values are falling, the question arises: Is now the perfect time to jump in and get a deal?","The Cybertruck was supposed to be the future. Now, one California dealership says it’s a future nobody wants to buy.

In a viral TikTok, Jason Xie, general manager of Alfa Romeo of San Jose (@alfa.romeo.of.san.jose) laments that even Founders Editions of the eye-catching Tesla are “piling up” and losing value fast, leaving some to wonder if the hype bubble has finally burst.

“It's nice quality, but it's too odd-looking. I'm not crazy about the look of these,” Xie said in the clip that’s been viewed more than 589,000 times. “It's definitely unique, but I think for the price point, I would take a Rivian over this.”

Xie’s comments underscore a palpable shift in the market for Tesla’s first electric pickup. The truck that once sparked year-long waitlists is now drawing dealer sighs and auction floors more than showroom excitement. Xie’s take: “They just keep piling up… about 150 days in stock at least.” That anecdote offers a peek behind the hood of what some observers are calling the Cybertruck’s rapid descent from “must-have” to “must-dump.”

Cybertruck’s Hard Resale Future

Behind the humor lies hard data. Multiple sources show the Cybertruck is depreciating at a rate that would be alarming for almost any vehicle, especially for a truck that cost six figures when new. According to an analysis by CarEdge, a Cybertruck that sold for roughly $96,985 could drop to a resale value of about $50,888 after five years, a decline of nearly 48%. More starkly, a study by iSeeCars found the five-year depreciation for a new Cybertruck at about 60%, versus around 38.8% for light-duty pickups in general.

In some trade-in examples shared by Electrek, Cybertrucks lost as much as 34-45% of their value in just the first year. By that math, an owner who paid roughly $100,000 would see a trade-in estimate of about $60,000 after under 20,000 miles.

OWNERSHIP STORIES

Viral stories from across the web

Our team of experts tracks what owners are saying about car-shopping, repairs, the daily driving experience and more on social media.

That kind of depreciation is almost unheard of for a new truck, especially one positioned as Tesla’s flagship. Xie’s observation that “no one buys ’em” echoes the broader trend: Dealers, knowing the market risk, are avoiding piling inventory of Cybertrucks. The result: supply builds, discount expectations rise, and buyers begin to suspect something’s off.

So what’s behind the slide? For starters, the design is polarizing. The angular stainless-steel body and futuristic profile that once generated viral acclaim now attract mockery: social-media commenters liken the truck to a “dumpster truck” or deride its aesthetics altogether.

Meanwhile, insurance and repair sources signal elevated costs for the model. With parts still scarce, repair times long and some insurers reluctant to cover the vehicle, ownership risk grows. Combined with a heavy curb weight and a premium price tag—the base Founders Edition launched near $100,000—the package is less suited to mainstream truck buyers than Tesla may have hoped.

Then there’s the macro-market context. Tesla’s used-EV values broadly are under pressure, and the Cybertruck appears especially vulnerable. With dramatic price cuts, fewer buyers willing to pay top dollar for EV trucks, and competition heating up from the likes of Rivian R1T and Ford F‑150 Lightning, resale sentiment is shifting. In effect, what was once a status symbol is becoming a cautionary tale.

Via email, Xie said: “Right now, (Kelley Blue Book) prices for the Cybertruck are still inflated, and the demand just isn’t there. There’s probably more price correction ahead before things level out.

“In contrast, we’re already seeing parity for EVs from other brands like Porsche, Lucid, and Rivian. A two- to three-year-old model that’s still under factory warranty can often be had for 40-50% off its original MSRP, which makes it much more accessible to the general market. Interestingly, a lot of those buyers are former Tesla owners.”

Built For Bold Buyers

But here’s where the narrative takes a twist. Because demand has cooled and values are falling, the question arises: Is now the perfect time to jump in and get a deal? For a buyer who is aware of the risks and intends to hold long-term, Xie’s admission that Cybertrucks are “piling up” may signal opportunity. A previously scarce vehicle, now discounted, might appeal to a niche buyer who values uniqueness over resale proof.

Still, the caveats are meaningful. The steep initial depreciation means the next buyer must expect a downward value curve, unlike traditional trucks, which hold value more robustly. The lingering social perception issues and ownership cost risks around insurer wariness, and repair complexity remain. For most buyers, that means the question isn’t simply if they can score a bargain but whether the bargain is worth the trade-offs.

Anyone intrigued by the Cybertruck’s boldness who is prepared for a longer-term hold and doesn’t mind the attention it brings may indeed find a deal emerging. But if resale value, mainstream appeal and predictable ownership dynamics matter most, you may want to hold off or consider alternatives with stronger resale tracks and broader market support.

In the end, the image of a cracked slab of asphalt Xie points to in the video may be the most accurate metaphor: a once-shiny future vehicle weighing too much to land softly. The question now is whether it’s that crack in the pavement or the value-gap beneath the truck that you’re really looking at.

When legislatures toss aside fair maps, they’re not just shifting lines on paper.
Until every state plays fair, California has a duty to recognize reality and respond.
50 isn’t about rewriting the rules forever.
We fight back, and we fight fair.","I served in the Navy, and when I raised my hand, I swore an oath to defend the Constitution. That oath wasn’t partisan, and it didn’t expire when I took off the uniform. It still guides me today. The values I lived by in uniform — honor, courage, commitment — aren’t just for battlefields. They’re for moments like this, when democracy is under attack and sitting on the sidelines is not an option.

This November, Proposition 50 is on the ballot. It doesn’t rewrite the rules forever. It doesn’t dismantle our independent redistricting commission. What it does is ensure that when others rig the system, Californians won’t sit quietly and accept it.

Prop. 50 allows a mid-cycle redraw of California’s congressional maps, but only because others already crossed that line. Texas, Missouri, and others have taken the extraordinary step of tearing up fair maps in the middle of a cycle, at the behest of the White House, with one goal: to cheat their way to power. That’s not democracy; that’s manipulation. California didn’t pick this fight. But we will not sit back and let ourselves be silenced by rigged maps drawn in Austin or Jefferson City.

And let’s be clear: this isn’t an isolated scheme. What we’re seeing isn’t limited to redistricting. This administration has made a habit of bending or breaking the rules to hold onto power. Whether it’s undermining the Justice Department, stacking the courts, or rewriting the rules of our immigration system, the through-line is the same: cheat where you can, and dare anyone to stop you. Some of those fights are out of California’s hands. But when it comes to elections, when it comes to our maps and our representation in Congress, we can do something about it, and Prop. 50 is how we do it.

Here’s the key: this isn’t permanent. It’s a mid-cycle correction, nothing more. Once the next regular redistricting process begins, the independent commission takes back the reins. Prop. 50 is a shield, not a weapon. It says California will meet fire with fire, just long enough to stop one-sided manipulation from deciding the balance of power in Washington.

We’ve already seen attempts to overturn the will of the people. In 2020, the effort to undermine our democracy didn’t happen in whispers behind closed doors, it happened in full public view and people died. And those same tactics are being repeated today. Pretending otherwise is an invitation for history to repeat itself.

When legislatures toss aside fair maps, they’re not just shifting lines on paper. They’re silencing entire communities. They’re deciding in advance who wins and who loses. That’s not politics-as-usual, it’s cheating. And it breaks faith with the very idea of elections.

These aren’t just lines on a map. They decide whether a farmworker in the Central Valley has a representative who listens to her, or whether a military family in San Diego gets a voice in Washington. Gerrymandering doesn’t just redraw boundaries, it redraws lives. Californians understand that when our voices are erased, our futures are too.

Every person who has ever raised their right hand and taken the oath to serve in the military, to uphold the law, or to take public office, swore allegiance not to a party, not to a politician, but to the Constitution. That oath is a reminder that loyalty belongs to the people and to the rule of law.

When state legislatures contort themselves to please a single leader, they violate that sacred trust. They reduce themselves to servitude, ignoring the people they swore to represent. Californians should not, and will not, tolerate that kind of cowardice.

Prop. 50 reflects the Navy values I lived by. Honor demands we call out injustice when we see it. Courage demands we take action even when it’s uncomfortable. Commitment demands we hold the line until fairness is restored.

Critics will sneer that this is gerrymandering by another name. They’re wrong. Gerrymandering is about permanently locking in unfair advantage. Prop. 50 is temporary, reluctant, and necessary. It is a corrective measure until the referees, the independent commissioners, are allowed to do their jobs again.

It’s breathtaking hypocrisy when Republican-led legislatures rip up maps mid-cycle to entrench minority rule and call it “strategy.” Yet when California acts to defend itself, suddenly they call it “unfair.” That double standard isn’t just insulting, it’s un-American. Until every state plays fair, California has a duty to recognize reality and respond.

Fairness isn’t partisan, it’s patriotic. Veterans like me fought for democracy abroad because we believed it was worth defending. Now the fight is here at home.

California has always set the pace for America. On civil rights. On clean air. On consumer protections. Now it’s time to lead again by making clear that election-rigging has no home here. This isn’t about punishing politicians. It’s about protecting people. It’s about living up to our values of honor, courage, and commitment. And it’s about showing the country that democracy still belongs to the people.

The choice before us is clear: either California accepts a tilted playing field written in someone else’s statehouse, or we stand up and fight for a democracy that works for everyone. We’ve never been a state that backs down from a fight, not on civil rights, not on clean air, not on consumer protections. And we shouldn’t start now.

On Nov. 4, Californians can send a message far beyond our borders: we will defend fair play, accountability, and democracy. Because without fair play, democracy fails. Without accountability, power corrupts. Prop. 50 isn’t about rewriting the rules forever. It’s about refusing to let un-American power grabs in Texas, Missouri, or anywhere else dictate our future.

This is a one-time, mid-cycle stand forced upon us by cheaters.

Californians don’t bow to cheaters.

We fight back, and we fight fair.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author.
“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said.
“That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.” Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates.
“It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.” Gathrid, now a co-founder of an AI and data start-up, Krv Analytics, based in Los Angeles, said the framework’s open-source design makes it especially valuable.","Even as coal power continues its steady decline in the United States, more than a hundred plants still have no retirement plans — a gap large enough to derail national climate goals. A new study led by UC Santa Barbara researchers offers a way forward, showing how targeted, data-driven approaches could help accelerate the transition.

Published in Nature Energy, the study tackles a critical question: if market forces have already driven many coal plants to close, why are so many still running? Despite years of decline, roughly 105 gigawatts of coal capacity — representing 114 plants — are still slated to operate through 2035, even though a complete phaseout by that date is widely considered essential for meeting U.S. net-zero emissions goals.

“Coal is complex — there’s no single right way to deal with it,” said Sidney Gathrid ’22, the study’s lead author. “Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem. There’s no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.”

Working with Grace C. Wu, an assistant professor in the Environmental Studies Program and senior author on the paper, Gathrid and his team show that reaching those goals will require policymakers to move beyond age-based or one-size-fits-all approaches — and instead focus on the specific contexts that accelerate the retirement of certain coal plants.

To do that, the researchers — including Jeremy Wayland, Stuart Wayland ‘22, and Ranjit Deshmukh, an associate professor in the Environmental Studies Program and the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management — developed a new framework combining graph theory and topological data analysis to classify the entire U.S. coal fleet into eight distinct groups based on 68 technical, economic, environmental and socio-political factors. They also introduced a “contextual retirement vulnerability” score that measures how susceptible each plant is to early retirement by comparing it to facilities that have already announced closures.

The framework goes a step further by identifying “retirement archetypes” — patterns that explain why plants in each group are retiring. These range from regulatory and health-based drivers to unfavorable economics or political pressure, offering a clear set of levers that can be applied to similar facilities elsewhere.

“Instead of asking only why coal plants retire, we asked how we can make retirements happen faster — and in ways that are efficient and grounded in data,” Gathrid said. “Our framework helps policymakers and advocates identify where they can have the biggest impact.”

The study began as Gathrid’s senior thesis in UCSB’s Environmental Studies Program, supported by the campus’s Manalis Leadership Fellowship, sponsored by Howard and Lisa Wenger, and evolved into a years-long collaboration. Wu said the project’s scope and impact are rare for undergraduate research.

“This is Ph.D.-level work,” Wu said. “It’s extremely unusual for a project that started as a senior thesis to reach this level of sophistication and impact. What’s exciting is that this framework doesn’t just describe which plants might retire — it shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.”

Using their model, the team grouped 198 active U.S. coal plants into clusters such as High Health Impacts Plants, Expensive Plants, and Plants in Anti-Coal Regions, each linked to specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted with policy or advocacy. For example, plants associated with high asthma rates and poor air quality could be prioritized through public-health campaigns and environmental enforcement, while those struggling financially might respond more effectively to economic incentives or market-based mechanisms.

One striking example is Belews Creek in North Carolina — a nearly 50-year-old, 2.49-gigawatt coal plant that the study categorizes as both highly vulnerable to retirement and part of Group 0: Fuel Blend Plants. The facility can burn up to 50% natural gas, yet remains one of the nation’s top particulate polluters, ranking 26th out of 198 for fine particle emissions. Financially, it’s among the most unprofitable plants in the country, carrying roughly $46 million in debt as of 2020.

Belews Creek is also located in a state seeing rapid growth in solar development and the implementation of coal debt securitization policies designed to help utilities transition away from uneconomic fossil assets. “Given the drivers for retirements in this group,” the authors noted, “advocates can leverage state and utility clean energy targets.” There were even preliminary discussions about replacing Belews Creek with a small modular nuclear reactor, but the plant’s owner, Duke Energy, has since postponed its retirement — underscoring the financial and operational complexities that the UCSB framework aims to untangle.

“We can simplify nearly 200 plants into clear groups and pair each with evidence-based strategies,” Wu said. “That’s a powerful approach to a geographically diverse and politically fragmented challenge.”

Their analysis found that about 28% of coal plants without retirement plans are already highly vulnerable to closure — potential “quick wins” for policymakers and advocates. But it also revealed that the least vulnerable plants are spread across several groups, underscoring the need for a diverse set of strategies to address the most persistent facilities.

The implications extend beyond coal. Because the model captures the multi-dimensional forces that shape real-world decisions — economics, politics, health and grid reliability — it could be adapted to other complex decarbonization challenges.

Wu, whose research focuses on sustainable energy transition planning, said the framework bridges mathematical and applied environmental science in a way that could transform how analysts and decision-makers approach energy policy.

“This work takes state-of-the-art mathematical tools and puts them into the practitioner’s toolbox,” she said. “It’s flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.”

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, electric vehicle purchases could qualify for a tax credit off the purchase price up to $7,500.
That said, Electrek reported that Lucid Motors aims to bring the price of its EVs down to approximately $50,000, with a mid-size range expected in 2026.
The automaker considers the Gravity a luxury EV, similar to models from BMW, Audi, and Mercedes, per Electrek.
And, even though many companies plan to pull back on EV production, Lucid Motors believes that ""electrification is the future.""","Lucid Motors announced that it plans to continue offering $7,500 off the Gravity SUV through the end of the year to replace shuttered federal electric vehicle incentives.

Many automakers and tech companies are developing ways to slash the cost of EVs, including developing fast chargers, working to avoid tariffs, and improving battery recycling possibilities. As a result, more people will access the myriad of benefits of EVs.

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, electric cars can help you save money on routine maintenance and fuel, allowing you to maximize your savings even more.

Plus, you can charge electric cars using solar energy, which reduces charging costs. At-home chargers are also cheaper than public options.

For homeowners interested in Level 2 EV chargers, Qmerit is providing free installation estimates. Additionally, EnergySage makes it easy to find home solar panel quotes from reputable installers.

Aside from saving money, the Union of Concerned Scientists has explained that EVs release no tailpipe pollution. That's a positive, because pollution contributes to rising temperatures and poorer air quality. Not to mention, EV manufacturing has a smaller environmental impact compared to traditional vehicles, as it requires fewer resources.

Several people had interesting things to say about the company's decision.

Some people expressed confusion about the credit in the Electrek article's comments.

One asked, ""How do you extend an EV tax credit for a vehicle that doesn't qualify in the first place … You just discount the price by $7500 and say you did.""

However, another person seemed excited about the offer, commenting, ""Lucid makes the best vehicles!""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lucid-motors.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:58:33.977287

The 30% clean energy tax credit will end on December 31, 2025. Are you going to make your upgrades? By acting now, you could reduce your taxes, lower energy bills, and position your home for a cleaner, smarter future.

Decoding the 30% clean energy tax credit and what it means for homeowners

The clean energy credit is a federal tax credit through the Inflation Reduction Act to promote energy efficiency and sustainability in U.S. homes. Homeowners can claim 30% of the total cost (both materials and labor) of qualifying energy-saving home improvements, up to certain annual limits.

To qualify, the improvements must be made to a primary residence in the United States. Improvements made in service from January 1, 2023, through to December 31, 2025, will be eligible

According to the IRS official statement on Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, homeowners are eligible to be reimbursed up to $1,200 each year for the types of improvements listed above; additionally, homeowners can be reimbursed $2,000 per year for larger types of improvements, including heat pumps, biomass stoves, and water heaters.

Understanding what home upgrades can maximize your 30% clean energy tax credit

The IRS lists many home improvements that qualify for the clean energy credit, instead of decreasing your overall energy use, and enjoy better comfort:

Insulating and air sealing: Keeps homes warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer by stopping the loss of energy.

Energy-efficient doors, windows, and skylights: These features minimize drafts and keep the indoor temperature stable, reducing the workload on heating and cooling equipment.

Heating and cooling systems: High-efficiency heat pumps, furnaces, and air conditioning systems use less energy while lowering your monthly expenses.

Efficient water heaters: High-efficiency models heat water faster while using less energy, so that you can shower, do laundry, and wash dishes without interruption.

Home energy audits: Discover where you are wasting energy while receiving recommendations specific to you to optimize energy use, while benefiting from the clean energy tax credit.

If you are thinking of making the switch to renewable energy with solar panels, wind systems, like this vertical turbine redefining home energy, or battery storage, you may also be eligible for related tax credits, such as the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would stack on top of your 30% tax credits.

What Homeowners need to know to secure the clean energy tax credit

To receive your clean energy credit, you need to have all the records in order and be aware of the timing. Always hold onto your receipts, documentation of manufacturer certifications, and Energy Star labels for the eligible items you purchased.

When filing IRS Form 5695 to compute your total credit, this is when you will have the final figures available. All items must be upgraded and “placed in service” by December 31, 2025, as projects must be completed by this date to be considered.

Common mistakes homeowners make when claiming the clean energy credit and how to avoid them

To qualify for the complete 30% clean energy tax credit, you’ll need to make sure all improvements meet IRS efficiency standards, retain all receipts and product certifications, and have the project completed by December 31, 2025. Staying organized and planning ahead will help you avoid these common pitfalls and efficiently navigate the process, resulting in a successful claim and maximized savings.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1001401420.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:23:25.976721

Finding innovative ways to recycle renewable energy equipment could help significantly cut costs and reduce waste, further supporting the sector’s green ambitions. There is great potential for a range of components to be reused and recycled, from solar panels to wind turbines and electric vehicle (EV) batteries. However, greater research and investment must be contributed to the sector to improve practices and make recycling options more accessible.

As interest and investment in renewable energy increase, we are seeing more technological advancements across the sector. Wind turbines have become bigger and more powerful, while solar panels have been getting cheaper and more efficient. This means that old technologies are becoming outdated more quickly, leading to their replacement. Once a renewable energy component reaches the end of its lifecycle, it is normally removed and replaced by something bigger, stronger, and better. What is done with these old components varies massively from country to country.

Often, old turbine blades or photovoltaic (PV) panels are stockpiled for long periods of time as companies decide what to do with them. Waste from the renewable energy sector is significant, with Europe expected to dismantle around 14,000 wind turbines by the end of the decade. This would result in between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of blade waste, according to WindEurope. Meanwhile, in the United States, wind turbine blade waste could reach anywhere between 200,000 to 370,000 tonnes a year by 2050.

Greater innovation in recycling could help reduce waste and cut costs by putting old components to good use. However, recycling old renewable energy parts is not always so simple. Steel and other materials that can be easily recycled account for around 85 to 90 percent of the makeup of a wind turbine, but the glass fibre or carbon fibre blades are much more complicated to recycle. The difficulties in recycling have not put operators off, with more innovative solutions being seen year on year. In a bid to become more sustainable, after years of discarding old blades and other components, several wind firms have pledged to invest in recycling operations to prevent old components from going to landfill.

In Scotland, old blades from the Hagshaw Hill windfarm are being recycled to provide a hybrid polymer to be used to produce precast concrete alternatives or replace virgin plastics. Meanwhile, Spanish energy firm Iberdrola aims to transform 10,000 tonnes of blade waste annually at its blade recycling facility on the Iberian Peninsula. It will use glass fibres and resins from the turbines to produce new blades to be used across a range of sectors, from aerospace to construction.

Related: Spain’s Clean Energy Dilemma

In the solar energy sector, various innovations are being seen. For example, in Brisbane, Australia, solar panels are being transformed into silver and copper. Operators are removing aluminium and wires from PVs that can no longer produce energy to grind them up into plastic, glass, silicon, silver, and copper. Pan Pacific Recycling is now processing around 30,000 panels a year and hopes to eventually increase its annual capacity to 240,000 panels.

Global solar panel waste is currently far higher than the recycling capacity for this waste, meaning that greater investment is needed in the sector to expand capacity and improve sustainability by preventing old solar panels from going to landfill. In addition, experts suggest that many of the solar panels being replaced with more efficient models are still capable of producing energy and could be reused in a different context rather than discarded. Several startups, such as Australian Second Life Solar, are working to encourage the reuse of old solar panels in alternative settings to provide clean energy and prevent unnecessary waste.

Some of the greatest advancements have been seen in EV battery recycling, as companies worldwide strive to improve their critical mineral supply chains. The lithium supply used for EV battery production is finite, meaning that once supplies are depleted, we will no longer be able to produce this type of battery. However, extracting the lithium from old EV batteries could allow EV makers to reuse the critical mineral, rather than relying wholly on mining projects for their lithium supply. Other minerals that can be extracted from these batteries include nickel, cobalt, and graphite.

Various companies from different regions of the world are now investing in expanding and improving recycling practices, although the industry’s recycling capacity still falls far behind the production of new wind turbine blades and solar panels, suggesting that greater funding is needed to accelerate the global component recycling capacity. In addition, governments could encourage companies to invest in recycling activities by introducing stricter rules and regulations on renewable energy waste, thereby helping the industry to become more sustainable.

What is energy security, and how does it relate to AI?

""It is making sure there is enough energy in the world to help enable and support our allies,"" said Pullin. ""But then an even broader, bigger context is making sure there's secure energy for humanity.""

She said energy security also applies to making sure companies like Google and Meta have the power they need to take advantage of artificial intelligence.

""Some of it's life and death, literal. And the other side of it is prosper, growth, and innovate, and keep the United States leading in this area,"" she said.

Is the HAMM Institute working on solutions to help fix the disparity of energy poverty globally?

Pullin said that ending energy poverty is at the heart of what they do.

""When you still have people that don't have access to electricity ... then that's a real problem, and so you have to solve that first, ""she said. ""We're not going to get there and be able to solve that unless we keep putting affordable and reliable energy at the front. of the argument in regard to energy policy. That has to happen, because when we can do that here locally and federally within our own country, that allows us to do more.""

How much are are local regulations affecting energy reform?

She said permitting reform is a key part of the solution.

""It is such a significant issue when you have an inconsistent policy, which is what we have seen over the past three decades in the United States, honestly. You see oil and gas come in favor, then out of favor. You see nuclear in favor, then out of favor. You see renewables in favor and then out of favor. And when you have that kind of inconsistency, the capital investment gets scared, and they're not willing to take that risk,"" said Pullin. ""Unless there is permitting reform, ? It means that there are laws in place that can help industry be able to do this in a way that's efficient and affordable and reliable to the consumer. What we will see, the risk of not getting the permitting correct, will be an increase in energy costs for the consumer.

“Nuclear energy is actually the backbone of Ontario's energy generation sector,” said Albis.
“It shows just how multigenerational nuclear power plants are,” he said.
Earlier this year, the Ford government greenlit Ontario Power Generation to start construction on the first SMR.
The Darlington New Nuclear Project was on Prime Minister Carney’s list of projects deemed to be in the national interest and therefore worthy of fast-tracking.","For as long as he can remember, Carter Albis has been fascinated by nuclear energy.

""I grew up right next to Pickering Nuclear. I used to play on the beach, like right next to the plant a lot,” he said. “When you're that age, it's this cool, mysterious building. That's where it started for me.”

That fascination led him to apply to Ontario Tech University’s nuclear engineering program, not far from which sits the Darlington Nuclear Station in Bowmanville.

Now it’s there, where the first-year student sees a radiant future for his career.

“Nuclear energy is actually the backbone of Ontario's energy generation sector,” said Albis. “There's no shortage of opportunity.""

On Thursday, Ontario and the federal governments announced a combined spending commitment of $3 billion to build Canada’s first small modular reactors (SMRs), a new nuclear energy technology to be built next door to the Darlington power plant.

The project is projected to bring 18,000 construction jobs to the region and sustain 3,700 energy jobs annually over 65 years.

“It shows just how multigenerational nuclear power plants are,” he said. “Many of the nuclear plants that are in projects that are being built right now, they'll continue to produce energy past 2100. That's a long time.”

Trickle-down effect expected to boost other sectors

The SMRs will inject $500 million annually into the Canadian supply chain, according to the prime minister, while construction, operation and maintenance of the four units will add more than $38 billion to Canada’s GDP over the next 65 years.

Earlier this year, the Ford government greenlit Ontario Power Generation to start construction on the first SMR. The total project cost was announced at the time as costing $20.9 billion, with the estimated construction cost of the initial reactor being $7.7 billion.

While construction is still in its infancy, local businesses are already reaping the rewards, according to Bonnie Wrightman, Clarington's board of trade executive director.

“We have connected quite a few businesses to vendors who are serving the project and working with our local businesses already,” Wrightman said. “ The economic impact is actually being felt right now.”

Wrightman described the scale of the project as one of the largest Clarington has ever seen. She said the trickle-down effect will boost numerous sectors throughout the region.

In a briefing earlier this year, officials with Ontario's Ministry of Energy and Mines told reporters roughly 80 per cent of the SMR project spending will go to Ontario companies.

“It puts us in a great position to keep supporting the nuclear file,” Wrightman added.

Clarington on a global stage

The technology is expected to be the first of its kind built within the G7.

The Darlington New Nuclear Project was on Prime Minister Carney’s list of projects deemed to be in the national interest and therefore worthy of fast-tracking.

Clarington Mayor Adrian Foster touted the project as a way to put the municipality on the map.

“The world is at our doorstep. They are coming through, they're paying attention,” said Foster. “There's a huge amount of international interest in this.”

Foster said the project holds the potential to provide relief among U.S. tariffs and economic uncertainty.

He pointed to struggling sectors, like Canada’s automotive industry, suggesting that workers could retrain to help steer the SMR project to completion.

“Those skill sets are more closely aligned than you would expect,” he added. “I think we can build a really, really interesting workforce, maybe more quickly than we thought.”

Foster said post-secondary institutions will have a vital role to play in filling out the positions created by the Darlington project.

Steven Murphy, the president of Ontario Tech University, knows that all too well.

Right now, he said post-secondaries across the country are working together to create pathways for future generations to enter into the nuclear field.

“That involves a lot of skilled trades like millwrights, welders, many others that are in short supply,” Murphy told CBC News. “If we are going to have this great build out as a nation, we're going to need all of us (post-secondaries) to be very coordinated.”

The first of four SMRs is expected to come online in 2030, according to the province.

When completed, the four SMRs is expected to produce 1,200 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power 1.2 million homes, according to officials.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/1.7234294,1718308387000/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C5280%2C2970%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-10-25 13:19:03.367234

“I said, ‘Oh, honey, if I’m cooking chili, I’m going all in.’ ” The community embraced her.
But none of those events have the vibrance, camaraderie and history of the Texas Ladies’ State Chili Championship Cook-Off.
“Competition chili is a little bit stronger, a little saltier, a little spicier,” says Maricle, a member of GVEC.
She dabbled in chili cooking on a lark, and now—with the help of her “chili family”—she’s a state champion.","Texans know: Chili is so much more than just a bowl of red.

That wasn’t always the case for Teena Friedel—not many years ago, when she worked for the city of Irving and was tasked with spicing up a city festival.

“I started trying to think of ways to make a festival more fun,” she says, “and one of the things I found was something called a chili cook-off, not knowing what that entails.”

Friedel joined her local pod of the Chili Appreciation Society International to learn the rules and process of a sanctioned competition. After her 2006 event, she remained part of the chapter but was reluctant to get more involved. “They asked me if I wanted to cook, and I did not want to do it,” she says.

After much cajoling and a crash course in cooking chili, she was finally persuaded to compete.

“I made the final table that first day and placed second in showmanship,” Friedel says. She was hooked. “I said, ‘Oh, honey, if I’m cooking chili, I’m going all in.’ ”

The community embraced her.

“If I needed anything, somebody gave it to me, and seeing how much fun everybody had, and part of your entry fee went to charity, and that feels really good.”

In the birthplace of chili, the official state dish comes with a storied history that represents Texas’ bold, rich culture. CASI, one of three standard-bearers for chili cook-offs in the state, hosts hundreds of competitions annually across the continent, raising $729,000 for charity during the last full fiscal year. But none of those events have the vibrance, camaraderie and history of the Texas Ladies’ State Chili Championship Cook-Off.

It’s as much about Texas hospitality as it is secret spice mixtures, and it’s a testament to the power of women in a traditionally male-dominated domain and the close-knit bonds that good food fosters.

The TLSCCO holds a unique place in chili history. The event was created in direct response to the 1970 formation of the Chilympiad, a famous San Marcos cook-off that barred women. In response, legendary rancher and humorist Hondo Crouch offered up Luckenbach, the town he owned near Fredericksburg, for a separate cook-off in 1971 called Hell Hath No Fury Like a Woman Scorned. It was for women only. And it was an instant hit.

The event evolved over the years to support more entrants and found its footing in Seguin, about 35 miles east of San Antonio, in 1991 as the second-largest chili cook-off in Texas, just behind the distinguished Terlingua International Chili Championship. While it’s no longer the second-largest, the women’s competition is still a qualifier for Terlingua, meaning winners gain immediate entry to the most prestigious cook-off of the year.

Heating Up

On a warm April day at Max Starcke Park in Seguin, there’s a huge spread of cars, campers and tents, all in residence for the TLSCCO weekend. A flag with the CASI logo flies above the proceedings, centered around a covered pavilion in a grove of pecan and sycamore trees along the Guadalupe River.

With 135 cooks, the competition is fierce but also clearly fun. Tents, tablecloths, T-shirts and décor are in bright pinks, purples and yellows. Previous champions stroll around wearing tiaras and bright sashes. Men, working behind the scenes, wear pink polos. Everywhere is the sound of women laughing.

Under the pavilion, the junior competition is already underway, with four girls ages 7–15 tending their pots in front of the main stage. Last year’s junior champion, Reese Satsky of Friendswood, is back, wearing her crown.

At the appointed hour, they parade their chili through a glitter-speckled purple arch to the turn-in table, reminiscent of a beauty pageant victory lap.

Outside the pavilion, the adult competition is just getting started. Cooks can begin their chili anytime but most plan a three-hour cook for the 1 p.m. turn-in time, when all competitors must present their chili to judges in 32-ounce plastic foam cups, marked only with ID numbers for anonymity. The visiting and socializing quiet down as the burners are lit.

“A lot of people think if you go to a cook-off, it’s just, you know, a free-for-all,” says Beverly Maricle, the cook-off’s board president. “We do party. We do have a good time but take what we do very seriously. After chili is turned in, or during the resting period, then you walk around and you visit with everybody, but when you’re cooking, you’re cooking. It is a competition.”

René Chapa of Grand Prairie, the 2023 chili world champion and 2014 ladies state champion, is among this year’s top competitors, browning her meat on a custom-painted camping stove under a purple awning with six other cooks, including her mom, Beth Baxter. All are dressed in pink shirts that read, “Spread Kindness.”

“Everybody does their own things a little bit differently,” Chapa says. “And so, you know, I’ll tweak it here and there. She tweaks hers here and there.”

While traditional Texas chili consists of beef (usually cuts of stew meat) cooked low and slow with a blend of peppers, garlic and onions, competition chili is more concentrated.

“This chili is not like a Wolf Brand Chili. You’re not going to sit there and eat a whole bowl; it’s very spicy,” Chapa says. “We’ve got five, six chili powders in here.”

Stew meat is left behind in favor of chili ground beef, and any vegetables are blended to create a gravy. Judges taste a single spoonful of each chili before recording a score, so each bite needs to pack a consistent punch.

“Competition chili is a little bit stronger, a little saltier, a little spicier,” says Maricle, a member of GVEC. “You want a little back bite, but if the tears are running down your face, your pot’s too hot.”

Each entry is judged based on five factors: aroma, color, consistency, taste and aftertaste. At the end of each round of judging, half the entries advance and the tasting begins anew.

Pat Krenek, 2001 and 2003 ladies state champion, has been coming to the competition since the Luckenbach days.

“You have to start out with a decent recipe,” she says. “You crank it up, put it in that cup, turn it in and wish for the best. Once you cook your pot, it’s out of your hands.”

Krenek loves the atmosphere of the event. “This is just a relaxing time. It’s not a beauty contest, so you don’t have to dress up or do your hair and makeup,” she says. “And the men are the ones working.”

Cooking Down

Stoves get turned off during the chili’s resting period as the spices work their magic. And then there’s a last-minute crush of activity before the mad rush to the turn-in table.

At Chapa’s tent, a band of visiting competitors brings out a tray of Jell-O shots, and everyone toasts to each other’s good luck. Some go back for seconds.

About 10 minutes before turn-in time, Chapa primes her entry cup by pouring in a spoonful of chili and swishing it around the edges, coating the cup in a familiar red color. Precoating the cup takes some of the plastic foam smell away, giving the aroma the best chance of scoring high.

At its core, this is a competition, but it’s also about the experience. For the participants, it’s a chance to show off their skills and gain recognition but also to nurture the bonds of a supportive statewide community.

Jeff Bauer, a CASI board member from Pinehurst, is sitting in the shade as his daughter Madalynn Bauer, 18, is cooking in the adult division for the first time. “At barbecue cook-offs, nobody will help you. It’s all about me, me, me, me, me,” Jeff says. “But chili cooks, they’ll help you.”

He competed for years on the barbecue trail before finding the chili circuit.

“It got to the point to where I was spending almost $800, $900, $1,000 a weekend at barbecue competitions,” he says, “and without sponsorship, there’s no way an average Joe can do that.”

Crowning Moment

For judging, hundreds of people—including members of the public—are divided among tasting tables.

“We like to have a minimum of 200,” Maricle says. On this day, some parks employees and litter cleanup crews have been recruited. The mayor of Seguin, Donna Dodgen; city employees; and longtime chili judges line the final table to determine the winners.

The main stage features custom purple camp chairs, part of the award booty for the top 20 cooks.

After the final tastings, the pavilion overflows with competitors, their supporters and curious onlookers. The winners are announced from 20th place to first by the entry numbers on their cups. Sharp cries and shouts of excitement rise up as winners emerge from the crowd, accept hugs from friends and then are escorted on stage.

Beth Baxter’s number is called as 20th place, and she takes a seat in her camp chair. As she’s handed a chilled glass of champagne, the number of her daughter, René Chapa, is called as 19th place, and the two women reunite on stage with laughter and hugs.

The camp chairs are almost full as the reserve champion’s number is called. A proud Jeff Bauer lets out a whoop of joy and spins his daughter Madalynn around. As the runner-up, she will head to Terlingua after her first year of competition.

When the championship announcement comes, Friedel looks radiant as she rises from the crowd. It takes her a few minutes to make her way to the stage, slowed down by all the hugs she receives along the way.

She’s crowned by last year’s winner and handed a bouquet of yellow roses and a large trophy, which she will carry around to competitions until next year’s winner is declared. She dabbled in chili cooking on a lark, and now—with the help of her “chili family”—she’s a state champion.

“I already knew it was going to be me,” she says later. “It was really weird, I just knew I was going to go get that crown.”",https://texascooppower.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/chili-cookoff-11783-og.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 14:19:35.679793

Charlie Garcia responds to readers about AI doubters, nuclear reactors - and why Blackstone fixes what City Hall won't

China is building power infrastructure because they're smart enough to know that electricity is what separates civilization from camping.

Dear Charlie,

I read with interest your discussion of the grid as the bottleneck for AI development in the United States. But aren't you assuming that AI will not be the bust that many people now think it may be? What if AI turns out to be an overhyped loser? Then won't China have won a race that was never run?

Steve

Dear Steve,

Appreciate you reading the piece. And fair question. You're asking if I'm betting the farm on AI turning out to be the next internet instead of the next Pets.com.

Short answer: I don't care if AI is overhyped. Here's why: electricity infrastructure isn't an AI bet. It's a civilization bet.

Whether AI cures cancer or just gets really good at writing bad poetry, we still need to power data centers, charge electric vehicles, run manufacturing plants, and keep the lights on while everyone streams Netflix. The grid is failing now. Texas nearly froze to death because their power grid has the reliability of a 1987 Yugo. California had to schedule blackouts like they're yoga classes.

AI might be the excuse we're using to finally fix infrastructure we should've upgraded 30 years ago. If that makes me a sucker, fine. At least I'm a sucker who can turn on the air conditioning in August.

As for China ""winning a race that was never run,"" that's the wrong metaphor. China is building power infrastructure because they're smart enough to know that electricity is what separates civilization from camping. If AI turns out to be garbage, they'll still have functional power plants and we'll still be arguing about whether windmills cause cancer.

The Romans built aqueducts because they thought the gods demanded clean water. Turns out the gods didn't exist, but the aqueducts still worked. Sometimes the right infrastructure for the wrong reasons beats no infrastructure at all.

Besides, even if AI is 90% hype, that remaining 10% still needs a ton of electricity.

Betting on voltage over vaporware,

Charlie

P.S. - If you're right and AI is a complete bust, at least I'll be able to say I invested in companies that make actual things instead of tokens that represent someone's dream of making money by selling tokens to other people.

Dear Charlie,

Here's two interesting points that one may consider: First, one should look at how much coal China is actually using versus how many mines/plants it may have. Second, the U.S. has many more nuclear reactors than does China.

W.L.

Dear W.L.,

You're right on both counts. China's 3,100 coal plants run at 50% utilization, so they're only burning coal at seven times our rate. And we have 94 nuclear reactors versus their 58.

Here's what those numbers actually mean:

Our 94 reactors are an average of 42 years old. The oldest went online in 1969 - the year the U.S. landed on the moon. It's still running. America built its first new reactors in 30 years at Vogtle, in Georgia. Two of them. Took a more than decade; cost more than double.

China's reactors are mostly under 20 years old. They're building Generation III, Generation IV - China opened the world's first commercial Gen IV reactor in 2023. They have 28 under construction and last April approved 10 more.

The U.S.? America approved reopening Three Mile Island - the one that melted down in 1979.

The U.S. has more nuclear reactors than China. It's like having the world's largest collection of rotary phones while the other guy's building cell towers.

So yes, the U.S. has more nuclear reactors than China. It's like having the world's largest collection of rotary phones while the other guy's building cell towers.

On coal - China built so much infrastructure they can run it at half-speed and still burn seven times more than America does. That's not inefficiency. That's having options. The U.S. is running its 240 plants into the ground because that's all there is.

You're right. America is ahead on 50-year-old technology. China is ahead on everything built in this century.

May the best infrastructure win.

Charlie

P.S. - Nothing says ""global superpower"" quite like bragging that your energy infrastructure predates the invention of the VCR. The U.S. is not falling behind China; it's been behind since China figured out that concrete doesn't need congressional approval.

Dear Charlie,

Radicalization within the political arena is not really good for infrastructures. The energy shortage and infrastructures' extreme decay were both obvious for some time. And now the U.S. government is shut down.

Reality will hit the earth soon. Most will call this a crash.

Pierre

Dear Pierre,

Political radicalization is terrible for infrastructure. So is government dysfunction, regulatory paralysis, and the fact that Congress couldn't organize a two-car parade.

The energy shortage and grid decay in the U.S. have been obvious for 15 years. Nobody fixed it because cutting ribbons on transformer stations doesn't win elections.

Here's what happens next: Reality doesn't care about your political dysfunction. Data centers still need power. AI doesn't run on bipartisan cooperation.

Which means someone builds the infrastructure anyway.

That someone is private capital. Blackstone (BX) deployed $25 billion in 90 days. Microsoft (MSFT) is building power plants. Utilities being upgraded before the grid collapses during an earnings call.

You're right - most people will call this a crash when reality hits. I'm calling it the biggest infrastructure spending cycle in American history, happening whether Washington functions or not. The 10 companies that deliver transformers, cables, and grid systems get paid regardless of which party controls Congress.

Chaos is expensive. Someone profits from fixing it.

Yours in profitable dysfunction,

Charlie

P.S. - The beautiful thing about infrastructure investment is that it doesn't require optimism about government - only pessimism about its alternatives. When the choice is between Congress fixing the grid and Blackstone doing it for 12% returns, bet on greed every time. At least greed shows up for work.

Dear Charlie,

I'm a mother of three and a CPA. I manage our family's investments conservatively - index funds, some bonds; nothing crazy.

You're telling me to bet on American infrastructure when I can't even get the pothole on my street fixed after two years of complaints? When the school needs a new HVAC system but the city says there's no budget?

I get your thesis about China building while America argues. But you're asking me to invest in the same incompetence that can't maintain what we already have. Why would companies suddenly build transmission lines when municipalities can't even patch roads?

My husband says I'm too pessimistic. But I'm the one who balances our checkbook.

Jennifer

Dear Jennifer,

You balance the family checkbook. That makes you more qualified than 90% of Congress.

You're asking why companies would suddenly build transmission lines when your city can't fix a pothole. Great question. Here's the answer: because Microsoft needs power and your city council doesn't.

The pothole stays because fixing it requires a municipal bond issue, three committee hearings and a contractor whose brother-in-law knows a guy. Nobody profits enough to care.

The transmission line gets built because Blackstone deployed $25 billion and they'd like $28 billion back. When private capital wants something, it generally gets it. When public works want something, they schedule another hearing.

You're not betting on American competence. You're betting on American desperation. Your skepticism is healthy. Index funds are smart. But sometimes the boring infrastructure stocks ARE the index, just concentrated enough to actually benefit when the thing finally happens.

May your portfolio outperform your municipality,

Charlie

P.S. - Your city can't fix the pothole because there's no profit in asphalt and nobody gets fired for ignoring it. Blackstone will build the transmission line because there's 30% IRR in electrons and someone absolutely gets fired if they don't.

Dear Charlie:

The squirrel fires remark had me rolling on the floor. Made my day!!

Violet

Dear Violet,

Glad the squirrel barbecue gave you a laugh. Though honestly, with the way our grid's running, we might want to start collecting recipes now while we still have internet access to look them up.

Thanks for reading.

Charlie

P.S. - If you're near a squirrel when reading this, maintain eye contact. Show no fear. They can smell weakness.

“A truly just transition must put people and safety first — not profits or politics.” Author: Bryan Groenendaal","Calls grow for government to abandon oil, gas and nuclear projects seen as threats to a just energy transition.

With just weeks to go before the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, South African faith and community leaders are calling on government to abandon what they describe as “high-risk and outdated” energy projects that could derail the country’s Just Energy Transition (JET).

The Southern African Faith Communities’ Environment Institute (SAFCEI) has warned that expanding oil, gas, and nuclear investments risks locking the country into decades of inequality and fossil fuel dependence. The appeal comes amid mounting controversy over offshore exploration projects, Eskom’s proposal to extend the operating life of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station’s Unit 2, and indications that the government’s draft Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) could include additional nuclear capacity.

“South Africa stands at a crossroads,” said SAFCEI energy justice coordinator Ntombizodidi Mapapu. “Offshore oil and gas expansion and new nuclear investments are costly distractions from real solutions. Communities across the country are saying clearly: we cannot keep betting on energy options that harm our people, pollute our environment and delay a just transition.”

Communities Mobilise Through “No Faith in False Solutions” Campaign

Through its No Faith in False Solutions campaign, SAFCEI is training 45 faith and community leaders nationwide to strengthen grassroots advocacy, engage in public consultations, and push for cleaner, community-centred energy alternatives.

Among them is Hilary Swartz, a business and faith representative from Atlantis, who attended a recent National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) hearing on the proposed extension of Koeberg’s licence.

“As someone representing both business and faith-based groups in Atlantis, I’m deeply concerned about the safety and evacuation risks,” said Swartz. “Our community lives next to the plant — we’d be the first affected if anything went wrong. There’s no clear evacuation plan, and many people lack the resources to relocate in an emergency. That’s unacceptable.”

Swartz added that extending Koeberg’s lifespan could undermine local economic stability. “If an accident occurred, the consequences for our economy, environment and families would be catastrophic. Government should be investing in renewable energy that creates jobs and protects communities, not clinging to outdated technologies. Nuclear is a false solution — it doesn’t belong in South Africa’s just transition.”

Safety and Transparency Concerns Around Koeberg and Vaalputs

Nearby, faith leader Wiedaad Davids, chairperson of West Coast Faith Solutions in Saldanha Bay, echoed safety concerns.

“At almost 40 years old, is Koeberg really in a safe enough condition? The public deserves evidence that this plant meets all safety requirements before any extension is approved,” Davids said. “Decisions that could have far-reaching impacts for our communities are being made without considering the real dangers to ordinary South Africans.”

In the Northern Cape, Justin Montzinger from Port Nolloth raised alarm over the long-term management of nuclear waste at the Vaalputs storage site.

“Our communities have lived near Vaalputs for years, yet most of us have never been properly informed about the safety measures or long-term plans,” Montzinger said. “People deserve clear information about what makes radioactive waste dangerous and how it’s handled — especially if Koeberg’s operation is to be extended for another two decades.”

Offshore Oil and Gas Projects Also Under Fire

Along South Africa’s coastline, fisher and faith communities are raising similar concerns about offshore oil and gas exploration, which they say threatens marine life, fisheries, and livelihoods.

Deborah De Wee, a small-scale fisher and faith leader from Doringbaai, said the government’s push for fossil fuel expansion ignores the lived realities of coastal people.

“Offshore drilling and nuclear expansion harm our environment and our health. For coastal communities, climate change and pollution are already real,” she said. “Government must support clean energy that protects our oceans and sustains our way of life.”

Davids added that many coastal communities have been sidelined in consultation processes.

“No oil company can guarantee there won’t be spills or accidents, yet we’re expected to risk the ocean that feeds and sustains us,” she said. “Future generations have the right to inherit clean seas and safe livelihoods — not more pollution and inequality.”

Montzinger said the wave of proposed offshore projects along the coastline has left many feeling unheard — but that’s starting to change.

“It feels as though risky projects are being imposed on our communities with little consultation. But through SAFCEI’s campaign, people are learning their rights and refusing to be spectators in decisions that affect their lives,” he said. “A truly just transition must put people and safety first — not profits or politics.”

Santee Cooper’s governing board voted unanimously Friday to allow the power company’s management team to officially begin negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management on an agreement to restart construction of the failed expansion project at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.

Brookfield, which boasts a $1 trillion global investment portfolio, was among more than 70 companies to express interest after Santee Cooper put a call out nine months ago. It was a partner on one of 15 proposals Santee Cooper ultimately reviewed.

Negotiations will continue over the next six weeks, CEO Jimmy Staton said. Santee Cooper will name the other partners on the project at a later date.

Santee Cooper did not make public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions.

But Staton said Santee Cooper would use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility. Customers could also benefit from the power the reactors would produce if finished.

“I feel pretty confident that our customers will realize some fairly significant value, both rates wise and otherwise, in this process,” Staton said.

Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.

Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.

Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customer continue to pay for on their monthly bills. Those payments could continue, in part or in full, through 2032, depending how much money Santee Cooper can secure for a buy down in any final deal with Brookfield.

If the two companies manage to ink a contract, Staton pledged that Santee Cooper customers will face no new costs associated with the project. All of that will be borne by Brookfield, as well as big tech companies, such as Google or Meta, that could buy the nuclear power a finished plant would generate.

“We’ve protected the rate payers of South Carolina, and quite frankly, I think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear energy gets built here in the United States,” Staton said.

After the firms mothballed the reactors eight years ago, SCE&G’s parent company, SCANA, collapsed. The reactors’ designer, Westinghouse, spiraled into bankruptcy.

Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy bought up SCANA.

Dominion is not part of the deal, so it won’t at all pay down debt saddled to its 800,000 South Carolina customers. They’ll continue to pay over the next 14 years for $2.3 billion worth of debt from the abandoned expansion.

Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

And it was Santee Cooper’s potential new partner, Brookfield, that took over Westinghouse in 2018.

To restart construction, Santee Cooper and Brookfield will need to find a construction firm. Westinghouse, which remains a part of Brookfield’s investment portfolio, won’t be the builder this time, Staton said.

It will take a year or more of due diligence, licensing and permitting before any construction on the inactive plants can restart, Staton added.

Among the funds Brookfield manages is a portfolio focused on clean energy and decarbonization. Earlier this month, the firm announced it had raised $20 billion for the effort.

The move to restart V.C. Summer follows calls by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year for a “nuclear power renaissance” in the state.

Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

And U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has vowed his support for the effort, which will ultimately have to make its way through the federal regulatory process.

Staton also pointed to a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which calls on the Department of Energy to prioritize approvals for 10 large-scale nuclear reactors under construction by 2030.

“South Carolina is going to have number one and number two in that process,” Staton said. “You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear in the United States.”

Still, nuclear power projects are expensive and take years to complete.

Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, operated by Southern Co. in Georgia, started construction around the same time as V.C. Summer. Work on the expansion wrapped up last year. Today the site is the nation’s largest nuclear plant, with four reactors.

But adding the two newest reactors cost more than $30 billion, more than twice the initial estimates.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-2048x1411.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 15:18:42.962521

A new climate report from Ember brings good news

State governments have broad discretion over their energy policy, while some are prioritizing emissions reduction, others remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Currently, Kentucky does not stand out as a leader in the transition to clean energy.

Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold Forever

A new report from the climate think-tank Ember reveals that in the first half of 2025 the world’s wind and solar farms generated more electricity than coal plants for the first time. Solar output surged nearly 30% year-on-year and met 83% of global electricity demand growth. China and India led the transition, helping drive a drop in fossil-fuel use. Unfortunately, slower renewables growth and rising demand still pushed up coal and gas generation in the U.S. and Europe.

The United States is one of the heaviest polluters in the world, and electric power generation is one of America’s heaviest polluting sectors. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. emitted over 6.3 billion metric tons of harmful greenhouse gasses in 2022, more than every other country except China — and 25% of those emissions were created by electricity production.

With climate change emerging as a leading global threat, many countries are taking action to reduce emissions. In the United States, Biden had previously set a goal of achieving a 100% emissions-free power grid by 2035 — largely by cutting U.S. dependence on dirty power sources, like coal, and increasing our reliance on clean, renewable sources. (Here is a look at 11 American companies on the cutting edge of renewable technology.)

In the continuation of a longer-term trend, the amount of electricity produced in coal-fired power plants has fallen by over 57% in the United States over the last 10 years, from 1.6 billion megawatt-hours in 2014 to 675.1 million megawatt-hours in 2023. Over the same period, electricity production from wind and solar farms nearly tripled, from 199.3 million megawatt-hours to 586.7 megawatt-hours. The shift has had a meaningful impact, as emissions from electric power generation have fallen by nearly 24% in the U.S. since 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The federal government has a long way to go to achieve its ambitious energy goals, and doing so will require the cooperation of states. Every state has its own climate, geography, and natural resources — as well as broad authority over energy policy. Given these variables, some states are doing far more to reduce the climate impact of their power grid than others. (Here is a look at the states where carbon emissions are skyrocketing.)

Among the 50 states, Kentucky stands out for its continued dependence on coal. Nationwide, coal accounts for only about 16% of electricity production and over half of all harmful gas emissions from the electric power sector.

Kentucky is the fifth largest coal-producing state in the country, and partially as a result, the state is one of only a handful nationwide where coal-fired plants account for over half of all electricity production. About 69% of the 63.2 million megawatt-hours of energy produced in Kentucky in 2023 came from coal-fired plants. Additionally, nearly 86% of the state’s 47.2 million metric tons in harmful power grid emissions in 2022 were created by coal.

This is how Kentucky generates electricity — and how much pollution its power grid produces. Electricity output is measured in megawatt-hours and harmful gas emissions are measured in metric tons. For context, a single megawatt-hour is enough to power an average American home for just over a month, and a metric ton is equal to about 2,205 pounds. All data is from the EIA.

This post was updated on October 25, 2025 to include news of Embers’ recent climate report.

Why It Matters

Electricity production is one of the heaviest polluting sectors in the United States. As demand for electricity continues to rise, much of the country is transitioning away from fossil fuels and toward clean and renewable energy sources to meet the Biden Administration’s climate change mitigation goals. Like many other resource rich states, Kentucky continues to rely heavily on fossil-fuels — particularly coal.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright sent the proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that he hopes will accelerate the connection of data centers to the grid, according to a department press release.

Data centers use a large amount of power and in some cases, are expected to raise electricity prices.

Wright’s rule particularly seems to favor centers that come with their own “dispatchable” power sources — allowing such facilities to have their studies “expedited.”

It’s not entirely clear how dispatchable is defined, but it often refers to fossil fuel and nuclear plants that can be turned on and off at will. It may also refer to renewables if they come with batteries that can store the power they produce.

Under law, the secretary is able to send proposals to the independent commission, but it will ultimately be up to FERC whether to go through with it. Currently, the five-member panel has two Democrats and two Republicans. A third Republican was recently confirmed by the Senate but has not yet been sworn in.

“To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity,” Wright said in a letter to the commission. “To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner.

Original story

Marion County Circuit Court Judge Matthew S. Delligatti issued a temporary restraining order Friday against the sale of the John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont to Marx Development Group. The order names Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Secretary Michael Caruso of the WV Department of Health Facilities, in their official capacities.

In August, Morrisey announced plans to sell Hopemont Hospital in Terra Alta, Jackie Withrow Hospital in Raleigh County, John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont and Lakin Hospital in Mason County by the end of September.

At the time of the announcement, Morrisey said the hospitals are licensed for 511 beds, although not all of them are currently in use.

“Marx Development Group, or MDG, has agreed to purchase these assets from the state of West Virginia for $60 billion,” Morrisey said. “And in addition, as part of the deal, MDG has also agreed that it would be investing in West Virginia to construct new facilities.”

Morrisey said the sale will help the state avoid an estimated $100 million in costs to renovate the buildings and that the four facilities have been operating at a $6 million annual loss.

As a private attorney, Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, filed a motion to stop the sale on behalf of his client Mary Devito, a resident of the facility. Garcia indicated he planned to file a suit at the end of August. Plaintiffs must give 30 days notice before suing the state.

Garcia indicated he would not be making statements because of the pending litigation but in August he told West Virginia Public Broadcasting “My client and other residents have many concerns but very little information other than a potential sales deadline of Sept. 30, 2025. The only way to protect the residents of John Manchin Sr. now is to fight this in court.”

A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025, at 3:30 p.m. in the Circuit Court of Marion County.

Government incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act are still available to help cover the cost of a replacement, as outlined by the U.S. Department of Energy. However, many of these programs close at the end of 2025, so you need to act fast if you don't want to miss your chance.

If you are considering a stove upgrade, there's no better option than an induction cooktop.

Induction uses electricity to generate a magnetic field that heats up only the correct type of metal pans — not the stovetop itself or anything else you set on it that isn't made of magnetic metal. This helps minimize burns, in addition to avoiding the fumes from a gas stove. On top of all that, induction stoves heat up faster and boil water faster!

If you're interested in induction, you can get up to $840 off the cost of installing a new range. If it's still outside your price range or you want to try cooking with induction before you commit, you can get an affordable countertop burner, which start as low as $50.

If you do decide to install a full-sized induction stove, the Department of Energy has explained how to claim your rebate for the purchase.

First, check that the appliance you have selected qualifies for the program. If you make any upgrades to support the installation that are eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, make sure the installation is completed before the applicable period ends. Then, when filing your taxes for this year, use IRS Form 5695 to claim your tax credit.

Assuming you followed the guidelines, that amount will be subtracted from your taxes, so you will either owe a smaller amount or receive a larger refund — and in the meantime, you can enjoy the lower bills every time you cook.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kitchen-5.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:08:21.476600

(AP) — Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.

Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.

“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,” Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.

Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no “eligible activities” had occurred on the site’s property in over 120 days.

According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site’s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.

The news was first reported by Crain’s Detroit Business.

The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a “material adverse effect” on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.

Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.

Auto manufacturing is the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy, which has been hard hit by tariffs imposed this year on the industry and Canada. When the project was proposed, officials said the factory would produce cathodes and anodes, two components key to electric vehicle batteries, as well as over 2,000 jobs. The original economic development incentives came as officials sought to bolster manufacturing in the state.

Whitmer’s office did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party. Moolenaar chairs the House Select Committee on China and introduced a bill that stopped companies like Gotion from receiving electric vehicle tax credits from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Moolenaar’s bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

“Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises,” Moolenaar said in a press release.

Carter,,,,,https://currently.att.yahoo.com/att/michigan-embraces-gas-power-charging-122500377.html,"One way that states have decided to recoup the revenue lost by EV owners not paying gas taxes is by adding additional fees when EV owners register their cars.
That annual EV surcharge will soon skyrocket by another $100 each year, and make EV owners pay significantly more in taxes than gas car owners pay in gas taxes over the course of a year.
This will make Michigan tie with New Jersey as the states with the highest EV taxes in the United States.
Given that there were 30,206 F-150s sold in Michigan in 2024, that equates to a loss in annual gas tax revenue of over $1.35 million.
What do you think, is it fair to charge EV owners significantly more money than owners of gas-powered cars?","The automotive industry has relied on fossil fuels for over a century, and the roads those cars travel on have relied heavily on taxes that drivers pay on each gallon of gas purchased at the pump. As the effects of human-caused climate change continue to worsen and more drivers choose to drive less environmentally damaging electric vehicles, governments have had to reconsider how to go about collecting those infrastructure-funding taxes. One way that states have decided to recoup the revenue lost by EV owners not paying gas taxes is by adding additional fees when EV owners register their cars.

EV-owning Michiganders already pay an annual EV surcharge of $160 on top of their annual registration fees, and owners of EVs and hybrids that weigh over 8,000 pounds pay an additional $100 on top of that before even accounting for the standard registration cost. That annual EV surcharge will soon skyrocket by another $100 each year, and make EV owners pay significantly more in taxes than gas car owners pay in gas taxes over the course of a year. This will make Michigan tie with New Jersey as the states with the highest EV taxes in the United States.

EV owners could soon pay an additional $1.88 for every cent the gas tax increases

The proposed bill that would further increase the fees that EV owners pay is Senate Bill 593, and according to M Live News, ""a plug-in hybrid vehicle's annual fee would increase 94 cents for every cent the fuel tax increased above 19 cents per gallon. For EV, the increase would be $1.88 per 1 cent of fuel tax."" That's right, even plug-in hybrid owners are paying more in taxes than folks who drive gas-powered cars.

Critics say that raising fees for PHEV and EV registrations discourages EV adoption, and signals to the automakers that are based in the state that Michigan is not serious about electrification efforts. As a reminder, Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis are primarily based in Michigan.

According to ecocenter.org, EV drivers pay an average of $47 more in road funding taxes every year when compared to their most similar gas-powered counterparts. For example, the driver of a Chevrolet Equinox EV pays $40 more per year than the driver of a gas Chevrolet Equinox, and the driver of a Chevrolet Blazer EV pays $47 more per year than the driver of a gas Chevrolet Blazer. The gap widens with vehicles over the 8,000 pound mark; the driver of a Chevrolet Silverado EV pays $218 more toward road maintenance each year than the driver of a gas Silverado.

EVs are usually heavier than gas models

Since gas powered cars have become more efficient and use less fuel, the revenue from gasoline taxes has dropped significantly. For example, the owner of a 2024 Ford F-150 pays $45.15 less in gas taxes than the owner of a 2010 F-150. Given that there were 30,206 F-150s sold in Michigan in 2024, that equates to a loss in annual gas tax revenue of over $1.35 million. One of the biggest arguments against the increases in EV registration costs is that EV owners are paying significantly more in annual road taxes than gas car owners pay in gasoline tax over that same time span.

EVs tend to be heavier than their gas counterparts, which naturally puts more strain on the infrastructure that they use, but the gas tax doesn't reward owners of lighter ICE vehicles with lower rates than owners of full-sized SUVs. Yes, the Chevrolet Equinox EV weighs about 1,500 pounds more than a gas-powered Equinox, but a Miata weighs over 3,000-pounds less than a Chevrolet Suburban and yet they pay the same proportion in gas tax. What do you think, is it fair to charge EV owners significantly more money than owners of gas-powered cars?

Tens of thousands of good jobs in clean power are already here in Scotland and thousands more are coming.
And the same is true when it comes to nuclear energy.
Hunterston, just down the coast from us, produced power from nuclear generation for decades, but with the ban on nuclear there’s no chance of future investment there.","This was largely driven by China building more solar and wind power than the rest of the world combined.

Our future lies in renewable energy, backed up by new nuclear. It’s important for our energy security and for lowering energy bills, but it’s also important for the next generation of jobs in our country, and Scotland has the chance to lead the way.

That’s why, this week, the UK Labour Government announced its plans to create 40,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector in Scotland by 2030, and 400,000 across the UK.

We’re proud of the history of industry in our area but in recent years, young people have had to look further afield than home to find new and good jobs. I hope that these jobs can help to change that.

This is why I felt it was so important to bring employers from the renewables sector together with our education providers last month at my ‘Developing our Future Workforce’ event.

A generation of young people in Scotland – and here in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire West – will benefit from these jobs under this government, and we need to know what lies in the future of employment in our area in order to predict the educational and training needs.

One of the big complaints I hear from parents is that “there’s no such thing as a job for life”, but when it comes to Scotland’s renewable energy boom that couldn’t be further from the truth.

Jobs like cable engineers, welders and construction workers are needed to build the electricity grid that is going to power our country for years to come. But at the moment we aren’t training enough people in Scotland to do these jobs, meaning that companies have to recruit from overseas.

It doesn’t have to be like this. Tens of thousands of good jobs in clean power are already here in Scotland and thousands more are coming.

I want to see a future where young people can choose to stay here – to choose to study, to live and to work here in Inverclyde, and not be left without a choice but to move. And that’s what this Government wants too.

Sadly, I don’t know if the same can be said of the SNP Scottish Government. They have hollowed out our vital college sector, taking away routes for people to access work and retrain if needed. And just when we need the support to make sure people can take advantage of these new jobs in the renewables sector, our colleges aren’t there to provide the opportunities.

And the same is true when it comes to nuclear energy. With their ban on nuclear power stations in Scotland, the Scottish Government aren’t just turning their back on a safe, clean and reliable source of energy, they’re also rejecting highly skilled jobs and investment in our communities.

Hunterston, just down the coast from us, produced power from nuclear generation for decades, but with the ban on nuclear there’s no chance of future investment there.

A Labour Government would change that and this week, Ed Miliband committed to support nuclear power development in Scotland if Labour wins the Scottish Parliament election next year.

Today, I’m holding my regular monthly coffee morning in Wemyss Bay Community Centre from 10.30am-1.30pm, and I look forward to catching up with constituents over a cup of tea and a biscuit.

This has been a turbulent year for North Carolina’s solar industry:

The Trump administration nixed the 25d Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would have expired in 2032. Now, it expires at the end of the year.

New FEOC requirements, or Foreign Entity of Concern, are leaving solar installers struggling to determine which solar panels still qualify for the Clean Energy Investment and Production tax credits.

The EPA also cut funding for EnergizeNC, which would have lowered energy bills for thousands of low-income residents, according to North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson.

Clean energy tax credits have saved people money on home solar installations for more than 20 years. However, it might already be too late for homeowners to save on new solar. Bryce Bruncati, with 8MSolar in Raleigh, said it’s been a busy few months, meeting a surge of demand that followed the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

“When the Big Beautiful Bill passed, and they ended 25d, we signed up like 200 people in a couple weeks,” Bruncati said. “So, all solar installers in North Carolina right now are booked through the year.”

It was the same story with other solar installers I spoke with in the Carolinas. One reported that it has some spots available for upgrades and small projects, but the queue is otherwise full.

The story of solar so far

Home solar systems have steadily grown in popularity in North Carolina since the mid-2000s. In recent years, they’ve added significant capacity to the grid, approaching the size of a small power plant. That role has only expanded as new battery storage systems and power management agreements allow utilities such as Duke Energy to draw power from homes, reducing energy demand on the system during peak hours.

However, the solar ship had already encountered some headwinds before President Trump returned to office. In 2023, new solar installations declined for the first time in six years, falling by over 15% from the year prior. They dropped again in 2024 — this time by nearly 44%.

Creating energy islands after the flood

Even if 2024 was a low-performing year overall for solar, Asheville-based Rhino Renewables got an unexpected boost after Hurricane Helene.

“Since the storm, we’ve been very busy. A lot of people realize the need for solar,” said Glynnis Hollifield, office manager at Rhino Renewables. “Even people with existing systems wanted to add a battery, just because they were like, ‘I should have had one for the storm.’”

Rooftop or standalone solar panels that are connected to the grid won’t work during a blackout without battery storage. The utility requires panels to switch off when the grid goes down to prevent energy from backfeeding while lineworkers restore power. An at-home battery enables homes to function like an energy island, powering them without risking the electrocution of lineworkers. In this way, they can replace their noisier, more polluting counterpart — the diesel generator.

“People were realizing that to have power when nobody else does, or when the grid goes down, is just so important,” Hollifield said.

Immediately after Helene, organizations such as The Footprint Project deployed battery and solar systems in western North Carolina to power Starlinks, phone chargers and more. Buncombe County installed its first two battery storage systems earlier this year at the county’s Public Safety Training Center and the Health and Human Services building.

“We didn't initially design these battery systems to be like resilience projects in the traditional sense,” said Jeremiah Leroy, deputy recovery officer for Buncombe County, in an interview this past spring. “They were really more designed to be like cost savings projects, to shed peak load and reduce demand charges.”

Leroy said that changed with Helene, and the county shifted to asking questions about emergency preparedness. Suddenly, these battery systems meant more than the sum of their cost savings.

“Resilience is our big focus, and probably will be for the foreseeable future,” He said.

Rhino Renewables had also been part of EnergizeNC, a federally funded program that would have expanded community and residential solar installations in low-income and disadvantaged communities to lower electricity bills. The $156 million program was scheduled to launch later this year, but the Trump Administration canceled funding for the project. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson has since joined several other states in a lawsuit against the EPA over the Solar for All funds.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a written statement. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Looking ahead

For companies that have diversified their services, such as South Carolina’s Southern Energy Management, other home electrification programs, such as Duke and Dominion’s HERO rebate program or Energy Saver NC, have been a boon. Graham Alexander, co-owner of Southern Energy Management, said his industry will weather the new changes, tax credit or no.

“We’d rather see the energy industry in North America on a level playing field,” Alexander said. “Take the subsidies away from the natural gas and the coal and everything else, and let’s see where the field balances out to.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill expanded federal subsidies for oil extraction and reduced the royalties that fossil fuel companies pay for federal leases.

8MSolar’s Bruncati was similarly optimistic about the future of his industry.

“Even without the tax credit, I'm selling systems that have about a 10-year breakeven,” Bruncati said, referring to the amount of time it takes for new panels to pay for themselves.

Bruncati said that math gets more favorable as electrical rates increase. Duke Energy’s proposed 2025 resource plan forecasted that rates will rise an average 2.1% annually over the next decade. Similarly, at-home battery storage has begun to compete more with gas generators as unit prices decrease.

The federal policy shift may favor other business models. In California, where electricity rates are higher, solar leasing has overtaken outright ownership in the past.

When a homeowner signs a solar lease, they don’t own the panels or battery system, but they do benefit from the savings. The leasing company claims the commercial tax credit and charges the homeowner monthly for the panels. These agreements typically last 10-20 years.

“It's a little more tricky. You have to have a really good site. You have to be okay with having someone else owning the equipment we roof,” Bruncati said.

A 2017 law legalized solar leasing in North Carolina and put a cap on leased solar relative to the utility’s total peak demand. Solar leases tend to decline in popularity when panel prices decrease or financial incentives lower the barriers to ownership. It’s possible that solar installers might pivot to so-called third-party ownership models after 25D expires.

In the Carolinas, there are still other incentive programs to offset the upfront cost of solar and battery systems. South Carolina offers a state tax credit for 25% the cost of a new solar system, including installation. In Mecklenburg County, the Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg campaign is a group-purchase program that has lowered the price of a solar system to below $2.00 per watt.

Duke Energy’s PowerPair program offers up to $9,000 back to homeowners who install both solar and battery systems on their homes.

“We have 100 projects booked for [quarter one] of next year where those homeowners are not getting the 30% tax credit, but they're still getting that PowerPair incentive,” Bruncati said.

But the program's future is uncertain. This three-year pilot is already nearing capacity after just over a year. Duke Energy Progress has started a waitlist.

Duke Energy will need to request permission from state regulators to extend the pilot program. The company provided the following written statement:

“Currently, there is no plan for expansion of upfront solar + battery incentives programming. However, Duke Energy continues to offer demand side programs that provide eligible customers with opportunities to earn incentives.”

In fact, the park’s onsite solar array produces nearly as much electricity as the entire park utilizes on an annual basis, including electricity for their buildings and electric vehicle charging stations found in the park’s marina.

To help raise awareness about this impressive achievement, PennEnvironment’s Clean Energy Associate Carolena Bellini hosted a solar tour at Prince Gallitzin State Park’s solar array alongside DCNR Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn, and DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. Local elected officials from Cambria County gathered with local residents and partner non-profit groups to celebrate one of DCNR’s many solar projects in Pennsylvania’s state parks!

“This solar array isn’t just a model for how public lands across PA and the nation can go solar,” said PennEnvironment’s Clean Energy Associate Carolena Bellini. “It is also a reminder that with creativity and drive, we can jumpstart local homegrown renewable solar projects on schools, churches, warehouses, homes, or other ingenious sites.”

Numerous local news outlets covered the solar tour, including articles in the Altoona Mirror, the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat, and the Mainline Newspaper, as well as TV news coverage on local WJAC and WTAJ. By garnering media attention to the Prince Gallitzin solar array, we’re able to increase our reach to every-day Pennsylvanians and educate them about the benefits and opportunities for going solar.

Not only is the solar array at Prince Gallitzin the largest solar array in Pennsylvania’s state park system, it provides a variety of benefits for the state park and taxpayers’ pocketbooks.

Prince Gallitzin Park Manager Jessica Lavelua explained how the solar array provides over $90,000 in energy bill savings to the park each year, and how park officials are able to use those newly-saved monies and invest it back into park improvements like new grills and campsites, a new roof at the ranger station, and much more. The array also helps Pennsylvania’s park system lower its global warming pollution by an estimated 700 tons each year.

At the event, DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley emphasized PA’s progress towards increasing renewable energy. “In May, the Commonwealth reached the momentous milestone of 2 gigawatts of installed solar energy…. enough capacity to power around 377,000 homes,” she noted.

DCNR Secretary Dunn highlighted how “projects like the Prince Gallitzin solar array demonstrate how we can save taxpayer dollars, support local clean energy jobs, and protect our natural resources for future generations. By incorporating solar and other energy innovations across state parks and forests, we’re building a cleaner, stronger, and more resilient Pennsylvania.”

Alongside the Secretaries and PennEnvironment, attendees heard from Park Manager Jessica Lavelua and Steven Spotts with Gridsmart who installed the solar array. Attendees also heard from both Democratic and Republican local elected officials–Cambria County Commissioners Tom Chernisky and Keith Rager–showing the bipartisan support that exists for this project.

A bus full of students from Cambria Heights High School were also in the audience at this event. Having young folks present to learn about sustainability practices showcased one of the goals of the event: to bring together a group of people varying in age, political background, careers, amongst other things, all here to celebrate clean energy.

“The sky is our future,” said Cambria County Commissioner Keith Rager. “If it means reducing taxpayer money, and it means less taxes on me and these young folk [coming from Cambria Heights High School], that’s what I want to do.”

Cambria County Commissioner Tom Chernisky emphasizes how “this project will continue to help Prince Gallitzin State Park make Cambria County a great place to live, work, invest, volunteer, and play.”

Superintendent Ken Kerchenske of the Cambria Heights School District stated that “Cambria Heights School District is venturing into the solar business in the coming months, both through a Power Purchase Agreement on our secondary campus and the direct purchase of a rooftop solar array at Cambria Heights Elementary School, made possible, in part, by a Solar for Schools grant the district received earlier this year. Monday’s event showed that solar is an excellent, fiscally-responsible option for public entities in Cambria County.”

This event was a great opportunity for people to come together and learn more about the environmental and economic benefits of the Prince Gallitzin State Park solar array. It also was a way to highlight DCNR’s leadership and discuss how Pennsylvania can continue to move forward towards a renewable energy future.

The 2025 Oregon Legislative Session ran from January 21 to June 27 and was marked by fiscal uncertainty and systematic challenges as the Capitol community grappled with how to process a record 3,466 bills introduced. Within this context, the session did not feature any of the signature climate or environmental packages that have been a hallmark of Oregon policymaking in recent biennia. Instead, legislators grappled extensively with how to address imminent major challenges in a constrained budget environment, namely issues relating to wildfire and water. The legislature also authorized significant fee increases across many environmental and natural resource agency programs.

As the Legislative Liaison to the Oregon State Bar Environment and Natural Resources Section Executive Committee, I had the honor this summer of providing a legislative update in the Section’s E-Outlook newsletter, published this August, and will be expanding on that report during the ENR Section’s upcoming annual Year-in-Review CLE on October 16, 2025. A few of the most salient session highlights relevant to environment and natural resources policy are outlined below.

General Environmental Protection & Climate

While 2025 lacked signature climate legislation, conceptual groundwork was laid with SJR 28, a proposed constitutional amendment asserting a “fundamental right to a clean, safe and healthy environment.” SJR 28 failed, but a similar measure—Initiative Petition 45—was submitted by petitioners to be included on the 2026 ballot. Chief petitioner recently withdrew the petition for IP 45, but this conversation is likely to continue in future sessions.

Other notable failed bills that may resurface in future sessions included:

SB 680: Greenwashing liability

SB 681: Moratorium on fossil fuel investments by State Treasury

SB 682 and SB 1187: Separate formulations of Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program

Separately, efforts to repeal and replace Oregon’s Climate Protection Program (CPP) with a Cap & Invest model gained traction, as evidenced by HCR 42, a resolution introduced during the last week of session declaring the legislature’s intent to reduce proposed transportation taxes if the Legislative Assembly enacts a cap-and-invest program.

Other environmental protection discussions focused on PFAS, a topic that continues to garner attention nationally and in Oregon. Enrolled SB 91, which becomes effective January 1, 2026, prohibits use of “PFAS firefighting foam” with exceptions, and enrolled HB 2947 requires a study on PFAS in biosolids applied to land, with the final report due September 1, 2028. A bill proposing to prohibit the distribution or sale of certain products that contain intentionally added PFAS, HB 3512, received a public hearing but otherwise did not move forward.

Water

Legislators considered a broad slate of water bills this session, with 26 bills ultimately receiving hearings that addressed water quantity policy, and another 12 addressing water quality. Discussions on water policy during 2025 were a significant, bipartisan priority, with several successful water-related bills of note passing. The most important of those include:

HB 3372: Expands exempt well use on small farms

HB 3544: Establishes uniform processes for water-related contested case proceedings

HB 3342: Modifies laws related to regulation and administration of water rights

SB 1154: Groundwater Quality Protection Act update

HB 3525: Drinking water well testing by landlords for rented dwelling units

Wildfire

Wildfire was a topic of considerable discussion this legislative session. Regarding wildfire funding, legislators considered various proposals but ultimately adopted HB 3940, establishing a new “Zyn tax” on nicotine pouches and directing those funds toward wildfire prevention; redirecting a portion of interest earned on the rainy-day fund to purposes related to wildfire; restructuring how landowners pay for fire protection; and creating a grant program for retrofitting dwellings for wildfire resilience. The legislature also appropriated funds to ODF for ongoing wildfire costs through the end-of-session budget package, HB 5006. This funding, while helpful, totaled well short of legislator’s goals and is largely considered just a first step in addressing mounting wildfire costs. It is all but guaranteed that wildfire funding will continue to be a significant conversation in future sessions.

The DOE issued on Oct. 10 a circular that provides the guidelines for the generation, management and monitoring of carbon credits, which would allow an organization or even a country to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions.

According to the Peoples Rising for Climate Justice-Philippines (PRCJ-PH), the new order from the DOE was “illegitimate and anti-people,” as this also opens doors to foreign and even local corporations to purchase “cheap offsets” instead of reducing their own emissions.

“It allows polluters to greenwash business-as-usual operations while other Filipino people bear the brunt of environmental destruction and climate disasters,” the group said in a statement.

The new policy also threatens the country’s sovereignty over natural resources, as well as undermines grassroots, non-market solutions led by indigenous peoples, farmers and fisherfolk, being the “real stewards of our environment”.”

By issuing the order, the PRCJ also criticized the DOE for going “beyond its mandate” in coming up with such a policy.

The DOE has said that the new circular was in line with the international treaty Paris Agreement. The agency also stressed that it was eyeing to collaborate with Japan, Singapore and some European countries for bilateral or multilateral trade agreements for carbon credits.

However, the group said the DOE cannot use the Paris agreement as a “blanket justification for such overreach, as they are not self-executory without enabling legislation.”

“Worse, this regulation was railroaded at the department level with little-to-no participation from frontline communities, civil society groups or independent environmental experts,” the PRCJ said. “It sidelines the Climate Change Commission, the body legally mandated to coordinate national climate policy and centralizes authority in energy bureaucrats who have long been beholden to corporate interests.”

The “deeper danger” of the DOE circular also includes the “eligible mitigation activities” for the carbon emissions, such as in mega-dams, large-scale solar and wind farms, waste-to-energy incinerators and nuclear energy.

“Now, under the guise of ‘carbon credits,’ these destructive undertakings will profit twice: from environmental exploitation and from selling off supposed ‘emission savings’ to wealthy polluters abroad,” the group said.

This has been a turbulent year for North Carolina’s solar industry:

The Trump administration nixed the 25d Residential Clean Energy Credit, which would have expired in 2032. Now, it expires at the end of the year.

New FEOC requirements, or Foreign Entity of Concern, are leaving solar installers struggling to determine which solar panels still qualify for the Clean Energy Investment and Production tax credits.

The EPA also cut funding for EnergizeNC, which would have lowered energy bills for thousands of low-income residents, according to North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson.

Clean energy tax credits have saved people money on home solar installations for more than 20 years. However, it might already be too late for homeowners to save on new solar. Bryce Bruncati, with 8MSolar in Raleigh, said it’s been a busy few months, meeting a surge of demand that followed the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

“When the Big Beautiful Bill passed, and they ended 25d, we signed up like 200 people in a couple weeks,” Bruncati said. “So, all solar installers in North Carolina right now are booked through the year.”

It was the same story with other solar installers I spoke with in the Carolinas. One reported that it has some spots available for upgrades and small projects, but the queue is otherwise full.

The story of solar so far

Home solar systems have steadily grown in popularity in North Carolina since the mid-2000s. In recent years, they’ve added significant capacity to the grid, approaching the size of a small power plant. That role has only expanded as new battery storage systems and power management agreements allow utilities such as Duke Energy to draw power from homes, reducing energy demand on the system during peak hours.

However, the solar ship had already encountered some headwinds before President Trump returned to office. In 2023, new solar installations declined for the first time in six years, falling by over 15% from the year prior. They dropped again in 2024 — this time by nearly 44%.

Creating energy islands after the flood

Even if 2024 was a low-performing year overall for solar, Asheville-based Rhino Renewables got an unexpected boost after Hurricane Helene.

“Since the storm, we’ve been very busy. A lot of people realize the need for solar,” said Glynnis Hollifield, office manager at Rhino Renewables. “Even people with existing systems wanted to add a battery, just because they were like, ‘I should have had one for the storm.’”

Rooftop or standalone solar panels that are connected to the grid won’t work during a blackout without battery storage. The utility requires panels to switch off when the grid goes down to prevent energy from backfeeding while lineworkers restore power. An at-home battery enables homes to function like an energy island, powering them without risking the electrocution of lineworkers. In this way, they can replace their noisier, more polluting counterpart — the diesel generator.

“People were realizing that to have power when nobody else does, or when the grid goes down, is just so important,” Hollifield said.

Immediately after Helene, organizations such as The Footprint Project deployed battery and solar systems in western North Carolina to power Starlinks, phone chargers and more. Buncombe County installed its first two battery storage systems earlier this year at the county’s Public Safety Training Center and the Health and Human Services building.

“We didn't initially design these battery systems to be like resilience projects in the traditional sense,” said Jeremiah Leroy, deputy recovery officer for Buncombe County, in an interview this past spring. “They were really more designed to be like cost savings projects, to shed peak load and reduce demand charges.”

Leroy said that changed with Helene, and the county shifted to asking questions about emergency preparedness. Suddenly, these battery systems meant more than the sum of their cost savings.

“Resilience is our big focus, and probably will be for the foreseeable future,” He said.

Rhino Renewables had also been part of EnergizeNC, a federally funded program that would have expanded community and residential solar installations in low-income and disadvantaged communities to lower electricity bills. The $156 million program was scheduled to launch later this year, but the Trump Administration canceled funding for the project. North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson has since joined several other states in a lawsuit against the EPA over the Solar for All funds.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a written statement. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Looking ahead

For companies that have diversified their services, such as South Carolina’s Southern Energy Management, other home electrification programs, such as Duke and Dominion’s HERO rebate program or Energy Saver NC, have been a boon. Graham Alexander, co-owner of Southern Energy Management, said his industry will weather the new changes, tax credit or no.

“We’d rather see the energy industry in North America on a level playing field,” Alexander said. “Take the subsidies away from the natural gas and the coal and everything else, and let’s see where the field balances out to.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill expanded federal subsidies for oil extraction and reduced the royalties that fossil fuel companies pay for federal leases.

8MSolar’s Bruncati was similarly optimistic about the future of his industry.

“Even without the tax credit, I'm selling systems that have about a 10-year breakeven,” Bruncati said, referring to the amount of time it takes for new panels to pay for themselves.

Bruncati said that math gets more favorable as electrical rates increase. Duke Energy’s proposed 2025 resource plan forecasted that rates will rise an average 2.1% annually over the next decade. Similarly, at-home battery storage has begun to compete more with gas generators as unit prices decrease.

The federal policy shift may favor other business models. In California, where electricity rates are higher, solar leasing has overtaken outright ownership in the past.

When a homeowner signs a solar lease, they don’t own the panels or battery system, but they do benefit from the savings. The leasing company claims the commercial tax credit and charges the homeowner monthly for the panels. These agreements typically last 10-20 years.

“It's a little more tricky. You have to have a really good site. You have to be okay with having someone else owning the equipment we roof,” Bruncati said.

A 2017 law legalized solar leasing in North Carolina and put a cap on leased solar relative to the utility’s total peak demand. Solar leases tend to decline in popularity when panel prices decrease or financial incentives lower the barriers to ownership. It’s possible that solar installers might pivot to so-called third-party ownership models after 25D expires.

In the Carolinas, there are still other incentive programs to offset the upfront cost of solar and battery systems. South Carolina offers a state tax credit for 25% the cost of a new solar system, including installation. In Mecklenburg County, the Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg campaign is a group-purchase program that has lowered the price of a solar system to below $2.00 per watt.

Duke Energy’s PowerPair program offers up to $9,000 back to homeowners who install both solar and battery systems on their homes.

“We have 100 projects booked for [quarter one] of next year where those homeowners are not getting the 30% tax credit, but they're still getting that PowerPair incentive,” Bruncati said.

But the program's future is uncertain. This three-year pilot is already nearing capacity after just over a year. Duke Energy Progress has started a waitlist.

Duke Energy will need to request permission from state regulators to extend the pilot program. The company provided the following written statement:

“Currently, there is no plan for expansion of upfront solar + battery incentives programming. However, Duke Energy continues to offer demand side programs that provide eligible customers with opportunities to earn incentives.”

A judge blocked Trump’s cuts in March, according to the lawsuit, and Hill thought her organization’s funding was safe.
“The grant was released in February, (and we added) on three additional communities,” Hill said.
“The loss of this funding will immediately curtail 4CORE’s planned programs for mobility planning in four communities, and commercial and residential energy efficiency outreach,” the release said.
To Hill, the move to cut the funding is strictly based on ideology, she said.","Half-million dollar cut resulted in job loss

The U.S. Department of Energy announced on Oct. 2 that it would be slashing more than $7.5 billion in funding approved through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Acts.

According to a release from the department, the funds, which were allocated for 223 energy projects nationwide, were found to be wasteful.

“DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the release read.

Some of the Congressionally-approved funds were to be sent to Durango-based nonprofit Four Corners Office for Resource Efficiency, according to a release from the organization.

4CORE Executive Director Jenny Hill said the cuts came after a coalition of state attorneys general, including Colorado AG Phil Weiser, sued the Trump administration, which tried to cut the funds through an executive order early on in 2025. A judge blocked Trump’s cuts in March, according to the lawsuit, and Hill thought her organization’s funding was safe.

“This one was completely out of the blue,” she said. “So we had been working under the assumption since February that these were obligated funds that we were already spending, and that they wouldn't ever be under threat of being cut again. So when this did happen, it was a big shock to us.”

The guiding ethic of 4CORE was to help communities across Southwest Colorado where 65% of households are at or below the federal poverty level – including Ignacio, Cortez, Pagosa Springs and Saguache. The nonprofit lost $531,240 due to the cuts, and as a result had to lay off two employees, reduce hours for two others and roll back operations, the release said. Hill said she had to cut her own time back to 20 hours a week.

“The grant was released in February, (and we added) on three additional communities,” Hill said. “We’re right in the middle of the work. For Pagosa Springs, we’re about 75% done with the transportation planning work. For Saguache we are roughly 50% done. So it really did impact and hurt those two communities when we received the stop work order.”

According to the nonprofit’s website, 4CORE helped provide funding, guidance and community organization for clean energy initiatives, such as solar installation projects and an e-bike lending program for low-income and car-less residents. On Friday, for example, Hill was in Towaoc working to get kids from the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe on e-bikes to help address their transportation needs.

Additionally, the organization sought to help communities become more climate resilient through groundwater conservation projects and sustainable economic practices.

What’s more, Hill said, is that community surveys about 4CORE’s work in both Saguache and Pagosa Springs was positive, regardless of political affiliation.

“The loss of this funding will immediately curtail 4CORE’s planned programs for mobility planning in four communities, and commercial and residential energy efficiency outreach,” the release said.

The reduction in the nonprofit’s staffing has already halted the organizations efforts to gather information and to help communities identify transportation needs, plan for affordable transportation, enable homeowners to make their houses more energy efficient and provide education about sustainable business practices to boost economic resiliency.

To Hill, the move to cut the funding is strictly based on ideology, she said. 4CORE’s work was non-partisan and helped communities save money, increase efficiency and become more environmentally friendly.

“It feels strictly political,” Hill said. “That’s why in 2020 through 2024, we were receiving more grant funds and getting more awards, and kind of wrapping up the services we offered. And then this whole year has been a roller coaster of determining the strategy moving forward.”

But some business leaders said they are wary that the move could lead to a costly legal quagmire.

The rule, known as the “endangerment finding,” is the conclusion by the E.P.A. that greenhouse gases endanger public health and therefore must be regulated by the federal government. Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, has said the agency would repeal the finding, claiming that the burden to industries of cutting greenhouse gas emissions is more harmful than a warming planet.

And yet carmakers, electric utilities and even the oil and gas industry have asked the E.P.A. to tread carefully. If the federal government were to stop regulating greenhouse gases, it could clear the way for states and municipalities to sue companies for damages from climate change. And it could spur individual states to come up with their own pollution limits, creating a patchwork of regulations. Environmental groups have also promised to sue the E.P.A. if it repeals the finding, leading to more uncertainty for businesses.

“This is something that the vast majority of industry didn’t ask for and doesn’t want,” said Zach Friedman, the senior director of federal policy at Ceres, a nonprofit group that submitted a letter from 59 companies and investors opposing the E.P.A. plan.

Human activities, mainly the burning of coal, oil and gas for energy, have produced the greenhouse gases that have been the primary driver of climate change for more than half a century. Carbon dioxide, methane and other gases have accumulated in the atmosphere and are warming the planet by trapping the sun’s heat. That has contributed to more intense wildfires and heat waves, rising seas and extreme weather events.

In its proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, the E.P.A. cited a recent Energy Department report that downplayed the severity of climate change. That report was written by five prominent climate contrarians chosen by the Trump administration.

Their work has been sharply criticized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the American Meteorological Society and more than 85 climate scientists in the United States, who found that the Trump administration’s climate report has numerous inaccuracies and misrepresents climate science.

Scott Saleska, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, said the evidence that supported the endangerment finding 16 years ago has only grown stronger since then. Air temperatures have increased, sea levels have risen, ocean acidification has worsened. Heat-related deaths are rising, smoke from wildfires is increasingly severe and the spread of climate-enabled diseases is on the uptick.

Ignoring that evidence, as the E.P.A. appears poised to do, Dr. Saleska said, “puts an exclamation point on the idea that science, as the best method the human species has ever come up with for discerning objective reality, has no role in this government.”

But they still said the federal government should retain the ability to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Rescinding the endangerment finding “will serve not as a path to regulatory stability, but rather a route to prolonged legal battles, possible market fragmentation and technological stagnation,” wrote Jim Kliesch, the director of regulatory affairs at American Honda Motor Company Inc.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil and gas companies, wrote that “federal government action is a necessary part of the solution” to climate change and said it believed the E.P.A. had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing the electric power industry, said that if without a federal role in regulating greenhouse gases, states and cities could “attempt to fill that perceived void through increased regulatory requirements that could vary significantly from one jurisdiction to the next.”

But other business groups supported removing the endangerment finding. The National Mining Association, which represents mining companies, and the Steel Manufacturers Association backed the agency, as did energy associations from several states, including coal and gas-rich Wyoming.

When the public comment period closed on Sept. 22, the agency had received more than 500,000 comments, about 2 percent of which have so far been posted on the E.P.A.’s website, according to an analysis Wednesday by InfluenceMap, a London-based sustainability think tank. In its report on the comments released so far, the group said that companies and trade groups across many sectors of the economy were concerned about the legal viability of the agency’s proposal, and some proposed weakening greenhouse gas standards instead of jettisoning them.

“I was definitely surprised to see the level of concern that some of these companies and industry associations are voicing about the proposal, especially the companies that have traditionally tried to weaken emissions standards,” said Leo Menninger, a senior analyst for the group. “They’re generally concerned about the entire framework being removed.”

Repealing the finding would almost certainly lead to litigation that could eventually reach the Supreme Court. The endangerment finding, which dates from 2009, came out of a Supreme Court decision two years earlier, Massachusetts v. E.P.A., in which the justices concluded that greenhouse gases were pollutants, and that the agency was obligated to determine whether they were a danger to public health.

Nixing the finding could also have another unintended consequence for fossil fuel producers: It would potentially weaken a primary argument that they have used to fight some of the lawsuits filed against them in state courts.

The industry has said in court that the E.P.A. has exclusive authority to oversee emissions that cross state lines, overriding other state and federal laws. (Plaintiffs in many of the suits have countered that their lawsuits are based on corporate misbehavior, not actual emissions.) But if the E.P.A. removes its own authority to regulate emissions, that could open up the potential for some lawsuits against the industry to proceed more easily.

In its proposed rule, the E.P.A. said the Clean Air Act and the structure of the federal system would still block such lawsuits, even without the endangerment finding in place. But that reading of the law would most likely be challenged in court.

“I think that’s one reason why Trump didn’t try to do this in his first term,” said Robert Percival, director of the environmental law program at the University of Maryland’s law school. “They were warned that it was too dangerous to open up this Pandora’s box.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/22/multimedia/22cli-endangerment-01b-jbhz/22cli-endangerment-01b-jbhz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 06:58:52.586661

In response, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has proposed a significant regulatory change aimed at expediting the connection of these power-intensive data centers to the national grid. This proposal, submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), is designed to streamline the interconnection process and reduce the lengthy review periods that often impede grid development. As the country grapples with increased energy needs, this initiative could reshape how the grid meets modern demands.

Accelerating Grid Connections: A New Rule Proposal

The U.S. Department of Energy has put forth a new rule to FERC that seeks to hasten the connection of data centers to the electric grid. Spearheaded by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, this rule allows for joint, co-located load and generation interconnection requests. The aim is to significantly cut down on the time and cost associated with grid improvements. Typically, reviews for grid projects can take several years, but Wright’s proposal suggests that a 60-day review period could be feasible.

This streamlined process is crucial as the demand for electricity rises, fueled by the expansion of data centers and the AI sector. The current administration, led by President Donald Trump, is focusing on boosting power capacity primarily through fossil fuels and nuclear energy. However, this focus has sparked a mixed reaction from various stakeholders. While some industry representatives see it as a necessary step for modernizing the grid, environmentalists have voiced concerns about the potential environmental impact and the administration’s energy priorities.

Support and Criticism: Diverse Stakeholder Reactions

The proposed rule has garnered both support and criticism from different corners. The Edison Electric Institute, representing publicly-traded electric utilities, has endorsed the initiative, highlighting its potential to strengthen the grid and lower costs for consumers. The organization believes that faster interconnection times will be beneficial for the overall energy infrastructure.

Conversely, environmental groups have criticized the proposal. Camden Weber from the Center for Biological Diversity expressed concerns over the administration’s priorities, particularly during a government shutdown. Weber argued that fast-tracking grid connections without thorough environmental reviews could have detrimental effects. This criticism underscores the ongoing debate between expanding energy capacity and maintaining environmental safeguards, a key issue in the current energy policy landscape.

Hydropower Development: Removing Permit Burdens

In addition to the grid connection proposal, Secretary Wright has also urged FERC to consider a rule aimed at easing the preliminary permitting process for hydroelectric projects. This move aligns with efforts to diversify energy sources and increase reliance on renewable energy. Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association, praised the initiative, emphasizing the need to prevent unnecessary barriers from federal resource agencies that could hinder hydropower development.

Hydropower is considered a critical component of a sustainable energy future, offering a reliable and renewable energy source. By reducing permit burdens, the U.S. could potentially accelerate the development of hydroelectric projects, contributing to a more balanced energy mix. This proposal reflects a broader strategy to ensure that renewable energy sources are not sidelined in the pursuit of increased power capacity.

FERC, an independent agency within the Department of Energy, plays a pivotal role in shaping U.S. energy policy. While the energy secretary can propose rules, FERC maintains the authority to accept or reject them. With a current 3-2 Republican majority, the commission’s decisions are closely watched by industry and environmental groups alike.

The independence of FERC is crucial for maintaining a balanced approach to energy regulation. As the commission reviews the proposed rule changes, it must weigh the benefits of expedited processes against potential risks to environmental integrity and regulatory oversight. This decision-making process highlights the delicate balance FERC must maintain to ensure that energy policies are both forward-thinking and responsible.

As the U.S. navigates its energy future, the proposals put forth by Secretary Wright represent a significant shift in how the country addresses growing power demands. These initiatives highlight the tension between rapid development and environmental stewardship, a core challenge for modern energy policy. As FERC deliberates on these proposals, the outcome will likely shape the trajectory of the U.S. energy landscape. What balance will be struck between innovation, capacity, and environmental responsibility in this evolving energy narrative?

Santee Cooper’s management plans to ask its board to approve a letter of intent for Brookfield to resume construction of two partially built reactors at the VC Summer site, Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Staton said during a board meeting on Friday.

The abandonment of VC Summer in 2017 marked a low point for the US nuclear industry, which has seen more than a dozen reactors shut down over the past decade or so amid increasing competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. Now, demand for clean energy is driving enthusiasm for fission, with dozens of companies seeking to develop new reactor technologies and power plants.

But high costs continue to hinder the development of new reactors. VC Summer would feature traditional technology akin to the Vogtle project that was completed last year in Georgia, which came in about seven years late and roughly $20 billion over budget.

Staton didn’t provide financial details about the Brookfield negotiations. He said a key component was moving the burden away from the utility.

“We think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear gets built here in the US,” Staton said. “Instead of the risk being absorbed by customers, it will be absorbed by the private entities seeking to build these assets.”

US electricity consumption is set to soar as technology companies build out power-hungry data centers supporting artificial intelligence applications. That’s driving interest in nuclear plants that can supply around-the-clock clean energy. Microsoft Corp. has agreed to pay above-market prices for power from a shuttered Three Mile Island reactor, which owner Constellation Energy Corp. expects to bring back into service in mid-2027.

Santee Cooper and the VC Summer plant’s former co-owner, Scana Corp., halted construction of the reactors about eight years ago after estimated costs soared above $20 billion and contractor Westinghouse Electric Co. went bankrupt. Four former executives involved with the project, including Scana’s former CEO, were convicted in a federal criminal investigation that found the state’s ratepayers had been defrauded over delays and cost overruns.

Santee Cooper began soliciting bids to restart the project in January. Brookfield already has a connection to the site; it now owns a majority stake in Westinghouse, which designed the two reactors that have about 1,100 megawatts of capacity each.

Staton reiterated that the restart is unlikely to lead to a repeat of the financial debacle. There were no Brookfield executives speaking at the meeting.

“There are no additional risks for our customers, at all,” he said. “We won’t have to contribute any additional dollars.”

Yet, progress continues to be stifled by a federal permitting system that is outdated, overburdened and in desperate need of modernization.

In Arizona — where nearly 40% of our land is federally managed — even straightforward energy projects like updating or expanding existing project sites can face months or years of unnecessary delay due to repetitive reviews. These hold-ups hinder job creation, stall economic opportunity in rural communities,and delay the reliable energy that Arizona families and businesses depend on. Inefficient policy is crippling growth and innovation.

There is a roadmap for reform. Federal agencies should follow through on proven streamlining tools and remove barriers that provide little or no additional environmental benefit. A prime example is implementing a permit-by-rule system for certain energy projects on federal lands, particularly those already developed or previously reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act.

A permit-by-rule process would allow low-impact projects to move forward without triggering yet another full NEPA review from scratch. These projects have already been vetted, align with earlier approvals and pose no additional risk to the environment. Requiring another lengthy environmental analysis in these cases doesn’t protect the environment — it simply duplicates paperwork, wastes valuable agency resources and delays energy production.

Another area for needed improvement is modernizing the NEPA process to reduce endless litigation. In recent years, federal courts issued more than 420 rulings on 210 energy projects, with many of the cases dragging on for years after receiving agency approval and extensive reviews. These delays are directly stalling projects resulting in unpredictable timelines and rising costs. NEPA needs targeted judicial reforms that limit excessive litigation to move energy projects forward efficiently and responsibly.

We’re entering a new era of energy demand. Nationally, electricity use is expected to steadily rise by 50% by 2050. In Arizona, the situation is worse, with energy demand for our largest utilities projected to triple as a surge of data centers come online. Meeting this challenge requires expanding capacity, modernizing our grid and accelerating clean energy deployment.

Arizona has some of the nation’s greatest potential for solar, but permitting delays are slowing progress on the transmission lines needed to deliver that energy reliably. A smarter permitting process will help ensure we meet rising demand with resilient, sustainable power. Delays in building new infrastructure and energy connections are only hampering the grid, putting energy reliability at risk today. These are not distant scenarios; they are real-time challenges demanding practical action now.

The energy we produce here in Arizona must be able to move swiftly from concept to reality. But that can’t happen if every project — no matter how minor — is treated as if it’s breaking ground for the first time. Importantly, these reforms do not sacrifice environmental standards; they enhance them by allowing agencies to focus their time and expertise on the projects that could carry genuine environmental risks. Safeguards would remain in place for high-impact areas, but the needless red tape burdening simple, routine projects must be reduced.

This is a common-sense, bipartisan solution — and a local one. Arizona communities thrive when energy is affordable, jobs are plentiful and infrastructure is modern. Permitting reforms, like a permit-by-rule, would help achieve all of these goals without compromising our environmental values.

Our congressional delegation has history of supporting practical solutions to strengthen Arizona’s infrastructure and competitiveness. Now, permitting reform must be the next frontier in realizing our state’s energy future. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego maintain critical positions on the Senate Committees on Environment and Public Works and Energy and Natural Resources respectively. They are in positions to lead on permitting reform on behalf of Arizona.

Our permitting system must evolve beyond its 1970s framework to address the challenges and opportunities of 2025 and beyond. By streamlining approvals for low-risk, previously vetted projects, Congress can ensure faster deployment of energy, better use of agency resources and a stronger future for Arizona.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/yourvalley/original/20251024-110150-0eb-Cesar%20Chavez%20headshot.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 13:19:16.634921

His journey from East Texas roots to the helm of Energy Transfer offers valuable insights into strategic business leadership, infrastructure development, and community-focused giving.

Building an Energy Infrastructure Giant

Kelcy Warren co-founded Energy Transfer in 1996 with approximately 200 miles of natural gas pipelines in East Texas, transforming this modest beginning into one of North America’s largest energy companies that now operates nearly 125,000 miles of pipelines across dozens of states. The company currently transports roughly one-third of the United States’ natural gas and crude oil, representing an extraordinary scale of growth achieved through strategic vision and decisive leadership.

Warren’s business philosophy centers on identifying market needs and rapidly building infrastructure to meet them. In the mid-2010s, when independent oil and gas producers returned from overseas operations, Warren recognized they needed new pipeline capacity to transport burgeoning domestic shale production and quickly expanded Energy Transfer’s infrastructure to fill those gaps. This customer-focused approach has been fundamental to the company’s success.

Strategic Acquisitions and Market Adaptation

When natural gas prices plummeted during the 2008-09 downturn and the Barnett Shale boom cooled, Warren led a transformative pivot to diversify Energy Transfer’s business through strategic acquisitions and expansion into natural gas liquids and oil. One pivotal moment came with a rapid $2 billion acquisition of Louis Dreyfus energy assets in 2011, demonstrating Warren’s ability to seize opportunities with remarkable speed.

The 2012 acquisition of Sunoco greatly expanded Energy Transfer’s footprint into new regions including the Marcellus Shale in the Northeast, adding oil transportation and retail capabilities to the portfolio. These bold moves exemplify Warren’s strategic thinking and willingness to transform his company’s direction when market conditions demand adaptation.

Operational Excellence and Innovation

Under Warren’s leadership, Energy Transfer became the world’s largest exporter of ethane and now ships liquefied petroleum gas to 93 countries around the globe, positioning the United States as a major global energy supplier. By finding profitable outlets for resources like ethane that were previously considered waste products, Warren helped revolutionize energy logistics.

During the 2020 pandemic when energy demand plunged, Energy Transfer emerged from the downturn stronger than before, thanks to its diversified portfolio and Warren’s steady long-term vision. This resilience demonstrates the company’s operational excellence and Warren’s ability to guide the organization through major industry challenges.

Transforming Urban Spaces Through Philanthropy

In 2012, Warren donated $10 million to help create Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, a 5.2-acre urban park built over a downtown freeway that has become a beloved community hub reconnecting the city’s Uptown and Downtown areas. Warren and his family later contributed an additional $20 million to expand the park, ensuring it can continue serving as a vibrant gathering place with free public programming.

The park, named after Warren’s son, stands as one of the nation’s most successful urban park projects and represents his commitment to improving quality of life in Dallas. His service on the Woodall Rodgers Park Foundation board demonstrates ongoing engagement with causes he supports.

Advancing Education and Energy Engineering

In 2023, Warren made a $12 million gift to the University of Texas at Arlington, the largest single donation in the university’s history, to help establish a cutting-edge resource and energy engineering program aimed at training the next generation of energy professionals. This transformational gift builds on 25 years of support to UTA, during which Warren previously gave around $4 million funding scholarships and research initiatives including a graduate fellowship honoring a professor who mentored him.

Warren’s commitment to education extends beyond universities to institutions from grade schools to other Texas universities, reflecting his belief in the power of learning to change lives. His educational philanthropy addresses the critical need for skilled graduates in the energy field while honoring his own educational journey.

Supporting Health and Youth Development

Warren has donated to prominent medical and children’s organizations including the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center, and March of Dimes, focusing his philanthropy on vulnerable populations and community well-being. Since 2018, he has been a steadfast supporter of the West Dallas Youth Academy through a partnership between Energy Transfer and the Texas Rangers, providing education, mentoring, and sports opportunities to underserved youth.

For years, Warren personally hosted an annual charity music event through his foundation, Cherokee Crossroads, Inc., to raise funds for children’s charities in Texas, demonstrating hands-on involvement with the causes he champions.

Leadership Recognition and Industry Honors

Warren has received high-profile awards from Hart Energy, the Texas Oil & Gas Association, and Southern Methodist University’s Cox Maguire Energy Institute, among others, recognizing his innovative leadership. D CEO Magazine named Warren as a top energy industry figure in 2023, and he was selected as a Laureate of the Dallas Business Hall of Fame in 2020.

Warren is a member of the Texas Business Hall of Fame and has been inducted into the Ammys Hall of Fame, in addition to receiving the prestigious Hanlon Award from the Gas Processors Association, the midstream industry’s highest honor for outstanding leadership. In 2016, he was inducted as a lifetime member of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans after receiving the Horatio Alger Award, a national honor given to individuals who have overcome adversity to achieve great success while remaining committed to philanthropy.

Civic Engagement and Public Service

Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Warren to the University of Texas System Board of Regents, where he has served since 2019 with a term through 2025, contributing to higher education governance at the state level. Warren was also appointed to the prestigious Kennedy Center Board of Trustees in 2019, reflecting his support for arts and culture.

These appointments demonstrate how Warren leverages his experience and resources beyond business ventures, actively participating in governance of major educational and cultural institutions.

A Lasting Legacy of Vision and Service

Warren’s career exemplifies how business success can align with benevolence and community impact, as his four decades in the energy industry have not only reshaped America’s energy infrastructure but also touched countless lives through charitable initiatives. The breadth of his awards and honors in the energy sector is matched by substantial philanthropic contributions, highlighting a commitment to improving lives and supporting meaningful causes.

The types of renewable energy Guinea-Bissau is hoping to implement in the country’s future has been recorded as recently as 2021, specifically from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).
Furthermore, a closer look into Guinea-Bissau’s renewable energy use found that 100% of the renewable energy used in 2021 came from bioenergy.","Located in West Africa, with about 2 million residents, the country of Guinea-Bissau has struggled with both economic and political instabilities for decades. However, with its coastal location, fishing has become an integrated part of the country’s economy. However, Guinea-Bissau has the power to improve both its economy and country with renewable energy. Here is information about energy poverty and renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau.

Energy Poverty in Guinea-Bissau

Energy poverty in Guinea-Bissau is very high. In fact, half of the country, more than a million people, are still unable to access electricity. As of 2023, only 0.8% of the country had access to clean fuels that are able to be used for cooking. While one may associate clean fuels with a more efficient way of cooking, there are other benefits of cooking with clean fuels as opposed to cooking with non-clean fuels, such as a lower risk of dying from indoor air pollution. Non-clean fuel sources, such as charcoal, crop waste or even dung, leave people at risk of death and ill-health, as opposed to those who use clean cooking fuels. While one may think of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau as something that will help out our planet, citizens of Guinea-Bissau think of it as a life-altering and potentially life-saving change to their everyday lives.

Facts About Renewable Energy in Guinea-Bissau

Implementing Renewable Energy is a Challenge: Guinea-Bissau’s electric sub-sector is one of the least efficient in West Africa. This is due to several factors, including, but not limited to, waste, supply and demand issues, financial issues and low investments. This means that renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau may be harder to implement.

Low Electricity Availability: The availability of electricity in the West African country is low; however, the addition of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau would change this. In fact, as late as 2022, more than one million people across the nation still do not have access to electricity. On the other hand, more than a million people across the country do have access to power. Out of the country’s entire population, rural areas were the smallest group to have that access, typically staying at the same low levels from 2015 to 2022. With the implementation of renewable energy in the country, more communities would have access to electricity, which could benefit their businesses, home lives and education.

A Delayed Power Plant: The development of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau experienced a delay due to an unfinished power plant. A 15MV power plant was supposed to reach completion in November 2018 as a replacement for another power plant; however, the power plant did not begin operating in 2019.

Increasing Renewable Energy: Despite the electricity issues Guinea-Bissau faces, its electricity supply, particularly that which is renewable, has increased. In fact, in 2021, electricity that was generated from renewable sources was at its highest, at 18.3 (GWh).

Possibility of Increased Renewable Energy: Even with the lack of resources, renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau is possible. Currently, the country has a huge potential to commit to using renewable energy more than ever. Since 2018, the country has had more electricity than before, growing from 28.3 MW to 29.1 MW in about three years. Furthermore, more advancements are to come to the country’s renewable energy use in the near future.

Investments in Renewable Energy in Guinea-Bissau

The European Commission has collaborated with Guinea-Bissau in an attempt to help better the country and its citizens. Aside from strengthening education and climate-resilient practices when it comes to agriculture and fishing, Team Europe is investing in clean and renewable energy with solar plants in rural areas of the country. In addition to this, the two are working to promote sustainable and climate-resilient practices, which include the use of renewable energy and agricultural techniques to protect the environment.

As of March 2015, the European Union pledged 160 million euros (which is just less than $2 million in the United States) in order to help strengthen the rule of law within the country and consolidate democracy. While this was over a decade ago, it shows good signs as to what is to come to Guinea-Bissau, thanks to the EU. In fact, the article states that this is the resumption of support towards the country from the union, rather than the start. In a more recent development, in 2020, during the Universal Periodic Review by the United Nations Human Rights Council, Guinea-Bissau received 197 recommendations; the country taking 193 into account, most of which involved the issue of sustainable development.

The types of renewable energy Guinea-Bissau is hoping to implement in the country’s future has been recorded as recently as 2021, specifically from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). IRENA’s 2021 energy profile release of the West African country found that out of the total energy supply available in the country, 85% of it was renewable, compared to the other 15%, which was oil. Furthermore, a closer look into Guinea-Bissau’s renewable energy use found that 100% of the renewable energy used in 2021 came from bioenergy. As of 2023, the renewable energy capacity of the country was 100% solar instead of bioenergy. This may be due to the increase of solar power installations across the country.

Looking Ahead

While Guinea-Bissau is a low-energy country, more than a million citizens are still unable to access electricity; renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau would do wonders for the country. Between boosting the country’s economy to improving countless families’ lives, renewable energy would create access to a feature that half of the country has not had exposure to. While progress might seem far away, due to the issues involving the West African country’s resources, the European Union is working to make the seemingly impossible, not only possible, but possible in the near future. Right before the pandemic, the EU had implemented suggestions to the country to help it improve its sustainable development, and Guinea-Bissau took nearly all of them into account. While the future is always uncertain, the use of renewable energy in Guinea-Bissau is looking up.

Since 2021, electricity demand within the Texas electricity grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has steadily increased. In the first nine months of 2025, electricity demand in ERCOT, which manages about 90% of the state’s load, reached a record high compared with the same period in previous years. Over those same months, ERCOT had the fastest electricity demand growth among U.S. electricity grids between 2024 and 2025. From January through September 2025, demand for electric power in ERCOT increased 5% compared with the same period in 2024 to 372 terawatthours (TWh), 23% more than the same months in 2021.

Utility-scale solar generated 45 TWh of electricity in the first nine months of 2025, 50% more than the same period in 2024 and nearly four times more than the same period in 2021, when utility-scale solar only produced 11 TWh. Wind generation through the first nine months of this year totaled 87 TWh, up 4% compared with the same period in 2024 and 36% since the same period in 2021. Together, wind and solar generation met 36% of ERCOT’s electricity demand in the first nine months of 2025.

Natural gas-fired generation also increased after 2021 but flattened more recently. Natural gas-fired generation between January and September increased to 161 TWh in 2023, 24% more than the same period in 2021. Since 2023, natural gas-fired generation remained relatively flat, totaling 158 TWh between January and September 2025. Although it is still the largest source of electricity for ERCOT, natural gas-fired generation averaged 43% in the first nine months of 2025, compared with 47% in the first nine months of 2023 and 2024.

The types of energy sources used for electricity generation can vary on an hourly basis, especially during the summer. Solar output is highest during midday hours, and the increased availability of solar generation in ERCOT in recent years has reduced the need for natural gas-fired generation during that time of the day. Solar generators in ERCOT produced an average of 24 gigawatts (GW) between noon and 1:00 p.m. during the summer months of June through September compared with an average of 12 GW of solar generation at noon in the summer months of 2023. Over the same period, the share of natural gas-fired generation at midday fell from 50% in 2023 to 37% in 2025.

Batteries store electricity during daytime when generation from wind and solar is the highest, and they supply electricity when generation from wind and solar is declining. Beginning in October 2024, ERCOT began reporting battery output separately in its hourly grid data. In the summer months of 2025, batteries helped supply electricity in the evening as solar output declined, supplying an average of 4 GW in the 8:00 p.m. hour.

ERCOT’s electricity demand is forecast to grow faster than that of any other grid operator in the United States through at least 2026. In our October Short-Term Energy Outlook, we forecast demand will rise another 14% in the first nine months of 2026 compared with the same period this year, reaching 425 TWh.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ERCOT-electricity-sources-trend-change-3.png,N,,2025-10-25 11:20:28.050535

Our two BESS projects are currently in the proposal stage. We are preparing an application to submit to the LT2 RFP. We are conducting community engagement, assembling the submission materials, and requesting a Municipal Support Resolution (MSR) from Council. If awarded an MSR, we would finalize the LT2 application submission. Please note that neither the MSR nor our application guarantees a contract award. If we are selected for a contract, we would then proceed with detailed permitting a nd development work; only after meeting all regulatory requirements (Municipal, MECP, ESA, etc.) would we finalize engineering and move into procurement and construction.

Post-award approvals (including but not limited to)

Municipal approvals: Official Plan and Zoning By-law review or amendment, Site Plan Approval, and Building Permit.

Provincial approvals: Environmental Compliance Approvals (MECP) for stormwater or sewage works, and coordination with other provincial bodies (e.g., conservation authorities, heritage or natural feature reviews) as applicable.

Electrical Safety Authority (ESA) approvals: Plan review, electrical permits, inspections, and connection authorization under the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (OESC).

Specific requirements may vary by municipality and site. All applicable processes will be followed, and the public will be updated as key milestones are reached.

Developer Information and Procurement Participation

The project owner, SUNN LT23 Corp., is a subsidiary of PowerBank Corp., a Canadian renewable and clean energy project developer and asset operator. Since 2013, PowerBank has advanced the growth of renewable and clean energy projects, helping to reduce carbon emissions through its development, engineering, and asset management services across Canada and the United States.

We are currently preparing applications for the IESO’s Long-Term 2 (LT2) RFP (C-1), which are due on December 18, 2025. If selected for a contract, permitting and development activities would begin in late 2026, following all applicable protocols related to safety, environmental protection, wetland conservation, and visual screening. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2027 at the earliest, with commercial operation expected by 2030. The project will operate for 20 years under the LT2 contract.

Environmental and Community Impact

Community

Community engagement includes an open house held on September 22, 2025, at 6:30 p.m. at the McGregor Recreation Centre (800 Lakeshore Dr, Shuniah, ON). This meeting provided community members with an opportunity to learn about the project and ask questions directly to the project team. Ongoing communication will continue throughout development and operation. A Community Benefits Agreement, to be entered into with the Municipality of Shuniah, will guide how the project supports local priorities and ensures that the surrounding area benefits directly from the investment over its lifetime.

Economy

The projects will support local economic growth by creating employment opportunities during the construction phase — including jobs for construction workers, electricians, and other skilled trades. Over the long term, operations and maintenance activities will provide stable technical positions and ongoing employment. The projects will also generate municipal tax revenue that contributes to essential public services and infrastructure improvements.

Environment

By storing clean energy and releasing it when needed, the projects will help optimize Ontario’s electricity grid using proven, safe technology. This supports the province’s climate goals, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions — all while maintaining a minimal environmental footprint.

Technology and How It Works

BESS plays a crucial role in storing excess electricity, making it available during peak demand or supply disruptions. This reduces reliance on costly and environmentally harmful peaking plants. Through this approach, BESS helps stabilize the grid, ensuring that Ontario’s energy system can meet both growing and peak demand using cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions. The project contributes to the creation of a flexible and resilient power grid that aligns with the government’s long-term energy goals, while also minimizing environmental impact and maintaining affordability for consumers.

Fire Safety and Protection

Safety is built into both the equipment and the overall project design from the start.

The system is remotely monitored 24/7/365. It can be remotely shut off.

All equipment meets strict safety certifications and follows national safety standards, such as:

NFPA 855

UL 9540 and 9540A

Before construction begins, we will work closely with local fire departments to plan safe access, training, and prepare a full emergency response plan.

Expected Timeline

December 2025: Application Submission

The project team will prepare and submit the full proposal to the IESO as part of the Long-Term 2 (LT2) procurement. This is the first key milestone and marks the official entry into the selection process for grid-connected battery storage projects in Ontario.

Fall 2026: Development Phase Begins

With contracts in place, the project moves into detailed engineering, permitting, procurement, and construction mobilization. This phase covers site preparation, equipment manufacturing, and early construction activities.

2029 – 2030: Commercial Operation Date (COD)

The BESS is expected to reach full commercial operation within this window. Once operational, the system will begin providing grid services such as peak load management, renewable energy integration, and improved grid reliability.

Frequently Asked Questions

Why do we need Battery Energy Storage Systems?

Battery storage plays a critical role in keeping Ontario’s power system stable and reliable. It stores clean energy when demand is low and releases it when demand is high, helping prevent blackouts and grid stress. It also supports renewable energy by storing power when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing, ensuring consistent electricity supply even when natural conditions change.

What is the current status of this project?

The project is currently in the application stage. The project team is preparing the submission for the IESO’s Long-Term 2 (LT2) procurement while conducting preliminary site studies and coordinating required municipal and provincial approvals. Once the permitting process is complete and approvals are secured, construction will begin, followed by testing and commissioning. If selected for a contract, the project would be expected to reach commercial operation by May 1st, 2030.

How safe is BESS technology?

Battery storage has been safely deployed in thousands of projects around the world with a strong safety record. Systems are designed with multiple layers of protection, designed to prevent any thermal event before it should occur. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, used in modern BESS, is much more stable and less flammable than older battery types. Fires are extremely rare, and the technology meets strict international standards.

What happens in the unlikely event of a BESS incident?

The risk of fire is very low, but safety systems are designed to keep it contained if it occurs. Battery units are built to prevent fires from spreading, and the design ensures it does not propagate. If a fire does occur, it will burn itself out without releasing harmful chemicals. Any gas produced disperses rapidly, and air quality impacts are minimal. People can remain in nearby areas safely.

We work closely with local fire departments — including volunteer teams — to ensure they receive specific BESS training and are fully prepared, including an Emergency Response Plan. The site is designed with wide access roads and clear entry points for emergency vehicles

What is the environmental impact of the BESS?

The BESS is a fully containerized system, meaning all battery components are enclosed within sealed, weatherproof units designed to prevent any interaction with soil or groundwater. These systems use non-toxic materials and do not release harmful substances during normal operation or in the unlikely event of an incident. They pose no risk to groundwater, drinking water, or nearby ecosystems.

The project will comply with all applicable environmental regulations and permitting requirements, including those of the local Conservation Authority, to ensure protection of natural features, wetlands, and watercourses. The LFP (lithium iron phosphate) chemistry used is among the safest and most stable available, producing no toxic runoff or long-term contamination.

What impact will this project have on the local community?

The project is designed to minimize its visual and physical footprint. Low-profile fencing and landscaping will limit visibility from nearby roads and homes, and noise will remain well within provincial standards. Property values are not expected to be affected. Safety buffers, vegetation clearance, and other proactive measures will ensure the site remains secure and non-intrusive.

What economic and social benefits will the project bring?

The project will create local construction and maintenance jobs, generate tax revenue, and support local community with a Community Benefits Agreement. It will also improve grid reliability, support local industry and economic growth, and strengthen the grid resilience by ensuring reliable electricity during peak demand or emergencies.

What happens when the BESS reaches end-of-life?

When the system reaches the end of its operational life, it will be safely decommissioned. Equipment will be removed, the site will be restored to its original condition as much as possible, and all battery materials will be responsibly recycled as per the requirements. Decommissioning plan is a requirement of the lease and typically a part of the permitting process.",https://powerbankcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/favicon-1.svg,N,,2025-10-25 07:18:12.215679

The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.
The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.
Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors.
“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.

Santee Cooper’s board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.

Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.

Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.

“The risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.

There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.

“I still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,” Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it’s not feasible.

Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

Santee Cooper executives credited President Donald Trump’s executive order in May calling for the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years for opening the door to the potential agreement.

“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.

Santee Cooper was the minority partner with what was then South Carolina Electric and Gas when construction on the two new nuclear plants started in 2013 at the V.C. Summer site — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Columbia — where SCE&G was already operating a reactor.

The project needed to be finished in seven years to get tax credits to keep the project’s cost from overwhelming the utilities, but it ended up behind schedule almost immediately.

Executives lied about the problems to keep money coming in. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",https://www.wccbcharlotte.com/content/uploads/2025/10/n/h/ap25297648011787-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:08:27.493144

EVANSVILLE, Indiana – Today, CenterPoint Energy announced an intention to delay plans to retire Unit 3 of its F.B. Culley Generating Station, backtracking on their commitment to be entirely coal-free by 2027. In previous CenterPoint plans, the utility wrote that “Coal plants have not been able to consistently compete on short term marginal price with renewable and gas energy” and that the plants, being old and outdated, were not designed to frequently cycle on and off, resulting in “increased maintenance costs and more frequent outages.”

Unit 3 of the Culley power plant has continued to have reliability issues and power outages, requiring costly upkeep and maintenance for CenterPoint that was then passed onto customers. Extending the life of the Culley plant poses more threats to reliability and affordability for customers.

Although the lowest cost resource plans in this study include retiring Culley Unit 3, CenterPoint did not even study a retirement prior to 2032.

In response, Nicole Chandler, Southwest Indiana Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer, released the following statement:

“The Culley coal plant is outdated, expensive, and unreliable. There’s no reason for CenterPoint to try to extend the life of a 50-year-old coal plant that continues to have power outages and costs even more to upkeep and maintain, while CenterPoint customers have been saddled with some of the highest utility bills in Indiana for years now.

“Instead of prioritizing solar and wind that’s more affordable and reliable for customers, the Trump Administration and Indiana legislators have continued to double down on expensive, polluting, and unreliable coal that costs more for all of us to keep our lights on and heat our homes. We can’t afford to keep throwing lifelines to coal. CenterPoint should stick to the promise they made to their customers by retiring coal at Culley and transitioning to clean energy, not backtrack and leave us with higher energy bills for years to come.”

The United States is poised to see a record surge in power demand this year, led by data centers' outsized energy needs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) says.

A steep pullback in benchmark gas prices last year from 2022's multi-decade highs after sanctions on Russia slowed talks, but a subsequent rebound, along with long-term LNG and domestic demand, has kept global buyers active.

Already the world's top LNG exporter, the United States is set to lift nameplate capacity to 115 million tons per annum (MTPA) this year, EIA data show.

The ramp-up has reignited mergers and acquisitions across key shale basins and the LNG value chain, with deal value climbing to about $30 billion in the first nine months of 2025 from $22.5 billion a year earlier, according to Rystad Energy.

More than $28 billion in gas and LNG assets are currently up for sale, Rystad's Palash Ravi said, citing potential deals involving Ascent Resources, BP, GeoSouthern, Williams and NextDecade's Rio Grande project.

In the Haynesville basin, Asian firms will outbid U.S. producers to secure feedstock for LNG imports, said Enverus analyst Andrew Dittmar.

U.S. LNG shipments to Asia are set to hit 3.61 million tons in October, the second-highest on record, driven by regional growth, cleaner energy goals, and Taiwan’s recent closure of its last remaining nuclear reactor.

""2025 is an inflection year,"" said EOG Resources CEO Ezra Yacob. ""We expect U.S. gas demand to grow 4%-6% annually through 2030, driven by LNG and power.""",https://pgjonline.com/media/cszpzhjv/ai-data-center-newsletter.jpg?v=1dc2ccd00e0e9d0,N,,2025-10-25 08:58:56.003245

Dive Brief:

Levi Strauss & Co. is updating its water strategy to reduce freshwater use across its operations and boost water recycling and reuse within its manufacturing process, the company announced Thursday.

The denim giant said it aims to cut its freshwater use by 15% across its garment manufacturing supply chain and processing facilities by 2030, compared to a 2022 baseline. These processes include cutting, sewing, laundry — activities the company said have the “largest impacts to water and nature” — and fabric dyeing and weaving.

Levi’s also has a goal to recycle and reuse 40% of water consumed during its manufacturing process by 2030 and has plans to publish an industry guide on water conservation and restoration.

Dive Insight:

The apparel manufacturer said it has a 2030 target for all of its direct discharge supplier facilities to achieve the “foundational” level established by the Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals Foundation — an organization which seeks to help the fashion industry phase out harmful substances from their supply chain and help brands and suppliers manage chemicals more sustainably.

Levi’s said it also aims for 25% of these facilities to hit the “progressive” level established by the ZDHC framework. This level entails facilities adopting advanced wastewater treatment processes and exhibiting a deeper knowledge of chemical management practices, according to the framework.

The company’s updated water strategy builds on goals it established in 2019 to reduce freshwater use across its manufacturing processes by 50% in areas of high-water stress by 2025, compared to a 2018 baseline. However, the company said it was only able to achieve 27% of this target by the end of 2024, causing it to revise its strategy and target date.

Levi’s new water stewardship strategy comes almost a year after the company unveiled its first climate transition plan. At the time, the company committed to achieving net-zero emissions across its supply chain by 2050 and set a few near-term sustainability targets. These included a goal to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2025, compared to a 2016 baseline, as well as a goal to cut absolute scope 3 emissions by 42% by 2030, compared to a 2022 baseline.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SnlJAaxEDHBG3xTdYqQQbAiTbYrCwMy_-SN_5KTwIQk/g:nowe:0:397/c:3923:2216/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUctMTUzMC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-25 01:17:42.726746

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Dive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.

Wright sent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a rule on Thursday that allows customers to file joint, co-located load and generation interconnection requests. The energy department said the rule would reduce study times and costs for improving the grid, while reducing the time needed for additional power to come online. The rule also pushes FERC to mull whether reviews for grid projects, which sometimes take years, can be done in 60 days.

As U.S. power demand spikes for the first time in two decades on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to boost power capacity, mainly from fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and grid access for the data center industry.

Energy secretaries can direct FERC, an independent panel of the Energy Department set to have a 3-2 Republican majority, to consider rules, but cannot force it to adopt them.

Edison Electric Institute, which represents publicly-traded electric utilities, said it supported Wright’s effort, saying it would strengthen the grid and drive down costs for customers.

An environmentalist slammed the move. “Pushing FERC to rubber-stamp connections in just 60 days while the government’s shut down and Trump builds a $300 million White House ballroom shows (how) out of touch his administration is from everyday Americans,” said Camden Weber of environmental group Center for Biological Diversity.

Wright also urged FERC to consider a rule to remove burdens for preliminary hydroelectric permits.

Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association, praised Wright’s move. “It is incumbent upon FERC, the Trump Administration, and Congress to ensure that third parties, such as Federal resource agencies, do not unduly inhibit hydropower development and instead foster its necessary growth to meet current challenges.”

IRVING, TEXAS – Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) announced that Indiana will be among the first states to receive funding from its five-year, $100 million workforce pledge, and has committed up to $5 million to training and upskilling efforts across the state. The pledge, announced as part of the company’s Centennial celebration, aims to grow interest in advanced manufacturing careers and prepare U.S workers for the future, unlocking quality jobs and industry-wide innovation.

“The future workforce will need skills for what comes next,” said Caterpillar Chief Human Resources Officer Christy Pambianchi. “We have our experts working on innovative training and resources to help skill and inform the next generation on how to navigate the worksite of tomorrow, and we’re excited to be starting here in Indiana to enable U.S. workers to enter high-quality jobs in the American manufacturing industry.”

Caterpillar will announce future workforce pledges in other states soon.

“Indiana is proud to be among the first states selected for Caterpillar’s workforce investment, which is a testament to our pro-growth policies, world-class workforce, and reputation as one of the best states in America to start and grow a business,” said Governor Braun. “Caterpillar’s continued commitment to Indiana demonstrates the strength of our business climate and our shared vision for the future of American manufacturing. We look forward to working together to prepare more Hoosiers for the high-quality careers of tomorrow.”

Caterpillar made the future workforce announcement at the company’s large engine facility in Lafayette, Indiana, which recently announced a $725 million capital expansion – one of the largest single manufacturing investments in the company’s global history – to greatly increase engine production and help meet the nation’s growing power needs.

“The demand for energy is increasing like never before,” said Jason Kaiser, Caterpillar Energy & Transportation Group President. “Many of the engines manufactured here in Lafayette will support power generation customers by providing reliable power – keeping operations running during outages and helping meet the growing energy needs driven by AI, data centers and other critical infrastructure across America and around the world.”

One of America’s oldest manufacturers, Caterpillar is a part of the country’s infrastructure, with more than 65 primary locations across 25 states and independent dealers from coast to coast. As a net exporter, Caterpillar workers in the United States build products that are shipped around the world, growing U.S. exports by 75% since 2016.

Caterpillar employs 51,000 people in the United States, including over 4,100 workers at 12 facilities across Indiana.

The company said its solar tower has a capacity factor 50% greater than traditional solar installations.
Capacity factor is the amount of actual electricity produced as compared to the theoretical maximum capacity of solar installed.
While typical flat installations have a capacity factor of about 22%, Janta Power said its typical installations achieve a capacity factor of about 32%.
The company currently offers a 5 kW solar tower, with 1.5 kW rooftop models as well as 8.5 kW and 10 kW towers under development.","Vertical three-dimensional solar tower developer Janta Power announced it has closed a $5.5 million seed funding round led by Mac Venture Capital and Collab Capital.

The funds are expected to help the startup scale its patented 3D solar towers which are designed to have high levels of energy density for space-constrained areas. The product has applications for data centers, EV charging hubs, telecom towers, universities, and a range of industrial facilities, said Janta Power.

Janta said its single-axis sun tracking tower’s geometry achieves approximately three times the solar surface area exposure of traditional flat arrays in the same land footprint. Each tower’s stacked vertical design captures both low-angle morning and evening light, producing a dual-peak power curve that better aligns with real energy demand, said the company.

The company said its solar tower has a capacity factor 50% greater than traditional solar installations. Capacity factor is the amount of actual electricity produced as compared to the theoretical maximum capacity of solar installed. While typical flat installations have a capacity factor of about 22%, Janta Power said its typical installations achieve a capacity factor of about 32%.

The company said it can achieve a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as low as $0.05 kWh.

The company currently offers a 5 kW solar tower, with 1.5 kW rooftop models as well as 8.5 kW and 10 kW towers under development.

The towers are currently deployed in pilot programs at major global airports, including Munich International Airport, and Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport.

Each structure is engineered to withstand winds of at least 110 miles per hour and as much as 170 mph, and feature steel construction and modular helical or pier foundations that eliminate the need for extensive grading, said Janta Power.

While single-axis tracker installations concentrate output near midday, Janta said its 3D configuration smooths energy delivery throughout the day, reducing ramp stress on grids and lowering reliance on peaker plants.

Paul Cicio, chairman of the Electricity Transmission Competition Coalition, said he believes that transmission costs have been the biggest driver of rising costs.
RISING ELECTRICITY COSTS SPARK VOTER ATTENTION IN VIRGINIA ELECTIONS “Competition promises fair prices for Americans.","Electricity prices did fall by 0.5% from the month before, offering some relief for consumers overwhelmed by increasing bills and concerns that soaring demand will hike prices further.

While energy services, including utility gas, were down for September by about 0.7%, the cost of these services was also up by 6.4% for the year.

Only prices for energy commodities, including gasoline, saw yearly decreases of about 0.5%. However, gasoline prices did rise month to month by 4.1%.

Broadly, energy prices increased by 1.5% from the month of August and were also up by 2.8% for the year.

Electricity prices have steadily risen since President Donald Trump took office in January, making it difficult for the president to keep his campaign promise of slashing the cost of energy and electricity in half.

INFLATION TICKED UP TO 3% IN SEPTEMBER AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

“Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,” Trump said during an August 2024 campaign rally in North Carolina.

“We’re going to get your energy prices down. We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%,” he echoed just a few days later during a Pennsylvania rally.

As prices remain high, Trump and his administration have pinned the blame on the deployment of renewable energy resources combined with the accelerated phaseout of fossil fuels.

Electricity experts have insisted that the underlying cause of soaring prices is not that simple, pointing to factors such as the replacement and maintenance of transmission lines, risk mitigation for extreme weather, and increased costs associated with maintaining and operating older power plants.

Plus, Energy Information Administration data compiled by the American Clean Power Association this fall revealed that the top 10 states with the largest share of renewables in their energy makeup have also seen significantly smaller electricity price hikes over the last year when compared to the national average.

Paul Cicio, chairman of the Electricity Transmission Competition Coalition, said he believes that transmission costs have been the biggest driver of rising costs.

He has repeatedly urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to pass an order that would require transmission projects to be subject to competitive bids, which he has claimed can reduce costs by about 25%.

RISING ELECTRICITY COSTS SPARK VOTER ATTENTION IN VIRGINIA ELECTIONS

“Competition promises fair prices for Americans. A competitive market means accountability, innovation, reliability, efficiency, and modernization,” Cicio said in a statement.

“The latest electricity price data is a clear signal to the two new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) commissioners Laura Swett and David LaCerte, that FERC must take immediate action to deliver rate relief for Americans as promised by President Trump,” he added.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PALIADES_NUCLEAR_MICHIGA_EDIT-8-e1761316763591.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-25 08:18:08.133018

Joining Scout staff at the event were construction and financing partners, community members and officials, as well as many of the 50+ landowners participating in the project.

Scout began development of the 180 MW Nimbus project, located in Northwest Arkansas’ Carroll County, in 2016. Construction is expected to finish early next year, after which the project will begin commercial operations and start generating enough electricity to power more than 40,000 homes annually.

“Nimbus is nearing completion after a decade of hard work by our team and the support of our incredible landowners, stakeholders, site workers, and the community that is making the project a reality,” said Michael Rucker, Founder and CEO of Scout Clean Energy. “The blade signing honors that work and allows us to pause to memorialize their contributions by signing a turbine blade that will fly above the project.”

Joining construction officials from Scout were representatives from MasTec, the general contractor for Nimbus. Construction commenced for the project in late 2024.

“From unpredictable weather to rugged terrain, the path to completion has demanded innovation, perseverance, and teamwork,” said Brendon Lamppa, VP of Wind Construction at MasTec Renewables. “Seeing the hard work of so many skilled individuals and community partners come to fruition through those challenges is the ultimate reward. The Nimbus Wind Farm will stand as a lasting source of renewable energy and economic value for Carroll County and the surrounding region for years to come.”

Electricity generated by the project will enter the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s (MISO’s) grid at the Dry Creek Substation in Green Forest.

Santee Cooper Selects Brookfield to Complete Two AP1000s at V C Summer

Brookfield, the Canadian private equity firm that holds a majority share of the ownership of Westinghouse, has been selected by South Carolina utility Santee Cooper to complete two partially built Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR type nuclear reactors.

Brookfield won the VC Summer development contract with the main factor being a commitment to paying down $2.7 billion of an existing $3.6 billion obligation Santee Cooper has on the site and sharing ownership and power. Ratepayers have been stuck with the debt since the project collapsed in 2017. Neither unit is more than 50% complete.

Three other bidders reached the best and final stage out of a reported field of 15 interested firms. The other bidders were reported to be the Nuclear Company, Elementl and the Oppenheimer Project. Brookfield’s proposal was the only one which put $2.7 billion on the table to address ratepayer obligations tied to the new project.

The company also agreed to allow Santee Cooper to retain a 25% stake in the final project – and receive 25% of the power it provided (at a below market cost). None of the other bidders had the financial capabilities to make a commitment to pay off the debt as part of the deal.

The utility launched a competitive bidding process in January 2025, receiving initial expressions of interest from over 70 potential bidders and 15 formal proposals. Working with industry experts, Santee Cooper developed key financial, risk mitigation and execution criteria by which the final proposals were measured.

Centerview Partners LLC served as financial advisor to Santee Cooper on the competitive process to sell its interest in the two partially built AP1000 nuclear units. J.P. Morgan also served as financial advisor to Santee Cooper.

What’s Next for the V C Summer Project?

Where things stand now is that the Santee Cooper Board of Directors approved on 10/24/25 a letter of intent with Brookfield Asset Management. The letter of intent establishes a six-week initial project feasibility period.

In that period, the parties will jointly select a project manager and evaluate construction providers that would be used in resuming construction of the two nuclear units. The six weeks also would allow for advanced discussions with entities interested in buying nuclear power generated by the units and facilitate additional due diligence, leading to execution of a Memorandum of Understanding.

Santee Cooper President and CEO Jimmy Staton said, “As we move closer to a final deal, our goal remains the same: to enable completion of these two units and thus provide 2,200 MW of carbon-free, reliable nuclear power that delivers energy security for South Carolina and specific benefits to Santee Cooper customers who are paying our initial investment.”

Staton noted that Santee Cooper’s strategic decision to maintain the equipment over the past eight years positions the V C Summer units for a quicker and less costly path to completion.

“The state of the units, and the fact that they use the same Westinghouse AP1000 technology that is now operating in Georgia and overseas, make these assets very attractive to the nuclear power industry.”

One key element of resuming construction is the continued involvement of Westinghouse Electric Co., which designed and owns the AP 1000 technology. “Brookfield is a majority owner of Westinghouse, which added to their proposal,” Staton said.

Completion of the two units could:

Generate thousands of temporary construction jobs.

Generate hundreds of highly skilled, permanent operational jobs.

Strengthen and diversify South Carolina’s energy portfolio.

Enhance grid reliability.

Help attract new industries, bringing more jobs and other economic benefits.

Unhappy Losing Bidder Writes a Strong Letter of Protest

According to a letter written by the CEO of the Nuclear Company, the firms withdrew its proposal. The firm had raised $100 million and hired a cadre of top level nuclear executive talent. It opened an office in Columbia, SC, and was widely seen as positioning itself win the business of completing the two reactors.

The letter challenged the utility on its assumptions tied to the cost of the restart and completion of the two reactors. The company’s CEP, Jonathan Webb, writtng from the company HQ in Lexington, KY, accused Santee Cooper of rigging the bidding process. (FITS News in South Carolina published the complete text of the letter on its website. The Nuclear Company did not respond to a media inquiry from Neutron Bytes. ( Full text of the letter – PDF file)

Webb wrote in his letter to the Santee Cooper board, “We are further concerned that the RFP process itself may have been fundamentally compromised by the evaluation of bids outside the established framework, by parties previously involved in the V.C. Summer project, and with access to information that the other parties did not have,”

“Sadly, this creates an uneven playing field and undermines the transparency and fairness essential to a project of this importance.”

“Restoring the confidence of South Carolinians in our ability to build nuclear power will require a transparent, rules-based process, one that ensures equitable treatment of all participants and safeguards the long-term interests of the people of South Carolina,” Webb continued.

“The lessons of this industry’s history are clear: when nuclear projects advance outside disciplined and transparent frameworks, the consequences are not hypothetical; they are catastrophic.”

Webb wrote in the letter that completing the two reactors would likely cost $20 billion. He noted that before a final investment decision is to be made that a six month period of technical and financial due diligence would be required to validate the design, assess site infrastructure, and build a project management organization.

Santee Cooper defended its decision. The utilituy did not address the concerns raised by CEO Webb. Instead it issued a statement on the benefits of its decision.

“Brookfield came to Santee Cooper with a proposal that set out the path to turn our prior nuclear investment into lasting value for our customers and all South Carolinians,” Santee Cooper board chairman Peter McCoy said in a statement.

“Our goals include completing these reactors with private money and no ratepayer or taxpayer expense, delivering financial relief to our customers and gaining significant additional power capacity for South Carolina. Brookfield’s proposal would do just that, and the company has the financial capability to stand behind its proposal.”

How V C Summer Went Wrong in 2017

It was the failure of one of the largest capital construction projects in the U.S. Every time another newspaper headline appeared about what went wrong at the V C Summer project, the dark implications of what it all means for the future of the nuclear energy industry got all the more foreboding.

A number of the principals at Westinghouse, SCE&G and Santee Cooper knew about the project’s problems and documented them to greater or lesser degrees as long as three years ago, 2014, that the project was a train wreck in the making that was racing towards a derailment of epic proportions. Eventually, four key executives were convicted of fraud in cases brought by the U.S. Department of Justice and sentenced to jail terms.

Instead of looking forward to a triumph for completion of two massive nuclear reactors generating 2300 MW of CO2 emission free electricity, the nation got endless political fallout, and lawsuits, plus billions in debt, which since 2017 have dominated the the complex contractual debris left behind like storm damage from a hurricane.

The failure of the V C Summer nuclear reactor effort had global implications for Westinghouse and for every country that planned to build nuclear reactors as CO2 emission free source of electrical power. Opponents of these projects at the policy level in government had a ready made anti-nuclear boogey man.

The surprise is that there are no surprises. All of the faults that caused the project in South Carolina to come to an early halt are with failures to follow project management schedule and cost control standard practices that have been known since Admiral Rickover supervised the construction of the first nuclear submarines in the 1950s. Gantt charts were developed as a project management innovation in 1910.

In addition, there were major supply chain woes ,including litigation, plus problems with compliance with nuclear quality standards and NRC regulations resulted in expensive rework.

Microreactor Company Announces Plans For Pilot Project At Texas University

Last Energy will use scaled-down version of its commercial PWR-20 plant

(NucNet) Microreactor developer Last Energy and the Texas A&M University System have announced plans for a microreactor pilot project at Texas A&M-Rellis, an applied research and advanced technology campus.

The project will feature Last Energy’s PWR-5, a microreactor design physically identical to the company’s commercial product, the PWR-20, scaled to 5 MW of electrical output. Last Energy said the PWR-5 will demonstrate low-power criticality and the ability to generate electricity for commercial output.

The PWR-20 is designed to be mass manufactured so production can be scaled to user demand. It is designed for flexible siting and “plug-and-play” installation.

Last Energy, which moved its corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas in May, has secured a lease agreement at Texas A&M-Rellis, procured a full-core load of fuel, signed an “other transaction agreement” (OTA) with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and begun formal licensing submissions with the NRC.

In February the Texas A&M University System selected four companies to explore developing advanced nuclear power reactors on the Rellis campus.

Each of the four companies, Kairos Power, Natura Resources, Aalo Atomics and Terrestrial Energy, could potentially build at least one commercial nuclear power plant at Rellis.

South Africa Reimagines the Pebble Bed Reactor

As part of a new Integrated Resource Plan, South Africa plans to invest in new effort to commercialize the pebble bed reactor. According to wire service reports, South Africa expects to lift the care and maintenance status of its Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) by the first quarter of next year.

The pebble-bed reactor (PBR) is a design for a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled nuclear reactor. It is a type of very-high-temperature reactor (HTGR), one of the six classes of nuclear reactors in the Generation IV initiative.

South Africa shelved its PBMR research and development effort in 2010 after spending $980 million and before building a planned demonstration model. Several of the key technical leaders of the effort left South Africa going to work for US SMR developer X-Energy which has been working to develop a commercial 80 MW HTGR nuclear reactor.

Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, the electricity and energy minister, told a media briefing the work on the pebble bed project is part of a long range Integrated Resource Plan that will raise the use of gas and nuclear power to 16% of total energy generation. Dependence on coal will drop from 58% to 27% by 2042. South Africa relies on coal to generate the bulk of its electricity.

New nuclear generation capacity of 10 GW, most of its from conventional SMRs and full size nuclear reactors, is foreseen, with gas at 16 GW, wind at 34 GW and solar PV at 25 GW by 2039. All of these numbers are for now aspirational as the country must still figure out how to finance the IRP’s objectives.

The energy minister told Reuters, “We are seeing huge opportunities around the world, with major players on data centers the biggest investors on SMRs (small modular reactors).”

Duke Sets Plans for New Light Water Reactors and SMRs

(NucNet) Duke Energy has filed its 2025 long term energy plan outlining supply and infrastructure investments for North and South Carolina, including expanded plans for new nuclear generation to meet rapidly rising electricity demand.

The Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy’s biennial roadmap for how the company is to meet future electricity needs across in the two southern states. The plan is reviewed by regulators in both North Carolina and South Carolina and updated every two years.

Duke said in a statement that the updated 2025 plan includes evaluation of both small modular reactors (SMRs) and large light-water reactors, targeting potential new nuclear capacity in service by 2037.

The statement said the company will expand licensing activities to preserve the option of developing either an SMR at its Belews Creek coal-fired site in North Carolina or a large-scale reactor unit at the William States site in South Carolina, which includes a new 750-MW combined-cycle natural gas plant, a 180-MW natural gas boiler and two dual-fuel 42-MW simple-cycle units.

The Lee site was previously selected by Duke more than a decade ago but the utility never broke ground to build twin AP1000s on the site. It cancelled the project in 2017. Since then electricity demand in the Carolinas is growing at eight times the rate of the past 15 years, driven by strong manufacturing and data center investments.

GLE Hits Technology Maturity Milestone for Laser Enrichment

(WNN) GLE, the exclusive licensee of the SILEX laser enrichment technology invented by Australian company Silex Sytems Ltd, began large-scale demonstration testing of the uranium enrichment process at its Test Loop facility in Wilmington, NC, in May. By mid-September, it had collected extensive performance data which the company said gave it the confidence that the process can be commercially deployed.

GLE has now reached TRL-6, as defined by the US Department of Energy’s DOE Technology Readiness Assessment Guide (G 413.3-4A), which means the technology has now been demonstrated in a relevant environment at the prototype or pilot scale, and is ready to move forward to full-scale systems.

The nine-point Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale was pioneered by NASA in the 1980s as a measurement system to assess the maturity level of a particular technology, from TRL-1 (basic principles observed) through to TRL-9 (total system used successfully in project operations).

“In plain language, this independent validation means that GLE has demonstrated large-scale, integrated system performance under relevant operational conditions and that our schedule for initial commercial deployment is achievable,” GLE CEO Stephen Long said.

“We now turn our attention to full-scale detailed design and disciplined deployment of our Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility (PLEF) in Paducah, KY. The PLEF would be built from an entirely-US supply chain, maintaining control of this vital new technology in the US and is expected to create first-rate advanced manufacturing jobs not just in Paducah, but around the country.”

GLE said its commercial deployment is backed by more than $550 million in privately funded engineering, design, manufacturing, and licensing activities across North Carolina and Kentucky and is one of six companies awarded an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract under the Department of Energy’s Low-Enriched Uranium program.

The company completed its full license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility in July. If approved, the facility would represent a multi-billion-dollar investment opportunity in the state, creating more than 300 permanent jobs when the plant is in operation.

If commissioned, the facility is expected to re-enrich more than 200,000 tonnes of high-assay depleted uranium tails acquired from the US Department of Energy and produce up to 6 million separative work units of LEU annually, delivering a domestic, single-site solution for uranium, conversion, and enrichment.

American Fuel Resources Plans Re-Start of Uranium Deconversion Project

American Fuel Resources (AFR) announced that it has formally submitted an application in conjunction with International Isotopes, Inc. (INIS) to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requesting approval for the transfer of Materials License Sub-1011 from INIS’s subsidiary, International Isotopes Fluorine Products, Inc. to AFR’s wholly owned subsidiary Green Salt Products, LLC (GSP). The 40- year license, issued in October 2012, is for a depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) deconversion site in Lea County, NM.

The application marks a key milestone in AFR’s mission to expand America’s DUF6 deconversion capacity. Upon NRC approval and financial close, GSP will assume full operational, regulatory, and safety responsibilities under the license.

Virginia Davies, Chief Financial Officer of AFR. said, “With proven technology, top-tier partners, and an experienced team, we’re advancing an asset that offers infrastructure-like durability and strategic importance to the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle.”

About American Fuel Resources

American Fuel Resources (AFR) is developing critical nuclear-fuel-cycle infrastructure to strengthen U.S. energy security and industrial resilience. Through its subsidiary Green Salt Products (GSP), AFR will convert DUF6 into DUF4 and high-purity fluorine, unlocking reliable domestic supply for nuclear conversion and strategic materials.

According to a report by the ANS Nuclear Newswire, the 40-year license for the project, which International Isotopes called the Fluorine Extraction Process and Depleted Uranium Deconversion Plant, was issued to Fluorine Products in October 2012.

The plant was to convert DUF6 into fluoride products for commercial resale (the deconversion process) and into uranium oxides for disposal. The facility was expected to process as much as 11 million pounds of DUF6 per year. However, no construction activities were carried out after the license approval.

Urenco Announces Plans To Double New Uranium Enrichment Capacity At Netherlands Site

The company aims to build reliable supply as West seeks to reduce reliance on Russia

(NuNet) Multinational uranium enrichment company Urenco has announced plans to double the expansion of uranium enrichment capacity at its site in Almelo, the Netherlands. Under the company’s capacity program, the first stage of expansion at Almelo was announced in December 2023, representing approximately 750,000 separative work units (SWU). The plant is scheduled to come online from 2027.

A new second stage of expansion will involve the construction of an additional centrifuge hall, representing another approximately 750,000 SWU, which is expected to come online from 2030. In total, the two expansions represent approximately 1.5M SWU of extra capacity at Almelo. Globally, Urenco has now committed to 2.5M SWU of new enrichment capacity and the first two centrifuge cascades are already online, in Eunice, NM.

Russia holds about 44% of the world’s uranium enrichment capacity and is a major global supplier of enriched uranium. Exports to the US are reported to be decreasing due to a 2024 law banning low-enriched uranium imports from Russia. The EU remains heavily dependent on Russian enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, a reliance that grew in 2023 as countries stockpiled fuel.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/v-c-summer-_thumb.png,N,,2025-10-24 21:58:34.837418

With more arriving soon, the South Korean auto giant is laying the groundwork for what’s shaping up to be a strong run.

Hyundai and Kia are betting on low-cost EVs.

Since launching the EV3 in Europe in late 2024, Kia’s compact electric SUV has quickly become one of the most popular EVs in the region.

The EV3 was the best-selling retail EV in the UK and ranked sixth in Europe in the first half of 2025. Hyundai’s Inster EV, which also arrived in late 2024, is now also gaining traction.

According to the latest figures, Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia, sold 103,476 compact EVs in Europe from January through September.

The Kia EV3 remains a hot seller, leading the surge with 55,514 units sold in the first nine months of 2025. At this pace, the EV3 is now expected to become Hyundai’s top-selling electric vehicle in Europe by the end of the year, outpacing the Kona Electric and IONIQ 5.

Hyundai sold 20,493 Inster EVs in Europe through September, right behind the Kona Electric at 21,224. With full-scale sales kicking off, the Inster EV is expected to surpass the Kona by the end of 2025.

By the end of 2025, Hyundai Motor Group, including Kia, expects to sell over 200,000 electric vehicles in Europe this year.

The Inster EV was “Germany’s best-selling electric small car” through July, according to Ulrich Mechau, President & CEO of Hyundai Motor Germany.

With new mass-market electric vehicles, including the Kia EV2, EV4, EV5, and the Hyundai IONIQ 3, rolling out or set to launch in 2026, Hyundai expects to see even more demand in Europe over the next few years.

What about those in the US? Well, the low-cost Kia EV2 and Hyundai IONIQ 3 will not be offered in the States, but Kia is expected to introduce the EV3 sometime in 2026. It’s also set to launch the EV4 early next year, likely starting at around $35,000.

Meanwhile, Hyundai already offers one of the most affordable electric vehicles in the US with the IONIQ 5. After the federal tax credit expired at the end of September, Hyundai reduced prices on the 2026 IONIQ 5 by nearly $10,000 on some trims. The 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 5 now starts at under $35,000.

The IONIQ 5 remains one of the top-selling EVs in the US, alongside the Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Ford Mustang Mach-E.

OC Geology Professor Joshua Hardt was the faculty lead coordinating the forum. This was the first time the college had hosted an event like it.

“I was approached by people from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last year about a partnership where they were collecting seismic data from this area, and they wanted to distribute the information that they got from that data to the public,” Hardt said.

“They were looking for someone who could be a partner to them for sharing that information, and I accepted. And here we are. This is our first ever event where we are trying to bring some of that initial information to the public, and as the years progress, we will be able to bring more specific information about the seismic activity here to them, the people here in the Permian Basin,” he added.

He said a lot of misinformation exists about the oilfield and how it influences seismic activity.

“We are trying to clear the air on some of that. We’re trying to bring actual, legitimate information, actual science, to the public to answer their questions. I’ve always found that having the right information tends to allay fears more than just meaningless assurances and so we’re bringing the actual science from the actual mouths of the actual experts here to the Permian Basin to answer those questions and make everyone understand exactly what’s going on,” Hardt said.

He encouraged students to attend the forum.

“We’ve made this event to be friendly to both students and experts. Whether you’re someone who’s been in seismic science for 20 years, or if you’re a high school student, you will be able to get something out of this event,” Hardt said.

Senior Recruiter Petey Lozano and Production Operations Manager Cameron McCartney, both of Diamondback, spoke to a group of attendees about the company — what they do and what they look for in the hiring process.

“Today’s just kind of an overview of the Permian Basin and then an overview of Diamondback,” McCartney said.

Lozano then reviewed career opportunities at the company.

One of their points was that they hire people from diverse backgrounds.

McCartney said if the Permian Basin was its own country it would rank third in oil production. Diamondback has more than 8,000 producing oil and gas wells.

“But I think that shows, domestically, the Permian Basin is the largest in the United States, and it’s the cornerstone of … American energy. If we were our own country, we’d be number three in the world, which is great. Permian Basin production volumes account for nearly half of all our U.S. production, and it’s a significant portion of our natural gas output, which is really going to a lot of the power you see now,” McCartney said.

“It’s an economic engine for the State of Texas. Almost $13 billion comes out of the Permian Basin in taxes, and that’s directly from the Permian Basin in the form of severance taxes. We’re paying … university funds — University of Texas, Texas A&M but that culminates to $13 billion in benefit to the State of Texas,” he added.

Lozano noted that if you are from the Permian Basin, you are likely connected to someone who works in the oilfield.

It’s a dominant force in our area here. Without the people, we couldn’t get the job done.

“I think workers that are out here in the backbone of the oil and gas industry, if you think about it, the oilfield, roughly, employs 645,000 individuals in Texas and just in and, of course, nationwide, that’s 862,000, so if you think about it, almost three quarters of the people who work” in oil and gas are in Texas, Lozano added.

Diamondback covers the Permian Basin, everything from Big Spring to Coyanosa and everything in between. Lozano said almost 1,800 people work for the company.

He added that Diamondback is not laying people off.

Lozano said Diamondback is hiring. He added that they have 56 openings right now.

He said the company has finance, communications, community engagement, accountants, lease operators and other positions.

He advised people just getting out of high school to work on their resumes in terms of punctuation and don’t make them too long, interviewing skills, communication, working on technical skills and taking dual credit classes.

Other advice was to have a clean driving record.

But not everyone needs to fast charge at a Tesla Supercharger or Electrify America station every day, unless they’re road-tripping. And not everyone owns a home with a garage to install a Level 2 charger in the first place.

Renters make up a large share of American households, yet they often lack adequate charging options. That could soon change under a new proposal that, if successful, could unlock millions of potential EV buyers.

Welcome to Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news shaping the world of electric cars and technology.

Also making news today: Rivian has let go of hundreds of workers amid aggressive cost-cutting just as CEO RJ Scaringe is taking another top role at the company. Plus, battery start-up QuantumScape has moved one step closer to the mass production of its proprietary solid-state cells.

Let’s get rolling.

30%: Why The Next Phase Of EV Charging Should Focus On Apartments

With the $7,500 federal clean vehicle credit now gone, analysts expect EV sales to decline in the near term. Still, there are ways to soften the blow with smarter policies and infrastructure. Automakers must build affordable, competitive EVs to start with. But buyers need more than just attractive models to make the switch.

Installing chargers at apartment complexes and rental properties could unlock a whole new pool of EV buyers, according to a new study.

Long-time Republican strategist Mike Murphy, who runs the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance, and was also a guest on the InsideEVs Plugged-In Podcast earlier this year, is reportedly lobbying California Governor Gavin Newsom to invest in home chargers at apartments and condos across the state.

If the experiment succeeds, it could serve as a blueprint for the rest of the country.

Murphy told Politico that multi-family home charging was lacking in California, where EV adoption is otherwise the highest in the country. California accounts for one-third of all EV sales in the U.S.

Renters, in particular, have little incentive to install chargers if they’re only living in an apartment temporarily. Landlords, meanwhile, may not fully understand the benefits of home charging or worry that the plugs could go unused if tenants drive gasoline cars.

Here’s more from that report:

Renters, who are far less likely to own EVs than homeowners, represent a potentially game-changing untapped market in a state where growth for battery-electric and plug-in hybrid cars has stalled in recent years.

Murphy’s plan would tap revenue from the state’s carbon-emissions trading program — a figure he said would be $100 million annually in an ideal world — to fund state-run installations and, in turn, let landlords charge a small monthly fee.

“It’s got to be landlord-friendly,” Murphy said. “We’re going to put it in for free, and you can charge a little money for it. It takes out all the headaches for the apartment building owner.”

This idea isn’t coming out of the blue. Politico cited a study which concluded that three out of four apartment renters in California were willing to pay up to $50 per month for a parking spot if it were equipped with a Level 2 charger.

It makes plenty of sense for the renter to use cheaper residential electricity to charge up their EVs, especially if their vehicle is lying idle for the vast majority of the time. If renters commute daily, they could wake up to a fully charged battery every morning, saving significantly on fuel costs, which are especially high in California.

Landlords, meanwhile, could earn a small monthly fee and make their properties more appealing by offering EV charging.

It’s a great idea on paper, but execution could be a different beast, especially when politics and governments are involved.

California has already backed out of Governor Newsom’s earlier proposal to replace the now-dead $7,500 federal tax credit with a state-funded alternative due to budget deficits. And getting lawmakers to agree on a friendly application framework to release the funds for the home chargers could be another big challenge.

Still, if the state can muster the political will to pull this off, it could be a game-changer for EV adoption locally and potentially even across the country.

60%: Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe Has A New Job

Rivian is undergoing a major restructuring as it gears up to launch its Tesla Model Y rival, the R2 SUV, early next year. CEO RJ Scaringe will temporarily take on a dual role as Chief Marketing Officer while the company searches for someone to take up the new position.

This comes after Rivian laid off 600 employees, The Wall Street Journal first reported, in what appears to be another effort to cut costs. The company continues to face intense competition and has yet to produce an EV profitably, losing thousands of dollars on every R1S and R1T it sells.

But Rivian is hoping the upcoming R2 will help turn things around. The mid-size electric SUV, expected to start at around $45,000 when it debuts next year, aims to disrupt the market much like the Model Y did five years ago.

But it will have to do so without the help of a $7,500 federal tax credit and succeed purely on merit. It's also arriving in an increasingly difficult economic and policy environment that keeps getting more uncertain due to tariffs and export controls from China.

90%: QuantumScape Is Now Making Near-Production Solid-State Battery Cells

California-based battery start-up QuantumScape said on Thursday that it had started shipping B1 samples of its solid-state lithium-metal batteries to customers.

These B1 samples typically refer to prototype or validation cells that are essentially pre-production batteries made to test and refine the design before full-scale manufacturing begins.

The Volkswagen Group is QuantumScape’s largest shareholder and one of its primary customers. The company has poured north of $200 million into the battery start-up to develop solid-state battery cells.

100%: Should Apartment Rentals Start Including Charging Stations?

According to the National Association of Realtors, roughly 45 million households in the U.S. are rented (as of 2022 data). That’s out of a total of about 130 million households, indicating a large pool of renters that could benefit from Level 2 home charging.

Do you think pro-EV states like California should do more to encourage landlords to install home chargers? If you rent, would access to a Level 2 plug be a deciding factor in choosing an apartment? And if you drive a gas car, would having a charger in your parking spot make you consider switching to an EV? Share your thoughts in the comments.

(TSX:ARA), a Toronto Stock Exchange listed company, is focused on building a vertically integrated supply chain for rare earths alloys used in permanent magnets.","TORONTO, October 24, 2025 - Aclara Resources Inc. (""Aclara"" or ""Company"") (TSX:ARA) is pleased to announce its decision to construct the first heavy rare earths (HREE) separation facility in the United States, located in the State of Louisiana (the ""Project"") with an expected secured sustainable feed from two ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile.

Key Project Highlights

The Project is scheduled for completion in 2027, contingent upon the timely completion of funding and offtake agreements.

Upon the Company achieving a secured feed from its sources in Brazil and Chile, the Project will become the first HREE separation plant in the U.S. with an integrated HREE feed from two ionic clay deposits in friendly jurisdictions, which deposits are expected to be in operation by in mid-2028.

Designed as a comprehensive solution for rare earths, the Project is expected to produce high-purity Dysprosium (Dy), Terbium (Tb), and other restricted HREEs and light rare earths (LREEs), essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, and robotics.

Provided the achievement of full production, Aclara anticipates being able to supply more than 75% of the U.S. requirements of DyTb for electric vehicles by 2028.

Annual production upon the successful development of the Company's ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile is anticipated to be 200 tpy (Dy), 30 tpy (Tb) and 1,400 tpy (NdPr) of separated high-purity oxides, representing approximately 14% of China's official DyTb production.[1]

The State of Louisiana is supporting the Project with an estimated US$46.4 million in tax incentives and grants.

This initiative marks a major milestone in Aclara's mine-to-magnet strategy, establishing a vertically integrated supply chain for permanent magnets, starting from our two ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile, moving into our HREE separation facility in Louisiana and supplying alloys to our strategic alliance with magnet-maker VAC (VACUUMSCHMELZE), who are currently building a permanent magnet production facility in Sumter, SC.

Project Development

Aclara will invest approximately US$277 million to develop the Project on an 82-acre Louisiana Economic Development (LED) certified site at the Port of Vinton.

The site offers direct road and waterway access via the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and proximity to chlor-alkali facilities, with the LED Certified designation allowing for immediate industrial development and fast-track construction.

The Company is also planning an additional investment to construct a metals and alloys plant on the property, to support the high-performance permanent magnet industry.

The separation technology being developed by Aclara is designed with scalability in mind, allowing potential capacity expansion to process material from other ionic clay deposits or compatible feedstocks in the future.

Hatch Ltd. (""Hatch"") has been retained to develop the engineering of the Project in addition to its work relating to the Company's Carina project located in the State of Goiás, Brazil (the ""Carina Project""), ensuring strong coordination across projects, driving cost efficiencies, and optimizing schedules, with an aim to reduce execution risk.

Virginia Tech Partnership for Technology Validation

Aclara is collaborating with Virginia Tech (""VT"") to validate its proprietary separation process through a pilot plant whose construction is currently underway and expected to be fully operational by Q1 2026.

By the time production is expected to start at the Louisiana plant, Aclara expects to have accumulated approximately 1.5 years of feed-specific operational data that will serve to accelerate the ramp-up, optimize efficiency and maintain steady-state operations.

Integration with Aclara's Ionic Clay Deposits

Once secured feed is achieved, the Project will become the only HREE separation facility in the United States that is integrated with ionic-clay deposits from friendly jurisdictions, ensuring the reliable production of significant quantities of HREEs.

Aclara's simultaneous optimization of mining and separation processes provides a competitive advantage among ionic clay developers and accelerates project execution.

Significant progress has been achieved at the Company's Goiania pilot plant to enhance the purity of the mixed rare earth carbonate that will supply the Louisiana separation facility upon successful production from the Carina Project.

The Carina Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS), prepared by Hatch, is scheduled for publication in early November 2025, with the Feasibility Study (FS) expected in Q2 2026.

Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry, commented:

""By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation. We're excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities - and for a Louisiana economy that's ready to power and lead our nation's future.""

LED Secretary, Susan B. Bourgeois, commented:

""Louisiana is proud to welcome Aclara and the innovation it brings to our industrial landscape. Aclara's investment underscores the importance of development-ready sites and strong local partnerships that give global companies the confidence to choose Louisiana. The Project builds on our state's strengths in advanced manufacturing and workforce excellence, reinforcing Louisiana's leadership in industries vital to the nation's energy and defense security.""

Aclara's CEO, Ramon Barua, commented:

""We are pleased to announce that we have secured a premium site in Louisiana for our U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility. Our priority was to identify a location that could support rapid development, given the urgent need to establish a reliable supply of these critical minerals. The reception from Governor Landry and his team has been outstanding, and Louisiana's LED program offers exactly the kind of pro-investment environment this strategic sector requires.

In addition, Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we require, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs. The state's highly established chemical industry and skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.

Our Project is unique in the Western world: with direct access to our ionic clay deposits, this will be the only fully integrated heavy rare earth separation operation currently capable of producing material volumes of heavy rare earths at scale. We are moving at an accelerated pace to bring supply online as quickly as possible, and we are working to have our projects converge and enter production by mid-2028.""

Aclara's COO, Hugh Broadhurst, commented:

""This facility will become a cornerstone of critical minerals reindustrialization in the Western Hemisphere. Louisiana was selected for its robust chemical and manufacturing ecosystem, attractive investment policies, experienced industrial workforce, and strategic geographic location. The incentive package offered by the State of Louisiana underscores the State's commitment to attracting high-technology and sustainable manufacturing investments.""

Dr. Aaron Noble, Professor and Department Head Mining and Minerals Engineering at Virginia Tech, commented:

""Aclara's leadership in rare earth extraction and processing complements our department's commitment to advancing technology and preparing future leaders in the mining industry. Their pilot facility will bring cutting-edge industrial innovation to our doorstep while creating transformative opportunities to advance our ongoing R&D efforts in REE separations.""

Hatch's Managing Director of Minerals, Conrad Blake, commented:

""We are excited to have been retained by Aclara to work on an integrated project that encompasses the Carina Project, the concentrator and the separation plant. Leveraging our decades of experience in solvent extraction technologies, this holistic approach is designed to drive operational efficiencies and minimize execution risk of the project across the entire value chain.""

President Trump Demands Cash From South Korea, Which South Korea Is Not Wont To Do One of these days, I’ll write my big piece on how the car market is way more influenced by the relative strength of different currencies than most normal people consider.
Given that South Korea has faced currency issues before, this seems like a reasonable fear.","I think a lot about fast followers, which are companies that aren’t necessarily first to a market, but come close enough and learn enough lessons to compete and/or sometimes dominate. (Apple wasn’t the first company to make a smartphone, nor was VHS the first tape-playing system). For a time, it seemed like Rivian could be that successful fast follower. Now it’s a lot less clear.

The fate of Rivian is important, if only because the company has one potentially good car coming soon and one possibly great car a little further down the track. Can the company overcome its loss of momentum to get there? That’s a big question in today’s Morning Dump.

It’s questions all around, today, actually. Can South Korea come to terms with a White House that wants a lot of cash now? Are Canada and the United States going to be able to make it work, or is the World Series suddenly something of more importance?

And, ending on a positive note, is Toyota’s SEMA concept the tamest SEMA concept ever?

Rivian Settles Lawsuit, Lays Off A Bunch Of People

There are so many advantages that Rivian had coming into the EV space. It had two attractive products that filled important niches in the market (large SUV and truck, plus a van). It was building those vehicles in America. The CEO comes off charming and not at all delusional. And, at the time, there was a huge amount of buzz around EVs, allowing the company to take in a lot of money in its IPO.

Now the company is hovering around 10% of its initial high share price, the buzz around EVs is dying, EV trucks are less popular, many incentives are going away at the federal level, and building cars in America now comes with a bunch of added materials costs thanks to tariffs.

Also, some of that IPO money is going back. Shareholders sued Rivian, claiming that the company knew it was going to raise the price of its R1 truck and SUV before it listed shares, which caused the value of those shares to drop once this was announced. While Rivian has not admitted any wrongdoing, Reuters reports that the company will pay $250 million to settle the case so it can focus on its big swing: Another two-row SUV called the Rivian R2.

People love their Rivians, generally, so perhaps a two-row SUV that costs about $45,000 and gets over 300 miles of range will appeal to a lot of people. It does feel like there are already a ton of those for sale now, although that price does make it cheaper than some potential gas-powered equivalents like the Audi Q5.

This launch is extremely important because, even with a cash injection from Volkswagen, the company continues to lose money on every vehicle it sells. Will its Q3 numbers show any improvement? Maybe.

In order to save money and “streamline,” the company announced it was laying off around 600 people, and forming “a single marketing organization” with CEO RJ Scaringe as the interim CMO, according to an email seen by Automotive News. Lowering costs is probably a good idea, though, until I drive it, I’m going to be a little skeptical that, in this market, a two-row SUV is going to move the needle enough to reverse the company’s fortunes.

You know what might? The dope as hell Rivian R3. This is a cool hatchback-type thing that’ll hopefully start in the upper-$30k range (though more for the hot version). Perhaps it’s overly optimistic to think a Hyundai Ioniq 5-sized vehicle will do any better than the Ioniq, but there is something indescribably alluring about it.

Does the R2 launch have to work for us to ever get an R3? Probably.

President Trump Demands Cash From South Korea, Which South Korea Is Not Wont To Do

One of these days, I’ll write my big piece on how the car market is way more influenced by the relative strength of different currencies than most normal people consider. A good example might be what’s happening with South Korea.

The country badly wants a deal with the United States so it can, among other things, sell cars with roughly the same tariffs as Japan. In order to get that, it pledged a lot of money in investment in the United States (a big chunk of which would be coming from Hyundai). The White House thanked Hyundai for its commitment by arresting a bunch of its citizens helping to build one of those investments.

Whereas Japan and the United States have a somewhat detailed outline of a trade deal, South Korea’s potential treaty depends on how much of that investment in America is in cash. And how fast that cash comes into the country.

This is tough for South Korea because, historically, the country’s exports helped make it money by building cars cheaply in the South Korean won and selling them in dollars, euros, and pounds. I won’t get into the complexity of the currency markets, but the won ain’t the dollar, and the country’s leaders fear that without having the ability to swap currencies freely with the United States, it’ll destabilize its own currency. Given that South Korea has faced currency issues before, this seems like a reasonable fear.

The South Korean plan has seemingly been to send over some cash, but mostly loans and guarantees. President Trump, though, seems to want that JG Wentworth speed.

Per Bloomberg:

Washington has pressured South Korea to accept conditions included in the agreement with Japan, such as the deadline for investments being Jan. 19, 2029, when Trump’s term ends, and allowing the U.S. government to select where the money goes. U.S. media also reported that Washington sought an increase in the investment amount.

“We are doing our utmost to persuade them that there are differences between Japan and South Korea, using various objective data and analyses,” Yeo told reporters last month.

South Korea’s foreign exchange reserves stood at about $422 billion as of the end of September, according to its central bank. The $350 billion that the U.S. is demanding is equivalent to 83% of that. Japan’s $550 billion investment promise is equivalent to approximately 40% of its foreign exchange reserves.

There are concerns that a short-term outflow of dollars could destabilize the country’s exchange rate.

The constant request for cash immediately on various fronts from the Trump Administration can be viewed in many ways. All presidents want stuff to happen in their own terms, which is why President Kennedy called for the United States to put a man on the moon before anyone knew how to do it. Perhaps it comes from a view that this long period of simmering inflation and cooling employment can’t last. Or maybe there’s some sort of massive remaking of the presidency that gives it unprecedented power to spend the money of private corporations.

Either way, destabilizing South Korea’s currency isn’t great if you want that country to also invest in the United States.

Trump V. Canada, Part Tres

President Trump was on Truth Social this morning and, in between ads for hearing aids and gold coins with the President’s face on them, was some angry messaging about the trade relationship between the United States and Canada.

What happened? The head of the Canadian Province of Ontario put out an ad campaign in the United States, just using a video of Ronald Reagan, pointing out that tariffs are bad.

If you want to read the full speech, btw, it’s here. I think this is the bit that’s upset the President:

You see, at first, when someone says, “Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,” it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works — but only for a short time. What eventually occurs is: First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.

The memory of all this occurring back in the thirties made me determined when I came to Washington to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity. Now, it hasn’t always been easy. There are those in this Congress, just as there were back in the thirties, who want to go for the quick political advantage, who will risk America’s prosperity for the sake of a short-term appeal to some special interest group, who forget that more than 5 million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business and additional millions are tied to imports.

If there’s one thing that the President pays attention to, it’s television, and this ad has made him real mad. So mad that he’s stopped talks with Canada. According to NBC, this has happened before:

Trump’s termination of talks Thursday is not the first time he has cut off trade negotiations with Canada. In June, he said he was “terminating ALL discussions on trade with Canada,” citing the treatment of American tech companies and dairy farmers.

Canada quickly retaliated, slapping a quota on steel products, over what Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne called “unjust U.S. tariffs.”

But days later, Canada announced it would rescind its digital services tax, which would have hit major U.S. companies, to appease Trump.

So, we’ll just have to wait and see what Canada can do to lower the temperature.

Toyota’s SEMA Camry GT-S Is Extremely Orange

Toyota is out with a SEMA Camry concept, and this version doesn’t come with a NASCAR-sourced V8 or wild powertrain. It doesn’t have 9,000 horsepower. It’s just a little lower, a little more agro, and a lot more orange.

As the company explains in a press release:

Unlike the over-the-top builds that often headline SEMA, the GT-S stays rooted in reality with its 232 horsepower, stock 2.5-liter four-cylinder hybrid system remaining unchanged. The interior, too, remains true to the production Camry, underscoring the build’s mission to highlight exterior design, stance, and chassis tuning as a natural extension of Camry’s existing capabilities.

[…]

“The Camry GT-S Concept is more than just a SEMA one-off—it’s a study in what a performance and style package could mean for Camry in the future,” said Adam Rabinowitz, chief designer, Toyota CALTY Design Research. “Our goal was to create something aspirational yet attainable, and to use this platform to gather valuable feedback from consumers.”

The team also focused on upgrades to complement the pronounced GT-S bodylines. At each corner, adjustable coilovers lower the chassis by 1.5 inches, yielding a more aggressive stance and improving handling. A high-performance brake upgrade includes massive 8-piston calipers squeezing 365mm front rotors with 6-piston calipers matched with 356mm rear rotors. To enhance mechanical grip, 20-inch performance wheels mounted with 245/35R20 tires fill the wheel wells.

You know what? I’m into it. This car could easily see the light of day, as Toyota hints approximately 400 times in its press release. I love a wild SEMA concept, too, don’t get me wrong, but production-intent stuff has its place.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

Thanks to the reader who sent in this salsa tune, which, I think you’d agree, is the sonic version of the Toyota Camry above. It’s “Lección de Amor” by Adalberto Alvarez. Che romantica!

On Saturday, October 18, 2025, my wife and I marched, protested, and rallied for democracy in Houston, Texas. We came to Discovery Green to see what the “No Kings” protest was like and stayed to march to City Hall, shout chants, and show that we don’t support President Trump’s policies and police state tactics for citizens or non-citizens in the United States of America.

Already in the Conservation and Environmental part of our lives I have seen what is in store for those who believe and support in a present and future that is based upon humans as one living thing on Earth that has a right to exist and evolve but also includes the right of all other living and non-living things to exist and evolve.

For me, I have seen the government, which before President Trump stated it wanted citizens to be partners, stakeholders, and participants in the protection and management our public lands, forests, parks, wildlife refuges, conservation lands, and other lands that we own, reject collaboration and cooperation that before was stated as a regular part of our laws, policies, rules, and regulations.

I have seen public servants, who before were friendly to my suggestions and advances for protection and management of our public lands, put up a wall of resistance against accepting citizen comments in the spirit of give and take to make proposed projects greener for us now and in the future.

I have seen the government delay, refuse, and mislead with words the right of citizens to obtain documents that we own. The rule of law, via the Freedom of Information Act, is treated as a formality, not a right and a legal mandate.

In some ways this has been coming for years, but under President Trump this kind of inappropriate behavior and illegal and criminal action now is policy that is demanded of all public servants at the risk of being fired if they resist and obey the law.

This cannot stand and we must fight against it. Democracy is about resistance to tyranny and the demand for rights of people to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

This has got to be the most anti automobile industry administration in my career.","With help from Noah Baustin, Garrett Downs and Heather Richards

BACK IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT: Chris Grundler thought he’d mostly closed the book on his career in environmental regulation. After 42 years at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, where he helped write America’s clean car rules and oversaw the Volkswagen emissions fraud investigation, he retired in 2022 to a medieval village in southern France.

Then President Donald Trump won a second term.

Now, Grundler is back in the trenches. But this time he’s in Sacramento, where Gov. Gavin Newsom and other California officials are pitching the most populous state in the country as a counterweight to the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental rules.

In May, Grundler joined the California Air Resources Board as its new deputy executive officer for mobile sources and incentives. It’s his job to flesh out California’s response to the Trump administration’s move to deny the state’s special authority to enforce its own clean car rules, which effectively ended the state’s electric vehicle sales mandate. Beyond having major implications for the nation’s entire auto market, the response Grundler cooks up will determine whether a smoggier California can meet federal air quality standards and continue to receive highway funding.

“This is a galvanizing moment in history for the state of California,” Grundler said in an interview. “I told my staff, there’s no time for hand wringing, there’s no time for catastrophizing. We have a job to do. This is a public health agency.”

Grundler spoke to POLITICO about his decision to join California, his experience with Trump administrations, and how he sees the state’s role in bolstering the EV market.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

How did you decide to come out of retirement to work for California?

It was just heartbreaking to watch the systematic dismantling of my and colleagues life’s work and very painful to watch the attacks on federal workers, watch the attacks on my colleagues in California, who I worked with for many years. I had to decide, and this is how I explained it to my kids, I could be angry about it, I could be sad about it, I could be depressed about it, or I could try to do something about it. And this opportunity emerged. I was living in a small medieval village at the time in the southern part of France, and applied and interviewed from France, accepted the job from France, signed a lease for an apartment in Sacramento, sight unseen, and rushed back to work, and I haven’t looked backwards. I have no regrets. I came in with my eyes open. I knew it was going to be challenging, but I really didn’t have a choice. I needed to feel as though I was at least trying to do something, because there’s just so much at stake.

What was your experience like working in the first Trump administration? How does it compare to what we’ve seen so far out of Trump 2.0?

I thought it was very important for me to serve during the Trump administration. I had responsibility for 400 some people that I cared a lot about. At first, I really thought that I would be able to reason with the new political leadership, because I served in the Reagan administration, both Bush administrations, and they believed in the mission of EPA, they just had different policy ideas and strategies. In Trump One, they thought very, very differently and they did not listen to the career staff. We did our best to try to explain, if you want to do this, here’s the proper way under the law to make these changes. They chose not to accept that advice, which is why so many of the actions in Trump One failed in court.

But then I retired and this administration, for many different reasons, came to power and came to EPA with a very, very different agenda in mind. The speed of what they’re doing has really surprised me, and their very transparent contempt for public servants is bewildering, frankly. Every previous administration came in with a goal to win the hearts and minds of the people, the experienced people, talented people, to execute their agenda. It’s really hard to do that when you come in very clear that you don’t trust, value or even respect.

What do you see as California’s role in making policies for vehicles right now?

I’ve been a part of this business for many, many years. I grew up in Michigan, near the auto industry. I have family that worked in the auto industry. I love cars. I had a subscription to the Road & Track magazine before I had a driver’s license. This has got to be the most anti automobile industry administration in my career. I feel like we’re the only ones standing up for the industry right now, as strange as that might sound.

This industry has allocated enormous amounts of capital in building these cleaner cars, and a big part of my job, and the governor’s focused on this as well, but we think we need to protect that investment, and we’re going to do that by growing the market here for these cleaner air vehicles in California. I’m inviting my colleagues in the auto industry to help shape that future, and my job is to persuade them that long term certainty with the California Air Resources Board is their friend… We’re trying to be the responsible actors here.

California is running out of tools, though, with the repeal of its Clean Air Act waivers to enforce its own clean car rules. What’s left? What can you realistically deliver?

We have other rules we can enforce, and we have fiscal tools that we’re employing. We have consumer incentives. We have a very important heavy duty, Clean Truck Check to make sure that trucks are complying with the law as they drive our streets and highways. We’re working with the Legislature on clarifying existing tools and inventing new tools.

We’re launching these new regulatory initiatives precisely to continue to send the signal to the market that investing in these cleaner technologies still matters. Congress can’t kill the electric car. [U.S. EPA] Administrator [Lee] Zeldin can’t kill the electric car. That remains the future. Just ask [General Motors CEO] Mary Barra, and she continues to say that, and they’re competing in a global market. It might take us a little bit longer. We might need to find different ways to get there, and we’re looking at everything available to us that exists and that hasn’t existed. But the story of our demise is premature. — CvK

GLOVES UP: The Trump administration is in for a fight over its push to open federal waters to oil drilling off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, including areas abutting Southern California. A slew of lawmakers are coming out in opposition to the idea, and it’s not just Democrats throwing up red flags, reports Garrett Downs for POLITICO’s E&E News.

Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Trump ally running for governor, threw her weight behind a ban on drilling off her coast that the president implemented during his first term.

“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” Mace’s communications director, Sydney Long, said in a statement. “Congresswoman Mace continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina to protect our coastline, economy, and way of life.”

Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida expressed similar concern.

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Scott said, using Trump’s preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. “It’s important to Florida.”

Democrats weighed in with their own full-throated condemnation.

“President Trump’s Big Oil agenda will have devastating impacts on our coastlines if the administration decides to open California’s waters to dangerous offshore oil projects,” said California Sen. Adam Schiff in a statement. — NB

FAILURE TO RESTART: Did someone say offshore drilling fight?

In September, Sable Offshore Oil Corp. asked for permission from the California Office of the State Fire Marshall to restart a pipeline system that once carried oil from the three rigs it owns off the Santa Barbara coast to shore. But State Fire Marshal Daniel Berlant on Wednesday sent the company a letter throwing up a serious road block.

Sable has not made all the repairs it must and has a “deficiency” in meeting the terms of waivers his agency previously issued to the company, according to Berlant.

“The above findings alone and the inconsistencies with the State Waiver requirements prevent restart under the law,” Berlant wrote, adding that his agency’s review of the company’s restart plan is ongoing.

Sable clapped back in a letter Thursday.

“OSFM conclusions are in error, ignore the remainder of the Waivers and are inconsistent with numerous discussions between OSFM and Sable,” wrote company representative Lance Yearwood. — NB

THE PARKS HAVE EYES: The National Park Service is trying to show that it’s cracking down on illegal BASE jumpers in Yosemite National Park as the government shutdown has left only a skeleton crew at national parks.

On Friday, the National Park Service touted the recent convictions of three men for illegal BASE jumping in incidents in 2020 and 2024. The men must collectively pay thousands in fines, spend several days in jail and stay away from Yosemite during one to several years of probation.

An Interior Department spokesperson also told Heather Richards of POLITICO’s E&E News that the agency is investigating three additional incidents from earlier this month in the iconic Sierra Nevada park, but did not provide specific dates.

Social media posts with video reportedly shot this month show jumpers leaping from Yosemite’s famous El Capitan cliff face and parachuting down. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has downplayed reports that understaffing has led to such activities, calling it “misinformation.” — HR, CvK

EBB AND FLOW: The Board of Directors of the Kern County Water Agency named Eric Averett as its next general manager at its meeting on Thursday. Averett previously managed another local water district and most recently was one of the board’s own directors, though he stepped down from that position in early October.

— Irvine-based electric truck manufacturer Rivian is laying off hundreds of workers.

— California’s reservoirs are 9 percent above their historic average for October, a potential good sign ahead of an uncertain winter wet season.

— Stellantis’ former CEO thinks Elon Musk could exit the auto industry within a decade.

As part of the investment in Louisiana LNG, Williams assumes LNG offtake obligations for 10% of produced volumes.
“This is Williams’ first investment in LNG and its participation in Louisiana LNG is a testament to the quality of the project.
HoldCo owns 60% equity in Louisiana LNG Infrastructure LLC (InfraCo), with the remainder being owned by Stonepeak.","Woodside has simultaneously signed and closed a transaction with Williams, a leader in US natural gas infrastructure, for an integrated investment in Louisiana LNG. The strategic partnership involves the sale by Woodside of a 10% interest in Louisiana LNG LLC (HoldCo) and an 80% interest and operatorship of Driftwood Pipeline LLC (PipelineCo) to Williams for a purchase price of US$250 million at the effective date of 1 January 2025. The total proceeds received are US$378 million including proportionate capital reimbursement since the effective date.

The transaction represents the next key stage towards realising Woodside’s strategy for Louisiana LNG. It not only secures capital and offtake commitments but also brings a strong strategic partner with complementary capabilities in US natural gas infrastructure and an existing gas sourcing platform, Sequent Energy Management.

Williams will contribute its share of the CAPEX for the LNG facility and pipeline, of approximately US$1.9 billion. As part of the investment in Louisiana LNG, Williams assumes LNG offtake obligations for 10% of produced volumes.

Williams currently operates more than 33 000 miles of pipeline across 24 states in the US and its Sequent platform has a marketing and optimisation footprint of more than 7 billion ft3/d. It will utilise its extensive pipeline experience to construct and operate the Line 200 pipeline to the Louisiana LNG terminal.

Leveraging the established Sequent platform and capabilities, a gas supply team will operationalise and optimise daily gas sourcing and balancing in accordance with Louisiana LNG’s gas procurement strategy. Sequent's proven gas marketing and asset optimisation expertise will support reliable feedgas supply for the benefit of all Louisiana LNG participants.

Woodside CEO, Meg O’Neill, said: “We are excited to have Williams join us as a strategic partner in Louisiana LNG given its leadership in US natural gas infrastructure and ability to add value and deliver operational benefits to enhance the project.

“This is Williams’ first investment in LNG and its participation in Louisiana LNG is a testament to the quality of the project.

“The bringing together of Woodside’s proven track record in developing and operating LNG facilities and global marketing, and Williams’ expertise in pipelines and gas sourcing, creates an energy partnership that has the combined capability to realise opportunities for long-term global energy demand.

“With strong LNG contracting momentum from Louisiana LNG and our portfolio, our existing infrastructure partner New York-based Stonepeak, and our key contracting partners including Bechtel, Baker Hughes, and Chart, we are on track to deliver first LNG in 2029 and create long-term value for our shareholders.”

President and CEO of Williams, Chad Zamarin, added: “This transaction marks an important step forward in Williams’ wellhead to water strategy – integrating upstream, midstream, marketing, and LNG capabilities to deliver the cleanest, most reliable energy to global markets. We look forward to partnering with Woodside, and together, reinforcing and strengthening our collective roles as trusted providers of sustainable energy solutions that meet growing global demand.”

Williams will hold 10% equity in Louisiana LNG LLC (HoldCo), with the remaining 90% of HoldCo currently owned by Woodside. HoldCo owns 60% equity in Louisiana LNG Infrastructure LLC (InfraCo), with the remainder being owned by Stonepeak.

For more information about the East Waterway Cleanup, visit the East Waterway Cleanup website or the Harbor Island and East Waterway Superfund Cleanup project page on the Port's website.","On October 14, the Port Commission authorized a public solicitation for a firm to lead the remedial design for the cleanup of the East Waterway, a key next step in translating the Record of Decision from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) into an actionable cleanup plan.

This follows a September 9 Commission authorization that directed the Port of Seattle’s executive director to enter into an Administrative Settlement and Order on Consent (“Order”) with the EPA and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with King County and the City of Seattle to complete the remedial design. Together, the Order, MOA, and bid solicitation reflect a shared commitment to restoring the river and protecting adjacent communities — helping to create a healthier environment and a more resilient working waterfront for future generations.

The East Waterway is an “operable unit” of the Harbor Island Superfund Site and is part of a long-running, federally directed cleanup effort with the Port, the City of Seattle, and King County working together under EPA oversight. Over the past several decades, five of the six Harbor Island operable units have been completed, addressing contaminated soil, groundwater, and sediment from historical industrial activity.

The East Waterway is the last and most complex operable unit, and its cleanup will remove sediments that are contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), arsenic, dioxins/furans, mercury, and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cPAHs) — pollutants that pose risks to people, fish, and the broader ecosystem.

“This is a significant moment in a long-term effort to restore the health of the Duwamish River and the communities that depend on it,” said Commissioner Ryan Calkins. “We are committed to transparency and collaboration every step of the way. This milestone is another element of the Port’s broader commitment to environmental stewardship. By planning ahead and investing now, we’re ensuring that future cleanups can move forward responsibly and predictably, while continuing to protect public health, habitat, and the working waterfront.”

The Duwamish River is ecologically significant estuarine habitat vital to juvenile salmon, shellfish, and other marine life, and it plays a key role in the health of Puget Sound. It also holds cultural and treaty-protected importance for local Tribes, who have stewarded and fished these waters since time immemorial and continue to rely on them for fishing and other traditional practices.

The EPA continues to oversee the East Waterway cleanup to ensure that it will meet federal and state standards for environmental protection and public health. While the Port is highlighting its recent milestones, the cleanup remains a shared responsibility among the three partner agencies.

That came as the feds and state governments have been offering financial incentives for companies to build data centers.
“Consumers may again feel the pressure on their utility bills in the coming months, particularly if the winter is a cold one,” BofA’s report warned.

Americans spent 3.6% more on electricity and gas in the third quarter of this year than they did during the same time last year, according to a study led by Bank of America economist David Tinsley.

Taking a longer view, electricity prices rose 5.1% over the past 12 months through September, while gas service went up a whopping 11.7%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.

That came as the feds and state governments have been offering financial incentives for companies to build data centers. There are over 4,000 such sites throughout the US today, according to datacentermap.com, though there is no official count.

“The rising demand for electricity generation capacity and grid investments, due in part to the build-out of data centers, appears to be placing more upward pressure on bills,” stated the Bank of America report, which was released last week.

When electrical grids get enhanced to accommodate increased power demands from new data centers, at least some of the cost appears to get passed on to consumers, the report explained.

On top of that, the increased use of electric vehicles has added to electricity demand, helping to keep prices high, according to the study.

More price hikes could be in store this winter.

“Consumers may again feel the pressure on their utility bills in the coming months, particularly if the winter is a cold one,” BofA’s report warned.

Electricity and natural gas prices actually ticked down slightly from August to September, according to the Consumer Price Index, though that’s likely due to consumers flipping off the A/C and waiting to turn on the heat.

Meanwhile, expanding the US power grid faces a number of barriers, with massive amounts of capital needed to build “more generation and transmission capacity,” the BofA report stated.

Regulatory hurdles and supply chain pressures also pose a roadblock, according to the analysis, who pointed to difficulties acquiring large turbines.

BofA warned that higher utility bills could hammer overall consumer spending.

Americans are already concerned about higher prices, sinking consumer sentiment to a five-month low in October, according to a University of Michigan report released Friday.

Average utility payments over the summer varied by city. Chicago and Tampa, Fla., for example, saw much higher bills, while prices dropped in Las Vegas.

It was notably hot this summer in parts of Phoenix – so prices increased alongside the demand for cooling, the study said.

Higher utility bills also tend to disproportionately hit lower-income households, which are already dealing with slower wage growth, according to BofA’s report.

Despite intense pressure on the grid, tech giants have continued to announce massive investments in AI infrastructure.

Just last week, a group of investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk’s xAI agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion.t

Mark Reuss is the head of the entire General Motors company.

And he recently made a startling admission about one of GM’s cars.

The GM boss confessed that sacrificing the Cadillac CT6 for electric vehicle production was the wrong choice.

GM boss holds his hands up

It’s not very often that the head figure of a car company publicly admits getting it wrong.

And yet that is exactly what has happened in the last few days.

A few days ago, GM boss Mark Reuss made a podcast appearance.

And he made something of a startling admission – one that car companies very rarely do.

During his appearance on the InsideEVs podcast, the GM boss discusses a variety of issues.

And one of the most interesting topics was that of the Cadillac CT6.

The podcast hosts asked the GM boss if he would have handled things differently, knowing what was ahead.

“I wish we didn’t have to stop the CT6 for Cadillac, but we did,” the GM boss admitted.

“And we converted factory zero, and we wouldn’t have the trucks that are in that factory.”

For those who don’t know, Factory ZERO is GM’s plant in Detroit-Hamtramck.

It was turned into a facility to build electric vehicles back in 2020.

Prior to that shift, it was the location of Cadillac CT6 production.

Cadillac CT6 was very competitive – for a few years

Speaking of the Cadillac CT6 – what actually was it?

Well, it was a saloon option from the GM brand – but also one of the most powerful Cadillacs ever made.

GM introduced the CT6 back in 2016 as a sedan with a more accessible price point.

It was the only GM vehicle built on the new Omega platform, and was actually meant to be the Cadillac LTS.

When the Cadillac CT6 debuted, the 2.0-liter base model came with a price of $53,495.

By contrast, the top-tier 3.0L turbo platinum model was priced at $87,465.

What made the Cadillac CT6 so special was its ability to deliver power and torque at a competitive price.

Of course, this was especially impressive – and important – for a full-size sedan.

Unlike other GM models, the CT6 was light yet rigid, making it a very popular model.

At least for the three full years it existed as a model option.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Cadillac-CT6.webp,N,,2025-10-24 21:02:54.368309

The decision grants a petition brought by Citizen Action of New York, PUSH Buffalo, Sierra Club, and WE ACT for Environmental Justice and finds that New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) violated the law by failing to promulgate regulations that ensure compliance with the state’s emissions limits by the statutory deadline of January 1, 2024.

Environmental Defense Fund, with partners Riverkeeper and Save the Sound, submitted an amicus — or ""friend of the court” — brief in support of petitioners claims. That brief made clear DEC had failed to promulgate rules to ensure compliance with statutory emissions targets by demonstrating that existing regulations were insufficient to meet the Climate Act’s emissions requirements. The brief also argued that DEC had violated the Climate Act by failing to prioritize measures to maximize reductions of emissions and co-pollutants in disadvantaged communities.

The Court’s decision today requires DEC to promulgate regulations to ensure compliance with the Climate Act’s requirements no later than February 6, 2026.

“The Albany County Supreme Court’s decision confirms that New York’s Climate Act requires the swift adoption of standards that ensure the state achieves its climate pollution limits,” said Erin Murphy, Director & Sr. Attorney, Clean Air & Energy Markets at Environmental Defense Fund. “Strong standards that reduce climate pollution to the levels required by law will deliver cleaner air, lower energy bills, and more resilient communities across New York State.”

Fortunately, New York does not have to start from scratch. State agencies have been working since 2023 to develop cap-and-invest regulations, now known as the Clean Air Initiative, specifically to fulfill the requirements under the CLCPA. In addition to slashing climate-warming pollution, the Clean Air Initiative is projected to generate more than $3 billion annually for investments that can save New Yorkers money on energy bills, create family-sustaining jobs and deliver massive health benefits, particularly in communities most impacted by climate and air pollution.

“The Clean Air Initiative, New York’s cap-and-invest program, is the best tool available to deliver pollution cuts that support a healthy future in line with the Climate Act’s requirements,” said Kate Courtin, Senior Manager, State Climate Policy & Strategy at EDF. “New York can establish a strong program that will clean our air, lower our bills, and generate new economic opportunities across the state. The New York legislature passed nation-leading requirements for tackling climate change and protecting our communities from pollution; the Hochul administration has an opportunity to deliver on that leadership promise.”

In addition to being a cost-effective, flexible and proven approach to cutting climate pollution, research released by state agencies as well as a growing body of independent studies confirm the affordability, job growth, and health benefits of the Clean Air Initiative, including:

Over $3 billion per year of new investments in New York families and communities. This includes over $1 billion annually in direct rebates to consumers and small businesses to reduce energy costs.

With targeted rebate investments, nearly all households earning under $200,000-per-year see net cost savings under cap-and-invest.

Savings of up to $1,000 per year on energy bills for the average family, through deployment of new clean energy technologies and efficiency programs, such as robust heat pump incentives.

Supporting the creation of over 28,000 jobs by 2030, representing continued growth of New York’s clean energy workforce, which already employs 178,000 New Yorkers.

Significant investments in community-directed grant programs that drive local economic development, cleaner air and affordability in disadvantaged communities.

Her name is Amelie Chen, and she's already thinking about how to power the future.

""I learned how to turn algae into biofuel in a $7 million lab at UC Berkeley, and that was throughout a summer program in my freshman year [of high school],"" Chen said. ""And I ended up creating biofuel in my kitchen with no lab.""

Creating biofuel from coconuts and algae

Without access to expensive equipment, Chen improvised. She used coconut ash to extract the chemicals she needed, turning a local resource into a key ingredient for innovation.

""I was able to extract potassium iodide from the coconuts and use that to separate the oils from the algal cell parts,"" she said.

That creativity earned her national attention. Chen was named a National STEM Champion, joining students from around the country and its territories for their achievements in science, technology, engineering, and math.

""It's a way to say thank you to my island""

But the idea that started it all came from home...a small island surrounded by the Pacific.

""American Samoa,"" Chen said. ""It's a small island in the South Pacific. It's actually an American territory. We only have 50,000 people living there.""

Growing up there, she saw how rising sea levels and coral bleaching were changing her world.

""Finding another renewable energy source can help fight climate change,"" she said. ""I think it's a way to say thank you to my island.""

The Louisiana plant is being designed for scalability, allowing it to process material from other ionic-clay deposits or compatible feedstocks.
Founded in 2021 following its spinout from Hochschild Mining, Aclara focuses on extracting rare earths from ionic clays using a patented water-based process that avoids traditional acid leaching.","Aclara Resources (TSX: ARA) plans to invest $277 million to build a heavy rare earth separation facility in Louisiana, marking what it calls a milestone for US critical minerals independence.

The plant is to process feed from Aclara’s ionic-clay projects in Brazil and Chile and is scheduled for completion in 2027, subject to financing and permitting, the company said on Friday. Louisiana is supporting the project with $46.4 million in tax incentives and grants. Currently, nearly all heavy rare earths are refined in China.

The facility is slated for a 33-hectare (82-acre) site at the Port of Vinton near Lake Charles, offering access to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and nearby chlor-alkali facilities used in Aclara’s refining process. The site’s infrastructure, chemical industry base and access to logistics were key factors in its selection, the company said in a release.

“Our project is unique in the Western world,” Aclara CEO Ramon Barua said. “With direct access to our ionic clay deposits, this will be the only fully integrated heavy rare earth separation operation currently capable of producing material volumes of heavy rare earths at scale.”

Aclara shares rose 14% on Friday morning in Toronto to C$3.15 apiece, valuing the company at C$686 million ($489 million).

Virgina Tech

Aclara, which is 57% owned by Hochschild Mining (LSE: HOC), says it plans to supply more than three-quarters of US dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb) demand by 2028. That amounts annually to 200 tonnes dysprosium, 30 tonnes terbium and 1,400 tonnes neodymium praseodymium (NdPr) of separated high-purity oxides.

The goal represents about 14% of China’s official DyTb production, positioning the Louisiana plant as the anchor of a Western supply chain for magnets and electric motors used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones and defence systems.

The company plans to use technology co-developed with major public research university Virginia Tech, whose pilot plant is expected to be operational in early 2026. Engineering partner Hatch is coordinating the design with Aclara’s Carina project in the central Brazilian state of Goiás, where a pre-feasibility study is expected in November and a full feasibility study in the second quarter of 2026.

Ucore plant

Aclara joins Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) in Louisiana, where the rare earths technology company is building its own processing plant in Alexandria. Ucore also operates a rare earths demonstration facility in Kingston, Ontario.

Carina hosts 236.3 million indicated tonnes grading 293 parts per million (ppm) NdPr, 43 ppm Dy and 6.8 ppm Tb for 371,492 tonnes of total rare earth oxides (TREO), the company reported this month. It also has 48 million inferred tonnes grading 236 ppm NdPr, 41 ppm dysprosium and 6.4 ppm terbium for 61,675 tonnes TREO.

The project could generate as much as 191 tonnes of Dy and Tb annually, according to a January 2024 preliminary economic assessment. The study estimated a mine life of 22 years and a net present value of $1.5 billion, using an 8% discount rate, with an internal rate of return of 27%. In September, Aclara received $5 million in US government support for development work at Carina under a bilateral critical minerals cooperation framework.

Penco project

In Chile, Aclara is advancing the smaller Penco project on a similar timeline. It hosts 27.5 million measured and indicated tonnes grading 2,292 ppm TREO for 62,900 tonnes of contained TREO. Penco received environmental approval last year after revisions to improve its social and water management standards.

The Louisiana plant is being designed for scalability, allowing it to process material from other ionic-clay deposits or compatible feedstocks. Aclara intends to expand production as its South American resource base grows. Earlier this year, the company commissioned a semi-industrial pilot plant in Brazil to test metallurgical recovery and refine its proprietary separation process.

The move into Louisiana builds on a wave of North American investment in rare earths separation, processing and magnet manufacturing, including stakes by Apple and the federal government in MP Materials (NYSE: MP). The US Department of Defense has supported several magnet and processing projects under its Title III program to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains.

Founded in 2021 following its spinout from Hochschild Mining, Aclara focuses on extracting rare earths from ionic clays using a patented water-based process that avoids traditional acid leaching. It says the method reduces waste and eliminates radioactive by-products, addressing one of the key environmental hurdles facing the sector.",https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aclara-pilot-plant.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 21:02:58.868116

That’s coming up later in the program.

And now for your environmental reports:

October is Leave the Leaves Month and as Bloomington’s trees turn shades of red, orange, yellow, and brown, you might ask, “what role do these leaves play in health of local plants, insects, and animals?” The National Wildlife Federation (or NWF) is urging residents to support the butterflies, lightning bugs, and songbirds that depend on fallen leaves for survival by foregoing the raking process this year.

“Refraining from clearing leaves from your lawn can also reduce large-scale organic gas emissions, too. According to the NWF, Americans dispose of over 35 million tons of yard waste annually, and leaves account for more than 13% of the country’s solid waste. In landfills, this organic matter releases methane gas—25 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat.”

Meanwhile, the layer of leaves that accumulate in your lawn each fall offers critical habitat to many species who “overwinter” in the protection of fallen leaves. Many moth and butterfly species don’t migrate, making Bloomington a necessary home for recurring sightings of these winged beauties. Lightning bug (or firefly) larvae rely on leaves for up to two years and bumblebee queens are known to hibernate through winter in this habitat, too. The vast majority of backyard birds—96 %—rely on butterfly and moth caterpillars as primary food for their babies during nesting season.

While a National Wildlife Federation survey found that 72% of people know fallen leaves benefit wildlife, only 25% actually leave the leaves. Often home- or property-owners are concerned about the appearance, turfgrass survival, or pests. But wildlife experts emphasize you don’t need to smother your lawn. Birds, insects, and reptiles benefit from smaller plots of natural leaf litter. You can leave specific areas of your lawn undisturbed to provide smaller habitats, or rake leaves from sidewalks, driveways, and grass into garden beds where they act as natural mulch.

The NWF offers tips and answers to frequently asked questions on their website, making it simple for residents to engage in lawn care that directly supports biodiversity right here in Bloomington.

A federal judge ordered the U.S. Forest Service to temporarily halt a massive logging project in the Hoosier National Forest last week, ruling that the agency failed to adequately explain potential environmental impacts. The USFS Houston South Vegetation Management and Restoration Project involves clear-cutting 400 acres, logging an additional 4,000 acres, enacting prescribed burns on 13,500 acres, and constructing several miles of roads.

Chief Judge Tanya Pratt found this project lacked proper environmental analysis, particularly regarding Lake Monroe’s water quality and soil erosion. The Forest Service claimed that “Best Management Practices” would mitigate any harm, but the court determined that the studies they cited were either 30 years old or used metrics that “carry little to no weight” for measuring logging impacts within the affected counties. Judge Pratt wrote that the agency offered “only generalized assurances,” failing to provide actual analysis to satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act.

This marks the third lawsuit attempting to stop the logging since 2020, supported by parties including the Monroe County Board of Commissioners, Indiana Forest Alliance, Hoosier Environmental Council, and Friends of Lake Monroe. The project remains halted until the Forest Service provides proper environmental findings and meets with the judge to determine an appropriate remedy and timeline. This ruling sets a critical precedent that federal agencies can’t just rubber-stamp major environmental projects with outdated science and vague promises—they must demonstrate that their actions won’t harm the water, air, soil, and ecosystems Hoosiers throughout the state are working to protect.

A state grant program is helping Indiana students discover the outdoors, a welcome reprieve amidst the rising transportation costs for field trips. The “Discover The Outdoors Field Trip Grant”, run by the Indiana Natural Resources Foundation, provided grants to 68 schools across Indiana this year to visit state parks. Since the program launched in 2013, it’s awarded 345 grants totaling over $92,000. This funding means more than 30,000 Indiana kids have had the chance to experience outdoor education.

Westlane Middle School in Indianapolis has already taken 130 middle schoolers to Fort Harrison State Park. Because the state parks charge just one dollar per student for guided interpretive nature tours, schools can afford to bring more young people out into nature. Kevin Melrose, a seventh-grade teacher at Westlane, says getting kids outside is crucial for teaching Indiana history, ecology, and earth sciences—but without grant support, many schools simply can’t afford it.

During a recent Fort Harrison trip, students climbed over logs, waded through creeks, examined the mysteries of the tree canopy, and never stopped engaging with their natural surroundings. Park staff led guided hikes, teaching about different ecosystems and animals while incorporating lessons about the park’s history. The school’s parent-teacher association also helped fundraise to cover additional costs beyond the grant.

Applications for the 2026-2027 school year open in March at the DNR State Parks website. Teachers and parents interested in getting kids outdoors can find more information about the program and start planning now. Research confirms time and time again that exposure to nature has a positive impact on students. In fact, analysis by Stanford researchers verifies that environmental education promotes competence, confidence, and connection as well as knowledge gains across multiple subjects, including environmental issues, science, and mathematics. And as Melrose says, “The point of school is preparing them to be global learners, and the best way we can do that is to get them out on the globe.”

On Monday, the Trump administration announced plans to eliminate over 2,000 positions at the Department of the Interior, targeting scientists who study water resources, endangered species, and toxic contamination like PFAS (pronounced P’-FAS). According to the court filing, the cuts will hit hardest at the U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, and regional National Park Service offices. Meanwhile, EPA staff received another round of furlough notices as the agency’s funding dries up during the government shutdown.

Conservation groups identify this as the next stage of a broader campaign to eliminate environmental data collection. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has described this sequence of decisions as the largest rollback of environmental protections in U.S. history. President Trump recently stated the shutdown provides an opportunity to dismantle what he calls “Democrat programs” and “woke” environmental protections, despite the fact that major environmental laws and the EPA itself originated during Nixon’s presidency, a Republican administration.

The Interior Department manages national parks, wildlife refuges, and public lands while conducting critical environmental research. The EPA layoffs specifically target staff who enforce anti-pollution laws and protect drinking water. As these cuts move forward, communities will lose access to crucial scientific research on flooding, wildfires, water quality, and wildlife—data that has guided public safety decisions for decades. ​​Without scientists monitoring water contamination, tracking endangered species, and researching the impacts of climate change, we’re moving through global environmental crises without guidance—losing not just data, but the ability to protect public health and respond to natural disasters before they become catastrophes.

Greg Gianforte, as well as all four members of the state’s federal delegation signed on to a letter last month claiming American Prairie’s bison restoration project is at odds with the state’s economy.

The five men sent the letter to Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota. The Interior Department holds decision-making power over grazing rights on Bureau of Land Management land, which under former President Joe Biden were granted to American Prairie in 2022.

The state, along with livestock industry groups, appealed the federal decision. Some ranchers have also expressed concern about added costs of having bison near their cattle, including fears of brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can spread between the animals.

“For us, a decision in favor of APR will re-shape the entire landscape of our state,” the letter reads. “Montana’s most profitable economic industry, for decades, has been agriculture. Agriculture drives our economy, sustains our small rural towns, and is the cultural epicenter of our state.”

While there’s no question agriculture is a cultural hallmark of the state, as a percentage of the state’s real gross domestic product, the industry ranked 12th in 2022. That year, Montana generated around $4.6 billion in agricultural cash receipts.

The letter goes on to argue removing “vast swaths” of land from agricultural production will harm the state and allowing American Prairie those grazing rights “threatens the economic vitality of our most important industry.”

American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana and owns more than 500,000 acres in the state. They own and manage 900 head of bison across 46,000 acres. The organization leases much of its land to cattle producers, supporting about 7,000 head and 25 ranchers, the organization spokesperson Pete Geddes said in a statement. There are almost a half million cattle in the seven counties they work, he added. Including calves, there are about 2.1 million head of cattle in the state.

“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” Geddes said. “American Prairie has little influence on the long-term demographic and economic trends in Central Montana. Extended drought, market fluctuations, international trade policies, personal family decisions, and global integrated agricultural markets have much larger impacts.”

Geddes went on to say that since 2020, the organization has paid $7 million in payroll, supporting 23 local jobs in Fergus and Phillips Counties, which infused $17 million into those economies, he said. They’ve also paid $877,000 in property taxes and $345,000 to ranchers participating in a wildlife abundance program, he added.

Some ranchers, including Gilles Stockton, an author and former president of the Montana Cattlemen’s Association, have other concerns.

“If you’re ranching in a brucellosis designated area, which they have in southwestern Montana, it’s hugely expensive,” Stockton said. “And it’s doubly expensive if one of your cows happens to become brucellosis positive.”

Some elk and about 60% of female bison in Yellowstone National Park test positive for brucellosis, a disease that attacks the reproductive system and causes abortions in pregnant cattle, elk, and bison. It’s a nonnative disease to the area, brought into Yellowstone by cattle in the 1900s and can also cause sickness in humans, though human infection is uncommon and the state hasn’t reported an official case since 2017.

“One of the primary mechanisms of historical transmission to people is through the milk, but pasteurization has made that a nearly obsolete pathway,” Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, State Veterinarian, said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “In the 1930s and ’40s, here in the United States, we had a much higher incidence of brucellosis in our cattle herds all across the country, and they started the national brucellosis eradication program.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has what’s called Brucellosis Class Free status, a tool used to maintain compliance so infected animals aren’t being moved around or consumed.

Montana has a “Designated Surveillance Area” for the disease in southwestern Montana — stretching from Dillon to past Livingston, and down to Gardiner and the Wyoming and Idaho borders.

Those borders are built through a partnership with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Szymanski said. FWP will go out, capture, tag and test elk and track their movement. Park County and Madison County elk have tested positive for brucellosis, she said.

That said, Montana is considered brucellosis free.

“The only population of infected animals in Montana is Yellowstone National Park, bison or elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area, we have a couple of livestock herds that are under quarantine for past detections, but any other domestic bison or cattle herd in the state of Montana is considered to be free of brucellosis,” Szymanski said. “That includes tribal populations of bison, APR, bison, people should not be concerned about those animals because of potential disease risk.”

About 100,000 brucellosis tests are administered in that area each year to keep the state’s class free status, according to the Montana Department of Livestock. Cattle vaccinations do have hurdles and have to be performed by a licensed veterinarian.

“If a human accidentally injected themselves with it, that it would make them kind of substantially sick,” Szymanski said.

That costs about $630,000 per year, according to the agency. Losing the status would incur even more testing costs by places that receive bison and cattle from the state.

“Loss of Class Free status would lead to required testing of livestock exported from anywhere in the State (not just southwest Montana) and cost the livestock producers millions of dollars for testing as well as revenue from lost sales due to a negative stigma,” a Department of Livestock information sheet reads.

American Prairie tests their animals regularly, Geddes said, and brucellosis is not present in their bison.

Grazing permits have also been a source of contention for American Prairie, and the letter states the organization is violating federal law.

The letter mentions the Taylor Grazing Act, legislation dating back to 1934 that created stipulations for grazing cattle and eventually led to the creation of the Bureau of Land Management.

Challenges to the Bureau of Land Management over American Prairie grazing their bison say the act doesn’t allow for conservation grazing. American Prairie asserts that’s not true and Geddes said nowhere in Taylor Grazing Act does it limit grazing permits to production livestock.

“The BLM is authorized to issue grazing permits to ‘stock owners.’ American Prairie qualifies as both a ‘stock owner’ and ‘engaged in the livestock business.’ AP bison are livestock and we are operating as a non-profit business,” Geddes said. “American Prairie’s primary purpose for obtaining grazing permits is for grazing livestock.”

One of American Prairie’s goals is returning the land to a state more similar to when hundreds of thousands of bison roamed free before colonization and westward expansion.

The Taylor Grazing Act was in part intended to preserve and protect that same grassland, Stockton said, who feels ranchers have done a pretty good job of that.

“The results of that is that we were able to take land that had been really badly overused and restore it across eastern Montana,” Stockton said. “So, you know, the grasslands that you have in eastern Montana are really in the best shapes that they’ve ever been.”

Stockton ranches near Grass Range, is close to American Prairie holdings and feels the Bureau of Land Management overstepped their authority. There’s frustrations with who gets to graze when, fencing problems — keeping cattle away from bison, in a ranchers eyes — and costs associated with vaccinations if brucellosis does spread further.

But, even then, other concerns for Stockton trump issues with the bison nonprofit.

“We got a feeling that the APR, when they moved in here, they were at war with our culture, I guess, our communities and our cultures,” Stockton said. “But the fact of the matter is that in terms of actual impact, say, for me, personally, I’ve got more trouble with my billionaire neighbors.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/52100233780_02eb91d8f6_k-1024x6831761343452.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=qXcwLnyj,N,,2025-10-25 10:18:52.695756

Dear Alumni, Students, and Colleagues:

At the University of Michigan, we have a rich legacy of supporting the economy.

More than 170 years ago, business leaders in Detroit needed help. Specifically, they needed more accurate timekeeping for railroads, which were the lifeblood of many industries.

At the same time, the University’s president asked business leaders to support the mission of research and science.

The result was that the business community stepped forward to fund a new observatory on the Ann Arbor campus. Astronomical science enabled accurate timekeeping, which improved shipping arrivals and departures. And the University of Michigan had a cutting-edge laboratory to create new knowledge.

The building with its magnificent telescopes still stands today. It is called the Detroit Observatory, in honor of its benefactors, and is the oldest research facility on our campus. It embodies collaboration for the improvement of society.

Ripple effect

When our scientists and researchers receive federal funding, those dollars have a tremendous ripple effect on the economy. This past year, our University spent over $332 million on goods and services to support federally funded projects. That meant hiring services, purchasing materials and equipment, and renting space in cities and towns throughout our state — and it happens every year.

This type of impact is amplified when considering that our state has four R1 research universities, whose collective economic impact from federal R&D funding exceeds $8.3 billion.

I strongly encourage business, community, and alumni leaders to join us in advocating for the contributions and impact of research universities, as well as the partnerships we build with businesses, industry, and nonprofits.

We all benefit from a robust higher education ecosystem.

Return on investment

Higher education in this country is currently under attack. I believe it is an assault grounded in misinformation and misunderstanding. Our universities transform a public investment into a public good. This includes supporting communities and economies through our discoveries and the talents of our graduates. Every year, employers can tap into thousands of the world’s top students who graduate from our three campuses.

Here’s something else to remember about partnering with higher education: Universities don’t move. We don’t pull up stakes and relocate to other countries. At the University of Michigan, we are firmly committed to our three home communities, the state of Michigan, and the nation. We are dedicated to the common good.

I’d like to share one of the most inspiring stories of recent economic impact and success.

Twenty years ago, several researchers at U-M developed a radical method for noninvasive surgery. They used focused ultrasound waves to target and destroy tissue like cancerous tumors.

The researchers called this new method histotripsy. A U-M startup company, HistoSonics, is commercializing histotripsy and this completely non-invasive form of surgery.

Two years ago, they obtained FDA approval to use histotripsy to eradicate liver tumors. Today, they have clinical trials underway to expand the use of this technology to tumors of the pancreas and kidney.

Last year the company celebrated the opening of its advanced R&D facility in Ann Arbor where they anticipate adding 40 high-growth jobs.

Then, just last month, a group of public and private investors acquired HistoSonics for an astounding $2.25 billion. An idea launched in a University of Michigan laboratory sold for more than $2 billion.

Investment to impact

Patients are receiving highly effective treatment that is relatively painless and requires less time in the hospital.

Ann Arbor has an R&D company that continues to thrive, as HistoSonics now plans to apply its technology to kidney, pancreas, and prostate cancers with more disease areas in the future.

And the University of Michigan has yet another proof point of how it energizes the local and state economy.

A robust economy — one that draws upon university resources and talent — translates to well-paying jobs, good neighborhoods, and strong schools. That is genuine impact.

We are here to serve society. Over 200 years ago, we were founded in the public interest, and this mission has been our core ever since.

Look to Michigan for discovery and collaboration.

Look to Michigan for talent and technology.

And look to Michigan, and all of higher education, as a valued partner in building and sustaining vibrant economies.

Thank you, and Forever Go Blue.",https://michigantoday.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/mc-image-cache/2025/10/Presidents-Message-Domenic-Grasso-UMCI-MPHOTO-UMCI_GndBk_gal03-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 19:19:23.789146

""The transformation of US resource independence policy represents both unprecedented opportunity and significant risk for investors.","US resource independence has become a cornerstone of American strategic policy, with the current administration implementing comprehensive measures to reduce foreign mineral dependencies that threaten national security. Furthermore, this strategic shift encompasses critical materials essential for everything from defense systems to renewable energy infrastructure, marking a fundamental transformation in how America approaches resource security.

The transition represents more than traditional energy independence, extending to dozens of critical minerals currently dominated by foreign producers. However, achieving true resource independence requires overcoming complex supply chain challenges and substantial infrastructure development across multiple sectors.

Understanding America's Strategic Resource Position

Resource independence differs significantly from energy independence in both scope and complexity. While energy independence primarily focuses on oil, gas, and renewable energy production, resource independence encompasses over 50 critical minerals essential for national security and economic competitiveness.

The Department of Energy's Critical Materials List identifies materials where supply disruptions could severely impact the economy or national security. These range from rare earth elements used in military applications to lithium powering electric vehicle batteries. Current US import dependency exceeds 50% for 31 of these critical materials, with complete reliance on imports for 14 minerals.

China's market position creates particular vulnerability, controlling approximately 60% of global rare earth mining and 87% of rare earth processing capacity. This dominance extends beyond raw materials into refined products, with Chinese companies processing materials mined in other countries before selling finished products globally.

The geopolitical implications extend beyond simple supply security. Control over critical mineral processing allows influence over pricing, quality standards, and supply allocation during international tensions. Recent trade disputes have demonstrated how quickly mineral access can become a diplomatic weapon, highlighting the uranium market volatility that can result from geopolitical tensions.

Strategic Minerals Driving Policy Changes

Rare Earth Elements and Defense Applications

Rare earth elements represent perhaps the most critical vulnerability in US supply chains. These 17 elements are essential for precision-guided munitions, satellite communications, and advanced radar systems. A single F-35 fighter jet contains approximately 920 pounds of rare earth materials.

Current US rare earth mining occurs primarily at the Mountain Pass facility in California, which produces concentrate that must be shipped to China for processing due to lack of domestic separation capabilities. This creates a strategic dependency that administration policies aim to eliminate within the next decade.

The Russian uranium ban impact demonstrates how quickly geopolitical events can disrupt critical mineral supply chains. Consequently, diversifying supply sources and developing domestic processing capabilities has become a national security priority.

Copper's Infrastructure Role

Copper demand for renewable energy infrastructure significantly exceeds current production capacity. Wind turbines require 3-5 tons of copper each, while electric vehicles use four times more copper than conventional vehicles. The International Energy Agency projects copper demand could increase by 70% by 2030 under current clean energy scenarios.

US copper production faces challenges from aging mines and lengthy permitting processes. Major deposits in Arizona and Nevada could supply domestic demand, but require substantial infrastructure investment and regulatory streamlining to reach production targets. Moreover, copper price insights suggest significant price appreciation potential for domestically produced copper.

Uranium Energy Security

Nuclear energy provides approximately 20% of US electricity generation, yet domestic uranium production has declined dramatically since the 1980s. The US imports roughly 95% of uranium requirements, with significant portions coming from Russia and Kazakhstan.

Recent legislation prohibits Russian uranium imports beginning in 2028, creating urgency around domestic production revival. Wyoming and New Mexico possess substantial uranium reserves, but production restart requires both capital investment and regulatory support for in-situ recovery operations.

Lithium for Battery Technology

Global lithium demand is projected to increase by 2,000% by 2030 driven by electric vehicle adoption and energy storage requirements. The US possesses significant lithium resources, particularly in Nevada's Clayton Valley and North Carolina's hard rock deposits.

However, domestic lithium production requires overcoming technical challenges in brine processing and environmental concerns around water usage in arid regions. Current US production meets less than 2% of domestic consumption, highlighting the magnitude of required capacity expansion. Additionally, lithium industry innovations provide insights into technological advances that could enhance domestic production efficiency.

Current Administration's Policy Reshaping

Regulatory Fast-Tracking Mechanisms

The administration has implemented sweeping changes to mineral project permitting, reducing environmental review timelines from an average of 7-10 years to 12-24 months for projects designated as nationally significant. This acceleration applies to both mining and processing facilities deemed critical for supply chain security.

Priority designation systems now categorise projects based on strategic importance, with highest-priority developments receiving dedicated federal coordination teams. These teams streamline inter-agency reviews and resolve regulatory conflicts that historically delayed projects for years.

Federal land access has expanded significantly, with previously restricted areas now available for critical mineral exploration. The Bureau of Land Management has identified over 2 million acres suitable for expedited mineral development, representing a 40% increase in available federal mining lands.

Nevertheless, mining permitting challenges remain substantial despite regulatory streamlining efforts. Furthermore, successful project development requires navigating complex environmental and community stakeholder requirements.

Financial Incentives and Government Backing

Direct government equity participation marks a dramatic shift in US resource policy. The Inflation Reduction Act allocated $500 million for direct investment in overseas critical mineral projects, with additional funding available through the Development Finance Corporation.

Recent investments include equity stakes in lithium projects in Argentina and rare earth developments in Australia. These investments position the US as an active participant rather than passive purchaser in global mineral markets. Moreover, these investments often include offtake agreements ensuring material flows to US processing facilities.

Tax incentives for domestic mining operations now include accelerated depreciation for processing equipment and research credits for innovative extraction technologies. Infrastructure funding exceeds $2 billion for rail, port, and processing facility development in mining regions.

Strategic tariff implementation creates preferential pricing for ally-nation mineral imports while penalising Chinese-processed materials. Section 232 investigations have expanded beyond steel and aluminium to cover rare earths, graphite, and other strategic materials.

Bilateral agreements with Australia, Canada, and selected African nations establish preferential trade status for critical minerals. These agreements are often coupled with technology sharing arrangements and joint infrastructure development commitments.

Investment screening through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States now explicitly covers mineral processing facilities and technology companies. This prevents foreign acquisition of strategic capabilities essential for US resource independence.

Investment Opportunities in US Resource Independence

Domestic Mining Sector Potential

Established mining companies with shovel-ready projects represent the most immediate investment opportunities. Copper developments in Arizona's copper triangle could begin production within 18-24 months given current regulatory support, while Nevada lithium projects benefit from existing infrastructure and water rights.

Key Development Projects by Mineral Type:

• Copper – Arizona (Resolution): Production start 2027-2028, Investment required $2.8 billion

• Rare Earths – Texas (Round Top): Production start 2026-2027, Investment required $1.2 billion

• Lithium – Nevada (Clayton Valley): Production start 2025-2026, Investment required $800 million

• Uranium – Wyoming (Nichols Ranch): Production start 2025, Investment required $150 million

Junior mining companies with advanced-stage projects face particular opportunities given current government support and streamlined permitting. However, these investments carry higher execution risk and require careful due diligence on management capabilities and financing arrangements.

Processing and Refining Infrastructure Gaps

The most significant opportunity exists in midstream processing and refining capabilities currently absent from US supply chains. Rare earth separation facilities could generate returns exceeding 20% annually given current supply-demand imbalances and government support.

Critical Processing Capacity Gaps:

• Rare earth separation: 100% import dependent

• Lithium hydroxide production: 85% import dependent

• Copper smelting: 40% import dependent

• Uranium conversion: 95% import dependent

Technology development for cleaner, more efficient processing methods attracts both government grants and private investment. Advanced separation technologies, automated processing systems, and waste reduction innovations represent high-growth subsectors within the broader resource independence theme.

Strategic Overseas Investments

Government-backed overseas projects offer risk-adjusted returns through shared financing and political risk insurance. Recent investments in Ukrainian titanium projects and Zambian copper developments demonstrate the model's structure and potential returns.

Joint ventures with allied governments often include preferential terms for US companies, including tax incentives, infrastructure support, and long-term supply agreements. These arrangements provide exposure to high-quality international assets while maintaining alignment with US strategic objectives. However, comprehensive assessment of US energy independence initiatives shows the complexity of achieving true resource autonomy.

Risk Considerations for Investors

Political and Timeline Pressures

The emphasis on shovel-ready projects within 12-24 months creates both opportunity and risk. Companies unable to achieve rapid production may find themselves excluded from current policy support, while those that can capitalise face potential windfalls from expedited approvals and financial backing.

Critical Timeline Considerations:

• Environmental permits must be substantially complete

• Financing arrangements should be finalised within six months

• Construction capability must be immediately available

• Offtake agreements provide demand certainty

Policy continuity represents the primary political risk, as regulatory approaches could shift significantly with future administrations. Successful investment strategies require projects capable of generating returns under various policy scenarios rather than dependence on current regulatory advantages.

Environmental and Legal Challenges

Expedited permitting invites legal challenges from environmental groups arguing inadequate review processes. Several fast-tracked projects already face litigation that could delay or halt development despite government support.

Water rights issues particularly affect lithium and copper projects in arid western states, where competing agricultural and municipal demands create complex legal environments. Climate change impacts on water availability add long-term uncertainty to water-intensive extraction operations.

Indigenous land rights and cultural site protection represent additional legal complexities, especially for projects on or near federal lands with tribal significance. Successful developers increasingly invest in early community engagement and benefit-sharing agreements to minimise opposition.

Global Competition and Market Dynamics

China's Strategic Response

China has responded to US resource independence efforts by accelerating Belt and Road Initiative mineral investments, particularly in Africa and South America. Chinese companies now control approximately 70% of lithium processing capacity in Chile and Argentina, the world's largest lithium-producing nations.

Processing capacity expansion within China aims to maintain downstream control even if raw material sourcing diversifies. New facilities in Jiangxi and Sichuan provinces will increase Chinese rare earth processing capacity by 40% by 2026, potentially offsetting US domestic development efforts.

Technology export restrictions now limit Chinese equipment and expertise availability for non-Chinese processing facilities. This creates technical challenges for US and allied nation development projects. Alternative technology sources from Japan, Germany, and Australia carry higher costs and longer deployment timelines.

Alternative Benchmarking Systems

Price discovery outside Chinese-controlled markets requires new benchmarking mechanisms and trading platforms. London Metal Exchange initiatives for rare earth pricing and lithium futures markets attempt to create alternative reference points, though liquidity remains limited.

Long-term supply agreements increasingly incorporate risk-sharing mechanisms that protect both producers and consumers from price volatility. These include sliding-scale pricing, volume flexibility, and force majeure protections that traditional spot markets cannot provide.

Regional market development focuses on creating supply chains among allied nations, reducing dependence on global commodity markets dominated by Chinese participants. The US-Canada-Australia critical minerals partnership exemplifies this approach through preferential trading arrangements and shared infrastructure development.

Processing and Refining Opportunities

Midstream Value Chain Development

The greatest value creation potential exists in processing and refining operations that transform raw materials into battery-grade and industrial-grade products. Current US capabilities meet less than 15% of domestic demand for processed critical minerals, creating substantial market opportunities.

Processing Investment Requirements by Mineral:

• Rare Earth Separation – Facility Cost: $800M-1.2B, Annual Capacity: 5,000-8,000 tons, Payback Period: 4-6 years

• Lithium Hydroxide – Facility Cost: $400M-600M, Annual Capacity: 25,000-40,000 tons, Payback Period: 3-4 years

• Copper Smelting – Facility Cost: $1.5B-2.2B, Annual Capacity: 200,000-300,000 tons, Payback Period: 5-7 years

• Uranium Conversion – Facility Cost: $200M-350M, Annual Capacity: 8,000-12,000 tons, Payback Period: 3-5 years

Technology innovation requirements focus on environmental compliance and energy efficiency improvements that make US processing competitive with lower-cost international alternatives. Advanced extraction techniques, automated operations, and waste heat recovery systems represent key technological differentiators.

Infrastructure Investment Needs

Transportation infrastructure improvements require substantial capital investment to connect mining regions with processing facilities and export terminals. Rail capacity expansion in Wyoming and Nevada could require $2-3 billion in private and public investment over the next decade.

Strategic storage facilities for critical minerals represent both opportunity and necessity, given supply chain vulnerability concerns. Government partnerships for strategic stockpile management could provide stable revenue streams for storage facility operators while enhancing national security preparedness.

What Are the Key Political Risk Indicators for Resource Independence Projects?

Political risk assessment requires evaluation of government stability, regulatory consistency, and policy continuity across mine lifecycles spanning decades. Traditional metrics like credit ratings provide insufficient insight into mining-specific risks such as royalty changes, environmental regulation evolution, and resource nationalism trends.

Key Political Risk Indicators:

• Regulatory framework consistency over election cycles

• Government revenue dependence on mineral exports

• Historical treatment of foreign mining investments

• Infrastructure development support and maintenance

• Community relations and social licence stability

Operational risk management extends beyond traditional financial metrics to include community relations, environmental compliance, and workforce availability. Mining projects in remote locations require comprehensive assessment of infrastructure adequacy, skilled labour availability, and emergency response capabilities.

Geographic Diversification Strategies

Portfolio construction across multiple jurisdictions reduces concentration risk while maintaining exposure to resource independence themes. Balanced exposure between US domestic projects and overseas developments in allied nations provides both policy alignment and risk mitigation.

Risk-adjusted return calculations must incorporate political risk insurance costs, currency hedging requirements, and longer-term policy stability factors that traditional investment analysis may overlook. Joint venture partnerships with local companies often provide valuable risk mitigation through local knowledge and government relationships.

Future Outlook for US Resource Independence

Production Capacity Projections Through 2030

Domestic mining output could increase by 300-500% for critical minerals under current policy support, though achieving these targets requires sustained investment and regulatory consistency. Rare earth production capacity could reach 50,000 tons annually by 2030, meeting approximately 30% of domestic demand.

Processing facility development timelines suggest domestic refining capacity could achieve 40-60% self-sufficiency for most critical minerals by 2030, assuming current investment trends continue. However, technical workforce development and technology transfer remain significant challenges requiring sustained attention.

Projected US Self-Sufficiency by 2030:

• Rare Earths – Current Level: 15%, 2030 Target: 45%, Key Constraints: Processing technology

• Lithium – Current Level: 2%, 2030 Target: 35%, Key Constraints: Water rights, permitting

• Copper – Current Level: 65%, 2030 Target: 80%, Key Constraints: Environmental approval

• Uranium – Current Level: 5%, 2030 Target: 25%, Key Constraints: Market demand uncertainty

Market share evolution will depend heavily on continued policy support, technological advancement, and successful resolution of environmental and community concerns. International competition from state-supported Chinese and other foreign producers creates ongoing pricing pressures that could affect project economics.

Sustainability and Environmental Integration

Future mining operations must integrate clean technology requirements and carbon footprint reduction mandates that reflect growing environmental consciousness and regulatory requirements. Advanced extraction techniques that minimise water usage and environmental disruption will become competitive necessities rather than optional enhancements.

Community benefit-sharing models increasingly influence project approval and social licence maintenance, requiring mining companies to demonstrate long-term value creation beyond traditional employment and tax revenue. These evolving requirements affect project economics and require early integration into development planning.

Moreover, current US energy policy initiatives emphasise the critical link between mineral security and broader energy independence objectives. This integrated approach recognises that achieving comprehensive resource independence requires coordinated development across multiple sectors.

""The transformation of US resource independence policy represents both unprecedented opportunity and significant risk for investors. Success requires careful navigation of political timelines, technical challenges, and evolving environmental requirements while maintaining focus on long-term strategic value creation.""

The window for capitalising on current policy support appears limited, making decisive action and thorough preparation essential for investment success. Furthermore, the strategic importance of achieving US resource independence extends beyond economic considerations to encompass fundamental national security interests that will likely maintain bipartisan support regardless of future political changes.

Disclaimer: This analysis involves forecasts and speculative elements regarding future policy developments, market conditions, and investment outcomes. Political and regulatory environments can change significantly, affecting project viability and investment returns. Mineral development projects carry substantial technical, environmental, and market risks that require professional evaluation and due diligence.

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

ENERGY AFFORDABILITY IS ON THE BALLOT IN NEW JERSEY, VIRGINIA, AND GEORGIA ELECTIONS: In upcoming elections in Georgia, New Jersey, and Virginia, there has been a clear line drawn between the candidates responding to voters’ concerns on energy costs with real solutions and those toeing the MAGA party line by supporting the Trump administration’s ban on clean energy and multi-million dollar taxpayer bailout for expensive, dirtier energy sources like coal. LCV’s affiliates in these states are running multi-million dollar campaigns to drive the conversation around costs ensuring the public understands who is focused on the issues that matter and who is making the problem even worse. Read the full memo for more.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Campaigns Sara Schreiber said, “Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ work to undermine, stall, and flat out ban wind and solar projects have led to higher utility bills for Americans nationwide. The Republican budget is expected to add more than $100 a year to Americans’ bills, and his administration’s attempt to block and limit wind and solar energy could cost even more. Affordability should be seen as the path to winning back voters’ trust. Candidates that are fully focused on bringing down utility costs and building homegrown clean energy will show voters they are serious about the issue. MAGA Republicans who are beholden to Trump’s disastrous energy agenda, will face the consequences of ignoring voters’ most pressing concerns.”

NJLCV HOSTS SOLAR FOR ALL TOUR AND ROUNDTABLE: New Jersey LCV hosted an event with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin to raise awareness of the cancellation of $7 billion in funding for the Solar for All program. New Jersey joined 19 other states in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its cancellation of the program, which would provide $156 million for clean energy in the state.

NJLCV TAKE: New Jersey LCV said, “Yesterday, Attorney General Matt Platkin visited the Social Profit Center in Hamilton, NJ where he viewed a rooftop solar and garden to highlight the lawsuit he filed alongside 22 other plaintiffs against the EPA for ending funding for the Solar for All program. The community solar program would have provided clean energy to more than 22,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities right here in New Jersey.

“This visit provided an opportunity to discuss how New Jersey is fighting back against Trump’s extreme energy agenda, which is raising electricity costs for working families in New Jersey while enriching billionaire oil and gas CEOs.”

INDIANA CONSERVATION VOTERS DELIVER ADDITIONAL PETITION SIGNATURES AGAINST MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING: Indiana Conservation Voters (ICV), Common Cause Indiana, the League of Women Voters of Indiana, Citizens Action Coalition and Women for Change, delivered more than 10,000 new signatures opposing mid-decade redistricting to the Indiana Statehouse. This more than doubles the initial petition drop delivered in early September.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters Executive Director Megan Robertson said, “Hoosiers have spoken—again and again and again. For more than two months, communities across the state have made it clear that they don’t want lawmakers to reopen the maps.

“The question for Governor Braun is simple: What will it take for him to listen to Hoosiers instead of Washington outsiders? When he came back to Indiana to run for Governor, Braun said it was because D.C. is broken. If that’s the case, why allow Washington operatives to come into our state with their outrageous demands. Hoosiers deserve better, and the Governor has a chance to say ‘no’ right now.”

ARIZONA COMMUNITIES CALL TO REINSTATE SOLAR FOR ALL: This past week, Chispa Arizona joined Activate 48, Vote Solar, and partners at the State Capitol to call out the EPA’s decision to pull $156 million in Solar for All funding — a program meant to help, not harm, communities. Leaders from across the state emphasized that all Arizonans, regardless of their race, zip code, or income, deserve the clean energy jobs, cost savings, and health benefits that this program would bring.

NEVADA ADVOCATES PUSH TO RESTORE SOLAR FOR ALL FUNDING: At a news conference on Tuesday, community advocates and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford came together to discuss the importance of the Solar for All program for community members struggling with high energy costs.

NEVADA FAMILIES SAY NO TO MORE RATE HIKES: Chispa Nevada and Nevada Conservation League (NCL) joined community members and partners — including Make the Road Nevada, Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, EcoMadres, and PLAN Nevada — at the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) General Consumer Session to demand that commissioners say no to more rate increases from NV Energy. Over 65 people attended and nearly 50 people gave public comments opposing the PUCN’s recent approval of another NV Energy rate hike. Chispa NV and NCL are supporting an effort to seek reconsideration of the rate increase.

CHISPA NV TAKE: Chispa Nevada member Ana Gonzalez said, “We’re here once again to raise our voices and make ourselves heard. The PUCN’s rate case decision is unjust and shows that they don’t understand what Nevada working families are going through. We are willing to pay a fair price. But these constant price increases, overcharges and abuses by monopoly utility companies are increasing poverty in our state, with no relief in sight. We can’t go on like this. We demand change.”

NCL TAKE: Nevada Conservation League Southern NV Communications Organizer Yesi Castro Lopez said, “We deserve real accountability. Decisions that deeply impact our lives — like raising rates, changing solar billing, and approving this new demand charge — should balance everyday Nevadans like me and our interests in a fair, impartial manner. I urge the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to demand transparency and fairness from these utilities to be more prudent, efficient, economically responsible, and reliable. No more luxury charges. No more blocking clean, affordable solutions like rooftop solar or energy efficiency. No more confusing charges, like the daily demand charge that will make it harder to manage costs. No more excuses.”

MARYLAND IS PUSHING FOR CLEAN SCHOOL BUSES: Chispa Maryland joined partners and advocates at the Baltimore City Board of Education to urge board members to take bold action toward fully electrifying the school bus fleet. They called for a clear implementation plan with timelines, resources, and infrastructure to make zero-emission transportation a reality, protecting children’s health and setting an example for school districts across the state.

NEW STUDY SHOWS CIATTARELLI’S ENERGY PLAN WOULD RAISE ENERGY COSTS: A new study found that New Jersey Republican gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli’s energy plan would raise energy prices by nearly $900 a year. Rather than lower prices for New Jersey families as promised, the Ciattarelli plan would decrease access to energy efficient appliances, electric vehicles, and cleaner renewable energy, raising costs for working families.

NATIONAL NEWS

LCV RELEASES ENERGY AFFORDABILITY MESSAGING MEMO: LCV released a memo detailing how the Trump administration’s policies to ban clean energy are raising already sky-high energy prices at a time when everyday people are struggling to pay for basic necessities. The memo recommends messaging on energy in a way that acknowledges energy bills are too high, goes on offense to call out who is raising them, and promotes policy focused on lowering costs. Read the full memo for more.

OUR TAKE: LCV President Pete Maysmith said, “The climate threat remains real, present and costly. People are losing their homes in massive floods, parents are keeping their kids inside because of wildfire smoke, families are struggling with insurance premiums, energy bills, and groceries. Trump’s attacks on cleaner, cheaper and faster renewable energy not only worsen future impacts of a warming world–they have created a rising cost crisis for people right now. This provides us an opportunity, if we take it, to win this debate once and for all and make progress on clean energy that is both immediate and lasting.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

DOI ANNOUNCES PLANS TO OPEN ARCTIC REFUGE FOR OIL AND GAS DRILLING, BUILD ROADS IN NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE: Yesterday, the Alaska congressional delegation, Governor Mike Dunleavy, and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum made a slew of announcements advancing oil and gas leasing in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge, greenlighting a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, and approving the right-of-ways for the Ambler Road Project to enable dirty mines in another Alaskan wilderness.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “While the government remains shut down and everyday people across the country are struggling with increasing healthcare, grocery, and energy costs, the Trump administration is once again putting the interests of its Big Oil billionaire donors over the public good. Today’s decisions from the Department of the Interior to build roads through Alaska’s sacred and treasured lands and push forward with oil and gas leasing in the entire Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge ignore decades of science and engagement with Indigenous communities. These decisions are reckless, not economically viable, and will hurt Alaska Native communities, their ways of life, and Alaska’s wildlife. LCV will continue to fight at every step of the way to protect these lands that sustain Alaska Native communities.”

TRUMP PLANS TO OPEN COASTS TO OFFSHORE DRILLING: Leaked federal documents revealed the Trump administration’s plans to open large sections of both the east and west coasts for offshore drilling. The proposal has drawn opposition from both Democrats and Republicans from coastal states. President Trump attempted a similar move during his first term, but backed down after bipartisan pushback threatened his reelection campaign.

ICYMI: BLM MOVES TO EXPAND MINING IN UTAH: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a copper mine expansion on more than 5,000 acres of public lands in Utah after cutting out community input. The mine is located just 40 miles from Bears Ears National Monument and threatens to pollute nearby waterways and endanger wildlife and cultural resources. LCV has been tracking the Trump administration’s efforts to open lands to corporate polluters at the expense of our communities and environment in our Attacks on Public Lands and Waters tracker.

7 MILLION PEOPLE JOIN NO KINGS PROTESTS NATIONWIDE: Over 7 million people joined thousands of No Kings rallies across the nation to protest President Trump’s power-hungry, corrupt administration. Communities came together in peaceful resistance, celebrating democracy and demanding change from the administration that has repeatedly defied the courts, cut vital programs, and given handouts to billionaires. LCV is proud to have served on the steering committee of this historic day of action.

OUR TAKE: LCV President Pete Maysmith said, “Today, millions of people across the country once again peacefully gathered to celebrate and defend our democracy, protect each other and our communities, and say enough to the Trump administration’s abuse of power. Just as Trump continues to threaten our fundamental democratic freedoms, he threatens the health, safety and prosperity of our communities as he and extreme Congressional Republicans make life dirtier and more expensive for everyone by banning cheaper, faster, and cleaner wind and solar power. We will continue the fight against authoritarian actions and stand with the people to say No Kings.”

TRUMP BEGINS DEMOLITION OF WHITE HOUSE’S EAST WING: In a striking visual representation of the Trump administration’s disdain for laws and his impact on this country, President Trump has begun demolition of the east wing of the White House to make way for his 90,000 square foot ballroom – paid for by cozy corporate donors – in the midst of a government shutdown.

The Climate and Community Institute and Public Grids report suggests overhauling the current system, shifting from investor-owned utilities to public power.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — The New York State Assembly held a hearing on Thursday to examine rising energy costs for everyday utility customers tied to new consumers on the electric grid, like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency data centers. The Assembly Energy Committee addressed concerns that surging demand from these massive energy users will drive up bills for New Yorkers.

The hearing convened just as a new report from the Climate and Community Institute and Public Grids concluded that the design of electricity rates itself—which prioritizes private profit over universal public service—is the core reason for soaring utility bills. Authored by Isaac Sevier and Roshan Krishnan, “Overcharged: The Rules Of The Electricity Affordability Crisis” said that the data center boom merely aggravates flaws that already plague the broken energy system.

The New York Independent System Operator has estimated that the state could be short some 1,600 megawatts of power by 2030, largely because of demand from these new, large consumers of power. The state’s grid operator has 36 current projects in its interconnection queue, a waiting list potentially representing over 10,000 megawatts of new demand. National Grid alone is reviewing 10 active requests totaling 2.28 gigawatts of new demand, with 65% of that coming from manufacturing or industrial projects and 35% from data centers.

Sevier also warned that one in four New Yorkers struggles to pay their utility bills. He said corporations repeatedly raise rates because they are designed to prioritize their own profits and ignore externalities like pollution. He also underlined the federal government shutdown, costing New York access to financial lifelines like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

“We need to ban utility shutoffs to protect New Yorkers today from the pressures of the extreme costs of living, buying us all more time to work on the core functions of the grid,” Sevier said.

The hearing questioned who should pay for vast infrastructure upgrades necessary to support rising demand from data centers. Representatives from utility companies, the digital infrastructure industry, and the New York State Public Service Commission said companies already pay for the interconnection costs they cause under the state’s current regulatory framework.

Rory Christian, Chair and CEO of the PSC, explained that they follow a “beneficiary pays” principle, meaning large new loads have to cover infrastructure costs they generate so residential customers do not pay the bill. And Javier Cobo, a Vice President at Avangrid—the parent company of New York State Electric and Gas and Rochester Gas and Electric)—agreed, insisting that their costs aren’t passed down to their customers.

But advocates doubted the beneficiary pays principle holds up. Laurie Wheelock, Executive Director of the Public Utility Law Project, suggested that the surge in wholesale power prices and the need for new capital infrastructure to support large users could still affect ratepayers. That’s because, for example, consumption spikes when AI models run, straining the grid and increasing costs on the supply side, while the new infrastructure translates to more capital costs on the delivery side.

Democratic Assemblymember Didi Barrett, Chair of the Energy Committee, cited reports of ratepayers in states like Illinois paying over 91% of the costs incurred by new, large energy consumers. She asked Christian about a reports that ratepayers upstate pay an extra $88 a year because of large-scale cryptomining. She also noted that tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft declined to send representation to the hearing despite being invited.

Christian acknowledged that sometimes, required grid upgrade costs are so high they that developers can’t or won’t pay:

Legislators have proposed a new measures that specifically cover large energy users. Barrett said she has a bill, the Accountable Costs for Data Center Act (S8540/A9039A), to create a new customer classification for large energy users like data centers for crypto or AI.

Republican Assemblymember Phil Palmesano, ranking member of the Assembly Energy Committee, questioned utility executives about the hundreds of millions of dollars that utilities collected from ratepayers for the state’s green energy mandates. He alleged that utilities are sitting on this money, which should be used for direct relief by and paying down customers’ high, overdue energy bills before funding green energy.

He also pointed out that unpaid arrears eventually get built into the next rate cases. Palmesano pushed for his legislation (S6412A/A6152A) requiring transparency by making utilities specifically disclose how much of the cost of a utility bill represents a surcharge from such mandates. The PSC and other state agencies would also publicly post that cost breakdown, itemized to include the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and programs related to offshore wind, electric heat pumps, or public policy transmission projects.

Advocates testified their backing for the ACDC Act. Elizabeth Moran, policy advocate for Earthjustice, supported the requirement that operations using at least 20 megawatts cover all of the associated costs and sign 10-year contracts to mitigate the risk that they’ll abandon projects. Earthjustice recommended meeting new demand with new, clean, and local energy supplies.

Wheelock pointed out that the specific service class would let the state monitor companies and set rates to accurately reflect the real costs. She added that utilities already include lots of detailed data on bills. That’s why she favored more transparency about how large consumer contribute to the system rather than a breakdown of costs for green mandates. PULP also recommended a dedicated technical panel for large energy users in every rate case.

The hearing also interrogated whether the state can maintain reliable and affordable energy supply. Zach Smith, Senior Vice President for NYISO, said that the New York power grid stands at an inflection point:

Smith owed the grid’s profound challenges to an aging fleet of power plants, the difficulty of building new resources quickly, and the rapid growth of larger energy demands. He warned that new large load connections are likely to outpace construction for generating and supplying power from new sources.

Still, large load users like cryptominers are more flexible than other, traditional industrial energy consumers. Hayley Miller, Director at the Digital Power Network, explained that Bitcoin miners can reduce consumption by over 95% in minutes without harming their operations. And Clint Plummer, CEO of Rise Light and Power, recommended requiring companies to pay for new power projects through long-term purchase agreements.

Tyler Norris, a research fellow at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, agreed that data center flexibility could exploited for better outcomes, temporarily reducing power when the grid is under strain. He suggested that modest changes, like cutting back power for about 44 hours per year, would let New York handle about four more gigawatts of consumption without any major upgrades. Norris said load flexibility could save hundreds of millions of dollars, since the price of new gas turbines is about $2 million per megawatt.

Utility representatives maintained that new load growth benefits all customers by spreading the fixed costs of the electric grid across a larger base of customers. Matt Barnett, Chief Operating Officer for National Grid’s New York Electric Business, said thoughtful growth helps customer affordability so communities prosper. Joe Halley, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs at Central Hudson, noted that new revenues from large customers usually cover infrastructure costs and can benefit existing customers, because increased sales reduces rates.

But environmental justice advocates said the scramble to meet new demands on the grid would force the state to rely on polluting power plants that damage vulnerable communities. Conor Bambrick, Senior Climate Advisor for the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, pointed out that many of New York City’s peaker power plants—which only run during hours of high demand—are in disadvantaged communities and cost ratepayers some $400 million or more each year.

Bambrick added community concerns like massive water use for cooling electronics, decreasing water and supply, while increasing water bills in other states. He noted that data centers pose the most significant threat to the state meeting its goals for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions. And Moran warned that data centers would erase any of those clean energy gains by forcing the grid to use dirtier, more expensive fuels.

The Climate and Community Institute and Public Grids report suggests overhauling the current system, shifting from investor-owned utilities to public power. The state could use public banks or other public finance authorities and terminate privately held franchise agreements to buy back the grid from private owners. They could reevaluate grid investments as if they were made under public ownership, with a 0% rate of return on equity premium. The goal would be prioritizing electricity as an affordable public good rather than a corporation maximizing shareholder profits, thus keeping costs low for new infrastructure.

Besides New York’s energy burden, the report also details local wealth inequality. The state’s “ultra-rich—households with over $30 million in net worth—hold $6.7 trillion in wealth. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable are under a “high energy burden,” meaning they spend at least 6% of household income on energy. In regions like the North Country and the Bronx, that applies to one in three households.

The report found that New York’s poorest households spend up to 34% of their income on energy on average. As of December 2024, over 1.3 million New York households were 60 days or more behind on utility bills, collectively owing more than $1.8 billion.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2025/10/AdobeStock_1307828176.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-24 21:02:48.182163
,EPA,2025-10-24 22:04:04+00:00,www.hunton.com,EPA Proposes to Extend ELG Deadlines for the Steam Electric Industry,"Andrew J. Turner, Brian R. Levey, Sadie Mapstone",,,,,https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/epa-proposes-to-extend-elg-deadlines-for-the-steam-electric-industry,"[1] Extension of NOPP Submission Deadline EPA proposes to extend the deadline to submit a NOPP for the 2034 cessation subcategory by six years to December 31, 2031.
Extension of Zero-Discharge Compliance Deadline EPA proposes to extend the zero-discharge compliance deadlines for flue gas desulfurization wastewater (FGDW), bottom ash transport water (BATW), and combustion residual leachate (CRL) effluents standards by five years.
New Transfer Provision EPA proposes to establish new transfer provisions to increase flexibility in the face of unexpected operational changes.
Alternative Applicability Date and Late NOPP EPA proposes a requirement for permitting authorities to extend applicability dates under the 2020 or 2024 ELG rules when an unexpected and uncontrollable circumstance occurs.
Clarifications to Must-Run Provision EPA proposes to clarify four aspects of the 2024 Rule’s “must-run” provision.","On October 2, EPA published the proposed effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) Deadline Extension Rule for the steam electric power generating industry to revise a series of provisions in the 2024 ELG rule. These revisions include extending the notice of planned participation (NOPP) and zero-discharge compliance deadlines, adding a new transfer provision to allow facilities to switch between compliance alternatives, and creating new authority for state permitting agencies to include alternative applicability dates based on site-specific factors. EPA also seeks comment on several key issues, including some that may inform a separate, future rulemaking. Comments on EPA’s proposal are due November 3.

The proposed rule, if issued as a final rule, would likely provide greater flexibility for electric generating units (EGUs) to meet ELG compliance deadlines, respond to unexpected market changes and supply chain uncertainty, and switch between compliance alternatives.

Background

The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits the unauthorized discharge of any pollutant to waters of the United States (WOTUS). Dischargers can obtain authorization to discharge limited pollutants through a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. An NPDES permit limits the amount of pollutants that can be discharged based on water quality standards and technology-based limits. Technology-based limits are set in accordance with effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Included in the 59 industries for which EPA has promulgated ELGs is the steam electric power generating industry (e.g., coal-fired power plants). EPA previously promulgated final regulations revising these ELGs in 2015, 2020, and 2024.

Key Elements of EPA’s Proposed ELG Extension Rule

EPA’s proposed rule includes provisions to extend NOPP and zero-discharge compliance deadlines, allow transfers between zero-discharge and 2034 subcategory compliance regimes, require alternative applicability dates, allow late NOPP submissions, and clarify the must-run provision.[1]

Extension of NOPP Submission Deadline

EPA proposes to extend the deadline to submit a NOPP for the 2034 cessation subcategory by six years to December 31, 2031. According to EPA, this deadline will give the owner or operator of an EGU more time to decide whether to participate in the 2034 cessation subcategory, which requires them to comply with certain requirements set forth in the 2024 rule. EPA is soliciting comments on alternative deadlines for submitting a NOPP and whether there are significant reliance interests related to the 2025 deadline.

Contemporaneously with EPA’s notice of proposed rulemaking, it published a direct final rule to extend the NOPP submission deadline to December 31, 2031, because, according to EPA, this change is noncontroversial, and notice-and-comment proceedings are unnecessary. This direct final rule will take effect on December 1 without further notice, unless EPA receives adverse comments by November 3. In that case, EPA will withdraw the direct final rule and address comments in any subsequent final rule.

Extension of Zero-Discharge Compliance Deadline

EPA proposes to extend the zero-discharge compliance deadlines for flue gas desulfurization wastewater (FGDW), bottom ash transport water (BATW), and combustion residual leachate (CRL) effluents standards by five years. In the 2024 rule, zero-discharge requirements must be met as soon as possible but “no later than” December 31, 2029. EPA proposes to extend the “no later than” deadline to December 31, 2034. EPA cites three primary reasons for this revision. First, the 2029 deadline may not be feasible due to possible unavailability of control technologies or their component parts. Second, extending the deadline will allow facilities that recently invested to comply with the 2020 rule more time to amortize technology costs, which could make it more feasible to comply with the 2024 rule. Third, the proposed deadline will allow facilities to transfer out of the 2034 subcategory and continue to generate electricity to satisfy national energy needs.

New Transfer Provision

EPA proposes to establish new transfer provisions to increase flexibility in the face of unexpected operational changes. Specifically, EPA proposes to allow transfers between zero-discharge requirements and the 2034 cessation subcategory compliance tracks. Under this proposed provision, facilities would be able to transfer, in either direction, up until the December 31, 2034, deadline.

Alternative Applicability Date and Late NOPP

EPA proposes a requirement for permitting authorities to extend applicability dates under the 2020 or 2024 ELG rules when an unexpected and uncontrollable circumstance occurs.[2] In particular, EPA proposes to require permitting authorities to establish an alternative applicability date where a facility 1) transfers between limitations or backs out of a commitment to permanently cease coal combustion due to an unexpected change in regional capacity markets or local demand, 2) faces unexpected supply chain issues, or 3) faces any other circumstance that requires additional time and is wholly outside both the facility’s control and the facility’s ability to plan.[3] As proposed, this requirement would allow an alternative applicability date and associated milestones to be included in the permit, despite existing regulatory requirements. Additionally, EPA proposes to add a provision that would allow a permitting authority to accept a late NOPP submission if the facility experiences one of these circumstances. According to the proposal, a facility wishing to submit a late NOPP must submit an initial request letter and regular progress reports to its permitting authority.

Clarifications to Must-Run Provision

EPA proposes to clarify four aspects of the 2024 Rule’s “must-run” provision. First, the “must-run” provision is intended to cover any reliability must-run agreement or similar order, including FERC’s acceptance of a reliability must-run agreement. Second, an EGU’s certification to cease coal combustion followed by a Balancing Authority’s projection that it will cause a resource adequacy shortfall constitutes a qualifying event under the must-run provision. Third, any event listed in the must-run provision would trigger the reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Lastly, the term “increased production” in 40 C.F.R. § 423.19(i)(3) includes extended production.

EPA Solicits Comment on Key Issues

In response to industry feedback, EPA also seeks comment on the “availability” and “economic achievability” of zero-discharge technologies, cessation subcategories, and unmanaged CRL.

Zero-Discharge Technologies. EPA solicits information on: pilot study and bench test information (technological availability); cost projection information (economic achievability); newly installed systems (technological availability and economic achievability); and resource adequacy and reliability.

Cessation Subcategories. EPA solicits comment on repealing the 2028 and 2034 cessation subcategories.

Unmanaged CRL. EPA solicits comment on any pilot or full-scale treatment data for unmanaged CRL. EPA also solicits comment on any engineering cost estimates, bids, vendor quotes, or other cost information regarding treatment of unmanaged CRL.

The move follows Harris County's lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration to restore the program.

The EPA announced on Aug. 7 that it would terminate the Solar for All program and take back $7 billion in funds from grant recipients, saying the Trump administration's rescission package required it to do so. Houston Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher played a key role in passing the program into law three years ago.

""This is a huge, important renewable energy program, and here in Texas, Harris County led a statewide coalition that won one of the five largest awards of any group in the country,"" Fletcher said. ""It got a $250 million grant to deliver solar and battery storage to nearly 30,000 households in Texas.""

Fletcher stressed that the program was designed to create thousands of well-paying jobs and to boost American manufacturing, in addition to making the electrical grid more reliable.

""All of that was happening here in Texas, in Houston, in Port Arthur, and in Waco,” she said. “Training programs were already underway to certify Texans in solar installation and energy efficiency. So, we’re talking about benefits for consumers, benefits for workers, and benefits for our environment and our economy.""

""This letter is responding to something even bigger than the Solar for All program,” Fletcher said. “It’s about responding to the Trump administration’s continued efforts to consolidate power and overrule the other branches of government, and that would be Congress and the courts.

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said Thursday, using Trump’s preferred name for the gulf.
“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” said Mace spokesperson Sydney Long.

And they aren’t pleased.

Areas off the southern coast of California, swaths of the Atlantic Coast and a part of the eastern Gulf of Mexico are potentially up for grabs in the Interior Department’s forthcoming five-year plan, Ben Lefebvre reported this week.

The plan is not as extensive as the one Trump floated in 2017 that alarmed politicians in Florida and was ultimately pulled back. But the proposal is nonetheless running into a bipartisan buzz saw on Capitol Hill, Garrett Downs reports, and potential encroachment on the Florida coastline is getting a reaction again.

A person familiar with the planning told Ben that “at least a small sliver” of area in the eastern Gulf of Mexico is expected to be opened for drilling.

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said Thursday, using Trump’s preferred name for the gulf. “It’s important to Florida.”

Floridians of both parties have long opposed drilling off their shoreline, asking for a hard line to be drawn between the dominant offshore oil and gas drilling areas along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas and waters even remotely close to the Florida coast. Politicians and residents from the state fear that offshore rigs or an oil spill would devastate its tourism-dependent economy — and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, which tarred stretches of the Panhandle’s white-dune beaches, is still fresh in many people’s minds.

‘Poke of the day’

Along the Atlantic, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) wants Trump to uphold his 2020 order that closed off South Carolina, Georgia and Florida’s Atlantic coast from drilling. Mace is running for governor.

“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” said Mace spokesperson Sydney Long. “Congresswoman Mace continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina to protect our coastline, economy, and way of life.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) agreed, telling Josh Siegel he supports continuing the 2020 moratorium.

Coastal Democrats are unified in their opposition to drilling and predicted more Republicans would join them.

“It’s going to be unacceptable for not just Democratic-run states, but for everybody. We don’t need to be moving in that direction,” said Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.).

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) speculated that floating the California proposal could be Trump’s way to antagonize Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential presidential candidate and outspoken Trump foe.

“That may be the poke of the day,” Padilla said.

But not all coastal lawmakers are opposed to drilling. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who previously opposed drilling off of his state’s coast, said he backs the idea, though he wants the state to get offshore wind, too. He said the equipment is so far from the shore that people cannot see it from land.

“Outside of the sightlines, you can’t see them from an 11-story building, which is the tallest building in Wilmington,” he said.

Ultimately, Trump doesn’t need approval from anyone in Congress, though state leaders’ opinions have been critical in the past.

Green groups brace for impact from Trump

Environmental groups are taking precautions including hiring extra security and lawyers as they brace for scrutiny from the Trump administration, Scott Waldman writes.

The administration has been stepping up attacks on the president’s perceived enemies, as well as its targeting of antifascist or “Antifa” groups. Some conservative groups have claimed that climate activists are part of a wider Antifa network, and have asked the president to investigate.

“These misguided and dangerous attacks on our First Amendment rights will ultimately fail and backfire,” said Denae Ávila-Dickson, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement.

Changing of the guard at FERC — again

The White House on Thursday designated Laura Swett chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, marking the agency’s third leadership change in nine months, Francisco “A.J.” Camacho reports.

Swett — a Republican who previously served as an adviser and attorney at FERC and an energy litigator at the firm Vinson & Elkins — will replace Democrat David Rosner at the commission’s helm.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright last night announced he had called on FERC to propose new rules for speeding the interconnection of data centers and other large electricity consumers to regional power grids.

Its plan to limit the sun’s heat raised $60 million from a broad coalition of investors that included Silicon Valley luminaries and the Agnelli family, an Italian industrial dynasty.

Critics of the effort to engineer an atmospheric climate solution says it’s a largely untested, thinly researched and mostly unregulated technology that could disrupt weather patterns.

By Sarah Vogel, Senior Vice President, Healthy Communities, EDF, Dr. Arnab Ghosh, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College and Stefanie Le, Writer, Data Smart Cities

Extreme weather is no longer a distant threat—it’s here. NASA reports that in the past year alone, the U.S. saw twice as many extreme weather events as the 2003–2020 average. Storms are stronger, heat waves last longer and wildfires spread faster.

At New York Climate Week, leaders from cities, universities and health organizations gathered to ask a pressing question: how can data help communities protect themselves? The panel, hosted by Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and Environmental Defense Fund with the Community Data Health Initiative, City of Detroit, NYC Department of Health, NYU’s City Health program and the African American Mayors Association, emphasized the role of data in shaping health-focused climate solutions.

Here are five takeaways:

1. Data is the backbone of climate and health solutions

Mount Vernon Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard described how data revealed a stark divide in her city: tree-lined streets in the north are up to 7 degrees cooler than the south side, where residents face higher asthma rates and utility bills.

“We don’t have the luxury of ignoring climate because we live at its intersection,” she said. “With a 5 to 7 degree difference in heat because urban heat islands on the south side, tree lined streets on the north side. And what does that cause? More asthma, more pulmonary issues and higher utility bills for the people that can afford them the least.”

2. Cities must adapt and mitigate—at the same time

Detroit is turning vacant land into opportunity. With more than 124,000 empty parcels, the city is converting lots into urban farms.

“It can’t be one or the other,” said Trisha Stein, Detroit’s Chief Strategy Officer. “We’re protecting the vulnerable, stabilizing neighborhoods, growing locally sourced food and generating $23 million in health benefits.”

3. Climate and health aren’t political—they’re personal

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson put it bluntly:

“Seventy percent of our most intense storms have occurred since 2015. If we’re ever hit by a Category 3 hurricane, three-quarters of Savannah would be underwater.”

4. Lived experience shapes the strongest policies

Margot Brown of EDF reminded the audience that climate change doesn’t create inequities—it deepens them.

“Climate change is what we call a threat multiplier. So it doesn’t just create new challenges, it worsens the ones that we already face, especially for the most vulnerable populations. People already facing poverty or racism are hit first and worst. That’s unfair—and avoidable.”

5. Leaders don’t choose their crises—climate chooses for them

Representative Maxine Dexter (OR-03) recalled Oregon’s devastating 2020 wildfires, which burned more than a million acres. The smoke spread far beyond the fire line, endangering firefighters and residents alike.

“We must act with urgency and care,” she said. “The smoke literally goes where the wind blows it. Wildland firefighters have been out there with bandanas over their faces, fighting for generations. You don’t see mainland firefighters doing that anymore and we need that for our wildland firefighters.”

The East Side Community Network’s Stoudamire Wellness Hub will host state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), state Reps. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-Detroit) and Donovan McKinney (D-Detroit), and Detroit Action Political Director James Johnson alongside Detroit residents and representatives from multiple organizing groups, as they call out the state’s largest energy providers over high rates and poor reliability.

The speakers will also offer information about the ratepayer bill of rights, a slate of bills which aims to address these issues alongside concerns that political spending is stymying additional regulations on energy providers.

The “Our Bills Are Too Damn High!” block party runs Sunday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. with speeches set to begin at 3 p.m. In addition to remarks from lawmakers and residents calling for greater accountability from DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s largest energy companies, the event will feature food and performances.

In recent years, both utilities have faced repeated criticism for high energy prices and poor reliability, with the Citizens Utility Board, an energy utility watchdog, noting that the companies have “some of the highest outage durations among all investor-owned utilities in the nation.”

Ballot initiative seeks to ban political contributions from monopoly corporations, like utilities

While both companies have each pledged to improve their services, customers and advocacy groups have remained frustrated with the utilities’ near yearly requests to increase their rates, with DTE requesting a $574 million rate increase earlier this year, while Consumers Energy requested a $436 million increase for its electrical rates.

Dana St. Couer, a senior communication strategist for DTE said customers saw 70% improvement in time spent without power in 2024 due to $1.5 billion in investments in the electric grid last year coupled with less extreme weather.

In a statement on Jan. 14, Consumers Energy said the average customer spent 21 fewer minutes without power in 2024, with 93% of customers seeing their power restored within 24 hours.

Katie Carey, Consumers Energy’s director of media relations, emphasized in an email to the Michigan Advance that the company’s rate requests fund future investments.

“For example, clearing trees away from power lines is critical to our plan, addressing the #1 cause of outages. We are proposing a five-year timetable to clear all of our system’s low-voltage lines, which serve homes and businesses directly,” Carey said. “We had previously been working toward a seven-year effective cycle. We plan to clear 8,000 miles of high- and low-voltage power lines this year. We expect a 30% reduction in tree-related outage incidents by 2030.”

In the interim, lawmakers have offered their own solutions through legislation seeking greater accountability from energy providers, while providing customers additional protections.

The ratepayer bill of rights includes legislation sponsored by McKinney that would increase the outage credit customers receive on their bills to $5 an hour, gradually increasing to $15 an hour after 24 hours without service and $25 dollars per hour in interruptions longer than 72 hours.

The current credit offers customers $42 if their outages last 16 hours or longer under normal conditions, 48 hours if skies are gray and 96 hours under catastrophic weather conditions, with customers receiving an additional $42 for each day they are without power.

The package also includes Myers Phillips’ House Bill 5047, which would ensure winter shut off protections for households with seniors 65 and older, and children 16 and younger.

The ratepayers bill of rights also includes legislation to allow for the establishment of community solar energy programs, and to ban utility companies and businesses seeking government contracts from making political contributions.

Chang told the Michigan Advance on Thursday that the event is aimed at raising awareness and getting more community members engaged on issues of energy affordability and reliability, while providing those affected with concrete solutions they can take action on.

Oftentimes when there is a major storm, Chang said her office will hear from residents and see the resulting power outages firsthand. While the outage credit has increased in recent years, it does not match the impact felt by those facing the outage Chang said, pointing to individuals losing the food in their refrigerator as one example.

When looking at the ratepayer’s bill of rights as a package, Chang emphasized that these policies focus on what ratepayers need.

“When we talk about reliability, when we talk about energy policy, when we talk about outages, ultimately, it’s about people,” Chang said, noting that these outages weigh the heaviest on those who are already struggling to pay their bills and keep food on the table.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250909_093742-1024x9421761339832.jpg?h=da12e3f0&itok=lvoKQx4o,N,,2025-10-24 19:59:16.039970

Just this week, small modular reactor (SMR) developer start-up ""One Nuclear Energy"" went public via a Special Purpose Acquisition Co. that values the pre-revenue brand at $1 billion.
These developments mark concrete progress on real projects further along than fevered equity investor nuclear plays.
The construction project — as with many SMR, microreactor and advanced reactor newbuilds — won't have the standard nuclear island basemat concrete pour that is the traditional metric of the commencement of nuclear construction.
Both projects ""will share a common core design, but their configurations will differ based on intended use,"" noted the Energy Northwest spokesperson.","The nuclear newbuild world is, at the moment, one in which all boats are rising: Serious deployments are approaching full nuclear construction even as the most precarious of start-ups inch toward billion-dollar valuations.

Even as interest picks up across North America in deploying traditional large light-water reactors, and as stock markets overheat with eye-popping valuations for advanced nuclear and SMR start-ups, enough utility-scale projects for both the BWRX-300 and the Xe-100 are getting concrete enough that serious fleets may be in sight for both GE Vernova-Hitachi and X-energy.

That real progress comes as the background noise only increases. Just this week, small modular reactor (SMR) developer start-up ""One Nuclear Energy"" went public via a Special Purpose Acquisition Co. that values the pre-revenue brand at $1 billion.

Compare that to the C$3 billion (US$2 billion) government investments announced this week at the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) BWRX-300 SMR project at Darlington, Ontario, which is ramping up to full construction and slated to become the first land-based commercial SMR project outside of China. Or to the expansion of the Xe-100 SMRs planned by Washington state's Energy Northwest — alongside Amazon — into a gigawatt-scale newbuild, something that was announced last week. These developments mark concrete progress on real projects further along than fevered equity investor nuclear plays.

BWRX-300 Fleet Takes Shape

""We're here to make a generational investment, an investment that will extend Canada's world leadership in clean energy,"" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said as he announced on Oct. 23 a C$2 billion investment from the Canada Growth Fund in the Darlington SMR project being built by province-owned Ontario Power Generation (OPG). A further C$1 billion of investment was announced by the province's Building Ontario Fund. Constructing the four BWRX-300s at Darlington ""will position Canada as the global leader in the deployment of small modular reactors, a leadership we can take to other markets,"" said Carney.

The first BWRX-300 at Darlington is arguably already under construction, after OPG stepped up work in May after Ontario took a positive final investment decision to proceed with the ambitious newbuild. The construction project — as with many SMR, microreactor and advanced reactor newbuilds — won't have the standard nuclear island basemat concrete pour that is the traditional metric of the commencement of nuclear construction. Instead, the BWRX-300 will be built on a base of construction ""bricks,"" or ""diaphragm plate steel composite (DPSC) modules"" that are fabricated offsite.

The first of these DPSCs will make up a basemat module, and once a reactor building shaft is excavated, ""a heavy crane will lift the Basemat and place it at the bottom of the shaft, 35 metres in the ground,"" OPG said in an Oct. 23 statement. An OPG spokesperson declined to give the date that this emplacement is targeted, claiming instead that the Darlington project is already fully under construction. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) database, the traditional arbiter of these metrics, has not yet listed the Darlington SMR as under construction but also has not yet finalized how it will measure novel reactor construction projects. Agency officials are planning to consider, in a March 2026 technical meeting, an expanded definition of a construction start to better reflect the characteristics of SMR and microreactor projects currently under development.

That decision ought to be able to capture the construction starts of the other BWRX-300 newbuild projects in the queue, although not by much. At the end of August, Polish oil and gas firm Orlen announced the selection of the Wloclawek site in central Poland for the inaugural two Polish BWRX-300s to be deployed by Orlen Synthos Green Power, the Orlen joint venture with Synthos, a Polish chemicals company.

The companies hope to build at least two BWRX-300s at Wloclawek by 2035 — three years after the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) hopes to complete an inaugural US BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site in the southeastern US state of Tennessee. TVA, which is controlled by the US government, has plans to build four BWRX-300s at Clinch River, comparable to the Darlington project, but has received inordinate pressure from the White House to speed up its nuclear deployments. The administration of US President Donald Trump has even stripped the TVA board of its required quorum — for five of its nine seats being filled — by firing multiple board members in an effort to jump-start new nuclear work.

This week, four nominees to join the TVA board testified before a Senate committee, and all four made clear they had heard the marching orders and that they were ready to press the accelerator. ""Our best hope is nuclear,"" nominee Jeff Hagood told the committee in an Oct. 22 testimony. Fellow nominee Arthur Graham added that ""we have the opportunity"" to make the Clinch River SMRs ""happen as quick as we can."" Added a third nominee, Randall Jones: ""We've got to have the sense of urgency to make this happen.""

Growing Xe-100 Orders

Last week's announcement that the X-energy-supplied new nuclear plant at Energy Northwest's at WNP-1 site on the government's Hanford nuclear reservation in eastern Washington state will be called the ""Cascade Advanced Energy Facility"" buried a major development: The scale of the project has ballooned from ""at least"" four Xe-100s to ""up to"" 12 Xe-100s in the year since Amazon partnered with Energy Northwest to help fund — and ultimately, purchase power offtake — from the utility's planned Xe-100 reactors.

""Key features of the future SMR facility include the modular nature of the plant with three 320 megawatt sections to make up the full 960 MW plant in just a few city blocks,"" Amazon said in an Oct. 16 update. The nearly 1 gigawatt that Amazon is supporting at the Cascade project is only a fraction of the 5 GW of capacity that Amazon and X-energy — in which Amazon led a $500 million financing round last year — hope to deploy by 2039 in the US and possibly beyond.

This summer, these two firms announced a partnership with South Korea's Doosan Energibility and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to ""accelerate the deployment of new Xe-100 advanced nuclear reactors in the United States to meet increasing power demands by data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification,"" X-energy said in an Aug. 25 statement. ""The parties aim to mobilize up to $50 billion in public and private investments for Xe-100 projects and the expansion of associated supply chain capacity to support the future of American energy dominance and artificial intelligence growth.""

It's not clear how much of that $50 billion Amazon itself intends to provide, but beyond its X-energy financing, notes from a June meeting of Energy Northwest's board reveal Amazon is funding $334 million for the Cascade project. Beyond that funding, which is likely all devoted to preconstruction project development, Amazon and Energy Northwest must conclude a power purchase agreement (PPA) for offtake from the Cascade plant. That PPA will, in turn, be used to provide ballast to Energy Northwest's loan application to the US Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office.

In late August, Energy Northwest submitted ""a preliminary working draft of the Part II loan application, marking a key milestone in securing federal support for the project,"" an Energy Northwest spokesperson told Energy Intelligence, and an Oct. 23 presentation to the board revealed the formal application is targeted for submittal by Nov. 30. ""This is a complex process, and we’ve collaborated with a broad group of industry partners to prepare the documentation. While this submission represents meaningful progress, substantial work remains ahead as we move toward a formal application later this year.""

Just this week, Energy Northwest selected an equal-share joint venture of Kiewit Nuclear Solutions, Black & Veatch and Aecon, creatively named ""Cascade Nuclear Partners,"" to ""collaboratively complete the planning, design, and construction of the first four of 12 Xe-100 SMRs under a progressive design-build (PDB) model,"" the utility announced Oct. 23. The PDB model is meant to facilitate cooperation between the project owner and the contractors during early stages of the project. Energy Northwest is targeting submitting its construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in August next year, according to the Oct. 23 presentation.

Not yet clear is to what extent Amazon will be actively involved in project development, although its role will be much greater than that of a traditional offtaker: One Amazon executive visited Doosan's manufacturing plant in Changwon, South Korea, last month, where he saw prototypes of the Xe-100.

The Cascade project is in the comfortable position of being a second adopter of the Xe-100: It will follow chemical giant Dow, which plans to build a FOAK four-unit Xe-100 plant at its Seadrift complex, in what Dow is calling the ""Long Mott"" project. Both projects ""will share a common core design, but their configurations will differ based on intended use,"" noted the Energy Northwest spokesperson. ""Dow’s installation will be integrated with industrial operations to provide process heat and power, while Energy Northwest’s will focus on grid-scale electricity generation with potential for future expansion. Both sites will deploy four-reactor 'packs,' with supporting systems and operational goals tailored to their respective contexts.""

The NRC confirmed in June that it plans to issue a final safety evaluation on the construction permit application for Long Mott by November 2026, setting the stage for the inaugural Xe-100 newbuild to be under construction well before the end of the decade. Unlike Energy Northwest or UK utility Centrica, which last month signed a deal to build three Xe-100 four-packs at the Hartlepool brownfield nuclear site in North East England, Dow has no history in nuclear operations.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6836be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x476+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F1b%2F9e9991b04eb089a2502e88e4df00%2Fshutterstock-2161610045.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:19:38.306414

Environmental advocates, community leaders and members of the Michigan Legislature will gather on Detroit’s east side Sunday for food and festivities while demanding accountability from the state’s largest energy providers.

The East Side Community Network’s Stoudamire Wellness Hub will host state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), state Reps. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-Detroit) and Donovan McKinney (D-Detroit), and Detroit Action Political Director James Johnson alongside Detroit residents and representatives from multiple organizing groups, as they call out the state’s largest energy providers over high rates and poor reliability.

The speakers will also offer information about the ratepayer bill of rights, a slate of bills which aims to address these issues alongside concerns that political spending is stymying additional regulations on energy providers.

The “Our Bills Are Too Damn High!” block party runs Sunday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. with speeches set to begin at 3 p.m. In addition to remarks from lawmakers and residents calling for greater accountability from DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s largest energy companies, the event will feature food and performances.

In recent years, both utilities have faced repeated criticism for high energy prices and poor reliability, with the Citizens Utility Board, an energy utility watchdog, noting that the companies have “some of the highest outage durations among all investor-owned utilities in the nation.”

Ballot initiative seeks to ban political contributions from monopoly corporations, like utilities

While both companies have each pledged to improve their services, customers and advocacy groups have remained frustrated with the utilities’ near yearly requests to increase their rates, with DTE requesting a $574 million rate increase earlier this year, while Consumers Energy requested a $436 million increase for its electrical rates.

Dana St. Couer, a senior communication strategist for DTE said customers saw 70% improvement in time spent without power in 2024 due to $1.5 billion in investments in the electric grid last year coupled with less extreme weather.

In a statement on Jan. 14, Consumers Energy said the average customer spent 21 fewer minutes without power in 2024, with 93% of customers seeing their power restored within 24 hours.

Katie Carey, Consumers Energy’s director of media relations, emphasized in an email to the Michigan Advance that the company’s rate requests fund future investments.

“For example, clearing trees away from power lines is critical to our plan, addressing the #1 cause of outages. We are proposing a five-year timetable to clear all of our system’s low-voltage lines, which serve homes and businesses directly,” Carey said. “We had previously been working toward a seven-year effective cycle. We plan to clear 8,000 miles of high- and low-voltage power lines this year. We expect a 30% reduction in tree-related outage incidents by 2030.”

In the interim, lawmakers have offered their own solutions through legislation seeking greater accountability from energy providers, while providing customers additional protections.

The ratepayer bill of rights includes legislation sponsored by McKinney that would increase the outage credit customers receive on their bills to $5 an hour, gradually increasing to $15 an hour after 24 hours without service and $25 dollars per hour in interruptions longer than 72 hours.

The current credit offers customers $42 if their outages last 16 hours or longer under normal conditions, 48 hours if skies are gray and 96 hours under catastrophic weather conditions, with customers receiving an additional $42 for each day they are without power.

The package also includes Myers Phillips’ House Bill 5047, which would ensure winter shut off protections for households with seniors 65 and older, and children 16 and younger.

The ratepayers bill of rights also includes legislation to allow for the establishment of community solar energy programs, and to ban utility companies and businesses seeking government contracts from making political contributions.

Chang told the Michigan Advance on Thursday that the event is aimed at raising awareness and getting more community members engaged on issues of energy affordability and reliability, while providing those affected with concrete solutions they can take action on.

Oftentimes when there is a major storm, Chang said her office will hear from residents and see the resulting power outages firsthand. While the outage credit has increased in recent years, it does not match the impact felt by those facing the outage Chang said, pointing to individuals losing the food in their refrigerator as one example.

When looking at the ratepayer’s bill of rights as a package, Chang emphasized that these policies focus on what ratepayers need.

“When we talk about reliability, when we talk about energy policy, when we talk about outages, ultimately, it’s about people,” Chang said, noting that these outages weigh the heaviest on those who are already struggling to pay their bills and keep food on the table.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/michigan_advance_articles_244/13b80d2c5edf56f60df5dd9419c114ac,N,,2025-10-24 18:05:34.259978

In my recent columns, I have analyzed the federal government’s alarming demolition of the U.S. scientific research enterprise. Public health, social justice, climate science, and environmental science have been notable targets of the Trump administration; however, virtually all federal, civilian research has been impacted since January 2025.

These actions are diminishing scientific capacity and deconstructing the infrastructure created after World War II and during the Cold War. During that time, we got serious about water and air pollution and formed the Environmental Protection Agency during the Nixon Administration.

Since early 2025, scientists, professors, research labs, and universities have been cast by the administration as an enemy, and what we are experiencing now is the government’s attempt to disarm and disperse that enemy. To diminish their agency and power.

My analyses have focused on fundamental motivations and consequences, and I have tried to encourage thinking about next steps. However, the federal layoffs, the withholding and elimination of research funding, the closing of institutions, the evictions of organizations, and the decisions of political appointees are so far outside the norm that it’s difficult to know what to do.

Lessons learned

In this column, I am going to reflect on my experiences leading and managing scientific organizations.

Though the government’s current efforts are extraordinary in terms of intent and effectiveness, we need to remember that science has been through tough times in the past. The science “recession” of the late 1960s, early 1970s, and the 2016 Trump administration are key examples.

My personal experience, however, dates to the 1990s when the Mission to Planet Earth, a centerpiece of NASA’s research, was reduced from a $30-billion program to a $7-billion program.

This descoping of NASA Earth Science was accompanied by congressional attacks on climate and environmental science. Even so, effective science advocates still existed in the U.S. Congress of the 1990s. Those advocates assured that scientists had a voice. There were people in power who listened to and trusted scientists.

What can we control?

When faced with difficult situations, one of the first things to do is identify what you can and cannot control. For example, you may be fearful and outraged by certain events, but you have still control over how you respond.

In managing people through crisis or complexity, I knew some people in my organization would respond with anxiety, others with sarcasm, and still others with indifference.

Some were immediately ready to solve the problem. They might have thought, “This is bad. This is challenging. But we need to figure out how to go on.” We ask: What does our experience tell us about what we should do? If we don’t have that experience, where can we find those who do?

I used to advise people in my organization to limit their exposure to their anxious and sarcastic colleagues, whose response did not reflect a useful reality. I would tell them to be careful about what they said and did; that there is no requirement to state every thought in your head. Such discretion limits self-inflected anxiety that can make the situation worse.

I’d remind them it’s important to evaluate a situation from different perspectives: How do I manage this crisis as an individual and as an organization or institution?

As efforts persisted to discredit both individuals and institutions, I would counsel people not to interpret every decision as a personal attack, to put some distance between events and oneself.

These questions of reflection and efforts at self-control are characteristics of leadership.

Active and passive resistance to management is normal in any organization. Anxiety and fear were always present in mine, but I could manage my staff up and down the hallway.

Now that hallway includes social media, and it is daunting to manage the impact of online discourse.

If all one can do is react and proclaim, there is little foundation for a productive path forward.

Presence

Once you can manage the reactive state, it becomes possible to strategize, prepare, and achieve longer-term outcomes. You can adapt and adjust by asking: What are the potential resources? How do I collect things together? Who are my allies? What power do my allies and I have? Before long, you are building a foundation to respond to the crises.

To build a foundation for response, you need to be present in the public and political process.

You may dislike what is happening, but it’s crucial to present the alternative you prefer.

If we only say that we want what we no longer have, we remain trapped in the reactive state, limited to expressions of outrage.

You must be able to articulate specific, achievable goals. Presence without goals has limited potential.

Exercise Due Process

Due process at times seems futile, but it is a mistake to give up and walk away.

A first line of action is adjudication and litigation: appeals to ethics, norms, and reason. In many cases, you will lose, but presence, persistence, and continuity are essential.

If you walk away from due process, you walk away from rules and law and the checks and balances that are integral to the American system. If you walk away, you are saying that laws are not worth preserving.

Due process includes writing to your elected officials, saying what you want, and reminding them that you vote.

Support an independent, objective press

The free press has been a pillar of American democracy from its inception. A strong, independent press fosters accountability. It is essential to being present and bearing witness.

The press is a source of influence and power.

Large news organizations are increasingly owned by a handful of individuals and corporations that align with political agendas or social goals. An emphasis on profits and ratings distorts priorities and erodes journalistic integrity.

As the mainstream press has consolidated under fewer owners and smaller newsrooms, journalists have organized at local, state, and national levels. Many are focused on integrity in journalism and objective news. But funding is perilous.

Such self-organizing leaves us with a fragmented landscape, with news outlets finding hundreds or thousands of customers, not millions.

And with the rise of social media, many would-be citizen journalists identify as independent alternatives to legacy media. Though “free,” they often eschew the ethical and professional protocols that define a fair press. Influencers and supposed experts abound, and many are sympathetic to political goals. But these are advocates, not journalists. Many are wildly popular and quite effective with their messaging.

A crisis of truth

Misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda have always been part of the political process. They are methods people use to steer resources toward personal and collective goals.

Social media platforms are open to all points of view. Unfortunately it is easier to gain a following by poking at human foibles and the uncertainties of knowledge than it is to methodically present a legitimate, evidence-based point of view.

When the Department of Energy published A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S., it presented a platter of propaganda.

Misinformation, manipulative media – even pranks – stand next to established knowledge, actual events, proven facts, and science-based knowledge as legitimate points worthy of discussion. Opposing points of view regarding the same sets of knowledge, events, and facts are distorted into tribal truths and lies. One’s self-identified truth becomes a set of beliefs, independent of evidence, facts, or reality.

We erroneously maintain that fairness requires equal representation of the correct and the incorrect.

Speaking lies is equated with freedom of speech.

We are faced with George Orwell’s chilling proclamation: “Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth.”

Where we are now

With the deconstruction of institutions in today’s political environment, an individual’s response tends to focus on their own well-being. And that’s a rational response.

But we are at a moment in history that requires us to envision how the overall scientific enterprise will look in four, eight, 12 years. We must think of something new.

This requires organization on a large scale.

Decisions by government leaders are eliminating or corrupting the resources that support research to discover, advance, and innovate. To cure, help, and solve.

The dispersal and defunding of this skill base will, at least in the short term, diminish rather than enhance our nation’s presence and competitiveness.

Voices in science need to be heard. We need to be present and to speak.

It is important to support organizations that present science to our elected representatives and that represent the case for science in the courts.

People have the power

We need to vote.

We need to build and support credible and legitimate journalism.

We need to press our institutional allies to support organization, nurture leadership skills, and develop the next generation of leaders.

As we organize, act, and build new capacity, we must consider the long term. How do we support data gathering, analysis, and interpretation? How do we organize and provide knowledge in ways that are trusted and durable?

In our federal laboratories these past six months, we have seen the deterioration of what many consider the most secure scientific capacity in the world. How do we insure the preservation and growth of future knowledge? What is government’s role?

As a start, we must get past reaction and dismay. We need to rise above the emotional convulsions that take us from one outrage to the next. We need to understand, and put into practice, the elements of leadership that lift us above the chaos. We must find our power.",https://michigantoday.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/mc-image-cache/2025/10/Climate-Biue-Abandoned-Laboratory.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:04:49.320836

As chief of staff for the Office of Domestic Climate Policy in the Biden Administration and special assistant to the president for climate, Maggie Thomas ’15 MEM was charged with overseeing the enactment of federal policy aimed at decarbonizing the U.S. economy. Her purview included the $550 billion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which as the largest climate investment in U.S. history, provided more than $370 billion to address climate change and advance the clean energy transition.

There were immense challenges in enacting this legislation. Thomas said some people told her that it simply could not be done, but she worked to meet each challenge and get it to the finish line. As the federal landscape on environmental policy changes, Thomas said she is taking the lessons she learned at the White House on overcoming barriers with her in her new endeavors as a consultant on environmental issues.

“Many people did not believe that the federal government could take the action that we took as quickly as we took it. Knowing that we were able to have an impact in a short period of time gives me hope and belief that we will be able to do it again,” she said.

Thomas became interested in government and politics at early age, accompanying her parents as they canvassed door-to-do in their neighborhood in Sacramento, California, during election season. Her childhood dream was to become a marine biologist, but after earning a bachelor’s degree in environmental science from Trinity College in Hartford, she took a job with NextGen America. That job profoundly altered her career path. Founded by Tom Steyer in 2013, NextGen works to turn out millions of young people to vote on issues that matter to them. As senior advocacy manager and Pennsylvania state director at NextGen, Thomas realized she could combine her interest in political action and the environment.

“We worked to motivate young people to vote and help them understand the consequences of the election, particularly as it related to climate,” she said. “I became focused on how to create conditions so that voters will feel compelled to want to take action on environmental issues.”

After leaving NextGen America, Thomas went on to advise several presidential candidates on climate policy, including former Washington Governor Jay Inslee, whose campaign focused almost exclusively on environmental and climate issues, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

In 2021, she was hired to build President Biden’s newly created Office of Domestic Climate Policy where she implemented the IRA and infrastructure act that created more than 300,000 clean energy jobs.

One of the accomplishments she is most proud of was launching the American Climate Corps, which was established to employ young Americans in clean energy, conservation, and climate resilience jobs. The funding for the Corps was removed in the final IRA legislation but Thomas built the program without any new money from Congress. By 2024, the corps had put 20,000 young people to work in the field.

While her positions focused on policy, Thomas said she learned that there are many paths to decarbonizing the economy.

“One of the big things I learned being in the White House is that there are a lot of different ways to wield power. It’s not just about Congress,” she said. “The climate is built on fluid systems, and we shouldn’t just take the same approaches as in the past.”

Thomas gave birth to a son on Christmas Day in 2024, and she said the desire to build a cleaner, greener world for him has given her renewed energy to tackle climate issues in her work now and in the future..

“In my positions, I wrote talking points about the work we have to do for future generations and that work hits home a little differently now — it’s about the world my son is going to grow up in,” Thomas said.

Since his birth, Thomas has been consulting for clean energy industry and climate-related philanthropy, and she remains optimistic, despite tough obstacles.

“We have more barriers than we did last year, but I do believe we are going to turn a corner. My work is helping to make that pivot and think about where the opportunities are now,” she said. “We’re already seeing cities, states, tribes, and the private sector coming together. We need to be as creative as possible. We need to constantly be thinking outside the box.”",https://environment.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_1200x630/public/2025-10/M-Thomas_2025_16x9.jpg?h=d1cb525d&itok=Em1919Z9,N,,2025-10-24 18:04:53.211958

In the energy sector especially, entrepreneurs eager to expand local operations face mounting costs, delayed permits and aging infrastructure. These barriers don’t just stall innovation — they hold California back. Federal permitting reform would unleash private investment, accelerate critical projects across all energy sources and deliver broad community and economic benefits. It’s time for Congress to act.

California is facing a harsh reality: energy prices have surged in recent years and may continue climbing. Over the last decade, electricity costs have nearly doubled, soaring 96 percent. In fact, Californians now face the second most expensive energy prices in the entire nation. These increases are simply not something our residents can manage as they already face some of the highest cost of living averages in the country.

These price hikes are happening simultaneously with energy demands that are rising to record highs driven by the rise of AI and advanced manufacturing. These industries promise enormous economic opportunity, but they’re also straining electric grids already pushed to their limits. Yet, as our need for reliable energy grows, permitting uncertainty and delays nationwide continue to halt investment.

The path to solving these issues is clear: empower innovative companies to unleash American energy production and capacity in every corner of the country. Unfortunately, our current system — slow, outdated, and mired in red tape — makes that almost impossible. Bipartisan, common-sense reforms are already on the table in Congress. Enacting them would be a major step toward meeting our energy needs, strengthening grid reliability, and lowering costs for consumers.

Chief among these reforms is an update to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) — a law passed decades ago that has yet to be meaningfully modernized. While its original intent was noble, NEPA’s vague and outdated provisions have turned it into the most litigated environmental law in the country. Too often, projects that could deliver more reliable energy are tied up in lawsuits that last years. Congress has the power to restore NEPA’s original purpose by focusing reviews on real environmental impacts, establishing proportional timelines, and curbing endless litigation.

Another major challenge lies in the misuse of the Clean Water Act (CWA). While the CWA plays a vital role in safeguarding our nation’s water resources, it has increasingly been used to delay or block critical development projects not over genuine environmental concerns, but to advance unrelated ideological agendas. Protecting our natural resources is no place for partisan politics. Congress must act to curb these abuses by clarifying the scope of the CWA and establishing clear project timelines that give both developers and regulators the certainty they need.

Faster, smarter permitting isn’t just good policy — it’s good for California workers, consumers, and families. It would create jobs, accelerate infrastructure developments, lower energy costs and make our grid more dependable. It would also strengthen America’s energy security at a time when global competitors like China are racing ahead.

Our congressional delegation has the power to advocate for real, long overdue change. Californians are desperate for reliable and affordable energy, and they are counting on their representatives in Congress to push for durable reforms. By cutting red tape and modernizing outdated laws, Congress can help unlock California’s full potential while preserving the environmental safeguards we all value.

The Broadwing Energy facility, located in Decatur, Illinois, is set to have more than 400 megawatts of generating capacity and will be able to capture approximately 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions for permanent underground storage.

The project is also Google's first collaboration with Low Carbon Infra, a portfolio company of infrastructure investor I Squared Capital, to develop CCS facilities across the US.

""Today, Google is taking a major leap forward to unlock the next generation of advanced clean energy technology, through a new agreement to support a first-of-its-kind gas power plant with carbon capture and storage,"" says Kate Brandt, Google's Chief Sustainability Officer.

Industrial site uses existing infrastructure

The power plant will be constructed at an industrial facility operated by Archer Daniels Midland, which has nearly a decade of experience storing CO₂ from ethanol production.

The carbon dioxide that is captured at the site will then be permanently stored in ADM's adjacent EPA-approved Class VI sequestration facilities, more than a mile underground.

Google has committed to purchasing the lion’s share of the electricity generated by the plant, where commercial operation is slated to begin in early 2030.

The project is expected to create around 750 full-time jobs over the next four years and will support dozens of permanent positions once operational.

The growing prominence of carbon capture and storage

CCS is a sophisticated form of technology that is able to capture CO₂ from power plants or industrial facilities and store it permanently underground.

Both the IEA and the IPCC have identified CCS as a valuable tool for reducing emissions from power generation and carbon-intensive industries, like steel manufacturing and cement production.

“Through this partnership, Low Carbon Infra and Google are joining forces on Broadwing Energy in Decatur, Illinois, our first in a series of carbon capture and storage projects,” says Jonathan Wiens, CEO of Low Carbon Infrastructure.

“The project marks a major step forward in demonstrating how industrial and power sector decarbonisation can work together to meet growing energy needs sustainably,” he adds.

Transparency measures and performance standards

The Broadwing project is set to incorporate a newly released standard for CCS-specific Energy Attribute Certificates, developed by industry experts to ensure that the quantification of emissions is as accurate as possible.

Google and Low Carbon Infra intend to use their collaboration to advance technical and operational improvements, including raising CO₂ capture rates and improving system performance and economics.

""It was a privilege to lead this deal and collaborate with an extraordinary internal team and forward-thinking partners,"" explains Donna Calderon, Senior Lead for Energy Strategy at Google.

The company has emphasised that transparency will be critical to ensure the environmental integrity of its CCS projects.

Growing energy demands and AI development

The announcement comes at a time when technology companies need more energy than ever, with the rise of AI and the expansion of data centres dependent on huge levels of electricity.

In 2024, Google revealed that five of its AI-powered products helped users collectively reduce an estimated 26 million metric tonnes of CO₂, which is roughly equivalent to emissions from the annual energy use of over 3.5 million US homes.

The company views this CCS investment as part of a broader strategy to harness AI's potential while also managing the associated energy demands through diverse clean energy technologies.

“We’re proud to be building a diverse portfolio of advanced clean technologies, which together are helping create a bright energy future for people everywhere,” says Kate.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/62f4b3cc0a227ff5745a5364152b8e9b:05935d419bfeb785f348cdfebc585f2d/broadwing-energy-center-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 20:17:58.652583

If the governor does declare an energy emergency, it would allow immediate state intervention and expand the city's available resources, McNally said.
The primary goals of state intervention would be to stabilize SOBE's system and ensure reliable heat for the community.
McNally also regarded the current ""replacement boiler"" as ""wholly inadequate"" in her letter to the governor.
Youngstown city officials are also asking the state for emergency funding for the SOBE plant.","State Representative Lauren McNally (D-Youngstown) and Youngstown Mayor Tito Brown penned letters to Ohio Governor Mike DeWine Thursday, seeking help with what Representative McNally called an ""ongoing crisis with SOBE Thermal LLC financial and service issues.""

McNally says she is asking the governor to use his power to declare an energy emergency in Youngstown.

If the governor does declare an energy emergency, it would allow immediate state intervention and expand the city's available resources, McNally said. The primary goals of state intervention would be to stabilize SOBE's system and ensure reliable heat for the community. McNally added that a long-term plan is also necessary for further oversight and accountability.

“My city has fought too hard to rebuild its downtown only to be left freezing in the dark — again. This is not just a utility issue; this is about public safety, economic stability, and basic human dignity,"" McNally said.

In his letter, Mayor Brown says that approximately 90 residents and 27 commercial businesses rely on the steam heat provided by the plant, and that the ""inadequacy and failure"" of SOBE's services ""continues to wreck untold injury and economic harm upon SOBE's customers and, indeed, upon the infrastructure of the City of Youngstown itself.""

In her letter to Governor DeWine, McNally included a timeline dating back to January of 2021 when a petition for purchase was filed, resulting in the acquisition of one boiler rather than two. The timeline concludes with a September 18, 2025 entry which stated the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO)'s ""Finding and Order"" acknowledged multiple violations of statutory requirements to provide reliable thermal services.

McNally also regarded the current ""replacement boiler"" as ""wholly inadequate"" in her letter to the governor. She says reports from tenants confirm that replacement boiler is providing little to no heat.

""We are on the doorstep of winter. If this continues, pipes will freeze, businesses will close, and people will face unsafe living conditions. Youngstown cannot afford another drawn-out receivership or bureaucratic delay,"" McNally wrote.

Additionally, Mayor Brown says in his letter to state officials, although the circumstances the city is now facing were not thought of when discussing public utility laws, the time to address them is now.

""The notion that the sole means of production of a public utility may be rendered inoperable due to mechanical failure or to inadequacy of service remains preposterous. Such circumstances seemingly existed beyond the contemplation of lawmakers and officials when drafting Ohio's public utilities laws. But they exist here and now and must be addressed.""

McNally's full letter to Governor DeWine is attached below.

Youngstown city officials are also asking the state for emergency funding for the SOBE plant.

In a letter to state officials, the city is asking for emergency relief funds, if SOBE would once again experience issues with its boiler, or any other problems that would hinder them from providing services.

""It is a rather urgent matter, winter's upon us, temperatures are dropping and we need this to happen quickly,"" Senior Assistant Law Director Jason Small told 21 News.

The city says when it comes to other sources of funding, it's the state's responsibility to provide them with alternatives.

Faster deployment of data centers is almost certainly bad for the climate.

The rule, announced Thursday night by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, asserts the federal government’s authority over matters now controlled by states and utilities. In doing so, utilities would lose some of their ability to manage the pace of development and profit from that development.

“To usher in a new era of American prosperity, we must ensure all Americans and domestic industries have access to affordable, reliable, and secure electricity,” Wright said in a letter announcing the proposal. “To do this, large loads, including AI data centers, served by public utilities must be able to connect to the transmission system in a timely, orderly, and non-discriminatory manner.”

Wright is directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to initiate a rulemaking process and finalize the rule by April 30.

Faster deployment of data centers is almost certainly bad for the climate. The growth of these massive computing facilities is driving a rapid increase in electricity demand, which, when combined with the Trump administration’s promotion of fossil fuels, casts doubt on the prospects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector.

But there is also broad acknowledgement that the current system for connecting new projects to the grid has deep flaws, with long delays and economic harm.

From a business perspective, utility companies would be the big losers.

“The rule would deny utilities billions in easy money,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, in an email. “Data centers are a generational opportunity for utilities, in part because new data centers require transmission upgrades.”

The rule would undermine this by allowing developers to finance their own upgrades, reducing utilities’ ability to pursue projects that would boost their profits, he said.

It would not be surprising if utilities fight the rule at FERC and then in the courts. But the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for utilities, is revealing little about its plan for dealing with the proposed rule.

“We share the administration’s commitment to American energy dominance and appreciate their leadership to accelerate energy to win the AI race and fuel our economy,” said Drew Maloney, the institute’s president and CEO, in a statement. “We look forward to working with FERC to strengthen the grid, drive down costs for customers, and improve reliability across our country.”

Wright’s letter argues that the rule is a narrow expansion of federal authority. He then lists 14 principles that describe how this authority would work.

The rule would apply to projects with electricity demand of at least 20 megawatts, which is roughly equivalent to the demand of a town of 10,000 to 20,000 people. It focuses on so-called hybrid projects, which are large power users built alongside power plants. The letter doesn’t specify whether certain power plant technologies would receive favorable treatment.

The proposal aims to streamline the planning process for large power users to gain approval for grid connections. Instead of potentially lengthy waits, which could last a year or more, Wright is asking FERC to consider a shortened 60-day timeline. But he specifies that this accelerated timetable would apply only to projects that are “curtailable,” which means they are capable of adjusting their power demand as needed.

As energy policy experts review the rule, a recurring theme is that it could mark a major shift in the federal government’s approach to managing the grid, but the full implications are not yet clear.

The rule “inserts FERC in a pretty central way into an issue that the regions are really struggling with,” said Jeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, a coalition that includes data center developers and other large businesses on issues related to the grid and electricity prices. “I think it’s a big deal because it’s federal leadership to try to set some rules of the road here that we haven’t had in a focused way to date.”

Dennis worked at the Department of Energy during the Biden administration and at FERC during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.

He said it would be premature to predict how this rule would affect carbon emissions. In some ways, it could help slow the growth of emissions, he said, because it gives large power users greater ability to build their own power plants, and many of the companies building data centers have commitments to use zero-emission energy sources. But his larger point is that the rule’s direct impact on U.S. climate policy is limited.

Mike Haugh, a policy director at Advanced Energy United, a trade group for clean energy companies, said he sees potential for this rule to help expedite grid connections for renewable energy and energy conservation systems.

“Realistically, they aren’t asking for anything all that crazy,” he said.

Others are more pessimistic about the implications.

“Pushing FERC to rubber-stamp connections in just 60 days while the government’s shut down and Trump builds a $300 million White House ballroom shows how out of touch his administration is from everyday Americans,” said Camden Weber, climate and energy policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “As families struggle with skyrocketing utility bills and exorbitant grocery costs, Trump wants to serve Big Tech a feast and expects the rest of us to eat AI slop.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226519690-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 17:19:33.911932

“What we’re looking at now is really our attempt to meet the growing needs of the region with these data centers coming online,” Wilson said.","Homeowners, business owners and renters across the valley may have noticed an atypical increase in their electricity bills this month, in part, due to the high-energy demand of data centers across the Northwest powering artificial intelligence.

Lower Valley Energy’s about 8% average price increase comes alongside the onset of winter, the highest energy use season of the year.

“The impact might even seem greater than the average 7.9% because it’s so cold here for so long,” said Brian Tanabe with the cooperative. “We have the cheapest product in the country, but we use a lot of it.”

LVE is the county’s sole energy provider and Tanabe said their rates are still likely among the nation’s lowest, even with the increase.

Wyomingites pay about 14 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for residential electricity, according to 2025 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The cheapest power was in Nevada and Nebraska, paying less than 13 cents per kWh and the most expensive was in Hawaii, nearing 40 cents per kWh. He’s personally paying about $10 more this October than last for his home’s energy.

“I don’t want to downplay 7.9%. That is an increase that will be noticed for sure,” he said.

The member-owned co-op’s August decision came after the recommendations of a third-party cost analysis that found they’re paying more to buy and transmit power as prices surge across the country. Part of that increase needed to be passed along to the consumer, he said.

“We were experiencing a lot of pressure just procuring the power for our Lower Valley Energy membership,” Tanabe said.

Bonneville Power Administration provides the majority of LVE’s energy and recently raised its transmission and wholesale rates by about 14%.

The Oregon-based federal agency is legally required to cover its cost through its rates, which reflect many factors like inflation and operations.

This blog post provides an overview of New York’s proposed program and compares it with California’s MRR.
While the specific thresholds and verification requirements vary between California’s MRR and New York’s proposed program, the two programs are similar in scope.
Conclusion While New York’s proposed Mandatory Reporting Program mirrors California’s longstanding MRR, there are some differences in the two programs’ requirements.","While the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is proposing to amend the federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (“GHGRP”) to remove reporting requirements for nearly all sources, it remains important for companies to track developments and manage their compliance obligations with existing and emerging state GHG reporting programs. Several states, such as California, already have some form of mandatory GHG reporting in place. Others are introducing similar programs to take effect over the next several years.

In particular, New York is expected to finalize a rule establishing a Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The state announced its proposal in spring 2025 and public comments closed on July 1. New York’s program appears to be similar to both the federal GHGRP (which EPA will likely roll back) and California’s Mandatory Reporting Regulation (“MRR”) and applies to companies with significant direct emissions from facilities located in New York state and fuels and electricity consumed within the state. This blog post provides an overview of New York’s proposed program and compares it with California’s MRR.

While the specific thresholds and verification requirements vary between California’s MRR and New York’s proposed program, the two programs are similar in scope. Whether an entity is subject to the requirements depends on the type of entity and the amount of GHG the entity emits. Further, each of these programs is distinct from California’s climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, which apply broadly to companies that do business in California and exceed certain annual revenue thresholds. (See our most recent blog post on the climate disclosure laws here.)

New York’s Proposed GHG Reporting Program: Overview and Comparison with California’s Longstanding MRR

New York’s proposed regulation would require entities responsible for emissions in New York to monitor their annual GHG emissions and report those emissions to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”). If the regulation is finalized as expected, the first reports will be due June 1, 2027 for emissions data collected in 2026. The proposed program is for data collection only; it does not impose any requirements to reduce GHG emissions or obtain emissions allowances. However, according to an FAQ document issued by NYSDEC, the reporting regulation is part of a broader plan to implement a cap-and-invest program, which the state plans to develop in the future.

New York’s program is very similar to California’s MRR. Created in 2007, the MRR also requires facilities located in California, as well as suppliers of transportation fuels and electricity consumed within California, to monitor and report their annual GHG emissions. California adopted the MRR prior to establishing its Cap-and-Trade Program, and the data from the MRR is used to implement the Cap-and-Trade Program.

Covered Entities

While the California MRR and New York’s program are similar in scope, there are some slight differences in the specific criteria for who must report. In general, both programs require some entities to report regardless of their emissions levels and require other entities to report if they emit 10,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year. Below is a table summarizing the requirements for certain types of entities.

Verification Requirements

In general, both California’s MRR and New York’s program require verification of data only for entities that emit 25,000 MT CO2e or more per year.

California allows certain entities to submit an abbreviated report if they emit less than 25,000 MT CO2e per year, do not have a compliance obligation under the Cap-and-Trade Program, and are not subject to the federal GHGRP requirements for certain sectors. See Cal. Code Pub. Health § 95103(a).

Under New York’s proposed regulation, entities must verify their emissions data if they qualify as a “large emissions source.” This generally includes facilities with emissions located in New York that emit 25,000 MT or more of CO2e per year. The proposed regulation specifies that the following also qualify as a large emissions source and are subject to the verification requirement:

Suppliers of natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and compressed natural gas that supply more than 15 million cubic feet per year;

Liquid fuel and petroleum product suppliers that supply more than 100,000 gallons of affected liquid fuels per year;

Coal suppliers that supply more than 500 U.S. tons of coal per year;

Waste haulers and transporters that emit more than 25,000 MT CO2e per year, including the sum of emissions reported for out-of-state landfill facilities and out-of-state combustion facilities for all waste exported out of New York State.

Contrasting New York’s Proposed Program with California’s Climate Disclosure Laws

The scope and coverage of both California’s MRR and New York’s proposed program are distinct from California’s climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, which passed in 2023 and have reporting requirements set to begin in 2026. Those laws require many corporate entities, regardless of the sector in which they operate and the location in which their emissions occur, to disclose their GHG emissions and climate-related financial risk. SB 253 applies to U.S.-based entities doing business in California with more than $1 billion in annual revenue and requires those companies to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2026 and Scope 3 emissions in 2027. SB 261 applies to U.S.-based entities doing business in California with more than $500 million in annual revenue and requires those companies to report their climate-related financial risks, with the first reports due on January 1, 2026. For more details about implementation of the laws, please read our previous post covering key takeaways from California Air Resources Board’s public workshop on implementation. We also published posts spotlighting SB 253 and SB 261 when the California legislature originally passed them, as well as an alert detailing the 2024 amendments to the laws.

Similar bills have been introduced in Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Washington state; thus far, none have passed.

Conclusion

While New York’s proposed Mandatory Reporting Program mirrors California’s longstanding MRR, there are some differences in the two programs’ requirements. And because the proposed program uses a reporting threshold framework that is distinct from climate disclosure laws like California’s SB 253 and SB 261, companies will need to carefully assess its applicability and requirements, as well as its potential interaction with other laws.

In that period, the parties will jointly select a project manager and evaluate construction providers that would be used in resuming construction of the two nuclear units.
“Brookfield came to Santee Cooper with a proposal that set out the path to turn our prior nuclear investment into lasting value for our customers and all South Carolinians,” said Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy.

The letter of intent establishes a six-week initial project feasibility period. In that period, the parties will jointly select a project manager and evaluate construction providers that would be used in resuming construction of the two nuclear units.

The six weeks also would allow for advanced discussions with entities interested in buying nuclear power generated by the units and facilitate additional due diligence, leading to execution of a Memorandum of Understanding.

“Brookfield came to Santee Cooper with a proposal that set out the path to turn our prior nuclear investment into lasting value for our customers and all South Carolinians,” said Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy. “Our goals include completing these reactors with private money and no ratepayer or taxpayer expense, delivering financial relief to our customers and gaining significant additional power capacity for South Carolina. Brookfield’s proposal would do just that, and the company has the financial capability to stand behind its proposal.”

“We thank Governor Henry McMaster and the South Carolina General Assembly members who were instrumental in encouraging Santee Cooper to conduct this bidding process,” said Santee Cooper President and CEO Jimmy Staton. “As we move closer to a final deal, our goal remains the same: to enable completion of these two units and thus provide 2,200 MW of carbon-free, reliable nuclear power that delivers energy security for South Carolina and specific benefits to Santee Cooper customers who are paying our initial investment.”

Staton noted that Santee Cooper’s strategic decision to maintain the equipment over the past eight years positions the Fairfield units for a quicker and less costly path to completion. “The state of the units, and the fact that they use the same Westinghouse AP1000 technology that is now operating in Georgia and overseas, make these assets very attractive to the nuclear power industry.”

One key element of resuming construction is the continued involvement of Westinghouse Electric Co., which designed and owns the AP 1000 technology. “Brookfield is a majority owner of Westinghouse, which added to their proposal,” Staton said.

With surging residential and industrial customer demand, and with the support of state leaders, last year Santee Cooper recognized a potential opportunity to sell the assets to a third party who would complete the unfinished nuclear units, it noted.

The utility launched a competitive bidding process in January 2025, receiving initial expressions of interest from over 70 potential bidders and 15 formal proposals.

Working with industry experts, Santee Cooper developed key financial, risk mitigation and execution criteria by which the final proposals were measured.

Santee Cooper said completion of the two units could:

• Generate thousands of temporary construction jobs.

• Generate hundreds of highly skilled, permanent operational jobs.

• Strengthen and diversify South Carolina’s energy portfolio.

• Enhance grid reliability.

• Help attract new industries, bringing more jobs and other economic benefits.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-24 17:19:40.852445

SWEPCO submitted a request with the Arkansas Public Service Commission in March to raise residential rates by 27.3%.
Under state law, utilities may increase rates by 4% annually without filing a formal rate case, according to Arkansas Public Service Commission filings.
For example, Fayetteville's municipal cost would likely see about a $190,000 a year impact with the proposed rate increase, Nierengarten said.
COMMUNICATION URGED Speakers on Thursday's panel encouraged residents to leave a public comment about the SWEPCO rate case.","FAYETTEVILLE -- If a requested rate increase by Southwestern Electric Power Co. is implemented, Fayetteville alone would see a $15 million per year impact across all businesses and residents, members of the public were told during a panel discussion Thursday.

Fayetteville Environmental Director Peter Nierengarten made the claim during the nonprofit, nonpartisan Citizens Climate Lobby panel discussion at the Fayetteville Public Library. The event was focused on rising utility rates.

Other speakers on the panel included Riley Gambill, a volunteer for the Citizen Climate Lobby; David Stitt, the president and chief executive for Stitt Energy Systems; Virginia Paschal, senior associate of regulatory affairs at Cordelio Power; and Fort Smith Mayor George McGill.

The ongoing Southwestern Electric Power Co. rate case was the primary discussion topic used an example of rising utility rates affecting Northwest Arkansas residents.

Southwestern Electric Power, or SWEPCO, is owned by Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power. SWEPCO has about 126,000 customers in far west and Northwest Arkansas and serves a total of 547,800 customers across its entire service area, which includes parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas.

SWEPCO submitted a request with the Arkansas Public Service Commission in March to raise residential rates by 27.3%. This would be about a $30.46 increase to residential electric bills each month, according to SWEPCO's commission filings.

Commercial and municipal rates would see about a 20%-40% increase, according to Nierengarten.

Under state law, utilities may increase rates by 4% annually without filing a formal rate case, according to Arkansas Public Service Commission filings.

The rate increases would provide about a $136 million retail revenue increase, according to the filings.

The increases would fund various projects including a new wind project, grid resilience, converting a coal plant in Texas to natural gas and improvements for the Flint Creek Coal Plant in Benton County, according to Nierengarten.

Walmart, the University of Arkansas' Board of Trustees, the city of Fayetteville, the National Audubon Society and the Sierra Club have all intervened in the docket before the Public Service Commission.

Melissa Gage, the utility's vice president of regulatory and finance, said in a statement earlier this year that SWEPCO was requesting the rate increase, ""not just as a necessity, but as a strategic investment in the future of reliable and sustainable energy for Arkansas.""

FAYETTEVILLE'S OPPOSITION

Fayetteville is specifically objecting to the $31 million that would be used for improvements to the Flint Creek Coal Plant, according to Nierengarten.

""The cost of renewables, the cost of clean energy, over the past 10 years has come down significantly, and all of those alternatives are much more cost effective for generating electricity than coal,"" he said Thursday. ""And so, as SWEPCO continues to invest money in the coal plant and continues to generate electricity from that coal plant, it's at the detriment of us, their ratepayers, because that electricity is more expensive to produce and that ultimately has to be passed on to us, their ratepayers.""

The continuation of the use of coal is contrary to Fayetteville's clean energy goals as well as the city's goals to reduce financial pressure on residents, Nierengarten said.

""The city is trying to be, as much as possible, sensitive to rising utility costs, and I think we saw that with our efforts to wrap our water and sewer improvements into the bond so that we don't have to increase water and sewer rates as much,"" he said. ""Maintaining low rates is part of the city's holistic affordability strategy for Fayetteville, and I think that's one of the main reasons we're intervening in this rate case is because we see this 27% amount that SWEPCO wants to increase undermining our strategy to hold our utility rates low for our residents and businesses.""

Residents are already dealing with rising costs of food, housing, health care and transportation. An electric rate increase that would add almost $400 to a resident's bill each year on top of that is too much, Nierengarten said in an interview Wednesday.

""Behind those bills are real people, families trying to stretch their paycheck, seniors living on fixed income, small business owners planning for an uncertain future,"" Sterling Smith, a Citizens Climate Lobby volunteer, said Thursday.

ALTERNATIVES

Stitt and Paschal spoke Thursday to two primary alternatives to coal that would decrease prices significantly: solar and wind energy.

For example, Fayetteville's municipal cost would likely see about a $190,000 a year impact with the proposed rate increase, Nierengarten said. However, a solar array project in southwest Arkansas the city is a part of would offset the cost to be closer to a $20,000 a year impact, he added.

Though wind and solar are significantly less expensive, it is difficult to get utility companies to make the change, Paschal said.

""The primary issue is that utilities don't make as much money off of the solar and wind as they do coal plants because their rate of return is based off of what they're paying for each month,"" she said. ""So the more that they invest in something, or the more that they pay for -- fuel is a big example of that, they're paying for coal, they're paying for gas -- they get a steady rate of return on that.""

The companies get a steady rate of return on things like coal and gas, but wind and solar are free so there is not a number for them to get a rate of the turn on and they would not make the same amount of money as if they remain with the more expensive option, according to Paschal.

COMMUNICATION URGED

Speakers on Thursday's panel encouraged residents to leave a public comment about the SWEPCO rate case.

There were 114 public comments as of Friday morning, all in opposition. Nierengarten said a rate case typically receives about 20.

A public hearing for the case will be held on Dec. 4 at Northwest Arkansas Community College in Springdale as well.

The panel also suggested contacting state representatives.

State legislation from the past two years is also a likely reason for increased utility rates, according to Nierengarten.

Over the past two legislative sessions strict restrictions have been placed on both solar and wind, Paschal said. The legislation on wind turbines has made it nearly impossible to build a project, she said.

""If we can change policy, we can keep rates down, but we have to take some ownership in that, and that's by doing things at your home or business,"" Stitt said.

He encouraged people to get creative and to start small.

""If you currently today have 100% of your energy coming from the grid and you're going to be 100% subject to a 27.3% energy price increase, what if you had three solar panels in your house or five or something, every little bit you get from an alternative source lowers your risk,"" he said.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211370346_FZ-CLIMATE-LOBBY-10-25-rgb_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-10-24 18:05:51.805170

Starting in 2026, Michiganders will pay $260 to register an electric vehicle (EV) and $110 to register a hybrid vehicle. That's up $100 for an EV and up $50 for a hybrid. Plus, depending on the vehicle's classification, drivers can pay up to $100 more for registration of trucks and buses.

The changes to the registration fees were a consequence of how gasoline and diesel will be taxed starting on Jan. 1, 2026.

Registration fees for electric and hybrid vehicles are tied to Michigan's motor fuel tax on gasoline and diesel. Whenever the tax rises, so do the annual registration fees for those vehicles, which are collected by the Secretary of State.

The annual state budget, passed in early October, is set to change how some taxes on gasoline and diesel will be levied next year.

On Jan. 1, there will be no more sales tax on gasoline and diesel; however, the cost to Michiganders at the pump won't change much, if at all. That's because the 6% general sales tax on gasoline and diesel was removed, but then replaced with a relatively equal amount of motor fuel tax. Michiganders will soon be paying 51 cents per gallon in motor fuel tax instead of the previous 31 cents per gallon, making up for the loss of the general sales tax.

Under Michigan law, motor fuel tax revenue goes directly to the Michigan Transportation Fund (MTF), which is the main collection and distribution fund for state transportation revenue. Essentially, the MTF is the main source of money used in road maintenance and repair.",https://media.wtol.com/assets/WZZM/images/cb19a523-fa25-4561-83ef-a117d61615f3/20250124T150830/cb19a523-fa25-4561-83ef-a117d61615f3_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 17:19:45.946208

AES Indiana will file its long-term plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission next week.","The electric utility that serves Indianapolis is prepared to add a lot of natural gas to serve data centers that move into its territory. AES Indiana went over its plan for the next decade and a half with stakeholders Wednesday.

If the company signs contracts with data centers, it plans to build a 700 megawatt natural gas plant — roughly the size of its Eagle Valley facility. It would also add about the same amount of megawatts in gas peaker plants — which only run when energy demand is high.

Patrick Maguire is senior director of commercial with AES. He said because no data center has officially contracted with the utility, it's too early to say how AES would cover the cost of new gas to serve them.

""We're approaching all discussions with potential data center customers carefully and with the goal to protect existing customers, however we proceed,"" Maguire said.

NIPSCO and Indiana Michigan Power have taken different approaches to help shield their customers from rate increases.

All together, the plan for data centers could increase AES's carbon emissions by nearly 70 percent. AES is already working to convert part of its Petersburg coal plant to natural gas by the end of next year.

The move to more natural gas marks a change from what AES proposed three years ago, which called for mostly wind and solar.

Megan Anderson is with the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign in Indiana.

""It's really disheartening to see that AES Indiana is exploring building gas — and only gas — to power data centers. And, you know, likely much of those costs will fall on to customers,"" she said.

Anderson said she's concerned a law passed this year to expedite power for data centers would mean less of a chance for the public to weigh in.

Maguire said the utility did consider a scenario to serve data centers with all clean energy sources, but that it wasn't as cost-effective for customers.

The utility's parent company, AES Corporation, aims to have net zero emissions from electricity sales by 2040 and go net zero entirely by 2050.

With or without data centers, AES plans to build battery storage and work on energy efficiency and what's called ""demand response."" That's where a utility offers incentives to some residents or businesses to use less power when the demand for electricity is high — which helps prevent blackouts.

Louisiana Economic Development officials this morning announced a $277 million investment by Aclara Resources Inc. to build the facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish.

LED characterizes the deal as one that will “establish Louisiana as a leader in sustainable rare earth production and strengthen the nation’s advanced technology supply chain.” With the new facility comes an anticipated 140 new direct new jobs.

LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois says the investment “underscores the importance of development-ready sites and strong local partnerships that give global companies the confidence to choose Louisiana,” also noting that it reinforces the central role Louisiana plays in energy and defense security.

Bloomberg reports that Aclara, in which the Hochschild Group owns a majority stake, has a $1 billion-plus plan to mine rare earths in Latin America and develop processing facilities.

The Louisiana project comes as President Donald Trump is focused on enhancing critical mineral-supply chains, currently dominated by China. The media outlet reported this morning that the Louisiana plant’s capacity for minerals dysprosium and terbium would represent about 14% of China’s official output.

The new facility will use Aclara’s proprietary sustainable extraction technology to produce the heavy rare earth elements essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones and robotics, which rely on advanced permanent magnets. By processing material from Aclara’s mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile, the Louisiana operation is expected to create a “reliable and sustainable” U.S. supply of these materials, LED says.

Last month, Aclara secured funding from the U.S. government for a Brazilian mining project.

In a statement, Gov. Jeff Landry said that in choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, “Aclara is recognizing what we already know: Our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation.”

Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa noted in the announcement that Louisiana’s access to key reagents made the location preferable, ensuring operational reliability and lower transportation costs.

“The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling,” Barúa added. “Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-10-24 20:03:48+00:00,www.ans.org,Leading the charge: INL's role in advancing HALEU production - American Nuclear Society,Not Available,,,,,https://www.ans.org/news/article-7387/leading-the-charge-inls-role-in-advancing-haleu-production/,"Shortly after the nuclear energy industry identified the need to quickly develop a sustainable HALEU supply, INL began providing HALEU for small research activities, such as collecting performance data on new HALEU fuel types.
HALEU is essential for numerous advanced reactor designs—including fast reactors, molten salt reactors, and microreactors—and is a key component in TRISO fuel.
Longer term, deployment of advanced reactors requires a much larger and continuous supply of HALEU to meet commercial industry needs.
“A domestic supply of HALEU is critical to the deployment of advanced reactors,” said Jess Gehin, associate laboratory director for INL’s Nuclear Science and Technology directorate.
Treating the EBR-­II used fuel elements with this method creates high-­quality HALEU that meets the needs of some advanced reactor developer designs.","INL is tackling this challenge in part by providing small quantities of HALEU to companies with near-­term research needs and by converting used fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-­II into larger amounts of usable HALEU for first-­of-­a-­kind advanced reactors. This work is intended to help meet the nation’s near-­ and mid-­term HALEU needs while the long-­term commercial HALEU supply chain is being established.

“We are trying to satisfy the immediate needs of the nuclear industry with our focus on short-­term and mid-­term goals,” said Josh Jarrell, director of INL’s Fuel Cycle Science and Technology Division.

Shortly after the nuclear energy industry identified the need to quickly develop a sustainable HALEU supply, INL began providing HALEU for small research activities, such as collecting performance data on new HALEU fuel types.

While recovery of uranium from EBR-­II used fuel has been ongoing for many years, that activity was accelerated to ensure HALEU was available to advanced reactor companies to meet their desired schedules.

The importance of HALEU

While the existing U.S. nuclear fleet uses uranium oxide fuel enriched up to 5 percent with uranium-­235, HALEU is enriched between 5 percent and 20 percent. HALEU is essential for numerous advanced reactor designs—including fast reactors, molten salt reactors, and microreactors—and is a key component in TRISO fuel. It can also significantly enhance the performance of current reactors.

There are two ways to obtain HALEU: enriching uranium to the desired level or downblending high-­enriched uranium from existing stockpiles that may have been recovered from used fuel.

Before making capital-­intensive investments in HALEU production capabilities, potential suppliers need confidence that there will be a reliable market for their product. In the near term, reactor developers require HALEU for research, fuel qualification, and first cores for demonstration reactors. Longer term, deployment of advanced reactors requires a much larger and continuous supply of HALEU to meet commercial industry needs.

“A domestic supply of HALEU is critical to the deployment of advanced reactors,” said Jess Gehin, associate laboratory director for INL’s Nuclear Science and Technology directorate. “There is an increased urgency as imports from Russia are no longer viable to support advanced reactors’ initial cores.”

While INL plays a pivotal role by jump-­starting the HALEU supply chain through its recovery and reuse efforts, several companies, including American Centrifuge Operating, General Matter, Louisiana Energy Services, and Orano Federal Services, are gearing up for commercial HALEU production.

Enabling innovation

In recent years, INL has provided HALEU for research and development use by repurposing surplus materials from various legacy programs. This effort involves identifying and processing suitable scrap HEU into the appropriate fuel forms for further irradiation testing, characterization, and data collection.

In 2023, INL facilitated the transfer of approximately 6 kilograms of HALEU to BWX Technologies for TRISO fuel development for the company’s BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR) project.

More recently, Southern Nuclear loaded nuclear fuel with uranium-­235 enriched up to 6 percent—higher than the usual 3–5 percent enrichment—into Vogtle-­2 to test it through irradiation. The fuel was developed as part of the DOE’s Accident Tolerant Fuel program. The pellets, which also include additives expected to enhance safety performance, were derived from uranium oxide (UO2) powder first prepared by INL.

Bridging the gap

In addition to directly providing small amounts of HALEU for research needs, INL is identifying surplus inventories of uranium scrap for conversion into useable HALEU.

“This [National Nuclear Security Administration]-­led scrap recovery program, which INL participates in, supports companies like Westinghouse for its eVinci microreactor, providing essential materials to continue their projects,” said Corey Shannon, who oversees INL’s HALEU scrap recovery efforts. “Over 80 kilograms of legacy fabrication scrap and other uranium forms are currently being stabilized, characterized, repackaged, and shipped for further processing.”

Along with the scrap recovery efforts that may provide hundreds of kilograms of HALEU, INL is going to provide reactor developers with thousands of kilograms of HALEU from EBR-­II used fuel recovery efforts funded through the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy.

EBR-­II operated at Argonne National Laboratory–West (now part of INL) from 1964 to 1994 and ran on high-­enriched nuclear fuel. As part of the deactivation of the reactor and management of the sodium-­bonded used fuel inventory, the irradiated elements have been undergoing a treatment process to neutralize the reactive sodium. This process enables the separation of uranium from the sodium and fission products, facilitating the recovery of the uranium.

“When EBR-­II shut down, there were 3 metric tons of used fuel containing [HEU], which is valuable because it can be recovered and diluted down to HALEU levels,” said Mike Patterson, program manager for used fuel treatment and disposition at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex.

The recovered HEU is diluted with lower-­enriched uranium (a process known as downblending) to create HALEU. Treating the EBR-­II used fuel elements with this method creates high-­quality HALEU that meets the needs of some advanced reactor developer designs.

“Since 2019, we expanded from four-­day weeks to seven-­day weeks and eventually to a 24-­hour schedule for four days a week,” said Patterson. “We will complete the EBR-­II driver treatment by the end of 2028, aligning with the HALEU demand schedule.”

Going commercial

In helping bridge the gap between the industry’s near-­term needs and a fully fledged HALEU industry, one of the key challenges is the compatibility of EBR-­II HALEU with various reactor designs. While the material is ideal for fast reactors like those developed by Santa Clara, Calif.–based Oklo, there are some impurities that require additional processing for use with light water reactors or thermal reactors.

“The current material from EBR-­II seems to be a good fit for Oklo’s reactor concepts but may not be compatible with some other advanced reactor applications,” said Patterson.

Once the EBR-II driver fuel elements have been treated, INL will have recovered enough material to produce just under 10 metric tons of HALEU, half of which is allocated to Oklo for use in its Aurora Powerhouse on the INL Site.

To increase the range of fuels and thus the number the nuclear developers that could benefit from the remaining HALEU, INL demonstrated in 2019 a “polishing” process on 3 kilograms of HALEU that purified and cleaned the material. The process also converted it from a metal into an oxide, making it suitable for broader applications, including as a feedstock for TRISO fuel.

The polished material was then sampled, and those samples were sent to BWXT, which confirmed that the material may be received at its facility for fuel processing.

“Now, INL is scaling this polishing process up and will use a new glovebox line to produce hundreds of kilograms of purified HALEU oxide per year beginning in 2028,” Jarrell said.

In April, the DOE announced conditional commitments to provide HALEU to five U.S. nuclear developers through its HALEU Availability Program. These commitments will help developers meet their near-­term fuel needs and advance innovative American nuclear technologies as a step closer to commercialization.

In June, Centrus Energy announced a milestone in its contract with the DOE: a shipment that marked the first significant domestic production of HALEU.

These investments aim to advance commercialization, with national laboratories playing a supporting part.

“The role of national laboratories like INL is critical in bridging the gap between reactor design and market readiness,” said Jarrell. “By providing essential HALEU supplies while the commercial HALEU supply chain is being established, national labs ensure that the nuclear industry can innovate and advance, ultimately leading to an abundant supply of affordable and reliable energy.”

Last week, the student newspaper at the University of Indiana Bloomington was barred from putting out a print edition, and its advisor was fired. The Indiana Daily Student, one of the best student newspapers in the country, was censored. The school proposed that this decision was due to budget issues, but denied any extra funding that was given to the newspaper. In the New York Times, one of the co-editors-in-chief of the paper, 21-year-old Andrew Miller, shared,

“The media school tries to construe this as a business decision, but fundamentally they are trying to tell us what we can and cannot print,” Miller said.

This was not a budgetary decision. Any obstruction of the freedom of the press, or any other infringement on the Bill of Rights, is illegal and pervasively wrong. But that doesn’t mean it’s not happening.

Perhaps you’ve read an earlier editorial of mine and heard my plea for ethical journalism or increased numbers of student reporters. This is not because the paper does not have enough writers, but because writers are increasingly scared to write for us in this current political climate.

Since my start at the paper, I have only seen an increase in fearmongering from outside parties and news outlets. I have seen larger newspapers than ours and The Indiana Daily Student bow their heads and compromise their journalistic values due to political pressures, especially from pressures given by the Trump administration.

Let me be clear: The Old Gold & Black would never compromise any of our values due to institutional pressure. However, as students, like the Indiana Student Daily, we are at the mercy of the University for funding and printing concerns. Wake Forest University has always worked with us, not against us, and understands the newspaper is important to the integrity of the campus. I hope it stays that way.

EPA.","Two former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency leaders joined students and community members at Duke University to speak on advancing environmental goals in the face of federal resistance to climate change regulation.

At an event celebrating the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability’s 20th anniversary on Thursday, former EPA Administrators William Reilly and Michael Regan discussed finding climate solutions.

Regan, who is now a distinguished fellow at Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, served from 2021 to 2024 under former President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This measure encouraged private sector, public sector, local and state governments, as well as households to invest in clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits and decarbonization efforts.

As a North Carolinian who also formerly served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Regan emphasized the importance of working with state leaders.

Regan said 70% of the EPA’s budget is passed through to the states. As a result, the agency is closely tied to state environmental departments, because the officials work together on strategic planning, setting priorities and measuring results.

“Most of those individuals at the state levels are the ones where the rubber meets the road, and they’re the ones that are having conversations with the private sector, with local communities, with environmental justice communities,” he said.

Former President George H. W. Bush appointed Reilly, who led the EPA from 1989 to 1993. Reilly now serves as chair of the Nicholas Institute’s advisory board.

Notably, Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a major revision to the original 1970 law. The amendments targeted three major threats to the environment and public health: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions, according to the EPA’s website.

In 1990, perception among members of Congress was that the EPA was “excessively oriented” toward regulation, Reilly said.

While the agency was initially popular during its inception in 1970, public support waned under the Reagan administration, which imposed budget cuts. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch resigned in 1983 because of an administrative scandal and another EPA official, Rita Lavelle, was convicted of lying to Congress.

To combat this and restore faith, the agency needed a new perspective, he said. The Bush administration worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop the clean air amendments and incorporate new ideas.

“We need to be more resourceful, more open to those kinds of approaches which have not really been tried before,” Reilly said.

A Duke student asked the pair how EPA leaders can continue to carry out their mission effectively while working under more narrow legal documents, such as West Virginia v. EPA. In that 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions in the power sector, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Regan said these Supreme Court cases force the EPA to be more creative in terms of protecting public health, and place restrictions on the level of authority the agency can give to regulators.

“We don’t need a ton of new regulations,” Regan said. “We need smart regulations that give flexibility so that markets and technologies can achieve those environmental goals.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_4387-1024x7681761336586.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=pUeNrRU0,N,,2025-10-24 17:00:12.128705

This essential component, required for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles, has remained largely dependent on overseas processing facilities until now.

The Essential Chemistry Behind Electric Vehicle Performance

Cobalt sulfate serves as a fundamental building block in nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery chemistry, the dominant technology powering most electric vehicles currently on North American roads. The material enhances battery performance through several critical mechanisms that distinguish it from alternative cathode chemistries.

Energy density advantages make cobalt-enhanced batteries particularly attractive for automotive applications. NMC batteries containing cobalt sulfate typically achieve energy densities between 150-250 Wh/kg, significantly higher than iron phosphate alternatives that max out around 160 Wh/kg. This density differential translates directly into extended driving range for electric vehicles, addressing one of consumers' primary concerns about EV adoption.

Thermal stability characteristics represent another crucial performance factor. Cobalt's presence in cathode materials helps prevent thermal runaway events that can lead to battery fires or explosions. Operating temperatures for cobalt-enhanced batteries remain stable up to 60°C, while some alternative chemistries begin degrading at 45°C.

Battery Chemistry Energy Density (Wh/kg) Thermal Stability Cycle Life Cost Factor NMC (with cobalt) 150-250 Excellent (60°C max) 1,000-2,000 cycles High LFP (iron phosphate) 90-160 Good (45°C max) 2,000-3,000 cycles Low NCA (nickel-cobalt-aluminum) 200-260 Very good (55°C max) 500-1,000 cycles Very high

Supply Chain Dependencies That Threaten Regional Security

North America's reliance on Asian cobalt sulfate processing facilities creates multiple vulnerability points that extend beyond simple logistics concerns. Furthermore, understanding critical minerals energy security reveals that approximately 85% of battery-grade cobalt sulfate consumed in North American battery manufacturing originates from facilities in China, Finland, and Belgium.

Geographic concentration risks became particularly evident during recent supply chain disruptions. When COVID-19 restrictions affected overseas production facilities in 2021, cobalt sulfate prices increased by 340% within six months, forcing several North American battery manufacturers to halt production lines temporarily.

Transportation logistics add additional complexity layers to overseas sourcing strategies. Maritime shipping delays from Asian ports to North American destinations averaged 28 days longer than normal during 2022, while freight costs increased by 180% compared to pre-pandemic levels. These disruptions highlighted the fragility of extended supply chains for critical battery materials.

The vulnerability of depending on overseas cobalt sulfate processing became starkly apparent when supply disruptions forced North American battery manufacturers to reduce production capacity by an estimated 15% during peak shortage periods.

How Electra's Ontario Facility Revolutionizes Continental Manufacturing

Technical Specifications Driving Market Transformation

North America's first cobalt sulfate refinery represents more than symbolic progress toward supply chain independence. The facility's technical specifications position it to address significant capacity gaps in regional battery material production.

Annual production capacity of 6,500 metric tons places the facility among medium-scale global producers, sufficient to supply cobalt sulfate for approximately one million electric vehicle batteries annually. This volume represents roughly 15% of current North American EV production capacity, creating meaningful impact on regional supply security.

Processing methodology employs hydrometallurgical techniques specifically designed for battery-grade material specifications. Moreover, the facility's purification systems can achieve cobalt sulfate purity levels exceeding 99.8%, meeting or surpassing automotive industry quality standards that typically require 99.5% minimum purity.

Quality control infrastructure includes real-time monitoring systems for impurity detection, particularly nickel and iron contamination that can degrade battery performance. Automated sampling equipment tests every production batch for compliance with ASTM International standards governing battery-grade cobalt sulfate specifications.

Strategic Positioning in Ontario's Industrial Corridor

Temiskaming Shores location provides multiple logistical advantages that enhance the facility's competitive positioning. The site sits approximately 500 kilometres from major automotive manufacturing centres in Southern Ontario, including facilities operated by General Motors, Ford, and several battery manufacturers.

Transportation infrastructure connections include rail access to Canadian National Railway networks, enabling efficient raw material delivery from Northern Ontario mining operations. Highway access via Ontario Routes 11 and 101 provides truck transportation alternatives for time-sensitive deliveries.

Regional workforce availability benefits from Northern Ontario's established mining industry expertise. The area maintains technical colleges and training programmes focused on metallurgical processing, providing access to skilled workers familiar with hydrometallurgical operations.

In addition, understanding how EVs transforming mining operations demonstrates the broader industry evolution. Utility infrastructure supports energy-intensive refining operations through connections to Ontario's electrical grid, which derives approximately 60% of generation capacity from carbon-free nuclear and hydroelectric sources.

Financial Structure Enabling North America's Cobalt Independence

Investment Components Supporting Long-term Viability

The $82 million total funding package represents a carefully structured combination of private investment, debt restructuring, and government support designed to minimise financial risk while ensuring operational sustainability.

Funding Source Amount (CAD) Structure Purpose Private Financing $34.5 million Equity/convertible debt Construction completion Debt Equitisation $40 million Balance sheet restructuring Operational flexibility Government Commitment $7.5 million Grant funding Infrastructure development Total Package $82 million Mixed instruments Full commissioning

Private investor participation validates commercial viability while providing growth capital for construction completion. The financing structure includes provisions for additional funding if expansion opportunities emerge, suggesting investor confidence in long-term market demand.

Debt restructuring elements address previous financial obligations while creating operational breathing room for the startup phase. Converting $40 million in existing debt to equity positions reduces ongoing interest payments and improves cash flow projections during initial production ramp-up.

Government Support Reflecting Strategic Priorities

Federal and provincial government backing demonstrates official recognition of cobalt sulfate production as a strategic national interest. Canadian government support aligns with the country's Critical Minerals Strategy, which identifies cobalt as essential for economic security and clean energy transitions.

Regulatory approval processes proceeded expeditiously due to government prioritisation of critical mineral processing projects. Environmental permits, construction approvals, and operating licences received coordinated review through streamlined governmental procedures typically reserved for nationally significant infrastructure projects.

Continental Energy Security Through Domestic Processing

Reducing Critical Dependencies on Overseas Facilities

National security implications extend beyond commercial considerations into defence and infrastructure applications requiring reliable cobalt sulfate supplies. Military communication systems, missile guidance technologies, and naval vessel power systems all depend on cobalt-enhanced batteries for operational reliability.

Economic benefits of domestic value-added processing include job creation, tax revenue generation, and reduced foreign exchange outflows for critical material imports. Economic impact studies suggest that domestic cobalt sulfate production could retain approximately $150 million annually in economic value that currently flows to overseas processors.

Import substitution potential grows as North American electric vehicle production expands. However, as the mining industry evolution continues, current projections indicate regional EV manufacturing capacity will reach 3.2 million units annually by 2030, requiring proportional increases in battery material supplies to maintain production targets.

Integration with Continental Battery Strategy

United States Inflation Reduction Act requirements create preferential treatment for electric vehicles containing domestically processed battery materials. Vehicles using North American cobalt sulfate may qualify for enhanced tax credits, improving their cost competitiveness in consumer markets.

Cross-border collaboration opportunities emerge through integrated North American supply chains. Canadian cobalt sulfate production can serve U.S. battery manufacturers while American lithium processing facilities supply Canadian battery producers, creating mutually beneficial trade relationships.

Defence production coordination enables both countries to maintain secure supplies of critical materials for military applications. Joint procurement agreements and strategic reserves become more feasible when processing facilities operate within allied territories.

Market Dynamics Reshaping Battery Material Competition

Competitive Positioning Against Established Producers

Global market share analysis reveals that existing cobalt sulfate refineries concentrate primarily in China (45% of global capacity), Finland (20%), and Belgium (15%). North America's entry into this market represents the first significant capacity addition outside these established regions since 2018.

Cost competitiveness factors favour North American operations in several key areas despite higher labour costs. Proximity to end-users reduces transportation expenses, while stable regulatory environments minimise operational disruptions that can affect overseas facilities.

Quality differentiation opportunities exist for premium applications requiring ultra-pure cobalt sulfate. Furthermore, examining cobalt blue expansion projects illustrates how automotive manufacturers increasingly demand traceability and quality assurance that domestic suppliers can provide more effectively than distant overseas facilities.

Future Expansion Potential and Market Growth

Modular facility design enables capacity increases through additional processing lines without requiring complete facility reconstruction. Engineering studies suggest potential expansion to 12,000 metric tons annually using existing site infrastructure and utility connections.

Related product development opportunities include cobalt hydroxide, cobalt oxide, and other specialised materials used in battery manufacturing. Diversifying product lines could improve facility utilisation rates and financial performance while serving broader market segments.

Regional hub development potential exists for co-locating complementary battery material processing operations. Lithium processing, nickel refining, and cathode material manufacturing could cluster around the cobalt sulfate facility, creating an integrated battery materials complex.

Industry Applications Beyond Electric Vehicle Manufacturing

Automotive Sector Supply Chain Integration

Electric vehicle manufacturers with North American operations represent the primary customer base for domestic cobalt sulfate production. Companies including Tesla, General Motors, Ford, and Rivian all operate battery manufacturing or assembly facilities within economic transportation distance of the Ontario refinery.

Battery pack assembly facilities require predictable supply schedules and quality consistency that domestic suppliers can provide more reliably than overseas alternatives. Just-in-time manufacturing processes benefit significantly from shortened supply chains and reduced logistics complexity.

Quality assurance advantages include direct communication with suppliers, facility inspections, and rapid response to specification changes or quality concerns. These factors become increasingly important as automotive manufacturers face stricter liability standards for battery-related safety issues.

Energy Storage and Infrastructure Applications

Utility-scale battery installations for renewable energy integration represent growing demand segments for high-quality cobalt sulfate. Grid-scale energy storage systems require long-term reliability that premium battery materials help ensure.

Commercial and residential energy storage markets continue expanding as solar panel installations proliferate across North America. Home battery systems and commercial backup power applications both utilise cobalt-enhanced lithium-ion batteries for their energy density and safety characteristics.

Grid stabilisation technologies increasingly rely on fast-response battery systems to maintain electrical grid stability as renewable energy sources comprise larger portions of generation capacity. These applications demand ultra-reliable battery performance that cobalt sulfate helps provide.

Environmental and Social Impact Considerations

Sustainable Processing Technologies and Environmental Stewardship

Advanced refining techniques minimise environmental impact through closed-loop water systems, waste heat recovery, and emissions control technologies. The facility incorporates zero liquid discharge systems that prevent contaminated water from entering local waterways.

Carbon footprint comparisons with overseas alternatives reveal significant environmental advantages. Eliminating trans-oceanic shipping reduces carbon emissions by an estimated 2,400 tonnes CO2 equivalent annually compared to importing equivalent cobalt sulfate quantities from Asian facilities.

Waste reduction protocols include recycling of process chemicals and recovery of valuable by-products. Approximately 95% of process water undergoes treatment and reuse, while solid waste streams undergo additional processing to recover residual cobalt content.

Community Economic Development and Social Responsibility

Local employment opportunities include approximately 75 direct positions ranging from process operators to technical specialists, plus an estimated 150 indirect jobs in supporting industries and services. Average wages for direct positions exceed regional averages by approximately 25%.

Skills training programmes developed in partnership with local educational institutions provide career pathways for regional residents while ensuring adequate workforce availability for facility operations. Training curricula focus on hydrometallurgical processing, quality control, and industrial safety.

Indigenous community engagement follows consultation protocols that respect traditional territories and treaty rights. Economic participation opportunities include contracting preferences and potential equity partnerships in future expansion projects.

Implementation Timeline and Operational Milestones

Construction Progress and Commissioning Schedule

Current project status indicates construction completion expected by Q2 2026, with initial production trials beginning shortly thereafter. Major equipment installation, including processing vessels and purification systems, has reached approximately 70% completion.

Regulatory approval processes have cleared final permitting hurdles, with operating licences approved by provincial and federal authorities. Environmental monitoring systems and reporting protocols have received regulatory approval and remain subject to ongoing compliance verification.

Production ramp-up phases will begin with 25% capacity utilisation during initial operations, increasing gradually to full capacity over approximately 12 months. This conservative approach ensures quality standards while minimising operational risks during startup.

Market Penetration Strategy and Customer Development

Initial customer agreements have been secured with several North American battery manufacturers, though specific contract terms remain confidential for competitive reasons. Industry sources suggest long-term supply agreements covering approximately 60% of planned production capacity.

Pricing strategies aim for competitive positioning against imported alternatives while maintaining sufficient margins for profitable operations. Consequently, according to Invest Ontario's recent announcement, market analysis suggests pricing can remain 5-10% below imported cobalt sulfate while still generating acceptable returns.

Quality certification processes for automotive applications require extensive testing and validation procedures that may extend over 6-12 months. These certifications represent crucial prerequisites for accessing premium market segments with higher profit margins.

Understanding Continental Battery Material Independence

What distinguishes this refinery from existing cobalt processing facilities?

This facility represents North America's inaugural dedicated cobalt sulfate production operation, specifically engineered to produce battery-grade materials meeting automotive industry specifications. Unlike general cobalt processing facilities, this refinery focuses exclusively on ultra-pure sulfate production optimised for lithium-ion battery applications.

How does domestic production economics compare with imported alternatives?

Local manufacturing eliminates overseas shipping costs averaging $800-1,200 per metric ton, reduces supply chain risks that can cause price volatility, and provides quality control advantages through direct supplier relationships. Transportation savings alone can offset higher domestic labour costs in many market conditions.

What strategic significance does government support provide for project viability?

Public sector investment totalling $7.5 million demonstrates governmental commitment to critical mineral processing independence while providing financial stability for long-term operational planning. Government backing also facilitates regulatory approvals and may enable preferential customer relationships with defence and infrastructure applications.

Which factors determine long-term competitive sustainability?

Market competitiveness depends on maintaining cost parity with overseas alternatives, securing stable raw material supplies from North American sources, and developing customer relationships based on supply chain reliability rather than solely on pricing considerations. Additionally, as noted by Recycling Today's coverage, the facility's funding structure provides operational flexibility crucial for long-term success.

Transforming North America's Critical Mineral Processing Landscape

The successful completion of financing for North America's first cobalt sulfate refinery represents more than a single project milestone. This development signals a fundamental shift toward continental supply chain independence for critical battery materials, combining strategic governmental support with private sector innovation to address longstanding vulnerabilities in electric vehicle manufacturing.

The facility's 6,500 metric ton annual production capacity provides meaningful supply security for regional battery manufacturers while establishing technical capabilities that could support future expansion as electric vehicle adoption accelerates. Financial structure combining $34.5 million in private investment with government backing creates a replicable model for additional critical mineral processing investments.

Environmental advantages of domestic processing, including reduced transportation emissions and higher environmental standards, align with broader sustainability goals driving electric vehicle adoption. Community economic development benefits demonstrate how critical mineral processing can contribute to regional prosperity while serving national security interests.

This project's success could catalyse additional investments in lithium processing, nickel refining, and other battery material production facilities across North America, fundamentally reshaping the competitive landscape for clean energy technologies and reducing dependencies on overseas supply chains for generations to come.

That’s all good news for the electric sector. But experts believe that demand will start to dwindle, now that most EVs are effectively $7,500 more expensive.

Before that happens, though, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at the best-selling electric cars in America, all of which have been helped by the sunsetted tax credit to get a foothold in the U.S. market. Whether or not they’ll keep their spots on the list when the year draws to a close–that’s for another article.

With just one exception, the Tesla Model Y, the top 10 best-selling EVs stateside have sold more cars from January to September of this year than last year. So, without further ado, let’s dive in.

So what happens now? Well, the fourth quarter will be an interesting one for EV sales in America. Many automakers are now offering big discounts, aggressive lease deals and price cuts on their electric models in order to compensate for the lack of tax credits. But it may be tough for carmakers to eat those costs forever, and in some cases, those deals may be used to clear out existing inventory rather than drive long-term demand.

If you're interested in an EV, make sure you do your homework—the rest of this year and 2026 will be anything but ordinary.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/koGbQP/s1/tesla-model-y-juniper.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:18:40.758603

The Trump administration plans to open a large area of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing. The refuge is the size of South Carolina and includes one of the largest stretches of undeveloped wilderness in the U.S. It's also believed to hold significant oil reserves. Liz Ruskin is the Washington reporter for Alaska Public Media. Joins us now from Washington, D.C. Liz, there's been a lot of back-and-forth over drilling in this wildlife refuge. What's happening now?

LIZ RUSKIN, BYLINE: Well, the new announcement is kind of the old announcement, going back to what the first Trump administration imposed. We as a country have been debating what to do with this upper right-hand corner of Alaska for a really long time. Democratic administrations try to keep drilling rigs out. Republicans want the area leased and drilled and the oil flowing down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The state of Alaska wants that, so do a lot of Alaska Native groups, especially on the North Slope. They want the economic development and tax revenue. But drilling is opposed by other Alaska Native groups and by those who say it would be terrible for caribou and polar bear and climate change.

So during the first Trump administration, Congress finally managed to open the refuge to drilling. But it seems like for the oil industry, maybe that came too late because no major oil company bid when drilling rights were auctioned. The big oil developments that we've seen in the Arctic, like the Willow project, they are outside of the refuge.

MARTÍNEZ: There were other projects in Alaska that the Biden administration blocked that the Trump administration is reviving. What are those projects?

RUSKIN: They're reviving two proposals to build roads in parts of Alaska that don't have roads now. You have to fly in. Maybe the most significant is the Ambler Road. This would be a 200-mile road in northwest Alaska through an undeveloped area. It would open access to a place where there's a lot of interest in mining. The state government supports this road. The Trump administration wants it. But a bit of it would cut through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, so that's controversial. And also, dozens of tribes and people in the region worry that the project will damage fish streams and harm caribou and other wildlife and generally ruin people's ability to live off the land. They say they'll try to block it in court.

MARTÍNEZ: OK, what about that other road?

RUSKIN: OK, that's in southwest Alaska. It would link an isolated town called King Cove to a former Air Force base that has an all-weather airport. And that road would cut through a wildlife refuge. The Trump administration wants to move past the controversy by swapping refuge land for land owned by the local Alaska Native Corporation.

MARTÍNEZ: Liz, why does it feel like Alaska is constantly this partisan political battleground, so to speak?

RUSKIN: Well, the federal government owns more than half of the state. And Alaska is where America goes to fight about public land policy. Democratic administrations, you know, mostly want to preserve natural areas. Republican administrations mostly want economic development. And with each administration undoing what the previous one did, there's not a lot of progress in either direction and these proposals remain in limbo for a long time. I heard from Senator Lisa Murkowski yesterday. And she said maybe, just maybe, one of these decisions will stick this time.

MARTÍNEZ: That's Liz Ruskin with Alaska Public Media. Liz, thanks.

RUSKIN: Thank you.

Wright sent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a rule on Thursday that allows customers to file joint, co-located load and generation interconnection requests. The energy department said the rule would reduce study times and costs for improving the grid, while reducing the time needed for additional power to come online. The rule also pushes FERC to mull whether reviews for grid projects, which sometimes take years, can be done in 60 days.

As U.S. power demand spikes for the first time in two decades on artificial intelligence, President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to boost power capacity, mainly from fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and grid access for the data center industry.

Energy secretaries can direct FERC, an independent panel of the Energy Department set to have a 3-2 Republican majority, to consider rules, but cannot force it to adopt them.

Edison Electric Institute, which represents publicly-traded electric utilities, said it supported Wright’s effort, saying it would strengthen the grid and drive down costs for customers.

An environmentalist slammed the move. “Pushing FERC to rubber-stamp connections in just 60 days while the government’s shut down and Trump builds a $300 million White House ballroom shows (how) out of touch his administration is from everyday Americans,” said Camden Weber of environmental group Center for Biological Diversity.

Wright also urged FERC to consider a rule to remove burdens for preliminary hydroelectric permits.

Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association, praised Wright’s move. “It is incumbent upon FERC, the Trump Administration, and Congress to ensure that third parties, such as Federal resource agencies, do not unduly inhibit hydropower development and instead foster its necessary growth to meet current challenges.”

This summer, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, ending various tax credits a decade ahead of schedule. The credits could be used to buy electric vehicles and to install solar panels on homes.

The EV tax credit expired last month. Residential solar tax credits are still available until the end of the year. But Kathy Kuntz, director of Dane County’s Office of Energy and Climate Change, told WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” that it’s unlikely people will be able to qualify for the credits in time unless they’ve already started the process.

“There’s a difference between buying a car and getting solar on your roof,” she said. “You can go to a dealership and buy a car in a couple of hours. It takes more planning to have all of the pieces in place, the permits and everything, to install solar on your house.”

“If people haven’t started yet, it’s probably not realistic for them to take advantage of the solar tax credits at this point,” she added. “If an installer is telling you ‘no problem’ and that they can get this done by the end of the year, you need to be a smart consumer and ask a lot of questions.”

Kuntz said most solar companies her office talks with are saying they’re booked through the year.

Burke O’Neal is a managing partner for Full Spectrum Solar, a solar installation company based in Madison. He told “Wisconsin Today” that the cancellation of the solar energy tax credits is hurting his business.

“It’s certainly been a bit challenging to change course,” O’Neal said. “We were expecting the residential and commercial tax credits through 2032. We were planning additional vehicle and tool purchases and adding electrical and roof installation crews, and we’re still planning to grow but it’s going to be at a slower pace than we expected.”

O’Neal said his company is offering a 5 percent discount to people if they schedule solar installations next year instead of this year to “keep the momentum going.”

Even without solar tax credits, Kuntz said there’s still an economic incentive for installing solar panels. She said the cost of installing solar panels has dropped by 90 percent since the early 2000s. She also said it’s a similar case with EVs becoming more cost-competitive with gas-powered cars.

O’Neal is trying to stay optimistic. He said energy costs for residential homes are up 35 percent in the last four years but solar installation costs remain stable. And as massive data centers around the country continue to drive up the demand and cost for electricity, O’Neal expects solar installations will remain popular.

“Maybe we’re a lot more resilient than we first felt when we learned about these (tax credit) changes,” he said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Madison-Home-with-Solar-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:18:45.305333

EPA.","Two former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency leaders joined students and community members at Duke University to speak on advancing environmental goals in the face of federal resistance to climate change regulation.

At an event celebrating the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability’s 20th anniversary on Thursday, former EPA Administrators William Reilly and Michael Regan discussed finding climate solutions.

Regan, who is now a distinguished fellow at Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, served from 2021 to 2024 under former President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This measure encouraged private sector, public sector, local and state governments, as well as households to invest in clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits and decarbonization efforts.

As a North Carolinian who also formerly served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Regan emphasized the importance of working with state leaders.

Regan said 70% of the EPA’s budget is passed through to the states. As a result, the agency is closely tied to state environmental departments, because the officials work together on strategic planning, setting priorities and measuring results.

“Most of those individuals at the state levels are the ones where the rubber meets the road, and they’re the ones that are having conversations with the private sector, with local communities, with environmental justice communities,” he said.

Former President George H. W. Bush appointed Reilly, who led the EPA from 1989 to 1993. Reilly now serves as chair of the Nicholas Institute’s advisory board.

Notably, Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a major revision to the original 1970 law. The amendments targeted three major threats to the environment and public health: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions, according to the EPA’s website.

In 1990, perception among members of Congress was that the EPA was “excessively oriented” toward regulation, Reilly said.

While the agency was initially popular during its inception in 1970, public support waned under the Reagan administration, which imposed budget cuts. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch resigned in 1983 because of an administrative scandal and another EPA official, Rita Lavelle, was convicted of lying to Congress.

To combat this and restore faith, the agency needed a new perspective, he said. The Bush administration worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop the clean air amendments and incorporate new ideas.

“We need to be more resourceful, more open to those kinds of approaches which have not really been tried before,” Reilly said.

A Duke student asked the pair how EPA leaders can continue to carry out their mission effectively while working under more narrow legal documents, such as West Virginia v. EPA. In that 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions in the power sector, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

Regan said these Supreme Court cases force the EPA to be more creative in terms of protecting public health, and place restrictions on the level of authority the agency can give to regulators.

“We don’t need a ton of new regulations,” Regan said. “We need smart regulations that give flexibility so that markets and technologies can achieve those environmental goals.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4387-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:05:19.464880

According to what we learned during Tom’s Ionna interview, Ionna’s long-term target is to deploy more than 30,000 fast-charging stalls by 2030.
Network Operation According to Ionna, the network already notes a very high uptime of 99%.
Video timestamps for Tom’s Ionna interview: 02:24 The interview starts 06:52 How does Ionna select where to locate sites today?
10:08 Do many NACS-equipped vehicles use Ionna sites?","It has been about 10 months since Ionna opened its first four Rechargery on December 27, 2024, following the soft opening of the first site in Apex, North Carolina. State Of Charge‘s Tom Moloughney has taken the opportunity to revisit Ionna and discuss its accomplishments, challenges, and future outlook.

The visit to the company’s headquarters and its Quarterback engineering lab in Durham, North Carolina, for the Ionna interview was quite fruitful and will result in two videos. The first one is an in-depth discussion with Dan Bryant, Ionna’s senior vice president of Site Operations, about the network’s current state of affairs.

How Many Bays?

The Ionna DC fast-charging network is a joint venture between eight global automakers: BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Toyota. This provides it with the opportunity for significant funding to jump-start its expansion, and it appears that this is exactly what is happening, as the network is the fastest-growing new DC fast-charging network in the US.

According to Bryant, the number of stations (called Rechargeries) has increased to 31-32. The number of individual stalls (or bays) now exceeds 300. The company has 900 stalls under construction or beyond, and 3,600+ stalls contracted (up 20% from July 2025, when it was 3,000+).

When asked about the possibility of achieving the target of 1,000 bays in 2025, Bryant answered that “we will be pleasantly surprised by what we are going to hit this year”, which makes us believe that there will be a very strong fourth quarter.

Let’s recall that on average, Ionna’s Rechargeries have 10 stalls (five dual-head chargers), so the first 100 sites will mark an important milestone that could be reached within a few months. By the end of 2026, the number of Rechargeries should exceed 200 (with over 2,000 bays).

According to what we learned during Tom’s Ionna interview, Ionna’s long-term target is to deploy more than 30,000 fast-charging stalls by 2030. The average number of stalls might be higher than 10 at that point, so we are talking roughly 2,500 stations.

Nonetheless, as of today, the company’s primary focus is on quality, reliability, and refining all aspects of the stations, rather than on quantity. If necessary, Ionna adjusts its original design to improve the user experience (for example, installing better lighting). By the way, small details not directly related to charging are often the most challenging when building the stations (such as the placement of trash cans, canopies, lights, etc.)

Chargers & Stalls

Ionna currently uses Alpitronic HYC400 (Hypercharger 400) chargers with a power output of up to 400 kW and up to 1,000 volts. They have two charging ports each and can simultaneously charge two EVs (allocating power between them). In the future, power levels might even be higher.

In the case of Ionna, about 60% of the chargers have CCS1 charging connectors, while the other 40% have NACS (SAE J3400) charging connectors. This enables the locations to serve all EVs, aside from a few corner cases (such as older CHAdeMO models). It’s worth noting that Ionna is the only DC fast-charging network with both CCS1 and NACS connectors at all sites.

According to the company, so far, both CCS1 and NACS charging connectors have been relatively well utilized. Depending on the future demand, the company might gradually add more NACS chargers (or even switch CCS1 connectors to NACS).

An important challenge concerns pull-through stalls for larger EVs or EVs with trailers. At the moment, there are two Rechargeries with pull-through stalls and a couple more in the pipeline. Ionna knows the importance of this type of charging stall and plans to deploy them wherever possible to customize the station layout.

Geographic Expansion and Canada

According to the interview, Ionna’s expansion strategy includes various factors — sometimes it’s a particular area, sometimes a corridor, or sites at partners’ locations. There is no single approach, and the Rechargeries are gradually opening in new US states. In September, the network opened its first site in California — the US’s largest EV market.

Regarding Canada, there will be no Rechargeries planned in the short term, but the country is part of the company’s long-term strategy, it says.

Network Operation

According to Ionna, the network already notes a very high uptime of 99%. Uptime is defined in accordance with the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program (although Ionna is not much engaged in the NEVI itself).

The company places strong emphasis on the reliability and prompt repair of charging ports.

A positive thing is that so far, the network has no issues with vandalism. There was also no issue with queues, and users reported very positive feedback on that topic. That’s probably why Ionna still does not have an idle fee, but it might have one in the future.

Another good thing is the Plug & Charge feature, which Ionna offers to several brands already, including BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, and Mercedes-Benz. This list recently expanded as Rivian joined the party.

A little surprising subject of discussion concerned app development. Ionna does not yet have an app, and according to the interview, it’s not focusing on this topic right now.

The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.
The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.
Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors.
“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.","COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.

Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.

Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.

Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.

“The risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.

There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.

“I still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,” Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.

Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

Santee Cooper executives credited President Donald Trump's executive order in May calling for the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years for opening the door to the potential agreement.

“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.

Santee Cooper was the minority partner with what was then South Carolina Electric and Gas when construction on the two new nuclear plants started in 2013 at the V.C. Summer site — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Columbia — where SCE & G was already operating a reactor.

The project needed to be finished in seven years to get tax credits to keep the project's cost from overwhelming the utilities, but it ended up behind schedule almost immediately.

Executives lied about the problems to keep money coming in. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/921bb079-82af-4966-a581-db093e0f0b6e/wirestory_f7bcefe431672c4145f7c4acbd05d4e7_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-24 16:04:50.617158

It is achingly predictable.

I mean … of course it was going to go this way. Australia’s rightwing parties are a mess, and threatening to tear themselves apart. It’s possible not every Coalition MP dismisses the evidence that the country’s extraordinary and unique environment is in long-term decline. But a significant number do.

Sussan Ley and David Littleproud are battling to hold their parties together and keep their jobs. The idea that a deal could be landed, with the support of the Nationals and many Liberals, that includes even mild nods to improving nature protection was always highly optimistic.

It’s hard to imagine the Albanese government believed it was possible. But for weeks we have been stepping through the political dance of the environment minister, Murray Watt, talking with both the Coalition and the Greens about what a future Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act might look like.

If nothing else, we should be grateful to Ley for ending the pretence on Thursday, when she declared the nature laws were a “red light” for jobs and suggested the creation of a national Environment Protection Agency (EPA) would be a form of “green ideology”. Most of what she said was not true – Alcoa quickly dismissed Ley’s claim that the legislation would stop a proposed gallium refinery expansion – but it made her position clear.

It means that unless something extraordinary happens in Australia’s rightwing politics, or Labor abandons any claim to wanting to protect the country’s extraordinary wildlife, the government will have to deal with the Greens in the Senate. In political terms, we are basically back to where we were a year ago, before Anthony Albanese intervened at the behest of Western Australian Labor and mining interests to scupper a deal between the then minister Tanya Plibersek and the Greens to legislate an EPA.

Agreement this time appears challenging, if not impossible. Lobbyists, campaigners and politicians have seen parts of the legislation, but key elements – the design of the EPA, for example – are yet to be released.

There are some things we know. The proposed changes to the EPBC Act do not deal with its fundamental problem: despite its name, the law does not prioritise protecting the environment. Its principle role is to allow projects – including fossil fuel developments – to go ahead, with some conditions attached to limit environmental damage.

That approach has failed, partly because the environment minister of the day has a remarkable amount of discretion to approve what they see fit. Ministers have routinely approved offsets that do not compensate for the nature that has been lost. Conditions have not been enforced. The cumulative impacts of multiple developments have not been considered.

Native forest logging overseen by the states has been effectively exempt, despite a long list of legal cases in which it was found to have breached the laws. Forest destruction on private land for agriculture – a major driver of biodiversity loss across vast areas of western New South Wales and Queensland, and the Northern Territory – has rarely been assessed.

Alongside these fundamental environmental problems, decision times on projects have often blown out – a major gripe of industry that it wants addressed.

Added up, it means major surgery will be needed to address the systemic problems set out in the last major state of the environment report. The risk is that the overhaul ends up as tinkering rather than transformation.

If the government’s first goal is to lift environmental protection – and it was prepared to lose skin to industry attacks in the process – there is a strong case it would replace the act entirely. Watt’s predecessor Plibersek flagged that as a possibility before dropping the idea. There seems to be no appetite for it now. Instead, the focus is on pushing legislation through as soon as possible.

There are some decent elements in what Watt is proposing.

He is leaning heavily on a 2020 review by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, including one of its central recommendations – the introduction of national environment standards against which development proposals could be tested. Two draft standards, covering matters of national environmental significance and offsets, are promised alongside the legislation, with others to follow. Their strength or otherwise will go a long way towards deciding whether the changes are meaningful.

The legislation will include a definition of an “unacceptable impact”. This could be crucial in setting a test of whether a project should be approved in an environmentally sensitive area. Business interests don’t like it and want it out.

The minister says there will also be broader “no-go zones” in which developments will be banned, and a requirement that industry will not only offset the damage it causes, but spend to create a “net gain” for nature. This is vital given what has been lost, but we know nothing about how net gain will be defined or enforced. For now, it’s just a phrase.

Watt is promising a legislated requirement that developers need to avoid or limit damage before buying offsets. And he says there will be beefed up penalties, with fines of up to $825m and a pledge that offenders would be stripped of financial gains made while breaking the law.

Most of these commitments are hard to assess without detail – including on whether the EPA will have the power, resourcing and culture needed to transform nature protection across the country.

Then there are the problems and unanswered questions – and they are significant.

There is little sign the legislation will tackle the huge problem of deforestation. Millions of hectares have been cleared without federal oversight, mostly for industrial farming. The state of the environment report cited evidence that 93% of the threatened species habitat cleared between 2000 and 2017 was not referred for assessment under national law. One hundred scientists wrote to Albanese this week calling for this to be urgently addressed.

The government is planning to create a “restoration contributions” fund that developers can pay into and officials would then use to buy offsets. But the legislation includes no requirement that the offset is “like-for-like”, which suggests spending on a completely unrelated environment project could be used to justify nature destruction elsewhere.

It is also unclear how the government plans to abolish the exemption granted to native forest logging – something Samuel, Plibersek and Watt have agreed is necessary – but which the timber industry and the Tasmanian government strongly oppose.

And on the epochal issue of climate change – which will transform so much of the natural environment as temperatures rise – the government has remained firm in rejecting calls for the greenhouse gas pollution of fossil fuel developments to be considered in the approval process.

Instead, developers will be required to just disclose in their application the expected emissions and a plan to reduce them – a step that many big companies already take. Rather than block big polluting projects, the likelihood is that coal and gas proposals could receive a greenlight more rapidly if the legislation is passed, in the name of cutting “green tape”.

If it happens, history is likely to judge it as an obviously perverse outcome from what the government announced on Friday would be known as the Environment Protection Reform Bill.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f07dddb6a1011695f64003315b4332ef717422/399_103_6752_5401/master/6752.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=68f60a30f6d111a2078b02e8f3ab6f38",N,,2025-10-24 16:05:04.279739

While the 118th Congress adopted some permitting reforms as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and nearly adopted a larger permitting reform as part of the Energy Permitting Reform Act, the topic is gaining traction under the 119th, with more bills and deeper policies proposed. While not exhaustive, this piece attempts to lay out the broad strokes of key legislation and explain their likely effects. It should not be considered an R Street endorsement of listed legislation.

SPEED Act

Reps. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine) introduced the Standardized Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act (SPEED Act) in July 2025. The bill is an extension of Rep. Westerman’s permitting proposals from last Congress, except more comprehensive and now bipartisan.

The SPEED Act includes three key policies:

Judicial Review Reform

The SPEED Act would make two major changes to judicial review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The first is that plaintiffs litigating government permits must have submitted comments during the public comment period that are relevant to the issue they are litigating. This is significant, as research on NEPA permitting timelines has hypothesized that a lack of knowledge about which environmental effects must be considered sufficient in court leads agencies to err on the side of comprehensive review, thereby lengthening the process. The reform—which already partially exists for some major projects under Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act—would reduce permitting timelines by ensuring agencies know exactly how their draft environmental reviews should be improved before a final permit is issued.

The SPEED Act would also reduce the statute of limitations under which a NEPA permit can be litigated from the current six years to 150 days. Although most litigations against NEPA permits occur almost immediately after issuance, a prolonged statute of limitations can deter market entry. This is because project developers may not want to commence construction while a permit is under threat of litigation.

Codification of SCOTUS Decision

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) heard a case that challenged the adequacy of a NEPA permit, contending that such permits should also consider any indirect environmental effects (e.g., pollution from activities supported by the permitted project). SCOTUS ruled that this was inappropriate, but importantly the majority opinion noted that lower courts had been improperly vacating permits and delaying projects. The opinion from SCOTUS was that permits should be vacated only when the asserted permit deficiency would have altered the decision to issue a permit.

The SPEED Act codifies some of this. First, it narrows the consideration of effects for review under permits to direct effects. Second, it clarifies that issued permits should still be considered active while agencies work to correct deficiencies. In other words, if a court finds that a permit’s supporting documentation is improper, a project can still move forward with construction unless the deficiency of the permit would have prevented it from being issued at all.

Paperwork Reduction

The SPEED Act has several provisions designed to make supporting documents for permits more durable and to expand the list of acceptable documents for consideration. The act also clarifies that agencies are not required to seek out or produce new environmental studies if there is sufficient existing available information, nor must they consider any new studies that emerge during the permitting process.

Furthermore, SPEED contains a number of provisions that narrow the applicability of NEPA, expand categorical exclusions, and prevent future reversals of issued permits between administrations.

SPEED and Reliability Act

Not to be confused with the SPEED Act, the Streamlining Powerlines Essential to Electric Demand and Reliability Act (SPEED and Reliability Act) proposed by Reps. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) and Andy Barr (R-Ky.) focuses on electric power transmission permitting issues.

The bill aims to ameliorate the difficulties of permitting large interstate transmission lines by enhancing federal backstop authority and removing some political authorities. Specifically, the bill would remove the Department of Energy’s authority to designate broad areas for transmission (called “corridors”) as within the national interest, transferring this authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to apply to specific projects.

Additionally, the bill aims to expand state and local engagement in the federal permitting process of electric power transmission and mandates a one-year period of engagement before FERC can permit a project. The bill further aims to clarify “cost allocation,” where those who benefit from new federally permitted transmission (e.g., lower electricity costs) must also bear the project costs.

The thinking behind the SPEED and Reliability Act is that although the federal government currently has the authority to expedite the permitting of significant electric power transmission lines through its designation of national interest electric transmission corridors, this authority is almost never used. It is complicated, rarely applicable to real projects, and opposed by states and localities that might be impacted. The reformed approach would centralize authority within FERC to focus on approving proposed (rather than theoretical) projects while expanding state and local engagement to address concerns of project opposition, though this federal backstop authority is only utilized if the state-level process fails or is impossible.

FREE Act

The Full Responsibility and Expedited Enforcement Act (FREE Act) introduced by Rep. Celeste Maloy (R-Utah) is a proposed “permit-by-rule” (PBR) legislation. PBR allows developers to begin construction without a permit so long as the final construction complies with government regulations.

Although it is considered a PBR proposal, the legislation would not directly implement any PBR policies. Rather, the bill would require government agencies to identify and report to Congress opportunities for PBR implementation within their permitting guidelines and to adopt PBR processes for those opportunities.

PBR is a relatively novel concept and may only have limited applicability to large-scale projects that require significant environmental review before being permitted. However, most permits do not require significant review from the government, often falling within “categorical exclusions.” That makes it possible for PBR to cover a wide swath of low-impact projects permitted by the federal government.

ePermit Act

Introduced by Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) and Peters (D-Calif.), the ePermit Act aims to digitize much of the NEPA-related permitting information collected and published by the federal government. There is little standardization or publication of permitting data from the federal government, making the analysis of relevant permitting trends difficult. It is also a problem for permitting expediency, because government agencies do not always know if the documentation they need for permits already exists.

The ePermit Act represents a potentially low-cost way to make necessary information more readily available to permitting agencies. It could also improve accountability by increasing the transparency of choke points within federal permitting processes.

Policy Insight

These efforts represent just some of the permitting policy efforts currently being contemplated this Congress. Importantly, they each target different elements of federal permitting identified as in need of reform. While different elements of reform will deliver varying levels of improvement for federal permitting timelines, it is unlikely that any single reform will be sufficient to remedy protracted federal permitting timelines.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AdobeStock_84221257.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 16:04:59.476890

(AP) — Michigan is demanding millions of dollars in incentives back from a Chinese company after plans to build an electric vehicle battery plant collapsed following years of pushback against the project from neighbors and members of Congress.

Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer supported the $2.36 billion factory in 2022, and state lawmakers approved nearly $175 million in incentives for the project. The state is now holding Gotion Inc. in default of $23.6 million, accusing the company of abandoning the project.

“While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we recognize the tremendous responsibility we have to the people we serve to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are spent wisely and appropriately,” Danielle Emerson, a spokesperson with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said in a statement.

Representatives for Gotion, which is headquartered in California, did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

In a letter dated Sept. 17, Michigan informed Gotion that it was in default of economic development grant obligations because no “eligible activities” had occurred on the site's property in over 120 days.

According to the MEDC, the state is seeking to claw back $23.6 million that was disbursed toward the purchase of the site’s land near Big Rapids, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. $26.4 million remaining from the grant that was not spent will be returned to the state, Emerson said. Citing a lack of progress on the project, a different $125 million grant was not distributed to Gotion.

The news was first reported by Crain’s Detroit Business.

The state also said two project-related lawsuits are imposing a “material adverse effect” on its progress, which counts as grounds for default. The letter said that if the defaults are not resolved in 30 days, the state expects repayment of $23.6 million. That deadline passed Oct. 17.

Residents of nearby Green Township so firmly opposed the project, some over environmental concerns, that voters in 2023 recalled five local elected officials who supported bringing the factory to the area.

Auto manufacturing is the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy, which has been hard hit by tariffs imposed this year on the industry and Canada. When the project was proposed, officials said the factory would produce cathodes and anodes, two components key to electric vehicle batteries, as well as over 2,000 jobs. The original economic development incentives came as officials sought to bolster manufacturing in the state.

Whitmer's office did immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, who represents a swath of rural Michigan, had been the loudest and most prominent critic of the project, accusing Gotion of ties with forced labor and the Chinese Communist Party. Moolenaar chairs the House Select Committee on China and introduced a bill that stopped companies like Gotion from receiving electric vehicle tax credits from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Moolenaar's bill was signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

“Now that its contract with the State of Michigan and MEDC is set to be terminated, the people of Green Charter Township can finally move on from Gotion’s lies and broken promises,” Moolenaar said in a press release.

Aclara Resources Inc., headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced a $277 million investment to construct the first U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton, according to a Friday news release from Louisiana Economic Development.

The company plans to mine deposits of rare earth metals in South America and ship them to Louisiana for processing at its proposed facility in Vinton. The facility will use hydrochloric acid to extract and separate the metals from the clay mineral deposits.

Rare earth elements — such as dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and terbium — are considered critical materials for many industries. Some are used as high-powered magnets in wind turbine motors, vehicle alternators and heat-seeking missiles, according to ScienceNews. Others are used as high-temperature alloys in aircraft engines and nuclear reactors, or as signal amplifiers in fiber optic cables, among other applications.

Aclara’s Louisiana facility is expected to directly employ 140 people. It will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through environmental and engineering reviews.

“Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said in the news release. “The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.”

The state is giving Aclara a $3 million grant to pay for infrastructure and an additional job-creation grant for as much as 22% of wages paid. Additionally, the company will be eligible for the state’s lucrative Industrial Tax Exemption Program through which it will be largely exempt from property taxes in Calcasieu Parish.

,Congress,2025-10-24 19:01:22+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Unions opposing Trump agenda pouring money into Proposition 50 campaign,"Seema Mehta, www.latimes.com, seema-mehta",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-24/special-interests-labor-newsom-donations-proposition-50,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state’s powerful, left-leaning labor unions are another factor that may influence the outcome of the Nov. 4 special election.
“There are real issues here that are at stake,” said veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman, who has represented several unions that have contributed to Newsom’s committee supporting Proposition 50.
“But the truth is on Proposition 50, I think it’s much less calculated than normal contributions.
Money from California unions pours in Although much of the money supporting the efforts comes from wealth Democratic donors and partisan groups aimed at helping Democrats take control of Congress, a significant portion comes from labor unions.
“The governor’s support for labor would be exactly the same with or without Proposition 50 on the ballot.","With the fate of President’s Trump’s right-wing agenda at stake, the California ballot measure crafted to tilt Congress to Democratic control has turned into a fight among millionaires and billionaires, a former president, a past movie-star governor and the nation’s top partisans.

Californians have been inundated with political ads popping up on every screen — no cellphone, computer or living-room television is spared — trying to sway them about Proposition 50, which will reconfigure the districts of the largest state congressional delegation in the union.

Besides opposing pleas from former President Obama and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state’s powerful, left-leaning labor unions are another factor that may influence the outcome of the Nov. 4 special election.

Unions representing California school teachers, carpenters, state workers and nurses have plowed more than $23 million into efforts to pass Proposition 50, according to an analysis of campaign finance disclosure reports about donations exceeding $100,000. That’s nearly one-third of the six-figure donations reported through Thursday.

Not only do these groups have major interests in the state capitol, including charter school reform, minimum wage hikes and preserving government healthcare programs, they also are deeply aligned with efforts by Gov. Gavin Newsom and his fellow Democrats to put their party in control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 election.

“There are real issues here that are at stake,” said veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman, who has represented several unions that have contributed to Newsom’s committee supporting Proposition 50.

“There’s always a risk when making sizable donations, that you’re putting yourself out there,” Kaufman said. “But the truth is on Proposition 50, I think it’s much less calculated than normal contributions. It really is about the issue, not about currying favor with members of the Legislature, or the congressional delegation, or the governor. Even though, of course, it benefits them if we win.”

High stakes brings in big money from across the nation

Newsom’s pro-Proposition 50 committee has raised more than $116 million, according to campaign disclosure filings through Thursday afternoon, though that number is sure to increase once additional donations are disclosed in the latest fundraising reports that are due by midnight Thursday.

The multimillion-dollar donations provide the best evidence of what’s at stake, and how Proposition 50 could determine control of the House during the final two years of Trump’s presidency. If the Democrats take control of the House, not only could that derail major parts of Trumps agenda, it probably would lead to a slew of congressional hearings on Trump’s immigration crackdown, use of the military in American cities, accepting a $400-million luxury airliner from Qatari’s royal family, the cutting of research funding to universities and the president’s ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, among many others.

The House Majority PAC — the Democrats’ congressional fundraising arm — has donated at least $15 million to the pro-Proposition 50 campaign, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) was in Los Angeles to campaign for the ballot measure last weekend. Obama joined Newsom on a livestream promoting the proposition Wednesday, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin hosted a bilingual phone bank in Los Angeles on Thursday.

“Make no mistake about what they’re trying to do and why it’s so important that we fight back,” Martin said. “We’re not going to be the only party with one hand tied behind our back. If they want a showdown, we’re going to give them a showdown and in just a little under two weeks it starts right here with Prop. 50 in California.”

Billionaire financier George Soros — a generous donor to liberal causes and a bogeyman to Republicans — has contributed $10 million. Others have chosen to fund separate entities campaigning in favor of Proposition 50, notably billionaire hedge-fund founder Tom Steyer, who chipped in $12 million.

On the opposition side, the largest donor is Charles Munger Jr., the son of the longtime investment partner of billionaire Warren Buffett, who has contributed $32.8 million to one of the two main committees opposing Proposition 50. The Congressional Leadership Fund — the GOP’s political arm in the House — has donated $5 million to the other main anti-Proposition 50 committee and $8 million to the California Republican Party.

Although Republicans may control the White House and Congress, the California GOP wields no real power in Sacramento, so it’s not surprising that Republican efforts opposing Proposition 50 have not received major donations from entities with business before the state.

The California Chamber of Commerce opted to remain neutral on Proposition 50. Chevron and the California Resources Corp., petroleum companies that have given to California Republicans in the past, also remain on the sidelines.

In contrast, Democrats control every statewide office and hold supermajorities in both houses of the California Legislature. The pro-Proposition 50 campaign has been showered with donations from groups aligned with Sacramento’s legislative leaders — with labor organizations chief among them.

Among the labor donors, the powerful carpenters unions have donated at least $4 million. Newsom hailed them in July when he signed legislation altering a landmark environmental law for urban apartment developments to boost the supply of housing. The California Conference of Carpenters union has become one of the most pro-housing voices in the state.

“This is the third of the last four years we’ve been together signing landmark housing reforms, and it simply would not have happened without the Carpenters,” Newsom said at the time.

Daniel M. Curtin, director of the California Conference of Carpenters, pointed to a letter he wrote to legislators in August urging them to put redistricting on the ballot because of the effect of Trump’s policies on the state’s workers.

“These are not normal times, and this isn’t politics as usual. Not only has the Trump administration denied disaster assistance to victims of California’s devastating forest fires, he’s damaging our CA economy with mass arrests of law-abiding workers without warrants,” wrote Curtin, whose union has 70,000 members in the state. “The Trump administration is now unilaterally withdrawing from legally binding union collective bargaining agreements with federal workforce unions. The President has made it clear that this is just the beginning.”

Proposition 50 was prompted by Trump urging Republican leaders in Texas to redraw their congressional districts to boost the number of GOP members in the House and keep the party in control after the 2026 election. Newsom sought to counter the move by altering California’s congressional boundaries in a rare mid-decade redistricting.

With 52 members in the House, the state has the largest congressional delegation in the nation. But unlike many states, California’s districts are drawn by an independent commission created by voters in 2010 in an effort to end partisan gerrymandering and incumbent protection.

The state’s districts would not have been redrawn until after the 2030 U.S. census, but the Legislature and Newsom agreed in August to put Proposition 50, which would give Democrats the potential to pick up five seats, on the November ballot.

Money from California unions pours in

Although much of the money supporting the efforts comes from wealth Democratic donors and partisan groups aimed at helping Democrats take control of Congress, a significant portion comes from labor unions.

The Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 700,000 healthcare workers, social workers, in-home caregivers and school employees and other state and local government workers, has contributed more than $5.5 million to the committee.

On Oct. 12, the union celebrated Newsom signing bills ensuring that workers, regardless of immigration status, are informed about their civil and labor rights under state and federal law as well as updating legal guidance to state and local agencies about protecting private information, such as court records and medical data, from being misused by federal authorities.

“Thank you to Governor Newsom for … standing up to federal overreach and indiscriminate, violent attacks on our communities,” David Huerta, president of SEIU California, said in a statement.

Huerta was arrested during the first day of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles in June and charged with a felony. But federal prosecutors are instead pursuing a misdemeanor case against him, according to a Friday court filing.

An SEIU representative did not respond to requests for comment.

The California Teachers Assn., another potent force in state politics, has contributed more than $3.3 million, along with millions more from other education unions such as the National Education Assn., the California Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of Teachers.

CTA had a mixed record in this year’s legislative session.

Newsom vetoed a bill to crack down on charter school fraud, Senate Bill 414. The CTA opposed the bill, arguing that it didn’t go far enough to target fraud in some of the schools, and had urged the governor to reject it.

Newsom signed CTA-backed bills that placed strict limits on ICE agents’ access to school grounds. But he also vetoed union-backed bill that would have required the state Board of Education to adopt health education instructional materials by July 1, 2028.

CTA President David Goldberg said their donations are driven not only by issues important to the union’s members, but also the students they serve who are dependent on federally funded assistance programs and impacted by policies such as immigration.

“It’s about our livelihood but it really is about fundamental issues … for people who serve students who are just incredibly under attack right now,” Goldberg said.

“The governor’s support for labor would be exactly the same with or without Proposition 50 on the ballot. But he would acknowledge this year is more urgent than ever for labor and working people,” said Newsom spokesperson Bob Salladay. “Trump is taking a wrecking ball to collective bargaining, to fair wages and safe working conditions. He would be backing them up under any circumstances, but especially now.”

Critics of Proposition 50 argue that these contributions are among the reasons voters should oppose the ballot measure.

“The independent redistricting commission exists to prevent conflicts of interest and money from influencing line drawing,” said Amy Thoma, a spokesperson for the Voters First Coalition, the committee backed by Munger Jr., who bankrolled the 2010 ballot measure to create the independent commission. “That’s why we want to preserve its independence.”

Other labor leaders argued that although they are not always in lockstep with Newsom, they need to support Proposition 50 because of the importance of Democrats winning the congressional majority next year.

Lorena Gonzalez, the head of the powerful California Labor Federation, said the timing of the member unions’ donations of millions of dollars to Newsom’s ballot measure committee for an election taking place shortly after the bill-signing period was “unfortunate” and “weird.”

“Because we have so many bills in front of him, we were gun-shy,” she said, noting that the federation has sparred with the governor over issues such as the effect of artificial intelligence in the workplace. “Never be too close to your elected officials. Because we see the good, the bad, the ugly.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17fc91a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7760x4074+0+231/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2F9f%2Fe80f266e40b0bb8f5f4ae1d0afb5%2F1523944-me-human-chain-standalone-cmh-01.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 17:00:07.569734

Its revenue reached $48.6 billion, remaining flat year - on - year; net profit was $1.3 billion, a 57% year - on - year decrease; and adjusted EBIT was $3.4 billion, an 18% year - on - year decline.

Meanwhile, General Motors expects its full - year net profit in 2025 to be between $7.7 billion and $8.3 billion; adjusted EBIT is projected to be between $12 billion and $13 billion, compared with the previous quarter's expectation of $10 billion to $12.5 billion; automotive business cash flow is expected to be between $19.2 billion and $21.2 billion; and adjusted automotive business cash flow is expected to be between $10 billion and $11 billion.

In the third quarter of 2025, General Motors sold 469,000 vehicles in China, a 10.9% year - on - year increase, marking the third consecutive quarter of year - on - year sales growth. General Motors pointed out that in China, the sales of its new energy vehicles and pure - electric vehicles have achieved year - on - year growth for ten consecutive quarters since the second quarter of 2023. Benefiting from the sales recovery, General Motors has achieved profitability in China for four consecutive quarters.

Can General Motors completely emerge from the trough in China and return to its former glory?

Restructuring the Chinese Business after Losses

In recent years, General Motors has faced development bottlenecks in the Chinese market, with its sales gradually declining. From 2022 to 2024, its sales volumes were 2.3 million, 2.09 million, and over 1.8 million vehicles respectively.

Data shows that General Motors mainly has two joint - venture companies in China: SAIC - GM and SAIC - GM - Wuling. According to the official website of General Motors (China), it operates five major brands in China: Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, Baojun, and Wuling. Among them, Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac are managed by SAIC - GM; Wuling and Baojun are managed by SAIC - GM - Wuling.

The decline in General Motors' sales is mainly due to SAIC - GM. From 2022 to 2024, SAIC - GM's sales volumes were 1.1701 million, 1.001 million, and 0.435 million vehicles respectively, with year - on - year decreases of 12.13%, 14.45%, and 56.54% respectively; SAIC - GM - Wuling's sales volumes were 1.6 million, 1.4031 million, and 1.3401 million vehicles respectively, with year - on - year decreases of 3.62%, 12.31%, and 4.49% respectively.

With the significant decline in sales, General Motors initiated the restructuring of its Chinese business. In December 2024, General Motors announced that it would record a non - temporary impairment of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion for its equity in Chinese joint - ventures, and recognize an additional equity loss of approximately $2.7 billion due to the implementation of the SAIC - GM restructuring plan. This part of the loss includes the impairment charges related to factory closures and portfolio optimization to be recognized by Chinese joint - ventures.

In the same month, SAIC Group announced that it would record asset impairment provisions of 23.212 billion yuan for SAIC - GM and its holding subsidiaries, including SAIC - GM Dongyue Automobile Co., Ltd., SAIC - GM (Shenyang) Beisheng Automobile Co., Ltd., and SAIC - GM Dongyue Power Assembly Co., Ltd. (i.e., Dongyue Factory) in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Due to the significant decline in sales in 2024 and the recording of asset impairment, SAIC - GM incurred losses. In 2024, SAIC - GM's revenue was 68.747 billion yuan, and its net profit attributable to the parent company was - 26.688 billion yuan; SAIC - GM - Wuling's revenue was 77.934 billion yuan, and its net profit attributable to the parent company was 1.045 billion yuan.

In addition to the restructuring, both SAIC - GM and SAIC - GM - Wuling have made management adjustments. Lu Xiao, the former executive deputy general manager of Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center, replaced Zhuang Jingxiong as the general manager of SAIC - GM. Xue Haitao, the former deputy general manager of SAIC - GM - Wuling, replaced Lu Yi as the deputy general manager of SAIC - GM.

After this adjustment, General Motors has given the Chinese management team greater autonomy in product definition and business decision - making. The two newly appointed managers, Lu Xiao, leads the product - side reform, and Xue Haitao is responsible for marketing.

Chinese Team Leads Electrification

Since the business restructuring, General Motors' electrification process in China has been accelerating, and the Buick brand has become the ""pioneer"" of the reform.

In February 2025, SAIC - GM's Buick brand officially adopted a new pricing model for new energy vehicles, becoming the first in the joint - venture camp to fully implement the ""fixed - price"" strategy, that is, a unified national price.

In April, Buick launched the new energy MPV, the Buick GL8 Lushang, with a starting price of 249,900 yuan. In August 2025, the new plug - in hybrid version of the Buick GL8 Avenir was launched, targeting the mid - to - large luxury new energy MPV market, with a price range of 339,900 to 399,900 yuan. According to media reports, after General Motors decentralized power to the Chinese team, the new plug - in hybrid version of the GL8 Avenir completed its replacement in 16 months, while previously, General Motors' iteration cycle was basically 36 months.

According to the electric vehicle sales ranking on Chezhuzhijia, in the first nine months of 2025, the Buick GL8 new energy vehicles sold 40,852 units, with an average monthly sales volume of about 4,539 units. In 2024, the cumulative sales of the Buick GL8 new energy vehicles were 23,056 units, with an average monthly sales volume of 1,921 units. Obviously, after the launch of new models led by the Chinese team, the sales of the Buick GL8 new energy vehicles have significantly increased.

It is worth mentioning that in April 2025, Buick launched its high - end new energy brand, Buick Zhijing, and released the new Buick ""Xiaoyao"" super - integrated architecture, which can support three full - body forms: MPV, SUV, and sedan, as well as three new energy technologies: pure - electric, plug - in hybrid, and range - extended. Buick also announced that starting from 2025, all new model line - ups launched by Buick in the Chinese market will be new energy vehicles; within the next two years, Buick will achieve full coverage of the main price segments of new energy vehicles.

Lu Xiao said that six Zhijing models will be launched in the market in the next 12 months. ""The goal of these new energy products is definitely to be profitable, and they will all be equipped with the new - generation intelligent cockpit and assisted - driving technologies."" ""By 2026, the sales of new energy vehicles of SAIC - GM will account for more than 50%, and by 2027, it will even reach 60%. All these new energy products must be profitable.""

In September, its first model, the Zhijing L7, was launched, targeting the mid - to - large range - extended sedan market, with an official starting price of 169,900 yuan. Buick officially announced that within 19 days of its launch, the number of firm orders exceeded 12,000 units.

Data shows that the Zhijing L7 is equipped with the ""Xiaoyao Zhixing"" assisted - driving system and the Momenta R6 Flywheel large - scale model based on end - to - end ""reinforcement learning"", which can provide full - scenario assisted - driving functions such as ""seamless"" urban NOA and ""one - key parking without stopping"". At the same time, in the new energy sedan market between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan, the range - extended segment remains a market gap, mainly consisting of pure - electric and fuel - powered vehicles. SAIC - GM plans to increase sales with the range - extended sedan, the Zhijing L7.

On October 20th, the Zhijing L7 started deliveries, and its current sales data is not yet known.

After the Chinese team took the lead, General Motors' electrification process in China has been accelerating. However, changes in the US market have also slowed down General Motors' overall electrification process. On October 14th, General Motors said in a regulatory filing that with a series of recent policy adjustments by the US government, including the termination of some consumer tax credits related to electric vehicle purchases and the relaxation of emission standards, it expects the penetration rate of electric vehicles in the US to slow down. At the same time, General Motors announced that it would record $1.6 billion in related expenses for re - evaluating its electric vehicle production capacity, of which $1.2 billion is for non - cash impairment and other expenses related to the adjustment of electric vehicle production capacity.

Through business restructuring, management reshuffle, and granting greater autonomy to the local team, General Motors' electrification process in China has significantly accelerated. The transformation of the Buick brand has initially shown results, especially the increase in the sales of the GL8 new energy vehicles and the launch of the Zhijing series, which demonstrate certain market potential. However, despite the continuous growth in sales and the improvement in profitability, whether General Motors can truly return to its peak still depends on its ability to continuously launch competitive products and achieve large - scale profitability in the fierce new energy competition.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20251024/v2_c3d9353b578a4177b8367a1e5f582751@5888275@ai_oswg1048118oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 19:19:11.446976

The project has elements of a ready-to-build acquisition, with the path to construction mostly cleared with a reported fully secured site control, clean title, and completed environmental and interconnection milestones.

A timely decision on the NTP will be key: Energy Vault also said it will safe harbor the asset with construction beginning on-site in Q4 2025, meaning it will aim to qualify the project for tax incentives under U.S. federal law by completing “significant” work or incurring at least 5% of total project.

Providing details of revenues, Energy Vault said it is in “advanced negotiations” with a counterparty for an eight-year offtake agreement, noting that the structure will be underwritten, and that the project is expected to deliver $17–20 million in annual revenues over the technical life of the project, or “$350 million in total.”

Asset Vault is backed by a $300 million preferred equity investment by Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC), along with the “monetization of Federal Investment Tax Credit-related funds,” and is said to be dedicated to developing, building, owning and operating energy storage assets globally.

Editor's Note: The above commentary formed part of the U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty discussion Dale Murden gave at a press conference hosted by the Texas International Produce Association","MISSION, Texas - I have been a longtime grower and water advocate in the valley and currently represent over 400 citrus growers as president of Texas Citrus Mutual. The purpose of today's press conference is to call on valley residents, city, county leaders, our farmers and ranchers to unite and urge the United States trade representatives to act in the upcoming USMCA review and tie the 1944 water treaty obligations through the trade act.

Linking the treaty to USMCA would make these obligations enforceable, finally allowing the United States to respond if Mexico fails to deliver. Water availability affects this region in every way. Whether it is regional growth, the economy, the environment, agriculture sustainability, or our community's health, we have for far too long traded with a partner in good faith that simply does not return that courtesy.

Over 6 million people rely on the Rio Grande for their daily water, including drinking, sanitation and public use. Reported repeated shortfalls by Mexico leave Valley City scrambling for emergency measures during droughts. Without guaranteed water, municipal systems cannot plan or invest for long-term reliability. Rio Grande is not just a water source, it is a living ecosystem. Reduced flows lead to dying wetlands. rising salinity, loss of fish and wildlife habitat. Healthy river systems mean cleaner water, stronger biodiversity and sustainable communities across the valley. By including the 1944 treaty under USMCA, the U.S. gains enforceable tools to protect both people and the environment through trade accountability.

A proposed annex on water delivery and trade compliance would treat water obligations as enforceable under USMCA chapter 24 of the environment. Protecting the river's flow is protecting the valley's health, welfare and future. Rio Grande is our lifeline. It is our drinking water. It is our wildlife habitat and the foundation of our health. When the river suffers, our communities do, too.

We want to encourage the public participation in the USTR comment process and highlight the importance of uniting the values of voice on water security and environmental protection. This is very important.

Whatever happens to us, happens to them on the Tamaulipas side. We are in it together really. It all stems from the Chihuahua State. There are two treaties. There is the treaty of the Rio Grande and there is the Colorado treaty where the US delivers water to Mexico without fail. We just want to see the same courtesy.

The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.
The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.
Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors.
“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.

Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.

Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.

Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.

“The risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.

There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.

“I still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,” Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.

Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

Santee Cooper executives credited President Donald Trump's executive order in May calling for the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years for opening the door to the potential agreement.

“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.

Santee Cooper was the minority partner with what was then South Carolina Electric and Gas when construction on the two new nuclear plants started in 2013 at the V.C. Summer site — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Columbia — where SCE&G was already operating a reactor.

The project needed to be finished in seven years to get tax credits to keep the project's cost from overwhelming the utilities, but it ended up behind schedule almost immediately.

Executives lied about the problems to keep money coming in. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

Two nuclear reactors built in a similar way in Georgia went $17 billion over budget before they were fully operational in 2023.

SolarPower Europe’s submission to the European Commission calls for the energy sector to move beyond fossil fuel supply and build energy security on solar, storage, flexibility, and electrification.

“Europe’s energy security strategy must evolve with its energy system. Energy security policies can no longer incentivise fossil fuel storage or imports. It must be built on renewables, flexibility, and electrification.” – Dries Acke, Deputy CEO of SolarPower Europe

Solar power and battery storage systems already play a vital role in Europe’s energy market, saving about $33 billion in fossil fuel imports in the summer of 2022 alone. By implementing measures that strengthen the renewable energy sector, Europe can potentially reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, which would protect consumers from price volatility in the energy market.

SolarPower Europe has suggested several measures to ensure energy security and stability

SolarPower Europe is a pioneering organization focused on the promotion of the renewable energy sector, with a particular importance placed on the solar power sector. The organization submitted a document to the European Commission outlining several measures that the EU could undertake to accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. Among the suggestions are:

Unlock the full potential of the renewable energy sector in Europe: SolarPower Europe suggests measures to ensure solar, batteries, and inverters are allowed to provide flexible power to the European energy sector, balancing and grid stability services.

Establish a robust EU cybersecurity framework: Cybersecurity is not only important for protecting your emails and private information, but could also protect distributed energy systems and inverters in Europe through a variety of measures, including strict remote-control limitations and strong harmonized standards in the energy sector in Europe.

Build resilience against economic and climate issues: The EU should develop a flexible, decarbonized, renewables-based system that shields citizens from fluctuating energy prices due to geopolitical and climate change problems.

SolarPower Europe’s position paper could become the standard for the global energy sector to address the issues that have stagnated the adoption of renewable energy across the world. As Europe sees record-breaking solar projects being commissioned, the need to accelerate the transition to the energy sector has become more pressing than ever.

The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.
The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.
Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors.
“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.

Santee Cooper’s board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.

Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.

Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.

“The risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,” Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.

There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.

“I still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,” Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it’s not feasible.

Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

Santee Cooper executives credited President Donald Trump’s executive order in May calling for the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years for opening the door to the potential agreement.

“You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said.

Santee Cooper was the minority partner with what was then South Carolina Electric and Gas when construction on the two new nuclear plants started in 2013 at the V.C. Summer site — about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of Columbia — where SCE&G was already operating a reactor.

The project needed to be finished in seven years to get tax credits to keep the project’s cost from overwhelming the utilities, but it ended up behind schedule almost immediately.

Executives lied about the problems to keep money coming in. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e56015d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3870x2177+0+211/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F45%2F44%2Fd8c1d81c60f83b6be03ab55f45ca%2F5e7d7bdfb4994c3ba51986d7a562da24,N,,2025-10-24 16:04:55.555827

On Friday, Aclara Resources Inc. announced plans to build a $277 million facility at the Port of Vinton. The project will strengthen the nation's advanced technology supply chain, according to a Louisiana Economic Development news release.

At the new facility, Aclara will use its proprietary technology to produce heavy rare earth elements. These metals are necessary for electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones and robots that rely on advanced permanent magnets. The operation in Louisiana will process material from Aclara's mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile to provide a reliable, sustainable U.S. supply of these materials.

Aclara's Vinton facility will create roughly 140 new jobs, according to LED. The site at the port has been prequalified for industrial development through both environmental and engineering reviews.

Aclara chose the location after evaluating dozens of potential sites across the U.S. because of its proximity to key chemical suppliers, access to the Gulf Coast and its industrial workforce.

To secure the project, the state of Louisiana offered Aclara Resources an incentives package that includes LED's FastStart workforce development software and a $3 million performance-based grant for utility and infrastructure improvements.

“Aclara’s investment in Vinton marks a defining moment for Southwest Louisiana,"" Calcasieu Parish Police Jury President Judd Bares said in a prepared statement. ""This project not only brings hundreds of high-quality jobs and significant economic growth, but it also positions our region at the forefront of America’s sustainable rare earth production and advanced technology supply chain.""

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and wrap up in 2027. The process will start with the rare-earth separation plant, followed by potential future expansions to support downstream processing and alloy production.

""I actually spent the summer before my freshman year in college interning in a physics lab at Rice University,"" Han, now 50, told Houston Public Media. ""And then I went to college and realized that, actually, while I still find physics extremely interesting, that the kind of social-political world was so interesting to me that I wanted to figure out how to make sense of it in a different way.""

Now, Han is a Harvard and Stanford-educated professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. She's also the recent recipient of the MacArthur Fellows Program, commonly referred to as the genius grant — an $800,000, no-strings-attached grant for researchers, educators, and artists.

The grant isn't limited to any single type of research or art. Previous recipients include author Matthew Desmond, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Han’s recognition as a genius grant recipient is unique, as she’s the first political scientist to receive the grant since 2001.

""In the immediate moment, I was like, ‘Is this a prank?'"" Han said. ""And then, I think after it sort of sunk in for a little bit, I honestly was just really flabbergasted. It's such an incredible honor to be part of this cohort of other people who received the award.""

Much of Han's work focuses on activism and what drives it, which Han calls pulling people off the sidelines into public life. Her most recent book, ""Undivided: The Quest for Racial Solidarity in an American Church,"" discusses a Cincinnati megachurch focused on anti-racist work, was published in 2024.

""Even if it is a little bit cliche, it is true that one of the great things about places like Houston and Texas is that there’s a spirit of entrepreneurialism and independence, in which people just go out and seize good ideas and act on them,"" Han said. ""And I think that’s one thing that I’ve always carried with me, is the kind of courage to try different things, even if they don’t necessarily seem like they’re the most probable, or expected, thing to have done. And so that sort of independence of spirit is something that I think probably does come from growing up in a place like Houston.""

The energy storage segment provided a bright spot, with deployments reaching a record 6.9 gigawatt-hours, contributing $2.4 billion in revenue.
The expiration of tax credits could level the playing field, forcing Tesla to compete on merits like technology and brand loyalty alone.","Tesla Inc.’s third-quarter earnings report for 2025 revealed a stark reality for the electric-vehicle giant: profits plummeted nearly 40% year-over-year, even as revenue hit a record high. The company reported net income of $1.9 billion, down from $3.1 billion in the same period last year, amid rising costs and the expiration of key federal tax credits that had previously bolstered sales. This downturn underscores the challenges Tesla faces in a maturing EV market, where competition is intensifying and external incentives are waning.

Investors reacted swiftly, with Tesla’s stock dropping about 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, attempted to pivot attention during the earnings call toward future growth drivers like autonomous driving technology and robotics, but the immediate financials painted a picture of vulnerability. Revenue climbed to $25.2 billion, driven by a surge in vehicle deliveries—approximately 462,000 units—fueled by buyers rushing to capitalize on expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credits before year-end.

Navigating Post-Tax Credit Realities

Analysts noted that without these credits, Tesla’s core automotive margins would have been even slimmer. According to a report from Mashable, the company was “buoyed by tax credits and regulatory carbon credits—it can’t rely on either going forward.” This reliance highlights a broader issue: Tesla’s profitability has been propped up by one-time boosts, including $890 million in regulatory credits from selling emissions allowances to other automakers.

Higher operating expenses also weighed heavily, with costs jumping 17% due to investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure and research for next-generation vehicles. Musk emphasized during the call that these expenditures are essential for long-term dominance, pointing to advancements in Full Self-Driving software and the Optimus humanoid robot as potential revenue streams. Yet, skeptics argue that such bets remain speculative, with regulatory hurdles for robotaxis still unresolved.

Revenue Growth Amid Profit Squeeze

Despite the profit miss—earnings per share came in at $0.72, below Wall Street’s $0.78 estimate—Tesla achieved its highest quarterly revenue ever, as detailed in coverage from CNBC. This was partly attributed to strong sales in the U.S., where the tax credit deadline spurred demand for models like the Model Y and Model 3. Internationally, however, growth was uneven, with softening demand in Europe and China amid economic headwinds and rising competition from local players like BYD.

The energy storage segment provided a bright spot, with deployments reaching a record 6.9 gigawatt-hours, contributing $2.4 billion in revenue. This diversification is crucial as Tesla shifts focus beyond pure EV sales, but it wasn’t enough to offset the automotive segment’s margin compression, which fell to 17.3% from 18.1% a year ago.

Future Bets and Investor Sentiment

Looking ahead, Musk outlined ambitious plans, including expanding robotaxi services by year’s end and launching more affordable models in 2026. As reported by Electrek, despite the earnings decline, Tesla’s leadership remains optimistic about scaling production and AI integration. However, with tariffs on imported components adding pressure—evident in a $200 million hit this quarter—the path forward demands operational efficiency.

Industry insiders view this quarter as a pivot point. Tesla’s valuation, still lofty at over 60 times forward earnings, hinges on executing these moonshot initiatives. Business Insider highlighted Musk’s comments on future products during the call, noting stock volatility as investors weigh immediate profits against visionary promises. For now, the profit plunge serves as a reminder that even Tesla isn’t immune to market cycles, pushing the company to innovate faster or risk losing its edge in an increasingly crowded field.

Strategic Implications for the EV Sector

Broader implications ripple through the auto industry. Rivals like Ford and General Motors are ramping up their EV offerings, often with more accessible pricing, while Tesla grapples with price cuts that have eroded margins. The expiration of tax credits could level the playing field, forcing Tesla to compete on merits like technology and brand loyalty alone.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-77bcdfaa-d8f2-4725-a64b-6f77a747eac3.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 15:18:46.764779

Sign up to get it every Friday.

Energy affordability has become a flash point over the past few months. It’s a key issue in this year’s gubernatorial races. It’s something President Donald Trump has promised to fix by boosting fossil-fuel production. And of course, it’s showing up in the bills that arrive in mailboxes every month.

Three-quarters of Americans count electricity costs as a source of stress in their lives, according to a new Associated Press-NORC survey. But a recent study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory provides more nuance to the conversation. When adjusted for inflation, 31 continental states actually saw their power prices decline from 2019 to 2024, while the other 17 states experienced increases.

One reason why some states saw prices jump? Utility spending on disaster recovery and preparedness. Take California, where utilities have added billions of dollars in wildfire-recovery costs and mitigation programs to retail electricity prices in recent years, the national lab found. It’s a bracing fact as the planet warms and disasters become more frequent and destructive.

But the report also tempered fears that the growth of data centers and other power-hungry industries will jack up electricity prices. Grid maintenance has been a top driver of increased electricity costs over the last few years, but spreading these expenses among more customers — like data centers and manufacturers — has helped lower retail electricity prices, researchers found. One caveat: That dynamic tends to benefit large, commercial consumers more than residential ones.

The Trump administration has elevated fossil fuels as a solution to rising electricity bills, positing that more coal and gas power can cut prices. But building a new gas-fired plant is increasingly expensive and takes years, and the U.S. is preparing to ship more liquefied natural gas out of the country anyway.

If you look at two rare examples of power utilities reducing their rates, it’s clear that falling back on coal isn’t the answer either. In Oregon, Idaho Power Co. has asked regulators to lower electricity prices by nearly 1%, saying the closure of a coal-fired power unit and demolition of another coal plant have brought down costs. And in Virginia, where a state law is pushing the electricity sector to lower emissions, Appalachian Power cited the addition of renewable power in its request to lower rates. West Virginia is meanwhile pushing to keep its coal plants running — a move that Appalachian Power said would raise prices for its electricity customers in that state.

But putting the national lab’s inflation-adjusted numbers aside, it’s clear that rising utility bills are reaching a fever pitch across the country — and it’s going to take both more clean energy and smarter utility regulation to rein them in.

Trump sinks a global shipping-decarbonization plan

Until a few weeks ago, the International Maritime Organization was on track to approve a global shipping-decarbonization strategy. That is, until the Trump administration launched a last-minute offensive and got the United Nations body to delay adoption of the plan, Maria Gallucci and Dan McCarthy reported late last week.

The tens of thousands of shipping vessels that travel the oceans are responsible for about 3% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. But as Maria points out in her follow-up dive into shipping decarbonization, the industry doesn’t currently have much incentive to replace dirty diesel-powered vessels with lower-carbon alternatives.

Some good news, some bad news for U.S. battery startups

The U.S. Department of Energy slashed another wave of federal funding this week, targeting $700 million in grants for battery and other clean manufacturing projects. Nearly half of that funding had been awarded to Ascend Elements, which had already canceled a portion of its planned battery-recycling facility in Kentucky earlier this year. A smaller portion was going to American Battery Technology Co., which said it will carry on with its lithium mine and refinery project in Nevada.

But it wasn’t a bad week for every battery company. Redwood Materials raised $350 million, which it’ll use to expand its unique energy-storage business that packages together used EV batteries into grid-scale resources that can power data centers and other industrial users. And Pila Energy raised $4 million to keep building batteries that provide backup power to large appliances, but are more affordable and portable than whole-home systems like the Tesla Powerwall.

The strategy, driven by the Trump administration, seeks to secure decades-long contracts with allies in Europe and Asia, locking in demand for US fossil fuels and reinforcing Washington’s influence in global energy markets.

Under the new policy framework, the European Union has committed to importing up to US$1.15 trillion in US energy, primarily LNG, by 2028, which would represent more than four times its current import levels. Indonesia has signed deals worth approximately US$24 billion, while Japan is exploring similar agreements. These deals are less about free trade and more about geopolitical leverage, as the United States uses trade access and security assurances to encourage dependence on its energy exports.

The United States’ position as a dominant energy exporter was made possible by the fracking boom that transformed its production landscape. By 2019, the country had become a net exporter of oil and gas, and in 2023, it surpassed Qatar and Australia as the world’s top LNG supplier.

For emerging and industrial economies, this US strategy poses both opportunities and risks. While LNG imports offer a short-term solution to energy security challenges, they also carry financial and environmental costs. The construction of new LNG terminals and gas-fired power plants can tie countries to fossil fuel use for decades, potentially diverting investment from renewable energy and electrification. Analysts warn that this approach could make participating economies less competitive over time, given the rapid decline in renewable energy costs and the increasing affordability of battery storage technologies.

In Latin America, and particularly in Mexico, the implications of US energy diplomacy are significant. Mexico’s current energy policy prioritizes domestic production and energy sovereignty, but US export growth could challenge those ambitions by increasing competition in regional markets. Additionally, higher US tariffs imposed on India for continuing to purchase Russian energy demonstrate Washington’s willingness to use trade pressure to align partners with its energy objectives, a move that could influence future trade and energy decisions in Mexico and other American partners.

Critics of the US strategy argue that it risks undermining global climate objectives. Expanding fossil fuel infrastructure contradicts international commitments to reduce emissions and could delay the global transition toward renewable energy sources. Long-term LNG contracts could also limit the flexibility of importing nations to adapt to technological and policy shifts aimed at decarbonization.

For countries evaluating new energy partnerships, including those in Latin America and Asia, the challenge lies in balancing short-term supply security with long-term sustainability.

The global solar industry is putting up the clean kilowatts at a record pace, the latest example being a supersized 1-gigawatt solar-plus-storage project in the United Arab Emirates, aimed at delivering solar energy on a reliable, baseload-worthy, 24/7 basis. To gild the green lily, the system is designed to be copied all over the world, pushing fossil fuels out of the power generation picture. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has been pouring all his energy into…building a ballroom. Yes, a ballroom.

The Global Solar Industry Rocketing Upwards

To be fair, building a ballroom sounds like lots of fun, and President Trump could use a break from a very busy year. He has been working nonstop for months, particularly in regards to the US offshore wind industry. After all, it takes a lot of effort to torpedo an entire domestic industry, and there are still some remaining shreds of activity to stomp on.

So much for the US offshore wind industry. Onshore wind and solar activity have also suffered setbacks under Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” plan. Even so, the facts don’t lie. The International Renewable Energy Agency affirms the verifiable fact that wind and solar are the most affordable, accessible, and economically beneficial energy resources available today.

The global solar industry has been particularly adept at picking up the pace of renewable energy. “Solar generation grew by 306 TWh (+31%) in the first half of 2025, its fastest absolute growth on record,” the energy data platform Ember notes.

“If this pace continues, solar is on track to remain the fastest-growing source of electricity for the 21st consecutive year and to outpace wind growth in absolute terms for the fourth year in a row,” the organization adds.

The UAE Solar Industry Blows A Giant Raspberry At US President Trump

Facts, schmacts. President Trump exercises power by enforcing his own alternate reality, drilled into the collective consciousness of the public with laser-sharp precision across his Cabinet. US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, for example, has declared that that energy storage does not even exist. Agriculture Secretary Sue Rollins can’t tell the difference between solar panels and buildings. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has also registered his two cents, insisting that “[w]ind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.”

Into this picture steps the United Arab Emirates. A seven-member federation of powerful oil and gas producers, the UAE nevertheless served as host of the 28th United Nations Conference of Parties on climate change. Taking place in UAE member Dubai in 2023, COP28 produced the UAE Consensus, described as “an unprecedented reference to transitioning away from all fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner in this critical decade to enable the world to reach net zero emissions by 2050, in keeping with the science.”

As if to drag President Trump along with Secretaries Burgum, Rollins, and Wright all in one blow, earlier today the UAE announced that energy storage actually does exist in space and time, and it is coming to drink your fossil fuel milkshake.

“UAE Breaks Ground on World’s First Gigascale Round-the-Clock Renewable Energy Project, Setting a New Global Standard For Clean Energy,” reads the headline of a press statement circulated earlier today by Masdar, the UAE’s sustainable energy showcase company, referring to the 5.2 gigawatt solar power plant integrated with a BESS (battery energy storage system) of 19 gigawatt-hours in the $6 billion project.

In case anyone over in the White House (or, what’s left of it) missed the message, Masdar emphasizes that the the project delivers the exact same baseload reliability championed by Trump’s “American Energy Dominance policy.” The company states that the project will deliver 1 gigawatt of “baseload renewable energy around the clock.”

Global Solar Industry To US: You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet

In the press statement announcing the new project, the entire UAE did all but point and laugh at US President Donald Trump and his reality-denying appointees.

“Masdar and Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC), reimagines the potential of renewable energy by overcoming the barrier of intermittency,” Masdar explains.

“By producing gigascale baseload energy at a globally competitive tariff for the first time, the project sets a new international benchmark and reaffirms the UAE’s leadership position in renewable energy development,” the firm explains again.

Twisting the knife just a little bit more, Masdar also affirms that the system is designed with the global solar industry in mind, stating that “the project will act as a blueprint that can be replicated internationally to meet the growing demand for clean, secure, round-the-clock power.”

The company’s CEO, Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, also chipped in his two cents regarding the baseload-worthiness of solar energy. He described the project as “a blueprint for the world, demonstrating that renewable energy can be dispatched around the clock.”

Ballroom-Builder Casts The US Solar Industry Aside

To gild the green lily with yet another layer of green, Masdar’s new project also demonstrates that the global solar industry can deliver electricity faster, and more economically, than any other energy industry. Masdar expects the facility to be operation by 2027, which is just around the corner.

In terms of government support, Masdar further notes that the project has the enthusiastic endorsement of UAE policy makers at the highest level, including His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and His Highness Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council.

Their Highnesses! No wonder President Trump is obsessed with the construction of an enormous ballroom on the grounds of the White House. He can’t claim the title of “His Highness,” but he can build a glitzy, gold-drenched ballroom worthy of the finest palaces in the world.

If the ballroom ever gets built, that is. So far, the project has only employed a smattering of demolition experts, who demolished the entire East Wing of the White House in short order.

Meanwhile, Masdar notes that its new 1-gigawatt renewable energy project alone will generate 10,000 new jobs for the UAE, factoring in component manufacturing jobs and service jobs along with the actual construction work, while supporting the UAE goals of economic diversification leadership in the AI sector, too.

The outlook is somewhat gloomier for the US solar industry and related jobs in energy storage, manufacturing, and the like. Still, Trump has a long way to go before he can completely snuff out the demand for electricity. The wind will keep blowing and the sun will keep shining long after Trump leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully one hopes, this time.

Solar developers in the US are already gearing up for a fresh burst of activity in the years following. That includes the US branch of Masdar, which has expressed a target of 25 gigawatts in the US over the next 10 years. The company states that it already has a 5.8-gigawatt US renewable energy portfolio under its belt.

As of August 27, 2025, Illinois Pollution Control Board expanded its hazardous waste rules to include paint and paint-related waste as universal waste.

Manufacturers selling architectural paint in the state must run stewardship programs to collect leftover products.

The change makes managing oil-based paints easier by placing them under the universal waste framework. This affects paint producers, retailers, and facilities handling paint disposal.

The new system reduces compliance burdens while promoting safer and more consistent paint waste management.

On September 12, 2025, in the Illinois Register, the Pollution Control Board adopted changes to hazardous waste rules to align with two recent state laws.

The Paint Stewardship Act requires manufacturers of architectural paint sold at retail to create and operate post-consumer stewardship programs. Another law allows oil-based paints to be collected and managed as universal waste.

What changed

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) proposed amendments to add paint and paint-related waste (PPRW) to the existing list of universal wastes. This list already includes batteries, pesticides, mercury equipment, lamps, certain household wastes, and very small generator wastes. By adding PPRW, Illinois makes paint waste subject to the same streamlined requirements that apply to these other universal wastes.

Impact on companies

Paint manufacturers and retailers must participate in stewardship programs, ensuring leftover architectural paints are collected and managed.

Waste facilities and businesses handling paint benefit from simpler compliance rules under the universal waste system.

Instead of full hazardous waste management obligations, they can follow the lighter requirements already applied to other universal wastes.

The change encourages more consistent collection and disposal of leftover paints, reducing risks of improper handling.

Deadlines and enforcement

The law required IEPA to propose rules within 60 days of its effective date, and the Board had 180 days after receiving the proposal to adopt them. These steps have now been completed. The Pollution Control Board enforces the rules, and companies must comply with the new requirements as of September 12, 2025.

Reason for the change

The goal is to make paint disposal safer, easier, and more environmentally sound. Paint stewardship programs shift responsibility to producers, while the universal waste classification reduces administrative burdens for businesses and improves collection efficiency.

Compliance support

Companies can refer to Illinois Pollution Control Board guidance and IEPA resources on universal waste management for detailed instructions on how to set up paint stewardship programs and meet the new requirements.

Cardinal & Pine: Why some politicians might literally be making you sicker

In 2023, the head of the EPA called PFAS “one of the most pressing environmental and public health concerns in the modern world.” PFAS takes a long, long time to break down in nature, or in your body, and they’re linked to cancer, birth defects, thyroid and liver issues, immune system deficiencies and a lot more.

Testing at Seymour Johnson found PFAS concentrations on levels thousands of times beyond EPA’s health advisory level…

Many parts of the federal government are undergoing big budget cuts this year under President Trump. Because of that, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has quietly delayed the cleanup at Seymour Johnson by five years, according to the New York Times.

For years, Whatley, the former head of the North Carolina GOP and the Republican National Committee, was a lobbyist for oil and gas companies, pushing back against government regulations. It doesn’t really track that he’d do that and be a crusader for regulating and cleaning up PFAS, right?

You rarely get to say without hyperbole that some candidates are taking a position that would actively poison you. But that’s not farfetched when it comes to PFAS.

This market-driven innovation increased the supply – and subsequently drove down the costs – of natural gas.
As the energy generation mix shifted towards natural gas and other technologies, coal’s downstream consumption and production subsequently declined.
This downstream effect stands in stark contrast to the needs of the energy sector, which needs significantly more capital investment to keep up with our energy infrastructure.
Ultimately addressing the expected growth in electricity demand will require more capital investment in energy production, transportation, and infrastructure.","The U.S. energy grid stands at a crossroads. It is facing an unprecedented rise in electricity demand driven in no small part by the growth of artificial intelligence and high-tech manufacturing. Simultaneously, supply is being curtailed by growing power plant retirements. It doesn’t take an advanced degree in economics to foresee the consequences.

Policy makers are scrambling for answers before the inevitable power shortages and skyrocketing prices kick in. But for every potential solution that would ease the grid’s strain – keeping plants online, expediting permitting reviews and cutting bureaucratic red tape – policy actions are being taken that would damage energy industries’ ability to attract and utilize capital investment.

Last year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considered and then held off on changing its long standing blanket authorization policy for investment firms. The current rule requires investment firms to receive FERC approval for purchasing a utility company’s securities only when acquiring more than $10 million worth. The commission was contemplating whether this so-called blanket authorization level is too generous. Of particular concern were investment managers’ passive investment strategies – think index funds – that require these investors to continue allocate a set percentage of their assets into utilities and energy companies.

Increasing the stringency of the blanket authorization would have adversely impacted the U.S. energy industry. At the time, I warned that creating “additional investment barriers” would hurt utilities’ ability “to raise the necessary capital,” hindering their ability to “expand capacity and improve the current energy infrastructure.”

Thankfully the FERC agreed. As then-FERC Chairman Mark Christie wrote, while BlackRock’s environmental advocacy raises concerns, “public utilities face already large and still growing capital needs, including to fund investment in greatly needed utility assets, such as power generation.” Given these capital needs, and BlackRock’s pledge “not to use its holdings to influence utility management,” extending BlackRock’s blanket authorization will help ensure the utility sector has access to the resources it needs to continue expanding the grid’s capacity

Having just dodged that bullet, a new threat to increased energy investment threatens to do the same – a lawsuit led by the Attorney General of Texas. The lawsuit alleges Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street conspired to artificially depress the coal market through anti-competitive practices.

The lawsuit is a response to these investment manager’s investments in coal companies given their public support and past membership in these same environmental organizations, which are promoting policies that are detrimental to the coal industry. As I have previously argued, the asset manager’s support of these environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies is troubling and creates significant conflicts of interest between the asset managers fiduciary responsibilities and their ESG commitments.

However, in practice, the AG actions will simply restrict the coal industry’s ability to raise capital – clearly contradicting the AG’s stated purpose. As the FERC decision emphasizes, prioritizing the need for an efficient allocation of capital is essential if the U.S. grid is going to deliver Americans cheap and plentiful electricity.

The lawsuit also fails to account for fundamental market changes created by the fracking revolution. This market-driven innovation increased the supply – and subsequently drove down the costs – of natural gas. Relatively cheaper and lower-emission natural gas radically changed the economics of electricity generation. It is mostly thanks to relatively cheaper natural gas that coal operations have decreased across the country.

In 2005, coal was the largest source for electricity, generating about 50 percent of the nation’s electricity. Natural gas generated roughly 19 percent. Over the latest 12 months, natural gas accounted for 42 percent of total generation while coal accounted for a mere 16 percent; their shares of electricity generation have swapped. This reversal of generation share was fostered by over 100 coal-fired plants that were converted to, or replaced by, natural gas-fired plants between 2011 and 2019. As the energy generation mix shifted towards natural gas and other technologies, coal’s downstream consumption and production subsequently declined.

Although Attorney General Paxton claims to be protecting the coal industry, if the lawsuit is successful these investment firms would likely be forced to divest their holdings in the coal companies listed in the suit. This forced liquidation will deny the coal industry access to a significant source of capital. According to an analysis by the American Council for Capital Formation’s chief economist, the forced divestments would deny the collective coal industry more than $17.5 billion in capital. This downstream effect stands in stark contrast to the needs of the energy sector, which needs significantly more capital investment to keep up with our energy infrastructure.

Ultimately addressing the expected growth in electricity demand will require more capital investment in energy production, transportation, and infrastructure. Cutting off investment sources – whether through FERC rule making or AG lawsuits – increases the likelihood of future blackouts and higher costs for consumers. If the goal is to promote widespread prosperity, such actions are simply the wrong policy path.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68fba7d5bae96cef5245b749/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-24 14:08:00.328502

High energy costs are choking America’s potential.

They’re not just raising our utility bills — they are raising the price of everything: groceries, gas, housing, and the American Dream itself.

If energy drives prosperity, federal energy policies restrict it.

Americans for Prosperity is working to change federal energy policy to unleash American energy independence through its “Prosperity Is Possible” campaign.

This includes a “Road to Prosperity” tour stop at the Montana Energy Summit, hosted by Gov. Greg Gianforte and the Montana Chamber of Commerce.

High energy costs and rising frustration

Families are tightening budgets.

Businesses are delaying investments.

And it’s not because we lack resources. It’s because we’re not allowed to use them.

The United States sits on vast reserves of energy, yet prices stay high because bureaucracy blocks production.

In fact, permitting delays due to restrictive federal energy policies place $4.5 billion in customer savings and 150,000 American jobs at risk.

Every new layer of regulation adds costs, slows innovation, and puts American workers on the sidelines.

A maze of red tape

For decades, Washington has piled layers of rules that stall prosperity.

Because of these federal policies and subsequent lawsuits, challenging approvals have resulted in:

Energy projects that take five to 10 years just for approval, due to unclear and inconsistent permitting requirements

Efficient plants like Montana’s Colstrip power plant facing shutdowns because of arbitrary EPA rules

American energy lagging behind countries which are modernizing their review processes to shorten timelines and attract investment American energy lagging behind countries that are modernizing their review processes to shorten timelines and attract investment

Americans for Prosperity in Montana shows what’s possible

“Montana fuels America — and America needs Montana,” said AFP–Montana State Director Jesse Ramos. “Here’s the truth: If we get energy, work, and innovation policy right, Montana can lead the next American energy renaissance.”

Voices in Montana made it clear: Independence is possible if government gets out of the way.

Ramos told a story that cut straight to the heart:

Libby, Montana, a once-proud timber town, was silenced, not by exhaustion of resources but by D.C. regulations.

“The mill didn’t close because we ran out of trees,” Ramos said. “It closed because Washington decided it knew better.”

“The day the mill closed, men sat in their trucks, staring at the ground. They weren’t losing their paycheck, they were losing their purpose.”

The Montana Energy Summit brought together industry leaders, legislators, and innovators who were determined to make sure towns like Libby have strong futures.

The panels and speakers explored what real reform could look like, including:

Permitting reform that turns decade-long reviews into decisions made in months, so projects like the Montanore Mine, first proposed in the 1980s, can finally move forward.

Modernizing the grid to prevent rolling blackouts, especially in winters when negative-30-degree temperatures can make blackouts deadly. Modernizing the grid to prevent rolling blackouts, especially in winters when minus-30 temperatures can make blackouts deadly.

Balancing stewardship and strength, letting Montanans manage their forests and resources responsibly instead of letting them burn.

Diversifying energy innovation, from advanced nuclear to clean coal and projects that harness local ingenuity, not federal mandates.

Reclaiming dignity in work by ensuring Montana’s loggers, miners, and engineers can once again earn respect by building the backbone of American energy.

Across every panel, one truth echoed:

Fewer federal energy restrictions result in American abundance.

Clear the path and let Americans embrace energy independence

It isn’t just in Montana.

You see it.

All over the country, Americans must make tough decisions when energy costs go up.

Luckily, the solution is remarkably simple.

Washington must let innovators and builders … innovate and build, instead of burying them in paperwork. This will allow everyday people to embrace the American Dream and thrive.

This is possible if Congress:

Passes permitting reform and streamlines decisions in the permitting process

Modernizes infrastructure and expands the grid to keep up with the demands of electric energy and AI expansions

Trusts workers on the ground to protect the land and build a sustainable future

Allows for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, allowing states and localities to embrace energy that makes sense for them

Take action: Tell Congress to work on energy independence and reduce federal energy policies

Our Prosperity Is Possible campaign is rallying citizens all over the country to tell Congress: enough with delays and red tape.Our Prosperity Is Possible campaign is rallying citizens all over the country to tell Congress: Enough with delays and red tape.

In addition to restoring dignity and keeping energy prices low, this is about ensuring America remains a leader in the global energy race and keeps prosperity within reach for every American family.

If lower energy prices and energy independence matter to you, please take a minute to sign our survey telling Congress to get to work on American energy independence.

PowerTransitions has been talking with local officials and has an agreement in place with the owner of the Vernon property, NorthStar Group Services, to potentially lease the site.

Vermont Public Service Commissioner Kerrick Johnson has requested a meeting with the company to get more details on its proposal to develop the approximately 140 acres along the Connecticut River in Windham County.

“Once I became aware that there is a relationship between PowerTransitions and NorthStar, in our role to advocate on behalf of all Vermont ratepayers, this is a part of our departmental due diligence,” Johnson said.

Johnson said any consideration of siting a project in Vernon would have to take into account the high-level nuclear waste that is being stored near the former nuclear power plant.

“The site in Vernon has strengths and weaknesses,” Johnson said. “The high-level radioactive waste has to be viewed as something that has to be respected and avoided at all costs.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on its website, says battery storage systems “have raised legitimate safety concerns,” because they can catch fire and release harmful gases that pose health risks to nearby residents and first responders.

A representative from the company has been meeting with the Vernon Planning Commission about the plan.

“It’s got our interest,” said Vernon Planning Commission Chair Jim Pinkerton. “At this point this is kind of back-of-the-envelope sort of thing, but the demand for power is increasing all over the place, and there’s no telling where those industries are going to go.”

PowerTransitions first contacted NorthStar about two years ago, according to NorthStar CEO Scott State.

PowerTransitions acquires operating and retired power generation and industrial facilities, according to the company’s website, to “transform them into modern, resilient energy infrastructure campuses.”

State said he introduced the PowerTransitions officials to the town of Vernon, adding that it is still NorthStar’s intention to, “allow redevelopment of the site for a use preferred by the town of Vernon.”

NorthStar acquired the closed Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in 2019, becoming the first company in the United States to own a nuclear facility with the intention of dismantling and decommissioning the property.

Since then, NorthStar has removed more than 76,000 tons of material, much of which is low-level radioactive waste, that has been shipped to a storage facility in Texas.

Most of these funds come from federal tax credits, including at least $65 million(link is external) from the enhanced credits.
That’s a big increase over 2015, before the enhanced credits took effect.
What losing the credits means for Vermonters Everyone receiving credits will pay more for healthcare if the enhanced credits expire.
Conclusion While the enhanced credits do not expire until the end of the year, the enrollment period for 2026 begins on Nov. 1.","Public Assets Institute(link is external) One of the main issues at stake in the federal government shutdown is the expiration of enhanced healthcare premium tax credits, which help people buy insurance through the state marketplace. If Congress does nothing, the credits will expire at the end of 2025, and millions of Americans will see large increases in the cost of their healthcare.

Among these are as many as 30,000 Vermonters. And because Vermont’s exchange has the highest premiums in the country, Vermonters will see the biggest increases. Middle-income participants are looking at an additional $10,000 a year for an individual and $32,000 for a family of four.

How the credits work

Vermont’s health insurance marketplace launched in 2014 as part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). The goal was to provide access to affordable health insurance to consumers who can’t get it through work or public programs. The ACA requires every state to operate an exchange with multiple qualified health plans(link is external) and helps cover the cost of the premiums.

Taxpayers using the exchange receive federal premium tax credits (PTCs), which are based on the cost of the benchmark silver plan and are often paid directly to the insurer.1(link is external) Recipients pay a percentage of their income toward the premium, on a sliding income scale, and the PTC covers the rest.

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act—enacted to help people weather the financial insecurity of the pandemic—enhanced the PTCs for 2021 and 2022(link is external) by providing larger subsidies to eligible households and expanding the number of households eligible. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 then extended the enhanced benefits through 2025.

The enhanced credits cover the full cost of the silver benchmark premium for those earning less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level. They decrease the cost for those between 150 and 400 percent of poverty and expand assistance to people with incomes over 400 percent of poverty.

Vermont is one of a handful of states that provide additional assistance(link is external) with the cost of premiums, targeted at those under 300 percent of the federal poverty level. It also provides assistance(link is external) to lower out-of-pocket costs for services.

Who gets them, and how much

In 2025, over 30,000 Vermonters on the exchange received an estimated total of $350 million to help cover the cost of care. Most of these funds come from federal tax credits, including at least $65 million(link is external) from the enhanced credits. Vermont provides just under 2 percent of the assistance ($6.2 million). Participants range across income and age; a third are between 55 to 64 years old.

Over 90 percent of exchange participants qualify for federal subsidies, and about a third receive the additional state support. The average federal credit for Vermonters is $11,400. That’s a big increase over 2015, before the enhanced credits took effect. Then, 22,500 Vermont recipients received an average credit of $3,300. Much of the increase occurred in 2024 and 2025, after the temporary pandemic expansion of Medicaid ended.

What losing the credits means for Vermonters

Everyone receiving credits will pay more for healthcare if the enhanced credits expire. Those with incomes under 400 percent of poverty would pay between 0.5 percent and 4.6 percent more of their income for the benchmark plan, after accounting for state assistance. Middle-income Vermonters, earning more than 400 percent of poverty, would no longer receive assistance. They would pay the full cost of their premiums if they continue to buy healthcare on the exchange.

Because Vermont has the highest premiums in the country and some of the fastest growth in costs in recent years, Vermonters will be hit particularly hard. An individual making $63,000 would pay $15,000 a year for the benchmark plan—nearly a quarter of their income. A family of four at the same poverty level could see an increase of over $30,000 a year.

Conclusion

While the enhanced credits do not expire until the end of the year, the enrollment period for 2026 begins on Nov. 1. Vermonters looking to enroll will be facing serious sticker shock. In the absence of federal action, many states are considering how to fill the gap and ensure healthcare access for their residents. With the highest hikes in the country, Vermont must take action to ensure access to care and to bring down its cost.

Without action, many Vermonters will be priced out of healthcare on January 1, 2026.

Both the base and enhanced federal premium tax credits are calculated to cover only as much as the cost of the benchmark silver plan. If participants choose a more expensive plan, they pay the difference. In Vermont in 2025, the gold plan was cheaper than the benchmark silver plan. [↩(link is external)]

Texas Insider Report WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today marks Day 24 of the federal government shutdown. I was in Washington this week, working to get the government reopened. The House has already passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government at previously approved levels while negotiations on long-term appropriations continue. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have refused to act, choosing instead to hold up government funding in exchange for extending costly COVID-era Obamacare subsidies, a policy that should be debated separately, not tied to basic government operations. These subsidies, known as the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, were originally enacted as temporary pandemic relief under the American Rescue Plan Act and later extended by the Inflation Reduction Act.

The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that permanently extending them would add $350 billion to the deficit over ten years, plus another $60 billion in interest costs, a total of nearly $500 billion in new spending. Much of that money benefits wealthy households and insurance companies, not working Americans in need. Instead of focusing on fiscal responsibility and reining in inflationary spending, Democrats are holding the government hostage over a pandemic-era subsidy that allows individuals earning nearly $600,000 a year to qualify for government assistance. This is unacceptable.

There are real-world consequences of this shutdown. For example, roughly 13,000 air traffic controllers are currently working without pay, operating under staffing shortages. These men and women are essential to our nation’s safety, and they deserve better. Every week this shutdown continues, our economy loses an estimated $15 billion in GDP. It’s time to put the American people ahead of politics. I continue to call on Senate Democrats to join House Republicans at the negotiating table and vote for the CR so we can reopen the government and get back to work.

I am in Washington to fix, not fight. I stand ready to work across the aisle to find responsible, commonsense solutions that serve the American people.

In addition, the proposal states that “to the extent practicable, load and hybrid facilities should be studied together with generating facilities. Such an approach will allow for efficient siting of loads and generating facilities and thereby minimize the need for costly network upgrades.”

The reforms would also include cost responsibility requiring load and hybrid facilities to pay 100 percent of assigned network upgrade costs, with possible cost-crediting over time.

As part of the proposal, Wright made light of the “unprecedented current and expected growth of large loads seeking to interconnect to the transmission system,” contending that “it has become necessary to standardize interconnection procedures and agreements for such loads, including those seeking to share a point of interconnection with new or existing generation facilities.”

1. Oil, gas and the tax code — The New York Times

In 2023, U.S. coal, oil, and gas interests received more than $16 billion in government subsidies, according to the Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker. Another group, Oil Change International, estimates it’s actually $34 billion. Much of that support comes from tax code provisions that have existed for more than a century.

Some economists argue that fossil fuel companies should be taxed more to account for pollution and climate damage, costs estimated at more than $820 billion per year.

Backed by a $50 million grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and corporate contracts with Meta, Nucor and others, startup Electra is building a 130,000-square-foot demonstration facility in Colorado. The plant will produce 500 tons of low-carbon iron annually using a low-temperature, electrochemical process powered by renewable electricity, avoiding the coal-fired blast furnace method responsible for steel’s 8% contribution to global pollution.

Nucor, the largest steel producer in the U.S., will buy some of that iron, while Meta will buy environmental attribute certificates related to its production. The plant will also benefit from an $8 million state tax credit.

The Department of Energy has canceled five grants totaling more than $700 million for battery and manufacturing projects, the first confirmed cancellations from a larger list of potential cuts circulating within the agency. These cancellations are among the largest so far in advanced battery manufacturing, affecting planned facilities in red states such as Kentucky and Missouri. It also affects projects backed by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

The biggest canceled grant, $316 million for Ascend Elements, was meant to support a $1 billion Kentucky plant that would make battery components from recycled EV materials. The company said the battery components would compete with supply that now comes primarily from China.

Different fuel recycling processes, such as aqueous and non-aqueous, and new nuclear recycling technologies will also be evaluated, according to the bill.

Cruz and Heinrich introduced similar legislation last year.

The study would be overseen by the assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy. The written report would be submitted to Congress within a year after the act passes.

The mandated study would compare the practicality of fuel recycling and the once-through fuel cycle, which includes temporary and permanent storage requirements.

The legislation also instructs DOE to identify any regulatory gaps surrounding waste management and fuel recycling

“Spent nuclear fuel has the potential to dramatically increase America’s energy, economic, and national security,” Cruz said in his Oct. 17 press release. “Domestic recycling can reduce the space we need for spent nuclear fuel, enhance energy independence, reduce our dependence on imports, and broaden the supply of rare elements and isotopes used in medicine and advanced technologies.”

“Recycling solutions will also reduce the burden on individual states from nuclear waste accumulation, and accelerate progress on nuclear energy, which is our nation’s cleanest baseload energy source,” Cruz added.

Nuclear industry executives of Curio and Oklo praised fuel recycling-oriented legislation. Both companies have recently taken steps to pursue domestic fuel recycling as Oklo announced plans for a $1.7 billion recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Curio has completed a lab scale demonstration for its recycling technology, NuCycle.

“We appreciate Senators Cruz and Heinrich for their bipartisan leadership in keeping nuclear waste recycling on the national agenda,” Curio CEO Ed McGinnis said. “What we call ‘waste’ is, in fact, a valuable energy resource that can help strengthen America’s energy security, reduce long-term environmental burdens, and support advanced nuclear technologies.”

“Oklo greatly appreciates Congress’s leadership in advancing commercial recycling of used nuclear fuel,” Oklo Co-Founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte said. “The proposed legislation reflects growing recognition of fuel recycling as a strategic pathway to strengthen U.S. energy security and enhance domestic supply chains.”",https://www.exchangemonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/exm-yoast-fallback.png,N,,2025-10-24 13:07:05.543437

While Richmond-area Democrats have, for the most part, supported community members in opposing the peaker plant, Del.
“Dominion Energy does not ask the recipients of our campaign contributions for favors,” Slayton said.","CHESTER, Va.—A crowd packed a meeting room at the SpringHill Suites here in September for a public hearing on an air permit for a controversial “peaker” plant that Dominion Energy has long been lobbying to build to enhance grid reliability.

Brent Archer, former president of Columbia Gas of Virginia, stood at the podium and told officials of the state’s Department of Environmental Quality that he strongly supported the project.

“The dispatchable energy represented by this plant is essential for balancing demand with available supply on the electric grid in partnership with renewable energy,” Archer said, with dozens of other supporters at his back.

He went on: “I am here today representing the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance, or VERA. VERA is an organization that was formed to support programmatic, balanced policy that supports all forms of energy generation to meet Virginia’s growing energy needs. And I think we have a lot of supporters this evening if you could stand for a minute so we can see. Thank you.”

About a dozen people stood up around the room, most of them wearing stickers that said “I support reliable energy” and “Energy you can count on.”

What Archer didn’t say was that the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance is funded by Dominion.

In an interview later, Archer said he was speaking as a volunteer and saw no need “to disclose anything that had to do with whatever Dominion’s relationship with VERA may be.” He said he assumed everyone else supporting him was there as a volunteer as well.

Several weeks later, one of Archer’s supporters wearing the stickers turned up in downtown Richmond in the lobby at 1021 E. Cary Street, an office tower populated by lobbyists and consulting firms within walking distance of the Virginia Capitol.

He declined to say who he was or whom he worked for, but he told Inside Climate News: “I’m not at liberty to talk to the media. I work for a consulting company that works with Dominion.”

Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson, said in an email prior to the exchange that the utility’s involvement with the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance “is transparently explained on the VERA website.”

Through the first half of 2025, he said, Dominion contributed $290,208 to another nonprofit called Power for Tomorrow, an advocacy group that works in favor of monopoly utility control as a means of power efficiency and reliability, which in turn supports the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance. Power for Tomorrow has ties with Dominion dating back to May 2021, according to the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog group.

Aaron Ruby, another Dominion spokesperson, told Inside Climate News that those people at the hearing supporting Archer and wearing the stickers were not there at Dominion’s behest. “They are not paid, and their support is real,” Ruby said. “We have been transparent about VERA and their efforts to mobilize public support, including handing out stickers. … Thousands of everyday Virginians and more than 100 Virginia businesses and organizations have spoken out in support” of the proposed plant.

Dominion’s financial sponsorship of nonprofits that publicly support its projects is a practice used by utilities across the country. In Alabama, Alabama Power’s corporate offices gave space and paid millions in fees to the Hawthorn Group, a firm based in Alexandria, Virginia. Hawthorn, which describes itself as an international public affairs company, has admitted to hiring a subcontractor, Crowds on Demand, that paid actors to speak at New Orleans City Council meetings in 2017 on behalf of a natural gas plant proposed by another utility, Entergy.

The proposed peaker plant in Chesterfield County, called the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, would run when electricity demand is high, rather than round-the-clock. A U.S. Government Accountability Office report in 2024 found that such peaker plants produce more pollution per energy generated than the baseload plants that run regularly, and they’re more likely to be located in communities of color.

The Chesterfield plant has generated significant opposition in the majority Black community whose residents live in close proximity to the site of an old coal plant where the new natural gas facility would be built.

While Richmond-area Democrats have, for the most part, supported community members in opposing the peaker plant, Del. Destiny LeVere Bolling, a Richmond Democrat, recently came out in support of the facility.

Bolling said at a second DEQ public hearing on the air quality permit earlier this month that the project is needed, even though it could make achieving emissions reductions more difficult under the Virginia Clean Economy Act.

“I wholeheartedly support the Virginia Clean Economy Act and its stated policy goals, but as elected and appointed we also have an obligation to ensure Virginians have the energy they need in both the near term and the long term,” said Bolling, who is running an uncontested House of Delegates reelection campaign in Henrico County, a heavily Democratic suburb of the state’s capital city.

“We cannot ignore facts,” Bolling continued. “The data is clear: Without additional peaking capacity Virginia runs a real risk of not meeting demand when it matters the most.”

Prior to her testimony, Bolling’s top donor had been Dominion, which contributed $110,000 between 2023 and August 2025. The day after she spoke, Dominion gave her another $50,000.

Bolling said her testimony and Dominion donations were unrelated. “I’ve actually voted on several bills that they don’t quite like, but that’s the beauty of being on [the Labor and Commerce Committee] and hearing all the energy conversation behind the scenes.”

Dominion, too, said the two were unrelated. “Dominion Energy does not ask the recipients of our campaign contributions for favors,” Slayton said. “That would be unethical, if not illegal.”

Shortly after the VERA supporter at 1021 E. Cary Street declined to give his name, Del. Jason Ballard, a Pearisburg Republican, appeared in the building’s lobby with two men, one of whom had also stood with the VERA supporters back at the air permit hearing in September. They went out on the street and appeared to be recording an audio interview.

Ballard is also a recipient of a Dominion campaign contribution, receiving a $25,000 donation from the utility on the same day as the second air permit hearing earlier this month, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. The utility is Ballard’s fourth-biggest donor at $122,500, records compiled by the access project show.

Asked about the men he had been talking with and whether their interaction had anything to do with the peaker plant in Chesterfield County, Ballard said: “Dominion’s not in my territory, you know that.”

Slayton, the Dominion spokesman, said the utility’s contributions to lawmakers had been made without any expected action in return. “We don’t exchange campaign contributions for political favors,” Slayton said. “Like most companies, we contribute to candidates from both parties who support commonsense public policy.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9957-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:01.491505

""We started off with the Biden administration, the first thing he said was he's going to stop oil and gas production. And he's gonna kill the industry. And that's what he intended to do.

The groups warned, ""[W]e are concerned that the next nominee will be a more camouflaged, sophisticated opponent of whistleblowers. Mr. Ingrassia's nomination should be a wake-up call.

The groups urged HSGAC to address the systematic breakdown of the merit system in the face of unprecedented threats ranging from lack of access to loss of political independence at enforcement agencies. Under the Administration's Schedule Policy/Career proposal, government agencies that are ""currently the defendants will be the judges and jury of their own alleged whistleblower retaliation.""

Rivian has agreed to pay $250 million to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit filed after the company abruptly raised prices on its R1 pickup truck and SUV in 2022. The settlement requires approval from a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California before the payment can proceed.

The lawsuit centered on allegations that Rivian included misleading statements and figures in regulatory filings before its 2021 initial public offering. Shareholders claimed the company misrepresented the actual costs required to manufacture its electric vehicles, which ultimately led to the controversial price increase.

Despite agreeing to the substantial payment, Rivian maintains its position that the settlement does not constitute an admission of fault or wrongdoing. The company released a statement denying the allegations while acknowledging the agreement to resolve the legal dispute.

Breaking down the payment structure

Rivian plans to fund the settlement through two sources if the court grants approval. The company will pay $67 million through its directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage, while drawing the remaining $183 million from its cash reserves.

Insurance payment: The $67 million portion will come from liability insurance designed to protect company leadership from personal financial exposure in legal matters.

Cash reserves: Rivian will use $183 million from its available funds, which totaled $4.8 billion in cash and equivalents as of June 30.

The timing of this settlement comes during a particularly challenging period for the electric vehicle manufacturer as it prepares for significant changes to its business operations and product lineup.

Company faces pivotal moment

The settlement arrives as Rivian undergoes major transitions in its business strategy and operations. The company is deeply involved in preparations to launch its second-generation electric vehicle, the R2 SUV, scheduled for release in 2026. This new model will carry a significantly lower price point than the existing R1 lineup.

Rivian expects to produce substantially higher volumes of the R2 compared to current models. The company states its Illinois factory can manufacture up to 150,000 R2 vehicles annually. Additionally, construction continues on a new Georgia facility that will produce the R2 and future vehicle models.

Meanwhile, sales of the R1 lineup have struggled to maintain momentum. The company anticipates finishing 2025 having shipped far fewer electric vehicles than it delivered in either 2024 or 2023. Multiple factors have contributed to these declining numbers, including tariff policies and the elimination of federal electric vehicle tax credits.

This week Rivian announced layoffs affecting more than 600 employees as part of a broader restructuring effort. The organizational changes also saw CEO RJ Scaringe assume the role of interim chief marketing officer, taking on additional responsibilities during this turbulent period.

The price hike that sparked outrage

The controversy began when Rivian delivered its first R1 pickup trucks in late 2021. By March 2022, the company announced plans to increase prices on both the truck and SUV by nearly 20 percent. Rivian cited supply chain shortages, inflation pressures and plans to introduce more affordable models as justification for the dramatic price adjustment.

The company initially applied the price increase to both new orders and existing customers who had placed pre-orders and remained on a waitlist. This decision to raise prices on customers who had already committed to purchases sparked immediate backlash from buyers and company supporters.

The intense negative reaction prompted Rivian to quickly reverse course for customers with existing pre-orders. However, the damage had already been done to investor confidence. The announcement caused Rivian’s stock price to plummet, resulting in substantial financial losses for shareholders.

Scaringe acknowledged the mistake in a letter to customers at the time, describing the decision as wrong and admitting it broke customer trust in the company. He characterized it as the most painful error in his more than 12 years leading Rivian.

Legal action follows market fallout

Shareholder Charles Larry Crews filed the lawsuit just days after the price hike announcement and subsequent reversal. The complaint argued that Rivian had misrepresented the true costs of building the R1 vehicles in documentation provided during its initial public offering.

These alleged misrepresentations, according to the lawsuit, directly contributed to the negative stock price impact when the company announced the price increase. The case received class-action status in July 2024, allowing it to proceed on behalf of multiple affected shareholders.

The settlement now awaits final court approval before Rivian can close this chapter of legal and financial challenges.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2155190835-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:03:23.648248

Now the companies have partnered to launch a bidirectional charging pilot that will be open to 180 homes in California and Connecticut.

Participating Kia EV9 owners will be able to use Wallbox’s Quasar 2 bidirectional charger and Bidirectional Energy’s virtual power plant (VPP) platform to save money on their utility bills while helping to support the electrical grid.

The companies aim to expand the program to additional vehicles and service areas at a later date.

The program provides participating customers with incentives for charger and installation costs: up to $8,800 in California and up to $10,800 in Connecticut. Participants can also save money on their energy bills and earn payments from their utilities for grid support services.

The Quasar 2, Wallbox’s next-generation 12.48 kW bidirectional charger, enables EV owners to power their homes or send energy back to the grid. Paired with Wallbox’s Power Recovery Unit, the Quasar 2 can also provide backup power in the event of an outage.

Homeowners in California or Connecticut who own or lease a Kia EV9 can sign up for the program on the Bidirectional Energy website. Once the charger is installed, drivers can use the Bidirectional Energy app to set charging and grid participation preferences, including mileage buffers to leave enough energy in the battery for daily driving needs.

Nevada Tech Hub is one of 31 Tech Hubs nationwide designated by the Economic Development Administration (E.D.A.) as playing a key role in a critical technology focus area. Over the past year, Nevada Tech Hub has met with industry partners and workforce development leaders to identify gaps and opportunities for funding, finding partners to provide solutions and crafting programs that solve problems in real time. The projects funded are:

Great Basin College was awarded $1.98 million to support the college’s new Industrial Tech Center in Winnemucca. The new facility provides a space for necessary programs that will fill the need for trained workers in the lithium battery and critical minerals economy. Opened in August, the Industrial Tech Center is anticipated, through spring of 2029, to train and credential approximately 250 new diesel technologists, industrial maintenance technologists, electrical systems technologists and instrumentation technologists for careers in the lithium battery supply chain.

Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) received $497,420 to support the Individual Career Mapping (ICM) 3D Classroom Project, which uses virtual reality and immersive training to provide career exploration, science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and industry-recognized credentials with hands-on, industry-led training.

Dragonfly Energy, a Reno-based lithium battery manufacturer, was awarded $278,583 to upgrade and modernize its production systems, boosting the company’s efficiency, supporting workforce development and expand its production capacity. The project aims to improve the company’s operational efficiency by enhancing data collection, product transport and overall output. By leveraging existing partnerships with other Nevada Tech Hub consortium members, including Aqua Metals, Redwood Materials and Ioneer, Dragonfly Energy’s battery manufacturing capability plays a major role in the state’s circular battery supply chain.

Lyten, lithium-sulfur battery manufacturer, received $400,000 to advance the company’s proprietary Lithium Processing System (LPS) to a pilot-ready design. The proposed system uses ion-selective membranes to extract lithium from brines into a high-purity lithium carbonate equivalent without acids, bases, or waste, resulting in high lithium recovery with very little energy usage. The system is fully enclosed within a shipping container, making it safe and scalable. The technology will provide an environmentally safe and scalable way to extract lithium from difficult brines like those found in Clayton Valley, Nevada.

Manufacture Nevada received $199,120 to provide dedicated expertise to help Nevada Tech Hub companies secure resources needed to succeed and expand, including finding domestic suppliers of equipment and materials.

Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology was awarded $140,000 to fund an assessment of Nevada’s historical and active mining sites to identify and quantify concentrations of target critical minerals such as cobalt, nickel, manganese and others in mine tailings or retrievable as by-products of existing mining operations. These critical minerals are often present in current mining operations but historically, due to their value or quantity, may not have justified the cost of a complete mining operation on their own. By identifying highly prospective deposits for potential extraction in existing operations, this project provides the necessary data for processing companies to attract investment, apply technology effectively and secure the minerals.

Nevada Department of Corrections was awarded $415,070 to expand re-entry programs for offenders, with career education and training specific to the lithium battery and critical minerals industry.

Nevadaworks, the local workforce development board for northern Nevada, was awarded $2.8 million to lead efforts aligning workforce initiatives with industry needs, including hiring a lead career navigator to head up the work in the lithium battery space. Nevadaworks was awarded an additional $215,000 to head up a statewide marketing campaign promoting Nevada’s jobs in the clean energy industry.

Northern Nevada Building & Construction Trades Council received $1.5 million to expand apprenticeship program capacity by adding key leadership positions including a director of recruitment and a building trades recruiter. These roles will strengthen apprenticeship recruitment and connect more Nevadans to careers.

Northern Nevada Central Labor Council and Northern Nevada Member Assistance Program were awarded $2.4 million to provide additional critical support services to apprentices in need, including financial assistance for boots, tools, equipment and transportation, as well as food and vouchers for housing and utilities.

Office of Workforce Innovation (OWINN) was awarded $219,999 to expand the Nevada P-20 to Workforce Research Data System (NPWR), unlocking new avenues of research, improving performance reporting and strengthening the link between workforce programs and long-term outcomes.

Redwood Materials received $440,890 to support a state-wide lithium battery recycling initiative. A collaboration with Washoe County, the project includes the deployment of 20 lithium battery-specific smart bins and a public education campaign to encourage responsible battery disposal, reduce landfill contamination and lower the risk of battery-related fires in homes and businesses.

Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) was awarded $1.8 million to expand its Advanced Manufacturing program, including the launch of a new Skilled Machine Technician registered apprenticeship program, featuring a 12-credit curriculum designed in direct collaboration with local industry partners. The funding also supports expanded faculty and lab staff, the purchase of advanced training equipment, and provides for participant support including registration and instructional materials.

University of Nevada Career Studios received $200,000 to develop and expand internship programs with partners in the lithium battery and critical materials industry.

University of Nevada College of Business was awarded $90,000 to support the development of a Workforce Readiness Bootcamp, offering students and recent graduates a dedicated, weeklong course to develop soft skills and emotional intelligence skills, something commonly identified by industry partners as a skillset that was lacking in new hires.

Western Nevada College (WNC) was awarded $1.8 million to support a new specialized training program to prepare workers for battery disassembly and recycling processes. This program, in collaboration with a strategic industry partner, will address the need for Nevada’s growing demand for skilled labor in the lithium battery recycling sector.

“Each of these projects plays an important role in the battery supply chain in Nevada,” Bartholet said. “From being responsible and smart about how we find critical minerals in Nevada to training the workforce that will be out there doing the labor, Nevada Tech Hub is working to ensure all elements of the battery supply chain are getting support when possible. This is a full-spectrum initiative, and we believe these projects each provide an important element to our overall success.”",https://www.unr.edu//main/images/news/2025/October/redwood-facility-drone-shot.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 13:05:58.539169

Google backs US gas power plant with carbon capture for Midwest data centers

Reuters/Laila Kearney

Google has entered its first corporate agreement to purchase electricity from a U.S. gas-fired power plant utilizing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to fuel its Midwest data centers. This deal, with Low Carbon Infrastructure for the 400-megawatt Broadwing project in Decatur, Illinois, addresses the massive electricity demand from Big Tech’s expansion of generative AI. Expected to be operational in the early 2030s, the gas-fired plant will capture and permanently store about 90% of its CO2 emissions underground at an existing industrial site. Google views CCS as a crucial component for achieving around-the-clock clean energy, complementing its existing investments in advanced nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower. Both Google and Low Carbon Infrastructure plan to pursue additional CCS facilities in the U.S. [MDN: It wasn’t all that long ago that Google (and Microsoft, and Amazon, and Apple) wouldn’t touch power from gas-fired power plants, unless the gas was hydrogen.

U.S. natural gas futures settles lower on storage data

Wall Street Journal

U.S. natural gas extends its retreat as last week’s storage build came in above expectations. “It appears that upside momentum might have run out over the past 24 hours, and today’s bearish storage data is helping to keep downward pressure on pricing,” Andy Huenefeld of Pinebrook Energy Advisors says in a note. Natural gas in underground storage rose by 87 Bcf last week to 3,808 Bcf, extending the surplus over the five-year average to 164 Bcf from 154 Bcf the week before. An 81 Bcf injection was expected, according to a WSJ survey of analysts. “Only two weeks remain in the traditional injection season, but it would not be out of the question for storage to continue to grow through mid-November if weather cooperates,” Huenefeld adds. Nymex natural gas settled down 3.1% at $3.344/mmBtu. [MDN: At least we’re still well above the $3 mark, for a change.]

NERC president warns of ‘five-alarm fire’ for grid reliability

Utility Dive/Ethan Howland

A recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission conference addressed the growing challenge of ensuring grid reliability amid the massive growth of data centers, which are estimated to use up to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. Though reliability is currently high, experts warn risks are mounting due to extreme weather, resource adequacy issues, and an “escalating toxic soup” of security risks. FERC leaders emphasized the urgent need to accelerate the construction and permitting of new energy infrastructure, including transmission and generation, to meet rising demand, as current reserve margins are deemed “not safe.” While this buildout is costly, solutions like integrated system planning, improved data analysis tools, and long-term contracts for large data center loads were proposed to improve efficiency and help mitigate cost burdens on ratepayers. [MDN: Jim Robb, president and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) said at the meeting: “We’re seeing … an increasing number of small scale events and near misses that continue to reinforce what we can’t call anything but a five-alarm fire when it comes to reliability.” In other words, more powergen is urgently needed, and the only thing that can provide it is natural gas.]

ProEnergy repurposes jet engines to power data centers amid gas turbine shortages

Data Center Dynamics/Zachary Skidmore

US energy solutions provider ProEnergy is repurposing retired jet engines to create gas turbines for data center power. These PE6000 turbines, made from retrofitting old General Electric CF6-80C2 jet cores, can supply 48MW each. The company has sold 21 turbines for two projects, totaling over 1GW, providing bridging power for five to seven years until permanent grid connection is secured. This solution addresses the limited gas turbine market and long wait times for new grid power, offering a 2027 delivery compared to backlogs stretching past 2029 for traditional turbines. After initial use, the units can transition to backup power or supplement the grid, extending their useful life. [MDN: How cool is that?! Use old jet engines as turbines because manufacturers of turbines can’t make them fast enough. Brilliant! Only happens in capaitalistic, free enterprise countries like the US of A. We love capitalism (and despise socialism)!]

Pearson and CEWD partner to power future energy workforce

Pearson

Pearson’s Connections Academy and the Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD) have partnered to create career-connected learning opportunities for students interested in the high-demand U.S. energy sector. The partnership aims to address the projected need for millions of new energy workers over the next decade, driven by factors like AI and data center expansion. A key component is the Energy Industry Fundamentals 2.0 (EIF 2.0) curriculum, a 120-hour virtual course that offers high school credit, foundational knowledge about energy careers, and an industry-recognized credential upon completion, giving students a competitive advantage for internships and jobs. This collaboration reflects a vision to equip students with skills relevant to the future of the energy workforce, spanning fossil fuels, renewables, engineering, and skilled trades. [MDN: Even education training giant Pearson is getting into the training game for fossil fuels. Can you feel the winds of change blowing? Those winds aren’t coming from windmills!]

Surprised by leftwing radical rhetoric? Look closer at the climate movement

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Chris Johnson

The article argues that the celebration of Charlie Kirk’s murder stems from a dangerous, long-standing anti-human streak within the left, especially its radical environmental wing. This ideology views human beings as the problem, believing that fewer people and less activity would improve the world—a perspective seen in the support of demographic decline and the casual dismissal of human life. The author highlights University of Pennsylvania Professor Michael Mann’s callous remarks mocking Kirk’s death as a prime example of this radicalism. The piece concludes by urging conservatives to stop ignoring the climate debate and to actively challenge the left’s “anti-human” narratives with free-market solutions and a more hopeful worldview, asserting that people are not the problem. [MDN: Excellent insights. These kinds of insights have been made for years. It reminds us of the Michael Crichton book titled “State of Fear,” published in 2004. The plot was about eco-terrorists who plot mass murder to publicize the danger of global warming. If you want a good read, get a copy. Although it’s fiction from 20 years ago, you’ll immediately recognize what’s happening today in its prophetic pages.]

Climate out, affordability in

Master Resource/Robert Bradley Jr.

The article argues that affordability has replaced climate as the primary focus in Democratic energy and climate discussions following their 2024 defeat, according to a Politico column. Author Robert Bradley Jr. highlights that the public is more concerned with reliability and cost than climate change, leading to “severe pushback” against climate advocates. The original messaging, which implied that embracing clean power would be expensive but necessary, has failed to gain traction now that promises of cheaper renewables are met with public skepticism. Bradley suggests that the “climate complex is in a messaging crisis” and advocates for free-market energy policies to replace what he calls “crony capitalism.” [MDN: We agree 100%. No more public money for unreliable renewables. Equally, no more public money for fossil fuel companies. We must end ALL crony capitalism, period.]

AI’s insatiable need for power is driving an unexpected boom in oil-fracking company stocks

Fortune/Jordan Blum

Despite weak oil prices, falling revenues, and shrinking profits in the traditional oil sector, major oilfield service companies are pivoting to power generation for data centers, capitalizing on the massive demand driven by the AI boom. Liberty Energy, for instance, saw its stock jump 30% after announcing plans to increase its data center power capacity to over 1 gigawatt by 2027. Similarly, Halliburton’s stock rose 15% following its partnership with VoltaGrid for global power delivery. Other players like Baker Hughes and SLB are also investing in this new market, primarily using on-site natural gas generator sets. This emerging power opportunity is considered a “bright spot” in a currently sluggish industry, which saw Liberty’s net income fall 42% year-on-year, though long-term success depends on providing 24/7 power reliability. [MDN: AI data centers are the new “it” thing in the O&G space. Company stock prices are rising when they enter the AI market.]

Why Big Oil is asking EPA not to cut its polluter reporting program

EnergyNow.com

The EPA proposes to halt the decade-old Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, claiming it will save oil and gas companies up to $256 million annually and let them fund more tangible environmental efforts. However, many in the industry, including the American Petroleum Institute (API), warn that axing the program would immediately jeopardize their ability to claim highly valuable tax credits for carbon capture and clean hydrogen. The reporting data is the nation’s main record of industrial emissions, relied upon by states, investors, and advocates. Losing it could also harm future LNG exports to Europe and Asia, which increasingly demand verified low-carbon energy. Critics emphasize that eliminating the federal program would create regulatory uncertainty and costly, fragmented state-level reporting. [MDN: This is why we so often detest the API. They want taxpayer money to support their cockamamie carbon capture and hydrogen programs. NO! Stick to your knitting and make oil and gas, and forget about government-funded unreliable renewables and these other hairbrained programs. Jeesh.]

INTERNATIONAL

Oil futures take flight on Russia sanctions

Bloomberg/J. Wittels, R.W. Neo, M. Gindis

New US sanctions targeting Russia’s largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, caused oil prices to surge, with West Texas Intermediate jumping 5.6% to settle near $62 a barrel. The radical new policy aims to cut off Russia’s war revenue, departing from the previous G7 price cap strategy. The sanctions immediately threatened global supply, as key buyer India indicated it would likely cease purchasing Russian crude. Analysts called the move an unprecedented escalation that risks major disruptions to Russian exports. While global supply is currently plentiful, the prospect of India sourcing oil elsewhere is expected to increase demand for non-Russian crude, reduce the market surplus, and lead to higher oil prices, despite the possibility of China absorbing more Russian volume. The pressure on Moscow has significantly increased. [MDN: Uh huh. And what did we say earlier this week? Just wait for the turnaround back into the $60s for WTI. It didn’t even take a full week! WTI for December delivery surged 5.6% to settle at $61.79 a barrel in New York. Brent for December jumped 5.4% to settle at $65.99 a barrel. Back in the $60s.]

Next month in Brazil expect the climate cops to party, plot

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Craig Rucker

COP30 will run from November 10-21 in Belem, Brazil, gathering 70,000 attendees to accelerate climate action, limit global warming to 1.5°C, and advance a “just transition” involving massive finance transfers—demanded to be up to $1.3 trillion annually—from wealthy nations to poor countries. The article frames the UN conference as a self-serving ritual, highlighting the hypocrisy that host Brazil is simultaneously expanding offshore oil and gas exploration and cleared thousands of acres of Amazon rainforest to construct a highway and accommodations for the event, using fossil-fuel equipment. It contrasts the economic self-harm of climate-focused nations like Britain with the pro-growth policies and cheap energy in US states, arguing that the push for “net zero” results in industrial destruction and financial strain. [MDN: These meetings are attended by arrogant hypocrites that seek to grab U.S. taxpayer money. That’s the sum total of what happens. Take a hike!]

China threat calls for ideologically free energy policy

CO2 Coalition/Vijay Jayaraj

The article argues that climate-centric energy policies have created a dangerous fragility in supply chains, most evident after the 2022 energy crisis. Aggressive fossil fuel phaseouts in Europe led to costly reliance on imports, undermining the “net zero” agenda and causing energy-intensive industries to relocate. The author argues this subordinates real-world utility to ideology and wishful thinking. In contrast, countries like India and Indonesia, which maintained diversified, fossil-based power grids and prioritized pragmatism, fared significantly better. The article concludes that energy independence is foundational to national sovereignty, urging governments to repeal regulations stifling domestic fossil fuel and nuclear production, and allow energy sources to compete on cost and reliability. [MDN: To rely on China for rare earths to make windmills and solar panels is about as stupid as it gets.

Regarding its business strategy, T1 Energy clarified that the Austin G2 cell and module factory will be developed in phases.
On the policy front, T1 Energy supports the Department of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation into polysilicon imports.
Concurrently, T1 Energy is fully advancing its compliance efforts for the Section 45X tax credits and expects to meet the eligibility requirements for 2026 and beyond by year-end.","Recently, U.S. solar company T1 Energy released its preliminary financial and operational results for the third quarter of 2025. The data shows that the company’s total net sales for the quarter reached $200 to $210 million, with module shipments of approximately 725 MW. T1 Energy maintained its full-year EBITDA guidance range of $25 to $50 million and plans to commence construction of its Austin G2 module factory in the fourth quarter.

As of September 30, T1 Energy held $87 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, including $34 million in unrestricted cash. Additionally, the company has accrued $92 million in Section 45X tax credits this year. These credits, a key manufacturing support policy under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, are expected to be monetized. The company forecasts a significant sales increase in the fourth quarter, driven by production ramp-up at its Dallas G1 factory and policy-driven inventory sales from the third quarter.

Regarding its business strategy, T1 Energy clarified that the Austin G2 cell and module factory will be developed in phases. The first phase is expected to have an annual capacity of 2.1 GW, with capital expenditures estimated between $400 and $425 million, and is scheduled to begin production in the fourth quarter of 2026. If this factory, along with the Dallas G1 factory (5 GW capacity), operates at full capacity, the company’s annualized EBITDA could reach $375 to $450 million. T1 Energy has now drawn the final $50 million from its $100 million preferred equity commitment with Encompass Capital Advisors, securing the funding foundation for the G2 factory construction.

On the policy front, T1 Energy supports the Department of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation into polysilicon imports. Should subsequent tariffs or import restrictions be imposed, the company expects to gain a competitive advantage in sourcing ultra-pure polysilicon. Concurrently, T1 Energy is fully advancing its compliance efforts for the Section 45X tax credits and expects to meet the eligibility requirements for 2026 and beyond by year-end. However, the full-year EBITDA forecast remains toward the lower end of the guidance range, primarily influenced by shifts in sales mix, uncertainty around trade tariffs, and ongoing supply chain challenges.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8-2.png,N,,2025-10-24 13:06:55.477005

And the emissions from 8 Rivers’ coal plant would be much lower.
But giving some ageing coal plants a few more years of life is very different from supporting investment in brand-new generation capacity.","Upton Sinclair’s novel ‘King Coal’, depicting the grim realities of the American mining industry in the 1910s, talks about “a vision of a future, great and wonderful” when miners would no longer be needed.

As it turned out, the decline of the US coal industry was less than wonderful for the communities that depended on it. President Donald Trump, in both his administrations, has attempted to reverse that decline, but with little success so far. There were 41,300 people working in coal mining in the US in August, down from 51,000 at the beginning of President Trump’s first term in January 2017.

Now the surge in US electricity demand, driven principally by new data centres for AI, is reviving hopes of at least a slightly brighter future for coal. Several planned retirements of coal-fired power plants have been delayed, as utilities look to secure whatever generation capacity might be available. Building new coal plants looks like a much tougher challenge. But one company is making progress on a commercial project that would be the first new large coal-fired plant in the US for more than 20 years.

8 Rivers, a developer working on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and low-carbon hydrogen, has this year announced two deals to assess the potential for a new coal-fired plant with CCS: one in Wyoming and one in New Mexico. It is close to announcing another such agreement with a partner in North Dakota. It plans to select one of those three possible projects to be its first commercial development.

The plan has been made possible by the alignment of circumstances created by the data centre boom. Big tech companies want to secure new power supplies, and they have also set demanding targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. They have been big backers of wind and solar power, but are increasingly looking at other technologies including nuclear and carbon capture.

Microsoft has described CCS as “among the most promising technologies that paves the way towards CO2 neutrality”. It has announced a series of deals with companies working on carbon capture, and is a partner in the Northern Lights CCS project in Norway, which is also backed by the country’s government, Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies.

This week, Google announced its first carbon capture deal, supporting the construction of a new 400-MW gas-fired plant in Illinois that will capture roughly 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions and sequester them in a nearby storage facility. The project is the first to come out of Google’s partnership with developer Low Carbon Infrastructure, which is working on deploying commercial-scale CCS for power generation.

Google says its aim is to help accelerate technical and operational improvements in CCS, including raising carbon dioxide capture rates and improving system performance and economics.

8 Rivers’ proposed plant would use conventional gasification technology to produce syngas from coal. The gas is then burned in pure oxygen to create two by-products: water, and a high-concentration stream of carbon dioxide, which together turn a turbine to generate power.

One of the great advantages of the process, known as the Allam-Fetvedt Cycle, is that the exhaust gas is nearly pure carbon dioxide, making processing for storage easier. The exhaust gas from a conventional coal plant might be only 12% to 15% carbon dioxide.

Turning coal into gas to enable carbon capture has an image problem in the US, as a result of the failure of Southern Company’s Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) project in Mississippi’s Kemper County, launched in 2006. The technology never properly worked as intended, and in 2017 the decision was taken to run the plant solely on natural gas.

8 Rivers is using different technology, and should not face the same issues that dogged the Kemper plant. But to help avoid the pitfalls that faced that project, the 8 Rivers team has been working with some of the engineers and commercial leaders who worked on Kemper, to learn lessons from the problems that were encountered there.

Government support will still clearly be very important for this first-of-a-kind project. The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture is critical, and there may also be additional grants and other backing from the Trump administration, following the US$625 million for the US coal industry announced by the Department of Energy last month.

With the benefit of that support, 8 Rivers is aiming to deliver power at a price of about US$100 to US$120 per megawatt hour. That would be highly competitive against even unabated natural gas generation at today’s prices, following significant cost inflation in that sector. And the emissions from 8 Rivers’ coal plant would be much lower.

It is estimated that the carbon intensity of the power from 8 Rivers’ plants could be about 9 kilogrammes per MWh. For comparison, the average carbon intensity of gas-fired generation in the US is about 450 kg/MWh.

No big tech companies have yet announced a deal to buy power from one of 8 Rivers’ plants. But as they explore every possibility for adding new electricity supply while cutting emissions, coal with carbon capture certainly looks like an option worth them considering.

The Wood Mackenzie view

There is no doubt that the boom in data centre investment is helping to slow the decline of coal in the US, by prolonging the operational lives of some coal-fired power plants. Two years ago, Wood Mackenzie’s base case expectation was that US coal-fired generation would drop about 60% between 2025 and 2032. Now we expect it to drop about 39%.

But giving some ageing coal plants a few more years of life is very different from supporting investment in brand-new generation capacity. Peter Findlay, Wood Mackenzie’s director of CCUS economics, says that while 8 Rivers’ plans are promising, the company still has significant challenges to overcome to make its first coal project a success.

The coal gasification unit is well-established, proven and commercially available technology, and so should not present too many difficulties, he says. The bigger potential issues are with the turbine used to generate the power.

Turbines typically use natural gas, for power generation, or jet fuel, for aircraft. Converting a design to handle water and carbon dioxide is not a trivial exercise. 8 Rivers has been working with Siemens Energy since 2023 to develop the new zero emissions turbines it needs.

The full life-cycle emissions of the plants will also be affected by methane leakage from the mines where the coal is produced.

But if those technical challenges can be solved at an acceptable cost, there is a huge potential market for greenfield coal plants with carbon capture, not only in North America but in Asia and Europe, too.

“If 8 Rivers can find a turbine manufacturer to develop an affordable turbine to perform reliably, over the lifecycle of the plant with affordable maintenance and overhaul cycles, then the proposed technology could be game-changing,” Findlay says.

New emissions rules for shipping deferred for at least a year

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has voted to postpone for a year a decision on whether to adopt its Net Zero Framework, which includes a global emissions pricing system. The proposed plan was strongly opposed by the US administration, which said it would “not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.”

The US said any nation that voted to support the framework faced actions including having its vessels blocked from US ports, additional port fees, new visa restrictions, commercial penalties under US government contracts, and sanctions on government officials. Administration officials described the plan as a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations”.

At a meeting in London last week, IMO member countries voted 57-49 to postpone a vote on adopting the framework. Countries supporting the US call for a delay included China and India, as well as big oil and gas producers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Russia. Countries voting against included most members of the EU, the UK, Singapore and South Africa. Among the abstentions were Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Greece.

What happens next is unclear. Some observers have suggested that the Net Zero Framework could now be abandoned. But Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, said this week that while the outcome of last week’s vote was “not the ideal scenario”, work on the plan would continue. He aims to provide more clarity on issues including governance, certification and distribution of revenues.

“This extra year gives us the chance to connect with all the stakeholders and parties in order to address the questions that were raised,” he added. “Shipping continues to be a global industry, and as such needs global regulations.”

The delay in the adoption of the framework casts a cloud of uncertainty over plans to reduce emissions from shipping through, for example, the production of low-carbon fuels.

In brief

The US has announced new sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies, as it attempts to increase the pressure to end the war in Ukraine. Rosneft and Lukoil have been designated as sanctioned, meaning that all their property and interests that are in the US or controlled by Americans are blocked and must be reported to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control. Foreign financial institutions that do business with Rosneft and Lukoil could themselves face secondary sanctions.

Wood Mackenzie analysts said the new measures meant that companies buying Russian oil would risk losing access to the dollar-based financial system. The main consumers of Russian crude oil, led by China and India, are expected to continue purchases from other non-sanctioned Russian suppliers. But there is likely to be a scramble for workarounds in response to the more stringent sanctions regime. Oil prices strengthened after the US announcement, with Brent crude trading at over US$66 a barrel on Friday morning.

The energy secretary of the US and the energy minister of Qatar sent a joint letter to the EU, warning about the potential impact of the new European Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) on the LNG industry. The directive creates new responsibilities for companies operating in Europe to address their impacts on human rights and the environment, including the climate. The US and Qatar said the proposals could jeopardise the affordability and reliability of energy in the EU, and posed “an existential threat” to European industry. The European Parliament on Wednesday agreed to consider further changes to the proposed directive, with the aim of approving a final version by the end of the year.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which sets global standards for measuring and managing carbon emissions, has opened public consultations on two proposed changes in its guidance. One change covers standards for Scope 2 emissions, which come from purchased energy, and the other covers estimates of avoided emissions from deploying lower-carbon electricity. The Clean Energy Buyers’ Association, which represents companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, General Motors and Walmart, said it had “deep concerns” about some of the requirements in the new proposed Scope 2 guidance, and said it could unintentionally chill voluntary clean energy procurement.

GE Vernova is spending US$5.275 billion to build up its presence in the transformer market. It is buying out the 50% share it does not already own in Prolec GE, a transformer manufacturer with plants in the US, Mexico and Brazil. The company, a joint venture between GE Vernova and Xignux of Mexico, recently invested US$300 million in the US and Mexico to increase capacity and add new technology.

Quote of the week

“Families across Missouri are struggling to pay their bills. But I am concerned Ameren is seeking dramatic rate increases in order to supply massive data centers and industrial users. Recent reporting indicates that Ameren cut electricity to thousands of Missouri households in September while simultaneously pursuing lucrative arrangements with corporate users. ​Missourians deserve affordable and reliable electricity. They should not be forced to subsidize corporate projects while struggling to keep their lights on.”

Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri became the latest Republican politician to sound the alarm about the potential impact of data centre development on residential customers’ electricity bills, in a letter to the CEO of Ameren. The senator asked whether Ameren had analysed the impact of agreements to supply new large load customers, and whether it had acted to ensure that the cost of new infrastructure for serving those large users would not be passed on to residential ratepayers.

The Longhorns will also have to prepare to take on a team with some of the conference’s best players.

Here’s a look at some notable Bulldogs to keep an eye out for on Saturday.

Redshirt senior safety Brylan Lanier

After Texas sophomore quarterback Arch Manning only completed 44.4% of his passes against Kentucky, he will have to be extra safe with the ball as Lanier lurks in the secondary.

“It’s what (defensive coordinator Coleman) Hutzler preaches: Everyday ball out,” Lanier said about forcing turnovers in a Monday press conference. “We do a lot of strip (the ball) attempt circuits, a lot of interception circuits and we just preach that every day. Get the ball out, an interception, a fumble recovery … it’s happening in the game because it’s how we practice and how we work.”

The 6-foot-1 safety spent part of his collegiate career at East Mississippi Community College. Eventually, Lanier became a three-star prospect and the 31st best player among the class of 2024 JUCO products.

Lanier is currently tied first for overall interceptions in the Southeastern Conference, counting non-conference games.

Senior wide receiver Brenen Thompson

On the other side of the field, Mississippi State will have its eyes on Thompson to make plays against a Texas defense that is currently second in the conference for interceptions.

After catching the ball only five times across the Bulldogs’ opening two conference games, Thompson exploded last week with seven receptions for 155 yards in a close loss to Florida. Thompson’s performance at “The Swamp” is the fourth-most receiving yards a player has recorded in a SEC game this season.

In Mississippi State’s upset victory over then No. 12 Arizona State on Sept. 6, Thompson caught the ball six times for 133 yards. The receiver scored two touchdowns, one of which was the winning score late in the fourth quarter.

“It’s a surreal moment for me,” Thompson said after the game. “Just being in that position to go make that play, it was surreal. I’m happy for my teammates, I’m happy for my coaches and I’m happy for this fanbase.”

Redshirt sophomore punter Ethan Pulliam

Mississippi State’s punting unit will have to be extra cautious with Texas sophomore wide receiver Ryan Niblett on punt return duty. Last week against Kentucky, Niblett returned two punts for 88 yards and returned a punt for a touchdown against Oklahoma the week prior.

However, the Bulldogs have one of the best punters in the SEC, Pulliam, who was also once on the baseball team.

“Looking back at it, I think it’s been a great decision with this opportunity that has been given to me, to be able to go out there and punt, and flip the field,” Pulliam said about committing full-time to football in a Monday press conference.

Pulliam now has the fifth-most yards punted in a SEC game with 319 while also having the second-longest punt in the conference with 67. Pulliam’s average punt against Tennessee and Florida are both in the SEC’s top 10 single-game punting averages.",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10-23-25_PlayersToWatchWeekNine_CourtesyOfMississippiStateAthletics.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 14:08:29.541266

Rivian has struggled to achieve consistent profitability due to costs related to ramping up of production, tariffs and intense competition from Tesla and traditional automakers.

High tariffs on imported auto parts have driven up manufacturing costs and squeezed margins for EV makers, forcing them to revamp supply chains, curb reliance on foreign components and boost US investment in line with the Trump administration policy.

Analysts expect Rivian's quarterly revenue to surge 71.5per cent and loss to narrow, when it reports third-quarter results after markets close on November 4.

The company lowered the midpoint of its annual deliveries forecast earlier this month, despite reporting a nearly 32per cent jump in the third quarter, largely driven by a last-minute rush to grab the now-expired federal incentive.

Rivian is focusing on improving manufacturing efficiency and streamlining operations at its Normal, Illinois plant to align costs with the weaker near-term demand outlook, while preparing for its next-generation R2 models, which are expected to broaden its reach beyond the luxury segment.

The company expects the R2 model to open up a lower-price segment, competing with Tesla's bestseller Model Y crossover, and counterbalance soft demand for its pricier R1 vehicles.

Justin Mackovyak is vice president of utility strategic enablement and emerging solutions at ICF.​​

Data centers, manufacturing and electrification are straining the grid with 24/7 load growth. ICF expects 25% growth in total electricity demand by 2030, and 78% by 2050. Residential rates could increase 15-40% by 2030, and potentially double by 2050 for some utilities. For utilities, keeping power reliable and affordable requires embracing near-term solutions to manage demand.

While energy efficiency has long delivered value, in recent years it has become overlooked, sometimes miscategorized, and scrutinized. Despite these setbacks, efficiency must continue to be recognized as a critical component in offsetting demand growth and improving reliability while also helping keep costs affordable for customers.

In the era of rising demand, efficiency is essential infrastructure. It’s one of the fastest, cheapest ways to take pressure off the grid and lower bills for customers. Utilities should look at modern energy efficiency programs as a crucial way to maintain reliability and affordability.

Energy efficiency as a grid-scale resource.

Efficiency and broader demand-side management, or DSM, strategies including demand response and other distributed energy resource programs are powerful tools for grid planning that offer flexibility, speed and cost control.

Rather than defaulting to expensive infrastructure upgrades, utilities can use efficiency and demand response to manage localized load growth at the source and circumvent the need for a $10 million substation. As distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and battery storage introduce bidirectional power flows the grid wasn’t designed for, reducing overall system load through efficiency can ease congestion, improving both stability and reliability across the transmission and distribution network.

These load-smoothing benefits also support better system operations. DSM programs that flatten unpredictable peaks and improve system forecasting can reduce the risk of last-minute capacity shortfalls. At a time when many utilities are facing long interconnection queues and permitting delays for new renewable assets, energy efficiency offers a practical stopgap that stretches existing generation capacity to meet customer needs while longer-term solutions are brought online.

Beyond system-level benefits, energy efficiency programs deliver real, measurable value to customers. Last winter, one utility’s residential customers enrolled in efficiency programs saw bill increases that were 30% lower than those of non-participants during peak heating demand.

Build customer trust through personalization and education

In many regions, customers are seeing policy rollbacks and changes to federal tax credits for rooftop solar, EVs, and home energy upgrades. Customers don’t fully understand who’s responsible in many cases, but they do expect their utility to help them adapt, which presents a strategic opportunity to earn lasting trust by acting as energy advisors. Recent technology advancements can help:

AI-powered analytics allow for tailored engagement based on customer usage, income, housing type and behavior, enabling utilities to deliver targeted messaging and offer programs that are more relevant and likely to drive adoption.

Digital twins and smart targeting tools powered by machine learning can match the right program or incentive to the right customer. These tools optimize incentive levels to avoid unnecessary spending so that programs remain effective and cost-efficient.

Proactive communication around policy shifts such as tax credit expiration or changes to electrification incentives can help manage expectations and reinforce the utility’s role as a trusted advisor.

Interactive dashboards and real-time monitoring tools increase transparency and allow customers to track and adjust their consumption, encouraging long-term behavior change that supports grid goals.

Federal rollbacks and funding shifts are already creating uncertainty, which can impact utility DSM program design, adoption and outcomes. This presents an opportunity for utilities to offer creative strategies that meet modern customer needs.

Deeper collaboration with state energy offices, local governments, green banks and community-based financing programs can help bridge the funding gaps created by changing or reduced federal incentives while also extending the reach of utility programs to align efforts across public and private sectors. Equally as important is investment in the trade ally ecosystem by educating and equipping contractors, installers and local vendors, which can reduce project delays and fallouts, and support the delivery of energy projects at scale.

This foundation is essential for expanding access to energy efficiency for low-income households and residents of aging buildings who face the highest energy burdens and lack access to efficiency upgrades, yet represent the greatest opportunities for savings. Prioritizing these groups amplifies program impact and helps utilities meet equity and affordability goals.

With the right partnerships, workforce and focus areas in place, utilities are better positioned to scale the most impactful strategies. Bundling energy efficiency with demand response and flexible load solutions form a ratepayer-funded, grid-integrated asset that delivers both short-term demand flexibility and long-term load reduction, helping utilities avoid or defer expensive new generation and infrastructure investments.

Energy efficiency also fuels the local economy. In Maryland, for example, over 70 contractors are actively involved in efficiency programs, driving economic activity that goes beyond kilowatt-hours saved and generates ripple effects that benefit entire communities.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/LRTFd824mo6o_8oNy3GkDUiM6b2oAEzCyfuPIL6O9Q4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9uZXN0X2hvbWVfZGVwb3QuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-24 15:18:54.444748

PowerTransitions has been talking with local officials and has an agreement in place with the owner of the Vernon property, NorthStar Group Services, to potentially lease the site.

Vermont Public Service Commissioner Kerrick Johnson has requested a meeting with the company to get more details on its proposal to develop the approximately 140 acres along the Connecticut River in Windham County.

“Once I became aware that there is a relationship between PowerTransitions and NorthStar, in our role to advocate on behalf of all Vermont ratepayers, this is a part of our departmental due diligence,” Johnson said.

Johnson said any consideration of siting a project in Vernon would have to take into account the high-level nuclear waste that is being stored near the former nuclear power plant.

“The site in Vernon has strengths and weaknesses,” Johnson said. “The high-level radioactive waste has to be viewed as something that has to be respected and avoided at all costs.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on its website, says battery storage systems “have raised legitimate safety concerns,” because they can catch fire and release harmful gases that pose health risks to nearby residents and first responders.

A representative from the company has been meeting with the Vernon Planning Commission about the plan.

“It’s got our interest,” said Vernon Planning Commission Chair Jim Pinkerton. “At this point this is kind of back-of-the-envelope sort of thing, but the demand for power is increasing all over the place, and there’s no telling where those industries are going to go.”

PowerTransitions first contacted NorthStar about two years ago, according to NorthStar CEO Scott State.

PowerTransitions acquires operating and retired power generation and industrial facilities, according to the company’s website, to “transform them into modern, resilient energy infrastructure campuses.”

State said he introduced the PowerTransitions officials to the town of Vernon, adding that it is still NorthStar’s intention to, “allow redevelopment of the site for a use preferred by the town of Vernon.”

NorthStar acquired the closed Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in 2019, becoming the first company in the United States to own a nuclear facility with the intention of dismantling and decommissioning the property.

Since then, NorthStar has removed more than 76,000 tons of material, much of which is low-level radioactive waste, that has been shipped to a storage facility in Texas.

Austin Energy says this agreement will support the utility’s goal of achieving 125MW of battery storage by the end of 2027.

The agreement is valued at an estimated US$14.4 million per year, with a term of up to 20 years, for a total estimated amount of US$288 million, representing Austin Energy’s largest energy storage initiative to date.

ESN reached out to Jupiter Power for more information regarding the project that would provide the 100MW for Austin Energy, but did not hear back before publication.

The company entered into a similar power purchase agreement (PPA) with Denton Municipal Electric (DME) in Denton, Texas, for the Tidwell Prairie II project, which was announced the day before the agreement with Austin Energy.

ESN Premium reported on this PPA when the agreement was discussed and unanimously approved during the City of Denton’s regular council meeting on 30 September.

Jupiter Power’s website does not list a BESS project in Travis County, where Austin is located.

The 200MW/400MWh Callisto I is located in Harris County, which encompasses most of Houston, Texas.

This would make Callisto I and Tidwell Prairie II the closest projects to Austin.

Jupiter Power also has multiple projects in Ward and Pecos County, which are approximately 100 miles further from the city.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/newsRelease.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 13:07:13.429522

Climate-focused community bank funds Virginia BESS projects

In other US battery storage financing news, two projects in Virginia totalling 20MW/80MWh have been financed by Climate First Bank, which claims to be a world-first “values-based, digital-forward community bank founded to combat the climate crisis.”

Insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Climate First Bank launched in 2021 to offer personal and commercial banking services alongside mission-aligned technologies, including rooftop solar PV and other renewable energy sources, building retrofits, electric vehicle (EV) charging, and carbon offset credits.

The bank has financed two projects in the rural towns of Exmore and Tasley, located approximately 24 kilometres apart on the eastern coast of the state.

The project developer is Patterson Enterprises, and the battery storage supplier will be the Chinese provider Great Power. Terms of the financial close were not disclosed in a Climate First Bank release.

The projects will be built near the A&N Electric Cooperative Substations in each town, using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology.

Culley Generating Station, backtracking on their commitment to be entirely coal-free by 2027. In previous CenterPoint plans, the utility wrote that “Coal plants have not been able to consistently compete on short term marginal price with renewable and gas energy” and that the plants, being old and outdated, were not designed to frequently cycle on and off, resulting in “increased maintenance costs and more frequent outages.”

Unit 3 of the Culley power plant has continued to have reliability issues and power outages, requiring costly upkeep and maintenance for CenterPoint that was then passed onto customers. Extending the life of the Culley plant poses more threats to reliability and affordability for customers.

Although the lowest cost resource plans in this study include retiring Culley Unit 3, CenterPoint did not even study a retirement prior to 2032.

In response, Nicole Chandler, Southwest Indiana Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer, released the following statement:

“The Culley coal plant is outdated, expensive, and unreliable. There’s no reason for CenterPoint to try to extend the life of a 50-year-old coal plant that continues to have power outages and costs even more to upkeep and maintain, while CenterPoint customers have been saddled with some of the highest utility bills in Indiana for years now.

“Instead of prioritizing solar and wind that’s more affordable and reliable for customers, the Trump Administration and Indiana legislators have continued to double down on expensive, polluting, and unreliable coal that costs more for all of us to keep our lights on and heat our homes. We can’t afford to keep throwing lifelines to coal.

(KLFY) — A multinational company has announced it will invest $277 million to build a rare-earth separation facility in Vinton, the first of its kind in the U.S., according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development.

Aclara Resources Inc. said in the release it will construct the first U.S. heavy rare-earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish.

The company is expected to create 140 direct new jobs at its first U.S. location. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 456 indirect jobs, for a total of 596 potential new job opportunities in the Southwest Region.

Rare Earth Elements are a group of 17 metals known for their unique magnetic, optical and conductive properties. These elements are used in modern technologies, from electric vehicles and wind turbines to smartphones and advanced defense systems.

“By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation,” said Gov. Jeff Landry. “We’re excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities — and for a Louisiana economy that’s ready to power and lead our nation’s future.”

The new facility will produce the heavy rare earth elements essential for applications which rely on advanced permanent magnets. By processing material from Aclara’s mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile, the Louisiana operation will create a reliable and sustainable U.S. supply of these materials, according to Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa.

“We are pleased to announce that we have secured a premium site in Louisiana for our U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility,” Barúa said. “From the beginning, our priority was to identify a location that could support rapid development, given the urgent need to establish a reliable supply of these critical minerals.”

Aclara Resources is controlled my majority stockholder Hochschild Mining, which is based in Lima, Peru, and has operations throughout South America.

The company selected the location after evaluating more than 100 potential U.S. sites for its proximity to key chemical suppliers, access to Gulf Coast logistics and availability of a skilled industrial workforce, LED said.

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. The facility will be built in phases, beginning with the rare earth separation plant, followed by potential future expansions to support downstream processing and alloy production as part of Aclara’s long-term growth strategy.

Ramaphosa calls for new ventures with Vietnam, as he points to low investment

President Cyril Ramaphosa today urged the Vietnamese to explore new ventures to diversify into untapped sectors and to build partnerships, to generate jobs, transfer skills and stimulate inclusive growth, as he noted low investment between South Africa and Vietnam.

Ramaphosa was speaking during a State visit to Vietnam, where he stated that there was no record of Vietnamese investments in South Africa.

He said there were several financial and non-financial support measures available for Vietnamese companies keen to invest in South Africa to diversify their supply chains.

He said both countries’ cooperation must extend into strategic sectors that define the economies of tomorrow.

These sectors include electric vehicles, battery manufacturing, renewable energy, agro-processing and digital innovation, he said.

However, Ramaphosa noted that in recent years, trade between South Africa and Vietnam expanded significantly.

South Africa ran a sizable trade deficit with Vietnam, importing significantly more than it exported, he pointed out.

He said the imbalance between the countries called for a move beyond the traditional trade in raw materials.

He said South Africa had much to offer Vietnam, in terms of mining, agriculture and manufacturing, while Vietnam, in turn, brought strengths in electronics, textiles, machinery and renewable-energy technologies.

South Africa boosts deportations amid jobs crisis, Schreiber says

South Africa is pushing to deport more undocumented migrants who compete with citizens for jobs in an economy with one of the highest unemployment rates globally, the minister overseeing the programme said.

The nation “is a neglected part of the global migration story,” with the contestation between foreigners and locals for positions becoming “a real tinderbox,” Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said today.

The department has deported 51 000 people in the last year — that’s more than France and Germany combined.

South Africa has the continent’s most industrialised economy and sees a constant influx of job seekers from neighbouring countries, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique. But with the unemployment rate running at 33.2%, tensions between locals and foreigners run high. About 8.4-million people are eligible to work yet don’t have jobs.

And, Lower CPI goal may save S Africa R900-billion in debt costs

Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago emphasised the benefits of a lower inflation goal, saying it could save the government as much as R900-billion over a decade in debt-service costs.

South Africa currently spends 22 cents of every rand on debt-service costs, crowding out investment in health and education.

Kganyago noted the debt-savings would dwarf the R60-billion the National Treasury expected to raise in the current fiscal year from a two-percentage-point value-added tax hike that was later scrapped after opposition from members of a coalition government, including the Democratic Alliance.

The governor announced in July that the central bank’s monetary policy decisions will now be guided by aiming at the floor of its 3%-to-6% inflation target instead of its previous objective of the midpoint of that range.

The South African Reserve Bank has argued that the current inflation target, which has not been reviewed since it was first adopted in 2000, is too high and wide, and that striving for 3% would help lower borrowing costs and make the nation more competitive among its trading partners.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act restores key provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including small business deductions and lower tax rates.

Long Island accountants say the reinstated 100% bonus depreciation offers major tax savings for real estate, construction, and manufacturing firms.

Termination of green energy credits may impact solar, auto, and energy-efficiency sectors across Long Island.

Experts urge businesses to plan strategically and consult tax professionals to maximize benefits under the new law.

The tax code changes brought about by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), cheered by many business leaders for restoring parts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, creates or returns several opportunities for businesses to reduce their tax exposure. Nevertheless, the implications of changing tax rules vary for every business, and experts from Long Island accounting firms remind owners that taking full advantage of the changes requires careful guidance.

Tax legislation can influence different aspects of businesses, explains Felicia Tucker, managing partner at the KPMG Long Island office in Melville. “In some instances, changes are designed to incentivize more business in the U.S., or drive economic growth and create jobs. Time will tell how that affects our clients. In other areas, the changes could result in further complexity (i.e. from clean energy tax credits).”

Provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that were scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025 have been extended by the federal government. “OBBBA permanently extended provisions regarding tax rates, standard deductions, the section 199a Small Business Tax deduction, and itemized deductions,” says Anthony Basile of Anthony Basile CPA in Woodbury.

However, the end of green energy tax programs may significantly impact several other business sectors locally. “Many energy credits have been terminated, so industries that are tied to alternative energy sources may be affected,” warns Basile, who lists solar panel companies, car dealerships and companies that install any energy-saving products and building materials among those facing more exposure.

In addition, businesses with employees that receive gratuities will need to adhere to new rule changes going into effect. “There are now limits on the taxation of tips and overtime [up to $25,000 for tips and up to $12,500 for overtime], which will require additional reporting by employers,” Basile says.

A major change for businesses comes from this year’s return of 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025. “This allows businesses to fully expense equipment, technology, and certain improvements again, giving significant flexibility for timing deductions,” notes Edward Kotlyanskiy, a partner at DDK in Jericho. “For taxpayers with irregular income or multi-year projects, there is even a transitional election to take 40% (of the deduction), which can help smooth taxable income rather than take the entire deduction at once.”

According to Kotlyanskiy, the return of full bonus depreciation carries significant implications for many prominent Long Island businesses. “Real estate developers, manufacturers and construction companies stand to benefit the most, since they often acquire significant property, equipment, or leasehold improvements that now qualify for immediate expense,” he says. “For real estate operators, this brings cost-segregation studies back to the forefront, as separating shorter-life components can yield substantial first-year deductions.

The change could even benefit healthcare businesses. “Even professional and medical practices investing in new equipment can use the reinstated 100% deduction to accelerate write-offs and reduce taxable income in 2025,” Kotlyanskiy says. He recommends businesses revisit depreciation schedules and capitalization policies, since many assets that would have been depreciated over several years can now be fully deducted in the year of acquisition.

Instead of seizing on the opportunity to maximize bonus depreciation of assets under the updated rule, Kotlyanskiy encourages businesses to plan the timing and amounts of their expenses to fit a long-term strategy. “Clients who want to reduce their tax exposure should be asking questions that go beyond: ‘What can I deduct?’” he says. “For instance, many of our business clients are asking whether accelerating equipment purchases before year-end makes sense under the reinstated bonus depreciation rules, or whether spreading them across years provides a smoother income profile.”

Automobile purchases should receive additional attention this year, especially considering recent changes to the way electric vehicle tax credits are administered. “The federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles (EVs) ended on Sept. 30, 2025,” explains Basile. “To be eligible for a tax credit, you must have purchased the vehicle on or before that date.” Earlier this year, Basile was able to advise a client who had initially believed the credit was expiring at the end of the year to purchase an electric/gas hybrid vehicle earlier to qualify for the credit. “He got his new car in July and we will be calculating the credit for him when we do his 2025 taxes,” Basile says.

Generally, accounting firms will provide clients with correspondence that keeps them current on legislation that could impact the way they file taxes. Often, these include specific questions which will target areas of the tax law that can be beneficial to the client. “Most CPA firms send a comprehensive tax organizer to clients annually, and it’s particularly important to review that this year,” says Basile.

KPMG is betting on technology solutions to keep its clients informed about changing tax codes. “We’ve been deploying ‘KPMG Digital Gateway’… to assist clients as they understand their tax impact,” says Tucker.

Kotlyanskiy prefers an approach centered on proactive analysis, forecasting, and restructuring before the end of the year in order to plan ahead of legislative and regulatory changes. “Our philosophy has always been to anticipate changes and align tax strategy with the client’s business objectives, not wait for the law to dictate the outcome,” he says.",https://libn.com/files/2025/10/focus1024.png,N,,2025-10-24 11:25:17.867311

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy’s nuclear power plant in Clinton.
The explosive growth of data center construction that has followed the boom in artificial intelligence has only added to that need.
At 400 megawatts, Broadwing would be only the second large-scale power generation project paired with carbon capture in the United States.
“There’s technology risk, performance risk, regulatory risk and overall economic risk.”","Google’s announcement of a power purchase agreement with Broadwing will allow Low Carbon Infrastructure to break ground in the first quarter, says CEO Jonathan Wiens.

“By agreeing to buy most of the power it generates, Google is helping get this new, baseload power source built and connected to the regional grid that supports our data centers,” Google said in its announcement, though it declined to say how much it plans to spend.

Google has two data centers on the Midcontinent Independent System Operator grid, or MISO, which serves downstate Illinois.

Google is the second major tech company to announce a power purchase agreement with a supplier connected to MISO. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy’s nuclear power plant in Clinton.

Google, Meta and other “hyperscalers” that operate massive data centers are under scrutiny for the power they consume and the pollution that results, leading them to search for sources of “clean” energy. The explosive growth of data center construction that has followed the boom in artificial intelligence has only added to that need.

Unlike Clinton, however, Broadwing isn’t yet producing energy. It’s an ambitious project that also involves ADM, which will use steam generated from the power plant for its food-processing facilities, as well as some of the electricity. ADM will take the compressed CO2 captured by Broadwing and store it in the company’s nearby carbon-capture wells.

Adding Google alongside ADM gives the project momentum. “I couldn’t ask for a better situation,” Wiens says.

The Google partnership is the result of three years of discussions. “Having them involved — one of the five largest companies in the world, putting their weight behind carbon capture, it’s a huge benefit,” Wiens says.

The idea of pairing carbon capture with natural gas-powered turbines has drawn interest as data center operators and other large users of electricity look for ways to generate power reliably while reducing pollution. One drawback of renewable sources, such as wind and solar, is their power output isn’t constant.

“If you can be low emission and meet peak demand requirements of a data center, that’s a material improvement over renewables,” says Mark Pruitt, former head of the Illinois Power Authority who now runs the Power Bureau, an energy consulting firm in Chesterton, Indiana.

At 400 megawatts, Broadwing would be only the second large-scale power generation project paired with carbon capture in the United States.

“Even if it gets built; even if it does work; I don’t know if it works long-term financially,” Pruitt says. “There’s technology risk, performance risk, regulatory risk and overall economic risk.”",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/google.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:51.477649

Licensing: Wald emphasized that U.S. energy policies regarding nuclear reactors must change, as the demand for electricity soars because of the energy requirements of AI data centers and other expected power needs. Among the policies that must be revised are the licensing actions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, because the procedures that needed for 30- to 300-megawatt advanced reactors are different from those required for 1,000-megawatt pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors.

He stressed that the licensing process for new nuclear needs to be speeded up, as also is noted in an executive order from President Trump. “Regulators must supply human intelligence to each license application, but their process must run many times faster than it does now, especially for licensing reactors that produce just 300 megawatts or 30 megawatts or 10 megawatts or 1 megawatt,” Wald said. “These are just one-by-one individual licenses. If we’re going to think big, we’ve got to rethink regulation.”

Wald opined that “what the NRC does is not very productive. It has a bureaucracy that is resistant to change and that’s now dealing with new technologies. . . . I am open to the idea that they’ll make errors [in an accelerated regulatory process], they’ll approve things they shouldn’t, and we’re going to learn from experience. [But] the NRC has this habit of approving things they’ve approved before and of not approving anything nobody’s ever done before. That’s not a recipe for successful innovation and industrial progress.”

Collective solutions: Wald pointed out that artisanal energy policies do not work well within the overall energy system. “Solar and wind tribalists say their costs are going down. But we’d be much better off if we put our money into collective solutions. We should invest in the electric grid. If all the money used to purchase 11-kilowatt emergency generators [solar panels], like I and others have in my neighborhood, had went into the grid instead, we’d all be better off.

“I think that solar and wind farms have their place, but only to the extent that they benefit the system,” he said. “Adding solar panels in a place where noontime electricity prices on the grid are negative is not a good idea, although federal and state incentives may make that happen.”

Wald added that the “amount of electricity transmission you need to support a new reactor is lower than what you need for wind or solar or hydro energy sources. Nuclear plants have reasonably flexible siting requirements.”",https://cdn.ans.org/i/favicon-128.png,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:15.183103

(KLFY) — A multinational company has announced it will invest $277 million to build a rare-earth separation facility in Vinton, the first of its kind in the U.S., according to a news release from Louisiana Economic Development.

Aclara Resources Inc. said in the release it will construct the first U.S. heavy rare-earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton in Calcasieu Parish.

The company is expected to create 140 direct new jobs at its first U.S. location. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 456 indirect jobs, for a total of 596 potential new job opportunities in the Southwest Region.

Rare Earth Elements are a group of 17 metals known for their unique magnetic, optical and conductive properties. These elements are used in modern technologies, from electric vehicles and wind turbines to smartphones and advanced defense systems.

“By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation,” said Gov. Jeff Landry. “We’re excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities — and for a Louisiana economy that’s ready to power and lead our nation’s future.”

The new facility will produce the heavy rare earth elements essential for applications which rely on advanced permanent magnets. By processing material from Aclara’s mineral deposits in Brazil and Chile, the Louisiana operation will create a reliable and sustainable U.S. supply of these materials, according to Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa.

“We are pleased to announce that we have secured a premium site in Louisiana for our U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility,” Barúa said. “From the beginning, our priority was to identify a location that could support rapid development, given the urgent need to establish a reliable supply of these critical minerals.”

Aclara Resources is controlled my majority stockholder Hochschild Mining, which is based in Lima, Peru, and has operations throughout South America.

The company selected the location after evaluating more than 100 potential U.S. sites for its proximity to key chemical suppliers, access to Gulf Coast logistics and availability of a skilled industrial workforce, LED said.

Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. The facility will be built in phases, beginning with the rare earth separation plant, followed by potential future expansions to support downstream processing and alloy production as part of Aclara’s long-term growth strategy.

The state of Louisiana offered Aclara Resources an incentive package that includes the workforce development by LED FastStart and a $3 million performance-based grant for utility and infrastructure improvements. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s High Impact Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption program.

WASHINGTON, DC – Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), Senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla (both D-CA), and 27 members of the California congressional delegation are urging(link is external) the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Inspector General to launch an independent investigation into the unlawful termination of $7.6 billion in grants to California and other states targeted for their perceived lack of support for President Trump.

The cancelling of these funds threatens thousands of jobs across energy, construction, and manufacturing sectors and could pass higher energy costs along to California residents.

“DOE does not have the authority to ignore the law, and Congress did not provide DOE with the discretion to terminate awards based on nebulous new criteria created by the Secretary years after enactment of the statute that funded and provided direction for these projects,” wrote the lawmakers.

In a letter to DOE’s Acting Inspector General Sarah Nelson, the lawmakers note that no state was hit harder than California. Out of the 321 terminated awards, DOE cancelled 79 awards in California, totaling more than $2 billion of federally funded projects. Among the projects was a backup battery power for a children’s hospital in Madera and an award worth $1.2 billion for the ARCHES hydrogen hub which had garnered bipartisan public support.

“These 321 grant project terminations will have real effects on affordability for our constituents and on the nation’s competitiveness. In the last year, electricity prices have increased twice as fast as the overall cost of living. Secretary Wright and the Trump administration’s decision to take $7.56 billion in energy projects offline is going to further constrain supply and send Americans’ electric bills through the roof,” the lawmakers continued.

Dear Acting Inspector General Nelson:

We write to request that your office immediately launch a formal investigation of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) recent termination of $7.56 billion in grant awards in states that did not vote for the President. These unjustified terminations call into question whether DOE followed appropriations law and raise serious doubts about the Department’s ability to meet its contractual and grant obligations. Terminating grants based on partisan criteria suggests significant unlawful bias at the highest levels of the Department. Therefore, a full investigation is warranted.

On October 1, 2025, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on X: “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled. More info to come from @ENERGY. The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA”. Every one of these states gave their electoral votes to Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Out of the 321 awards deemed unworthy by DOE, it strains credulity to believe that all but seven of them happened to be in blue states.

No state was hit harder by these terminations than California. Out of the 321 terminated awards, DOE chose to cancel 79 awards in California, alone. In total, more than $2 billion of federally funded projects for California were included in this barrage of terminations. The recipients included state government, local governments, electric utilities, and innovative American energy companies. One of the projects would have provided backup battery power for a children’s hospital in Madera. One award for $1.2 billion was for the ARCHES hydrogen hub, a significant project that garnered public support from both Democrats and Republicans. Scores of projects were focused on boosting grid reliability and American domestic manufacturing. Overall, DOE’s terminations threaten the existence of thousands of jobs in the energy, construction, and manufacturing sectors.

It is not clear to us how DOE could have considered these projects unworthy of continuance, save for the obvious partisan reasons outlined above. Secretary Wright even specifically called out our state during interviews on CNN and Fox News: “California can do what it wants, but the 49 other states’ taxpayers shouldn’t be subsidizing that.” In the past several years, California has annually contributed around $600 billion in revenue to the federal government, making it a top donor state to the federal Treasury.3

The process by which these terminations were approved also warrants intense scrutiny. During his interview with CNN on October 2, 2025, Secretary Wright explained that these terminations were a result of a months- long review of more than 2,400 projects. It remains unclear why such a review was necessary, and the Department has failed to produce a shred of evidence purporting waste, fraud, or abuse in any of these thousands of projects approved under the last administration. Indeed, the only criteria that condemned these projects to termination seem to be: 1) they were approved under the Biden Administration and 2) they were awarded to recipients located in states that did not vote for the President. Secretary Wright also mentioned that this review was conducted by “a team of seven or eight people”. The positions and qualifications of these individuals deserve scrutiny; it is unknown, for instance, if this team of people was comprised of any career officials, agency lawyers, or technical experts, or whether the team was comprised of DOGE personnel.

The Department’s press release states: “Using this review process, DOE evaluated each of these awards and determined that they did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment.” There are serious problems with this statement. First, DOE has provided no evidence or quantifiable data to Congress to justify any assertion that these projects did not meet economic, national security, or energy security standards. In fact, DOE has demonstrated a stunning lack of responsiveness to congressional correspondence on previous grant terminations.

Second, no order, whether presidential or secretarial, can override a statute enacted by Congress. Much of the funding for these projects came from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a law that Congress passed with the support of both Democrats and Republicans. Congress directed DOE to establish these programs and use this funding to provide grant awards to further the intent of the statute. DOE does not have the authority to ignore the law, and Congress did not provide DOE with the discretion to terminate awards based on nebulous new criteria created by the Secretary years after enactment of the statute that funded and provided direction for these projects.

It is also unclear whether the Department conducted the appropriate internal reviews and analyses prior to approving these terminations, which raises important legal questions. Additionally, grant recipients were largely excluded from these deliberations and kept in the dark. Days after DOE’s termination announcement, many recipients reported that they had not even received a termination notice from the Department. At the very least, recipients deserve communication from the agency and an opportunity to appeal in accordance with DOE grant regulations. DOE’s actions cast doubt on the Department’s ability to be a reliable and trustworthy partner for the private sector.

It is imperative that these terminations be thoroughly investigated and the results shared with the Congress, especially in light of Secretary Wright’s assertion that he does not intend to stop wantonly terminating grant awards: “We released some announcements a few months ago. We’ll have many more coming this fall.” These 321 grant project terminations will have real effects on affordability for our constituents and on the nation’s competitiveness. In the last year, electricity prices have increased twice as fast as the overall cost of living. Secretary Wright and the Trump administration’s decision to take $7.56 billion in energy projects offline is going to further constrain supply and send Americans’ electric bills through the roof.

Secretary Wright’s termination decisions are both unlawful and will cause harm to Americans. We respectfully request that your office investigate these terminations thoroughly.

The solution for most nations is to turn to one of the three main components of the renewable energy sector: wind, solar, and nuclear.

Poland is the last remaining stronghold of the coal energy sector in Europe

The international embrace of the renewable energy sector has reached nearly every corner of the world, nearly. Some nations have stagnated in the adoption of the sector in favor of the more reliable energy generation that the fossil fuel sector presents.

Nations like Australia have no sign of the renewable energy sector emerging as a contender for the crown of energy king. Australia is among the nations of the world that still place an exceedingly high importance on the coal sector.

Poland has the unwelcome reputation as the last stronghold of coal in Europe. It is the only EU member state that still produces the “black gold”. As such, many leaders in Poland have called for more work to be done to phase out the coal and gas sectors in their nation. In stepped Vestas with a plan to construct a massive wind turbine manufacturing facility.

In 2012, approximately 90% of Poland’s energy came from coal, which has since been dramatically reduced. At the moment, the number sits closer to 50%, which is still significantly higher than any other EU member state.

“We entered the period of transition with our energy balance dependent on practically one resource: coal. In spite of such difficult beginnings, Poland has maintained emission reductions at the level present in other EU member states: its use of coal in electric energy production has fallen by 19 per cent over the last 30 years.” – Michał Kurtyka, Polish Minister of the Environment

A lack of demand in Poland has led Vestas to shelve its largest project to date

The Danish wind turbine manufacturer has stated that it plans to halt construction of its largest factory in Poland due to a lack of demand in its main European market. The company announced its plans to build an offshore wind project in Poland last year. The facility was set to deliver its first wind blades by 2026 and could have employed over 1,000 people.

The company informed several news organizations of its plans to shelve the project in Poland “due to a lower-than-expected demand for offshore wind in Europe”.

In August, Poland’s President Karol Nwrocki vetoed a bill aimed at relaxing rules for the construction of onshore wind farms. However, the lack of demand has led Vestas to pull out of its plans to manufacture wind turbines in Poland. While Poland sees an exodus of wind, Germany has opened an 11.4 MW wind farm in Herbsleben-Dachwig.

Stewart noted the county bill was made possible in part by state Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Dist. 20), who in 2021 sponsored legislation passed by the Maryland General Assembly that authorized the county to create a Community Choice Aggregator pilot program.

Under the bill passed Tuesday, the county would have to consider factors such as sustainability, availability and affordability in deciding its preferred mix of energy sources.

“Due to shifting federal climate policies, volatile energy prices from our regional transmission operator and rising demand, it is critical for the county to pursue local strategies that stabilize energy costs and advance climate initiatives,” Stewart said during the briefing Tuesday.

The Potomac Electric Power Co. [Pepco] recently asked a state agency for permission to raise rates for customers in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties.

If approved, the proposal filed Oct. 14 with the Maryland Public Service Commission would result in an increase of $11.73 a month on the average customer bill.

The commission expects to rule on the rate case next summer, but existing rates will be frozen pending that decision, according to a press release from the agency.

The county’s aggregator plan will also require approval by the commission before it can be implemented.

In an emailed statement to Bethesda Today on Thursday, Pepco spokesperson Rodney Wilson said the company is aware of the county’s plan to create a Community Choice Aggregator.

“Pepco has been an active participant in the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) Working Group around Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) in Montgomery County and will continue to collaborate with legislators, the PSC and other stakeholders to comply with the legislation while ensuring the continued delivery of safe, reliable energy service to our customers and communities in Montgomery County,” the statement read.",https://assets.bethesdamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DSC_1908-scaled-1-e1761256461811.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 14:08:17.778146

Texas Health’s community well-being programs like Texas Health Community Hope and the Good For You Healthy Hub provide fresh produce and nutrition education to families in need.
The TxN 20 program not only honors leaders in sustainability but also serves as a resource for best practices and performance metrics.
“I’m thrilled to celebrate this year’s TxN 20,” said Bush.","Texas Health Resources has been recognized as a 2025 Texan by Nature 20 (TxN 20) industry leader in sustainability and conservation for the seventh year in a row. It is the only health system included in this year’s class of honorees.

“Being named to the TxN 20 is more than an honor – it reflects our unwavering commitment to building a healthier future for North Texans, not just through care but through conservation,” said Barclay Berdan, FACHE, CEO of Texas Health. “We believe sustainability is a form of stewardship and caring for our environment is deeply connected to caring for our communities.”

Texan by Nature, founded by former First Lady Laura Bush, is a nonprofit organization that connects conservation and business for the benefit of Texas. The TxN 20 award recognizes the most innovative conservation work across the state.

“Our conservation efforts go beyond reducing emissions or saving water,” said Shaun Clinton, senior vice president of supply chain management at Texas Health. “They’re embedded into daily operations and deeply connected to improving lives.”

Texas Health has integrated a wide range of conservation measures into its operations, including building energy-efficient facilities, repurposing and recycling materials and using low-water irrigation.

The company’s new building designs meet high environmental standards and incorporate green building guidelines into all expansion and renovation projects.

Texas Health’s community well-being programs like Texas Health Community Hope and the Good For You Healthy Hub provide fresh produce and nutrition education to families in need. The Culled Produce Recovery Program reduces food waste by redirecting unsellable fruits and vegetables to local urban farms for composting.

Texan by Nature works with businesses across the state to promote conservation-driven practices. The TxN 20 program not only honors leaders in sustainability but also serves as a resource for best practices and performance metrics.

“I’m thrilled to celebrate this year’s TxN 20,” said Bush. “Their leadership shows what is possible and I encourage other companies to follow their example. Together, we can sustain a prosperous economy, rich natural resources and a secure future for the next generation.”",https://www.crosstimbersgazette.com/crosstimbersgazette/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TexasHealthgardens2025-e1761268891734.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:35.602809

A report from Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee today claims Scotland's energy sector is at a ""critical juncture” with communities at risk because of huge job losses offshore and in supply chains.

GMB, one of the biggest unions across the energy sector, said the report is only the latest to expose the widening gulf between ministers’ rhetoric around promised jobs in renewable energy and the reality.

Louise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary, said: “The alarm bells around the so-called just transition have been ringing constantly for years but are now deafening.

“Ministers’ can no longer stick their fingers in their ears and shout more loudly about all the great things coming tomorrow while ignoring catastrophic job losses today.

“The MPs’ report is grim but completely unsurprising and comes days after the Scottish and UK governments were continuing to insist they have a plan. If they do, it is beyond time to share it.

“No matter how many times they are repeated, promises and platitudes will not feed families, heat homes or protect our communities.

“We must build supply chains in renewables but our offshore industries demand urgent protection because our country will need its oil and gas, energy security and jobs for years to come.”",,N,,2025-10-24 10:19:25.793440

,American Energy,2025-10-24 14:00:44+00:00,The North State Journal | Elevate the conversation.,CURTIS: Winning against China means winning on energy | The North State Journal,"Trisha Curtis, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://nsjonline.com/article/2025/10/curtis-winning-against-china-means-winning-on-energy/,"China now boasts one-third of the world’s power generation, more than 10,000 TWh.
In 2024, China added more than 500 TWh of coal-fired power generation, equivalent to half of Japan’s entire grid.
China has more coal-fired power generation than any nation on Earth has total power generation.
The EPA is moving to rescind the Endangerment Finding, which weakened America’s energy security by shuttering coal power plants.
China’s cheap and reliable coal power underpins its industrial manufacturing power.","China spent the past 40 years building an industrial powerhouse fueled by coal, while American politicians, Europe and California focused on decarbonizing and greenwashing. Such efforts enabled the purchase of Chinese wind turbines, solar panels and batteries, made from cheap coal, further subsidized power and forced labor. These products have been forced into the grid at the expense of the consumer, the economy and the nation, driving electricity prices higher and reliability lower.

As the Western world buys cheap Chinese green tech, China continues to build out its manufacturing base. China now boasts one-third of the world’s power generation, more than 10,000 TWh. In 2024, China added more than 500 TWh of coal-fired power generation, equivalent to half of Japan’s entire grid. More than 5,800 TWh of China’s power generation comes from coal alone. China has more coal-fired power generation than any nation on Earth has total power generation. China consumes more coal now than at any time in history and constitutes more than half of global coal consumption.

Coal is reliable, energy-secure, cheap and easily transportable. It produces direct process heat for industrial use and stable, dispatchable baseload power generation. The Chinese green tech that European countries and U.S. states prize is only cheap because it is subsidized, made with inexpensive coal, forced labor and in a country with no rule of law, let alone environmental standards.

The reason China controls the rare earth market is it processes and refines the rare earths and metals, a dirty and energy-intensive business that requires removing thorium and uranium. China’s access to ample, redundant power from coal allows them to dominate the processing of rare earths, but it also enables them to make everything from smartphones and weapons to robotics.

U.S. utility companies with executive pay tied to ESG metrics and states with unfair power purchase agreements (including Texas) have favored adding wind and solar into the grid at the expense of reliable baseload power, including coal and natural gas. These states flood the grid with intermittent wind and solar, leading directly to rising electricity prices. These states are also removing reliable baseload power in the form of inexpensive coal.

This is taking place in Colorado. In California, the result is rolling blackouts, imported electricity and some of the highest power prices in the nation. It is worse in Europe; a war is being waged, and European nations lack the power generation to build the ammunition and weapons to support Ukraine.

Germany has some of the highest electricity prices in the world. Drones, AI and air defense all require power generation. China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are not making weapons with wind and solar power, nor is Ukraine defending their country and making drones with it.

When it comes to energy, the U.S. should be winning the competition with China. The U.S. is producing 13.6 million barrels per day (mbd) of oil, more than any nation on Earth, ever. That is almost 4 mbd more than the next two largest producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia, who produce roughly 10 mbd. The U.S. produces 130 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas, more than double Russia, the second-largest producer in the world.

Natural gas makes up a substantial portion of the U.S. grid, but the grid has weakened as politicians forced the green agenda, pushing wind and solar at the expense of low-cost coal. The U.S. now has more wind and solar power generation than coal.

The Trump administration’s policy shifts and energy agenda are critical in head-to-head competition with China. Energy is the lifeblood of a nation. The Trump administration understands that without abundant and reliable power, America cannot manufacture.

In his U.N. address, Trump called out Europe’s energy failures and high electricity prices. His Interior Department just opened 13.1 million acres for coal leasing, ending an Obama-era de facto moratorium. The EPA is moving to rescind the Endangerment Finding, which weakened America’s energy security by shuttering coal power plants. China’s cheap and reliable coal power underpins its industrial manufacturing power. If America wants to remain free, strong and prosperous, we must unleash our energy resources, including natural gas and coal, rebuild our industrial base, and embrace affordable and reliable power.

COLUMBIA, S.C. – Scout Motors is making an additional investment of $300 million in South Carolina to build a Supplier Park on the site of its Production Center in Blythewood. This initiative, which does not come with any new government incentives, is expected to support approximately 1,000 additional supplier jobs and represents a critical expansion of the company’s existing investment of more than $2 billion in the state.

“This expansion reinforces our long-term commitment to American manufacturing and reflects our continued belief in South Carolina as a hub for automotive innovation and economic growth,” said Scott Keogh, President and Chief Executive Officer of Scout Motors. “Our on-site Supplier Park will strengthen our production capabilities and help establish a vibrant, resilient supply chain ecosystem that will benefit the region for decades to come.”

Located adjacent to the main Production Center buildings, the Supplier Park spans nearly 200 acres and will feature more than 2.3 million square feet of specialized manufacturing and logistics space across three key centers: • Just in Time (JIT) Facility dedicated to sequencing parts for final vehicle assembly. • Battery Assembly Building designed for high-volume battery assembly. • Accessories Building to support upfitting and installation of vehicle accessories.

In addition to building the physical footprint, Scout Motors is in the process of finalizing supplier contracts that are expected to drive a multiplier effect across the local economy. Early estimates suggest that supplier agreements already awarded represent $368 million in investments and are expected to support more than 1,000 new jobs in South Carolina.

The Supplier Park will serve as a central logistics and production hub, supporting seamless delivery of parts, batteries, and accessories to Scout Motors’ main assembly operations. The size and scope of the park reflect Scout Motors’ strategy to build a fully integrated, domestic supply chain for its trucks and SUVs.

""When Scout Motors announced they were coming to South Carolina, we knew it would set off a chain reaction of investment and job creation across our state,"" said Governor Henry McMaster. ""This announcement further highlights Scout Motors’ commitment to our continued prosperity and the seemingly limitless economic opportunities they're creating for our people.""

“The latest investment from Scout Motors demonstrates their strong commitment to our state and reinforces our position as a leader in manufacturing,” said U.S. Senator Tim Scott. “This expansion will not only create jobs but support continued growth and opportunity in South Carolina.”

""I am grateful that Scout Motors is investing additional funds in the Second Congressional District, creating hundreds of new, good-paying jobs, benefiting businesses throughout the state,” said U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. “As an indication of my support, I have personally provided payment to reserve a Scout hybrid pickup truck.”

“This $300 million Supplier Park and the 1,000 new jobs it brings to South Carolina reflect the impact of Scout’s decision to call our state home,"" said SC Senate President Thomas Alexander. “This investment is a powerful reminder that our state can compete with anyone in attracting investment and jobs, while ensuring that families and communities here at home share in the benefits of today’s announcement for generations to come.”

“Scout Motors’ decision to expand their investment in South Carolina confirms what we have long known — our state is a premier destination for innovation and growth,” said SC House Speaker Murrell Smith. “This new Supplier Park will not only bring good jobs and economic opportunity to Richland County but will also strengthen the foundation of prosperity for generations of South Carolinians to come.”

“This supplier park is a major milestone in the Scout Motors project and for Richland County, signifying a new era of growth in innovative manufacturing and opportunity,” said Jesica Mackey, Co-Chair, Columbia Area Development Partnership and Chair, Richland County Council. “Not only does it infuse an immediate investment of capital that further strengthens our community, it sets the stage for other businesses to enter the market that will bring in career opportunities and partnerships.”

The construction contract has been awarded to Evans General Contractors, a nationally respected firm with strong local ties. PRP Real Assets is serving as the Project Advisor.

“It has been an incredible opportunity to work with the Scout Motors team on the new plant,” said Paul C. Dougherty, President of PRP Real Assets. “PRP is honored to be a small part of what will be the most thrilling new trucks and SUVs ever produced. We look forward to seeing the new vehicles roll off the assembly line in Blythewood, SC.”

Michigan’s Solar Expansion Faces Its First State-Level Test

Michigan has officially entered a new era of renewable energy oversight. For the first time, a solar developer has filed plans directly with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) for approval, bypassing local zoning boards under the state’s new Clean Energy and Jobs Act of 2024.

The proposed project, covering 873 acres in Ingham County, represents a major shift in how large-scale solar farms will be reviewed and approved across Michigan. The legislation, which took effect in 2025, allows developers to seek state approval for utility-scale renewable projects if local governments do not have compliant permitting ordinances in place.

This is a test case for a policy that could accelerate Michigan’s clean energy transition while also reigniting debates about local control, farmland preservation, and community involvement.

Learn more about how local concerns have shaped solar siting before this policy change in https://michigansolarpartners.com/blendon-township-battery-project-sparks-safety-concerns and https://michigansolarpartners.com/huron-county-solar-cap-back-under-review-growth-limits-or-missed-opportunities.

What the New Law Changes for Solar Developers

Before 2025, large solar farms were primarily subject to local zoning approval, which often created friction between developers and township governments. Some local boards imposed temporary bans or restrictive ordinances that slowed renewable progress.

Under the new system, the MPSC now has authority to review projects larger than 50 megawatts (MW) when local ordinances fail to meet minimum renewable energy siting standards.

According to the MPSC, this new framework will:

Provide predictable timelines for clean energy developers

Ensure consistent environmental and land-use standards statewide

Maintain public participation requirements, including hearings and community comment periods

However, township officials argue that the rule undermines local decision-making. As one Ingham County resident told reporters, “We’re the guinea pigs for what happens when Lansing takes over.”

This marks the first real-world test of how the state’s policy will balance speed, scale, and community input.

Balancing Local Control and Statewide Goals

The debate over who should control renewable energy development is not new in Michigan. Similar tensions surfaced when battery storage projects in Coldwater and Blendon Township raised questions about zoning authority and public safety.

The new MPSC-led process is designed to address that friction by setting statewide minimum standards for noise, setbacks, decommissioning, and farmland protection. Some local leaders still fear it removes too much autonomy from rural governments.

Learn how past projects shaped this policy shift in https://michigansolarpartners.com/coldwater-takes-the-lead-in-energy-storage.

Clean energy advocates argue that the policy will help Michigan meet its target of 100 percent clean electricity by 2040, a goal established in Governor Whitmer’s climate plan.

Economic and Environmental Stakes

The Ingham County project would generate roughly 150 MW of solar power, enough to power about 30,000 homes. Beyond electricity generation, it could deliver new construction and maintenance jobs to mid-Michigan and expand the local tax base.

The developer, whose name has not yet been disclosed, plans to use low-impact construction methods to preserve soil health and restore pollinator habitats, practices increasingly common among Michigan solar sites.

This mirrors trends seen in https://michigansolarpartners.com/from-brownfields-to-brightfields-michigans-hidden-solar-opportunity-on-industrial-land, where previously underused areas are repurposed for clean energy without displacing farmland.

What Happens Next

The MPSC will now begin its formal review process, including a public hearing phase expected later this year. If approved, the project could break ground in 2026.

Observers say the outcome will set a strong precedent for how Michigan balances rapid renewable expansion, local engagement, and environmental responsibility.

If the process succeeds, dozens of pending solar projects may follow suit and apply directly through the MPSC, transforming Michigan’s renewable energy permitting landscape.

Looking Ahead: Michigan’s Renewable Rules Get Real

This first MPSC filing is more than a bureaucratic milestone. It is the stress test for Michigan’s new clean energy policy framework.

If it streamlines the path for responsible development while preserving transparency and local voice, Michigan could become a national model for smart renewable growth.

If not, the policy could face legal challenges or community backlash that slow the state’s solar progress.

Either way, all eyes are on Ingham County. The results of this case will shape how Michigan’s solar future unfolds for years to come.",https://i0.wp.com/michigansolarpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pexels-photo-4320449.jpeg?fit=1200%2C674&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-24 14:59:55.227202

Atlanta-based Georgia Power yesterday announced the start of construction at its 200 MW/800 MWh BESS in Twiggs County, southeast of Macon, Georgia.

The utility will own the BESS, which is being built next to the Twiggs County Solar project by North Carolina-based construction company Crowder Industrial Construction, LLP.

Georgia Power said the BESS was selected via a tender as a result of its Integrated Resource Plan Update in 2023 and was approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) last month.

The utility said it is already constructing the 49.5 MW Moody BESS in Lowndes County, near the Moody Air Force Base solar site, which is due in May; the 128 MW Robbins BESS, near the Robbins Air Force Base solar site in Bibb County, due June; the 530 MW phases I and II of its McGrau Ford BESS in Cherokee County, due October 2026 and September, respectively; and the 57.5 MW Hammond BESS on the retired Plant Hammond coal-fired power station site in Floyd County, due November next year.

The electric company is seeking Georgia PSC approval for more than 3.02 GW of energy storage capacity across 10 BESS and a further 350 MW of BESS project capacity at two solar-plus-storage sites and says it will tender for a further 500 MW of BESS with at least two hours of storage capacity. Bids will be due in that tender in “early 2026” with the projects to be delivered before 2032, the utility said.

Arizona

Out west, the Recurrent Energy business owned by Canadian Solar on Tuesday announced an $825 million finance package for energy storage and solar projects in Maricopa County, Arizona.

The construction finance loans and tax equity commitment will fund the under-construction, 600 MWh Desert Bloom Storage site and the 150 MW (AC) Papago Solar project. Recurrent did not separate out funding details for the separate facilities.

Both sites are due online before July and are being developed as part of a multi-project deal signed by Recurrent and utility Arizona Public Service (APS). They follow construction of the 1.2 GWh Papago Storage site which began operating in Maricopa County in July, under a 20-year “tolling agreement” with APS, by which the utility operates the site for the contract term.

Recurrent said German public lender Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale; Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.; US rural banking network CoBank; and Germany’s Siemens Financial Services provided the construction finance element of the funding package. US banking giant Wells Fargo provided the tax equity commitment.

Dallas-based Primoris Services Corp. is providing engineering, procurement, and construction services for the Desert Bloom Storage site, Recurrent said.

More BESS?

And there could be more BESS on the way courtesy of Redwood’s latest funding round.

The Nevada-based company develops BESS, makes battery components, and produces critical raw materials cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and cathode active material. Announcing the results of the Series E funding round yesterday, Redwood said the $350 million would be injected across its operations.

Stating its BESS can also be used to optimize electricity supply from natural gas turbines and nuclear, a press release issued by Redwood about the funding round said, “By combining deep materials and manufacturing expertise with advanced power electronics and software, Redwood is creating a new generation of US-made energy storage systems … reducing reliance on imported LFP [lithium iron phosphate] batteries.”

Some of this increase is due to higher demand on utility companies from AI centers, according to BlockClub Chicago.
It should come as no surprise, then, that plans to build more data centers have run headlong into some opposition.
For example, voters kicked out officials in Warrenton, Virginia, who supported a new Amazon data center in 2024, according to Data Center Watch.
The biggest challenge remains accommodating AI data centers’ massive appetite for electricity.","The explosive growth in artificial intelligence (AI) has put Big Tech companies on a collision course with many rural communities that do not want massive data centers in their backyard. But while the speeding train of AI likely can’t be stopped, policymakers and AI executives have a responsibility to balance the interests of AI companies and everyday Americans – particularly when it comes to ensuring both have affordable, reliable energy.

Throughout the country, Big Tech companies are building or planning to construct more than 1,000 data centers to house all the servers needed to power the massive growth in AI. One researcher told The Epoch Times that “there are 1,827 active data centers in the United States, with another 1,726 announced and 419 currently under construction.”

Each of these centers needs land, water, and electricity to operate. Electricity prices have already risen faster than inflation since 2021, and are projected to increase more in the years ahead. Some of this increase is due to higher demand on utility companies from AI centers, according to BlockClub Chicago.

It should come as no surprise, then, that plans to build more data centers have run headlong into some opposition. In many cases, local citizens are speaking out against what they view as an encroachment in their communities, partially based on concerns about electric bills, competition for scarce water resources, and changes to the character of a community when massive warehouses are built where farmland or forests once stood.

These battles have serious political consequences as well. For example, voters kicked out officials in Warrenton, Virginia, who supported a new Amazon data center in 2024, according to Data Center Watch. That website also reported that “In Cascade Locks, Oregon, voters recalled two Port Authority officials in June 2023 for supporting a $100 million data center project from Roadhouse Digital… Following the recall election, the new board canceled the data center project in July 2023.” This spring, residents of Valparaiso, Indiana, also opposed even the possibility of a data center moving into their city, leading the developer to pull the idea.

But despite these victories for a few communities, the AI genie likely can’t be put back in the bottle – the industry is projected to quintuple in value in the next five years alone, according to one estimate. AI is now being used not just in sophisticated financial modeling and healthcare systems, but also by millions of Americans who use ChatGPT, Grok, or other platforms to look up recipes, help with homework, or organize their daily lives. AI is already an integral part of the U.S. economy.

But despite some tension, there is still hope that AI companies can coexist with the communities they build in – if they take some steps to listen to community members and invest in them.

The biggest challenge remains accommodating AI data centers’ massive appetite for electricity. According to NPR, “a typical AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, and the largest under development will consume 20 times more.” Multiplied out over thousands of data centers, that’s the equivalent of adding tens of millions of homes to the grid in just a few years.

While politicians continue to argue about the best way to meet this demand, what’s not up for debate is the looming energy crisis facing the country if no action is taken.

President Donald Trump has embraced this challenge head-on, promising on the campaign trail last year to “make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far.” Trump has advocated for an “all of the above” approach to energy that includes renewable projects as well as increasing production of oil and gas, restarting coal power plants, and reinvesting in nuclear. Recent advancements in small modular reactor technology and fusion breakthroughs have made nuclear energy particularly promising. This approach has the dual benefit of improving the reliability of the grid while also creating high-paying jobs.

In Indiana, the projected growth in AI energy use is expected to be larger than the output from coal plants which are slated to close. But this creates an opportunity, according to a white paper by Shashank Chandrakumara.

“Indiana can address this challenge by requiring data center companies to directly fund the redevelopment of coal plants that are nearing retirement or closure,” Chandrakumara wrote for the Indiana Policy Review. “By doing so, these companies can upgrade existing facilities to generate additional power and build new data centers near these sites.”

There is a public relations benefit to this as well, Chandrakumara predicts – the investments will “minimize community backlash.” And of course, investing in coal plants and keeping them open will create, or at least sustain, jobs in the local community. Residents may also be more inclined to live with a data center nearby if it means more job opportunities at a new nearby power plant.

He argues that this strategy, called “colocation,” can also address other concerns residents have about noise, pollution, and water usage by data centers. Since the companies are working at sites that have historically operated as industrial facilities, residents are familiar with how to handle some of these challenges – much like how one factory taking over another factory does not materially change the living situation for anyone in that community.

Nuclear energy advocates also believe that nuclear can meet the country’s increasing electricity demand. A blog post from Georgia Tech earlier this year argues that “nuclear power, with its high energy density and continuous operation, is well-suited to provide the steady base load of electricity required” for data centers.

Furthermore, AI can actually help mitigate some of the risks normally associated with nuclear power by making detection of potential problems easier, according to Erickson.

This is the model being used by Microsoft, which is working with a local energy company in Pennsylvania to reopen Three Mile Island, a nuclear facility in the Keystone State. The reopening of the plant, which closed in 2019 because of financial problems, is intended “to power the tech giant’s AI data centers” while creating jobs and billions of dollars in economic value, according to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star.

The situation is a win-win – Microsoft gets a steady supply of energy and hundreds of local residents will get jobs, along with potentially cheaper electricity, from the new deal.

The path forward for Big Tech companies and Americans who share a community with a data center does not have to be contentious. Instead of trampling over small towns and everyday people, Big Tech companies can win over residents by creating jobs and making investments themselves in the energy infrastructure. It is not a question of if new data centers will open up – but how they will do so in a way that promotes prosperity for all.",https://static-asset.amac.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24092049/AI-Data-Center.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 12:04:59.555850

If you want to step out of the crowds, there are a few hidden gems inside the fairgrounds.

Old Grist Mill

For people going through Gate 8 of the North Carolina State Fairgrounds, there's a small gray mill that typically has a long line of people. This is the Old Grist Mill.

Daryl Spencer, the North Carolina Cornmillers president and owner and CEO of Buffaloe Milling, has been running the Old Grist Mill since the early 80s.

“I was one of the two people that put all the equipment in the middle here originally and got it running,” Spencer said.

He said that when he first saw the mill, despite the wheel spinning, it was not functional in producing cornmeal. After Spencer gave it a facelift, however, visitors can see how the mill actually works.

“We have a demonstration of actual stone-ground cornmeal with plexiglass around it where you can actually see the corn going into the middle of the stone coming out the edge,” Spencer said. “We take it back to sift and sift the brand. The brands, the outside part of the grain. It looks like a little fingernail. Get that out to make a better appearance when you cook product.”

No product is made at the mill, but the experience of exploring the mill and collecting a bag of grists, or hushpuppy mix, on the way out is a traditional N.C. State Fair experience.

“When people who walk through and eat a hushpuppy, maybe they’ll go home and they cook some,” Spencer said.

Either way you try these iconic hushpuppies, he is excited for people to try his product.

“I like to make people happy when they eat what I’ve cooked,” Spencer.

Flower & Garden Show

After you have your hushpuppies, head over to the Flower & Garden Show.

“I like to think of it as Disneyworld or Disneyland, but in Raleigh. For 11 days, you got 11 days of Disneyland out here,” said Daniel Danford, the Flower & Garden Show director.

Danford has been working at the Flower & Garden Show at the North Carolina State Fair for years. Carefully placing thousands of flowers across roughly five acres.

“It’s over 2,000 little plants I’ve planted this year. All in the beds throughout the gardens,” Danford said.

Not only has he been planting thousands of flowers, he has placed around 1,500 locally grown mums. Each year he makes a new arrangement with the potted flowers.

“I was looking at it and I was like, ‘You know what? They’d be really cool to do a quilt of mums,’” Danford said.

The centerpiece of it all is the mum tree, an iconic photo destination at the fair.

“Believe it or not, this was once the first mum tree in the country. When the guys developed it at N.C. State, there was no other thing like that,” Danford said.

There are also 26 gardens in competition in this area, which include student groups and professional categories. Each competing under a themed category.

“The beauty of it too is that the schools are separate from the adults. Everybody is a winner. All 26 gardens walk home with a ribbon and some kind of money prize,” Danford said.

Gourds, Bonsai, carved pumpkins, a Butterfly Barn, scarecrows and a very well-known big red chair for photos are just some of the other attractions at the Flower & Garden Show.

“This is the one place you can actually feel free to let your child’s hand go. Kids love it. They run around in the grass, and they roll around in the grass, and the parents will sit at the picnic tables keeping an eye on them, of course,” Danford said.

Inside the large tent near the mums are thousands of cut flowers in competition for the coveted blue ribbon, ranging from small arrangements to large Elephant ears.

Danford has also planted a sensory garden full of plants and herbs that are full of smells and different textures to touch, making sure everyone can experience the Flower & Garden Show.

Dive Brief:

Casey’s General Stores is partnering with electric vehicle charging company Ionna to build chargers at 8 of its c-stores this year, the companies announced this week.

Casey’s will debut Ionna’s 400-kilowatt Regargeries, which are accessible by all EVs using Combined Charging System or North American Charging Standard. Casey’s joins Wawa and Sheetz as c-store retailers using Ionna’s technology.

The rollout, which will occur across six states, continues the measured growth in Casey’s EV charging network, which has made its way to over half of the retailer’s areas of operation.

Dive Insight:

Casey’s Ioanna Rechargery rollout will start at two stores in both Illinois and Missouri, as well as one site in Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas, according to the announcement. The company has already broken ground on all eight sites.

“This partnership with Casey’s is key to expanding our presence in America’s heartland — a region that embodies the spirit and tenor of IONNA’s brand,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna. “With a shared respect and commitment to delivering quality customer experience, we are pleased to add Casey’s to our growing network of partners.”

Despite being the third-largest c-store retailer in the U.S., Casey’s has taken its EV expansion fairly slowly. The retailer has only brought chargers to about 42 sites since getting into alternative energy in 2018 through a partnership with Electric America.

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure.
""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters.
""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.
The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress.","The Solar for All program, launched on Earth Day in 2024, was set to bring cleaner, more affordable energy to nearly a million low-income and disadvantaged households. But its promise was cut short when the $7 billion grant initiative was canceled following the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill. Now, close to two dozen states are suing the Trump administration, according to Reuters.

As of October 16, Democratic attorneys general from more than 20 states and Washington, D.C, have filed two lawsuits in response to the program closure. This comes after Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced the termination of Solar for All in August, shortly after the funds were briefly unfrozen.

The initiative had been funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the previous administration, and it was intended to enable the installation of solar panels in communities across the country. But the project was designed to support more than just the clean energy transition away from polluting energy sources — its aims also included more resilient power grids, increased U.S. energy independence, a boost for local economies, and lower household electricity costs.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his state will lose about $250 million in federal funds, according to Reuters, while Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her state's loss of $156 million would cause energy bills for more than 11,000 Arizona families to go up by 20 percent. Mayes also noted that marginalized communities in Northern Arizona, such as the Hopi Tribe, have lost a $25 million award to bring electricity and battery storage to hundreds of homes — some of which have never been connected to the grid.

""The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,"" Bonta said in a call cited by Reuters. ""In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.""

According to a 2024 news release issued under the previous administration, the Solar for All grants were designed to improve equitable access to solar energy in order to advance environmental justice and save more than 900,000 American households $350 million annually. In fact, with tens of thousands of U.S. residents lacking safe and consistent access to electricity at home, the program was set to improve equitable access in general.

Job creation was envisioned as another benefit of Solar for All. Following its termination, the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions advocating for green jobs, released a statement saying the move is an attack on working families. ""This decision will raise energy prices and slow the growth of the solar energy we need to fill demand, which is at an all-time high,"" said executive director Jason Walsh.

The AGs' lawsuits are seeking both monetary damages and reinstatement of the program. The plaintiffs are challenging that the administration violated federal law by rescinding ""congressionally obligated funds"" — funds already approved by Congress. A group of unions, nonprofits, and homeowners has also separately sued the administration for the program termination.

While a legal battle over vast sums may ensue, some states, cities, and homeowners have already been taking matters into their own hands. Some residents have been able to leverage more local funding and make at-home panel installation happen. Others are signing up for community solar programs to save money and reduce their environmental footprints.

Communities are coming together in other ways too. For example, in Maine — which happens to be one of the states involved in the lawsuits — the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy has been hosting monthly ""energy cafés"" so locals can get together to learn about home solar and other cleaner, more affordable energy options.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zqc2Sc9iBeGKIAm6N8Qt9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/3df31305152b7de4a5f1f641ebdd26e0,N,,2025-10-24 13:07:27.114598

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, stood apart from the three other candidates — all Democrats — at the California Economic Summit by challenging whether the spate of devastating wildfires in California is linked to climate change, and labeling some environmental activists “terrorists.”

After a few audience members shouted at Bianco over his “terrorists” comment, the Democratic candidates seized on the moment to reaffirm their own beliefs about the warming planet.

“The impacts of climate change are proven and undeniable,” said Tony Thurmond, a Democrat and California superintendent of public instruction. “You can call them what you want. That’s our new normal.”

The fires “do have a relationship with climate change,” said former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.

Besides environmental issues, the hour-and-a-half forum at the business-centric California Forward’s Economic Summit focused primarily on “checkbook” topics as the candidates, which also included former state Controller Betty Yee, offered gloomy statistics about poverty and homelessness in California.

Given the forum’s location in the Central Valley, the agricultural industry and rural issues were front and center.

Bianco harped on the state and the Democratic leaders for California’s handling of water management and gasoline prices. At one point, he told the audience that he felt like he was in the “Twilight Zone” after the Democrats on stage pitched ways to raise revenue.

Other candidates in California‘s 2026 governor’s race, including former Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and former Rep. Katie Porter, were not present at Thursday’s debate. Former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon planned to come, but his flight from Los Angeles was delayed, audience members were told.

All are vying to lead a state facing ongoing budget deficits caused by overspending. A state Legislative Analyst’s Office report released this month cited projected annual operating deficits ranging from roughly $15 billion to $25 billion through 2029. At the same time, federal cutbacks by the Trump administration to programs for needy Californians, including the state’s Medi-Cal healthcare program, will put more pressure on the state’s resources.

All of the candidates had different pitches during the afternoon event. Asked by moderator Jeanne Kuang, a CalMatters reporter, about ways to help rural communities, Thurmond cited his plan to build housing on surplus property owned by schools. He also repeatedly talked about extending tax credits or other subsidies to groups, including day-care providers.

Yee, discussing the wildfires, spoke on hardening homes and creating an industry around fire-proofing the state. Yee received applause when she questioned why there wasn’t more discussion about education in the governor’s race.

Villaraigosa cited his work finding federal funds to build rail and subway lines across Los Angeles and suggested that he would focus on growing the state’s power grid and transportation infrastructure.

Both the former mayor and Yee at points sided with Bianco when they complained about the “over-regulation” by the state, including restrictions on developers, builders and small businesses.

Few voters are probably paying much attention to the contest, with the battle over Proposition 50 dominating headlines and campaign spending.

Voters on Nov. 4 will decide whether to support the proposition, which is a Democratic-led effort to gerrymander California’s congressional districts to try and blunt President Trump’s attempt to rig districts in GOP-led states to retain control of the House of Representatives.

“Frankly, nobody’s focused on the governor’s race right now,” Yee said at an event last week.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/793d9d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x840+0+380/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2F64%2F496112ca46c49b9629288d285b0d%2Fbianco-thurmond-villaraigosa-yee.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 10:03:12.702171

The investment is the largest in Stellantis's American history and appears to be a strategic response, given challenging market conditions, including tariffs that have impacted competitors.

The financial commitment is to be spread across the next four years, with a focus on expanding Stellantis's manufacturing footprint and launching new vehicles.

Stellantis is targeting a 50% increase in yearly vehicle production and the creation of over 5,000 jobs across Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Antonio Filosa, Chief Executive Officer at Stellantis, says the investment supports a customer-first approach and ensures Stellantis strengthens its position in a key global market.

""This investment in the US – the single largest in Stellantis's history – will boost our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" Antonio explains.

""Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the US – it makes us stronger everywhere.""

The multi-billion-dollar injection is set to fund five new vehicle launches, the development of a new four-cylinder engine and ongoing powertrain updates.

According to Stellantis, 19 refreshed vehicle models are on track for introduction across its US assembly network through to 2029.

Michigan's role in EV and ICE production

Stellantis has outlined two commitments in Michigan. The Warren Truck Assembly Plant is set to be retooled to produce a new range-extended EV alongside an internal combustion engine (ICE) large SUV. This dual drivetrain approach aligns with Stellantis's stated strategy to provide customers with a choice of products during the transition to electrification.

This programme is scheduled to begin in 2028 and will receive a US$100m investment, creating more than 900 new jobs at the plant that currently builds the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

Additionally, Stellantis has confirmed a US$130m investment to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson for the production of the next-generation Dodge Durango.

This vehicle is planned for a 2029 launch and continues Stellantis's stated goal from 1 January 2025 to keep investing in legacy models while introducing newer alternatives.

Powertrain and legacy model investment

In Indiana, Stellantis' focus is on powertrain technology. Stellantis plans to produce the GMET4 EVO, a new four-cylinder engine, across several Kokomo facilities.

These upgrades total more than US$100m and will add over 100 manufacturing jobs.

This move could ensure the US becomes the main production hub for a core power unit central to the engine roadmap for Stellantis, which could be important for future hybrid models.

In the same week that graced us with the news that about five million Brits would enjoy dynamic electricity prices depending on sunshine and wind, Centrica, the owner of British Gas, added one more cause for celebration in the hothouse for insanity that the British Isles have become, by saying it was launching a net-zero academy to train thousands and thousands of engineers for the transition because there was such hunger for clean energy jobs.

All this sounds like it would be a good idea to declare a one-week national holiday for the populace to rejoice in the progress towards a greener, cleaner future. Alas, some silly House of Commons committee went and ruined it with a report warning that clean energy jobs were failing to offset job losses in the Scottish oil and gas industry so maybe, just maybe, the powers that be could slow down the murder of said industry. Side note, assume there are quote marks around clean energy. I just can’t be bothered to click on the quote marks button so often.

We’ve discussed the topic of a real-life case study in energy transition more than once here and I believe we all agree that the UK is an excellent candidate. Germany is one, too, but there is a language barrier there, alas, so I’m focusing my research interests on the UK.

So, first things first. E.on has announced it would now track its customers’ smart meters every 30 minutes and adjust their rates based on the balance between demand and supply of electricity, which in turn would depend on the output of wind and solar installations. I don’t know about you, but my heart rate surged at the mere thought of having my electricity rate spike like the ECG of a chronic arrhythmiac every time a cloud passes over while I’m trying to bake bread or do the laundry. That’s the sort of excitement I don’t think many of us need in their lives yet five million will be getting just that. Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger and all that.

The brains behind that idea are promoting it as “giving people more control over the way they manage their bills and providing opportunities for them to save money” so “we can enable the UK to make the best use of the vast amounts of electricity we’re generating.” This comes from a wind lobbyist and it would’ve been adorable if it wasn’t so utterly disgusting.

While people learn to do laundry at night, Centrica is hard at work securing the professionals who would be fitting their new smart meters, solar panels, and heat pumps. They’re calling them engineers and while I’m the last one to argue that engineering is a mentality rather than a job, I would like to point out that mentality still needs a few years at a higher education institution to fully blossom so, no, these would not be engineers.

The people who Centrica wants to be training at its academy, would be technicians. I see nothing wrong with the word. A technician is a respectable thing to be — unless what we have is a roundabout way of saying the future workforce of the UK energy system does not need higher education in engineering. It’s enough to learn how to install a heat pump. But also, “The academy will have a full size “eco house” to demonstrate how all of the skills and capabilities of Centrica’s workforce come together to deliver the home of the future.” With the help of half a dozen labs because labs make the whole thing sound so much more serious.

So, about those clean jobs that Centrica would be adding — they are likely to create a surplus of engineers, meaning technicians, because demand is falling short of expectations, at least according to the Scottish Affairs Committee at the common, as it were, chamber of the UK parliament.

Here’s what the committee had to say about it: “We are concerned that the scale-up of clean energy projects is taking longer than expected and is progressing slower than the decline of the oil and gas industry. We found that clean energy jobs are not being created at the pace or the scale required to match the job losses arising from the decline of the North Sea oil and gas industry.”

Funny, that. Brits were promised many millions of clean jobs or, if not millions, then at least 400,000 by 2030. From their very own mouths: “Clean energy will bring 400,000 extra jobs by 2030, with high demand for roles including plumbers, electricians and welders.” Oh, you’re laughing at the classification of welders and plumbers as clean job professionals, are you? If plumbers are not in the clean job business, I dare you to tell me who is.

It gets even better: “Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders,” per the assortment of cells that the UK has for an energy secretary. It seems there’s a major shortage of plumbers and welders in the UK.

I really don’t know what the Scottish Affairs Committee is so worried about. I mean, jobs are being created at breakneck speed and they’re fetching much higher salaries as well — up to 23% higher for an entry-level position compared with other sectors. That must be because clean energy is so much cheaper than dirty energy.

Just as I was enjoying the vision of a green, clean, cheap UK, along came the BBC and wrote this, “In a new report, the Tony Blair Institute says if the transition to renewable energy “continues in a way that raises costs, weakens reliability and weakens growth, it will fail both practically and politically”.” Oh. I guess this concludes this week’s visit to the looney bin.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gGHT!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd80f1f35-f96a-47cb-a68d-cb73c280d4cc_1024x768.jpeg",N,,2025-10-24 12:03:56.310716

This section of highway can now charge electric cars as they drive.","A new type of highway in the United States is changing the way in which people see electric cars. In the state of Michigan, a part of the highway has been created that can charge electric vehicles while they are on the road — without stopping at a charging station.

For years, one of the main issues about electric cars has been the lack of charging stations and the fear of drivers running out of battery on the road. However, with this new highway this issue could disappear in the future. So, let’s see how this highway works.

Challenges of electric cars

Electric cars are a great alternative to gasoline or diesel cars because they emit way less CO₂ and are better for the environment. But they are not as popular as traditional cars yet. The main reasons for this are:

The cost of buying an electric car is still higher than a regular car.

Charging stations are not available everywhere, especially outside big cities.

Range anxiety, or the fear of running out of battery before reaching a charger, keeps many people from switching to electric.

For people who don’t have a charger at home, finding a charging station can become a complicated task and when they do they tend to be full of cars. So, all of this makes electric cars seem less practical than gasoline ones. However, a new smart highway could change everything.

The company behind this highway

The company Electreon is responsible for this huge advance. While other known brands like Tesla focus on manufacturing electric cars, Electron is working on improving the infrastructure those cars need to work better.

Electron is expert at wireless charging for electric vehicles, so cars equipped with Electreon’s system can charge automatically when they’re on a special road. The company offers 3 types of charging:

Dynamic charging, which happens while the vehicle is moving.

Semi-dynamic charging, which occurs when a car is stopped temporarily, for example at a red light.

Stationary charging, when a vehicle is parked.

Charging while driving

Electreon has already installed wireless charging coils under a section of road on 14th Street in Detroit, Michigan. This section of highway can now charge electric cars as they drive. It works with induction technology, where energy is transferred wirelessly from coils under the pavement to receivers installed in the cars. Drivers don’t have to plug in or stop to recharge — the car gets power simply by moving along the road.

New collaborations

After the success of this first charging highway, Electron has partnered with the company Xos, Inc., which manufactures commercial electric vehicles. Together, both companies are including wireless charging technology in these vehicles, which means a great change for transport companies that could:

Lower the total cost of ownership for companies.

Reduce the number of vehicles needed in each fleet.

Improve efficiency with underground charging systems that save time and space.

Michigan

With this project, Michigan proves that it’s one of the most innovative states in sustainable transport. It’s investing in clean technology that can transform roads and reduce pollution. This milestone is not only about luxury passenger cars — it also helps delivery vehicles, which make up a large percentage of the traffic on American roads.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/michigan-highway-charge-station-electric-cars.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 09:03:46.731079

The Project is scheduled for completion in 2027, contingent upon the timely completion of funding and offtake agreements. Upon the Company achieving a secured feed from its sources in Brazil and Chile, the Project will become the first HREE separation plant in the U.S. with an integrated HREE feed from two ionic clay deposits in friendly jurisdictions, which deposits are expected to be in operation by in mid-2028. Designed as a comprehensive solution for rare earths, the Project is expected to produce high-purity Dysprosium, Terbium, and other restricted HREEs and light rare earths, essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, and robotics. Provided the achievement of full production, Aclara anticipates being able to supply more than 75% of the U.S. requirements of DyTb for electric vehicles by 2028. Annual production upon the successful development of the Company’s ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile is anticipated to be 200 tpy, 30 tpy and 1,400 tpy of separated high-purity oxides, representing approximately 14% of China’s official DyTb production. The State of Louisiana is supporting the Project with an estimated $46.4M in tax incentives and grants. Aclara will invest approximately $277M to develop the Project on an 82-acre Louisiana Economic Development certified site at the Port of Vinton. The site offers direct road and waterway access via the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and proximity to chlor-alkali facilities, with the LED Certified designation allowing for immediate industrial development and fast-track construction. The Company is also planning an additional investment to construct a metals and alloys plant on the property, to support the high-performance permanent magnet industry. The separation technology being developed by Aclara is designed with scalability in mind, allowing potential capacity expansion to process material from other ionic clay deposits or compatible feedstocks in the future. Hatch has been retained to develop the engineering of the Project in addition to its work relating to the Company’s Carina project located in the State of Goias, Brazil, ensuring strong coordination across projects, driving cost efficiencies, and optimizing schedules, with an aim to reduce execution risk. Aclara is collaborating with Virginia Tech to validate its proprietary separation process through a pilot plant whose construction is currently underway and expected to be fully operational by Q1 2026. By the time production is expected to start at the Louisiana plant, Aclara expects to have accumulated approximately 1.5 years of feed-specific operational data that will serve to accelerate the ramp-up, optimize efficiency and maintain steady-state operations. Once secured feed is achieved, the Project will become the only HREE separation facility in the United States that is integrated with ionic-clay deposits from friendly jurisdictions, ensuring the reliable production of significant quantities of HREEs. Aclara’s simultaneous optimization of mining and separation processes provides a competitive advantage among ionic clay developers and accelerates project execution. Significant progress has been achieved at the Company’s Goiania pilot plant to enhance the purity of the mixed rare earth carbonate that will supply the Louisiana separation facility upon successful production from the Carina Project. The Carina Pre-Feasibility Study, prepared by Hatch, is scheduled for publication in early November 2025, with the Feasibility Study expected in Q2 2026.

Holding a PhD in geography and geoinformatics, Marcel has made significant contributions to solar energy through science and peer-reviewed research.","However, as the solar sector evolves in response to real-time market demands, volatile pricing and increasingly complex grid requirements, this once-reliable metric is no longer sufficient on its own. A new paradigm is emerging – one that prioritises quality over theoretical maximum output, and focuses on the optimal performance of the PV power plant, the timely delivery of energy and long-term operational resilience.

PV performance becomes the new standard – encompassing not just how much energy a plant can produce, but when, how reliably and how profitably it can do so.

The limitations of energy yield as a standalone metric

While annual energy yield remains a technically meaningful parameter, its relevance in business modelling and real-world operations is limited. Historically, developers could assume that all energy generated would be sold at a predictable price, regardless of when it was delivered. Under those conditions, maximising total annual production was a logical goal. This is no longer the case.

In today’s competitive energy market, the value of electricity is highly volatile. Energy generated during periods of low demand or high offer may reach negligible prices – or may not be accepted at all. Worse, energy delivered outside of contractual delivery windows in power purchase agreements (PPAs) can lead to financial penalties. In short, a high theoretical yield does not guarantee commercial success.

Modern PPAs and grid codes increasingly require alignment between forecasted and actual production, often down to hourly or sub-hourly intervals. PV asset owners and operators are now directly responsible for forecasting accuracy and delivery performance, particularly during peak demand windows or critical grid events. Deviations from forecast can lead to financial penalties, dispatch curtailment or additional balancing charges.

As a result, performance – defined as the ability of a PV power plant to consistently deliver energy at the right time, under real-world conditions and in line with market or contractual expectations – has emerged as a more actionable and financially relevant metric. This shift has significant implications for PV system design, monitoring and forecasting.

Accurate forecasting is central to succeeding in performance-based markets. In many regions, deviations from intraday and day-ahead forecasts can lead to financial penalties or curtailment. For that reason, developers and investors face greater pressure to design projects that are predictable, resilient and where performance simulations and financial models match the new reality.

Designing for optimal PV performance

To optimise for real-time performance, PV systems must be designed not just for maximum annual output, but for temporal alignment, weather resilience and long-term system health.

Temporal alignment

Optimal PV performance begins with aligning the system’s output with realtime demand. Rather than peaking at noon, when wholesale electricity prices are typically the lowest, a well-designed plant maximises production during periods when demand and prices spike. This shift is increasingly important in markets with time-of-use tariffs, dynamic pricing or capacity-based incentives.

One of the most effective ways to meet the temporal demand is by integrating battery energy storage systems (BESS). While PV generation is inherently tied to solar availability during the day, BESS enables time-shifting of energy delivery to match it with higher-value periods, such as early evening hours. This flexibility not only enhances profitability in markets with variable pricing but also supports grid stability and improves the overall dispatchability of solar energy.

When properly sized and integrated into the system design, BESS can transform a PV power plant from a passive generator into a responsive energy asset.

BESS integration also requires adjustments in the system design and modelling, including dispatch strategies and energy forecasts. Accurate simulation of charge/discharge cycles is essential for optimal sizing of inverters and system availability. Degradation modelling becomes more complex as cycling patterns impact both battery life and long-term system output.

Additionally, revenue stacking – combining energy arbitrage with services, such as frequency regulation, capacity payments or grid balancing – further underscores the need for high-resolution data. Without it, the economic modelling of hybrid PV+BESS systems remains incomplete and potentially misleading.

Resilience to critical events

Many PV system designs still rely on the use of TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) datasets, which only provide ‘typical’ or ‘average’ weather conditions, obscuring the risk of extreme weather events, such as sudden temperature changes or strong winds. Figure 1 shows the difference in actual wind speed versus wind speed as recorded as TMY.

This may lead to inverter overloads, overvoltage, shutdowns or even damage. For example, if events of very low air temperature are not accounted for in the design, overvoltage can occur – causing system faults or hardware damage. Such technical failures can undermine a project’s performance and jeopardise the PV power plant’s financial viability.

Designing for resilience also means anticipating non-meteorological stress factors that are amplified during critical events, such as grid-induced voltage spikes, mechanical strain from thermal cycling or increased soiling after sandstorms or wildfires. These risks can be mitigated through better inverter protection settings, thermally tolerant cable routing, reinforced mounting systems and adaptive cleaning schedules.

Just as engineers design bridges for 100-year floods, PV systems must be specified for rare but plausible operational extremes – not just average conditions. In the context of long-term performance guarantees and insurance coverage, the return on resilience-focused design is substantial.

System health and longevity

Integral to PV performance is long-term asset health. There are a large number of solar power plants that under-deliver against expectations. Poor design choices can cause thermal or electrical stress, accelerating the degradation of modules and inverters. When solar power plants underperform due to preventable wear and tear, it signals a misalignment between design assumptions and realworld conditions.

Investors are increasingly focused on this alignment. A project with a strong theoretical yield is no longer enough – financial stakeholders now demand more robust modelling of PV performance. That means more than just P50 and P90 yearly energy production estimates. Figure 2 demonstrates some of the factors affecting energy loss that can be reported on at PV projects.

In today’s high-stakes environment, where electricity markets are volatile, and operational risks are more visible, the emphasis has shifted from theoretical output to real-world resilience. Lenders and insurers want to see simulations that take into account variability, extremes and uncertainty. Investors expect to see credible simulations based on realistic meteorological data and risk mitigation strategies.

This trend also reflects the growing importance of performance stability over time. Investors understand that a solar project with a high theoretical yield may still underperform financially if its output is misaligned with market pricing, or if it is vulnerable to curtailments, voltage issues or environmental stressors.

What can PV developers do to ensure optimal PV design?

PV developers must move beyond outdated, empirical models and low-resolution datasets. This includes using advanced PV simulation software that works with highresolution time series data instead of the hourly TMY datasets.

High-resolution 15-minute time series data capture temporal variability and enable more accurate modelling of real-world operating conditions. It can better capture site-specific conditions and model the system behaviour more accurately, resulting in PV designs that reflect actual operating conditions and support modern business models. Figure 3 includes a graph showing soiling losses at a project site.

Another critical layer is software built on advanced physical modelling. Technologies, such as ray tracing and the Perez all-weather model, enable more accurate calculation of shading in complex terrain or densely packed layouts. Unlike the simplified view factor model, ray tracing simulates the exact path of sunlight through a 3D environment, making it possible to accurately model PV output for bifacial PV systems and uneven surfaces.

Factors such as soiling and snow losses also have a significant impact on PV performance, particularly in dry, dusty, or high-latitude environments.

Software solutions must be capable of simulating soiling losses dynamically, based on site-specific, high resolution time series data, PV model configuration and local weather conditions such as wind and precipitation. Realistic modelling of soiling losses helps developers schedule cleaning and maintenance more effectively.

Ultimately, these improvements result in a more accurate PV output estimation, reducing the gap between projected and actual performance. For bankability assessments, that accuracy is essential.

Performance as a strategic advantage

The goal is to build PV systems that are healthy, reliable and profitable. In today’s market, a high performing solar asset is one that delivers energy when it’s most valuable, withstands operational stress and is long-term efficient. Designing for that reality is no longer optional; it’s the new standard.

As energy markets grow more dynamic and expectations rise, stakeholders across the value chain, from developers to financiers to grid operators, will increasingly demand performance-oriented metrics. Those who embrace this shift early will be best positioned to thrive in the next generation of solar energy projects.

Being able to predict and consistently deliver energy, not just in quantity, but at the right time and under the right conditions, is becoming a core differentiator for PV projects. Advanced forecasting and PV evaluation lead to better decisions and healthy PV assets that are ready for active collaboration with electricity markets.

The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.
In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.
Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness.
Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico.","According to the latest analysis from E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs) and the Clean Economy Tracker, the US clean energy sector saw another blow this September, with companies calling off or downsizing large-scale projects worth nearly $1.6 billion. The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.

The private-sector cancellations have impacted battery, storage, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These losses are in addition to the US Department of Energy's recent withdrawal of $8 billion in funding for over 200 public-sector projects nationwide.

In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.

Many of the cancellations came from automakers adjusting their EV production plans. For instance, General Motors scaled back 2 EV production lines in Tennessee and Kansas, impacting roughly 1,600 workers. Meanwhile, sodium-ion battery startup Natron Energy announced that it would cease operations altogether – closing a $40 million plant in Michigan that had 150 workers, and shelving plans for a $1.4 billion facility in North Carolina that would have employed around 1,000 people.

Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness. For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for US workers to lead in the industries of the future. While other nations are racing ahead to capture the clean energy economy, these cancellations leave American communities falling further behind.”

However, amid the pullback, new investments worth $542 million were announced in September. These include EV and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and grid infrastructure projects designed to support the energy demands of expanding AI data centers. Collectively, these ventures are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs.

Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico. Together, companies have pledged roughly $135 billion in new investments and committed to hiring 125,000 permanent workers.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-10-24%2F180ylphs%2FUS-clean-energy-suffers-setback.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-24 13:07:19.415219

Estimated value: US$2.5 million About Aclara Aclara Resources Inc. (TSX:ARA), a Toronto Stock Exchange listed company, is focused on building a vertically integrated supply chain for rare earths alloys used in permanent magnets.","Aclara Resources Inc. (""Aclara"" or ""Company"") (TSX:ARA) is pleased to announce its decision to construct the first heavy rare earths (HREE) separation facility in the United States, located in the State of Louisiana (the ""Project"") with an expected secured sustainable feed from two ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile.

Key Project Highlights

The Project is scheduled for completion in 2027, contingent upon the timely completion of funding and offtake agreements.

Upon the Company achieving a secured feed from its sources in Brazil and Chile, the Project will become the first HREE separation plant in the U.S. with an integrated HREE feed from two ionic clay deposits in friendly jurisdictions, which deposits are expected to be in operation by in mid-2028.

Designed as a comprehensive solution for rare earths, the Project is expected to produce high-purity Dysprosium (Dy), Terbium (Tb), and other restricted HREEs and light rare earths (LREEs), essential for advanced technologies such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, drones, and robotics.

Provided the achievement of full production, Aclara anticipates being able to supply more than 75% of the U.S. requirements of DyTb for electric vehicles by 2028.

Annual production upon the successful development of the Company's ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile is anticipated to be 200 tpy (Dy), 30 tpy (Tb) and 1,400 tpy (NdPr) of separated high-purity oxides, representing approximately 14% of China's official DyTb production.[1]

The State of Louisiana is supporting the Project with an estimated US$46.4 million in tax incentives and grants.

This initiative marks a major milestone in Aclara's mine-to-magnet strategy, establishing a vertically integrated supply chain for permanent magnets, starting from our two ionic clay deposits in Brazil and Chile, moving into our HREE separation facility in Louisiana and supplying alloys to our strategic alliance with magnet-maker VAC (VACUUMSCHMELZE), who are currently building a permanent magnet production facility in Sumter, SC.

Project Development

Aclara will invest approximately US$277 million to develop the Project on an 82-acre Louisiana Economic Development (LED) certified site at the Port of Vinton.

The site offers direct road and waterway access via the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and proximity to chlor-alkali facilities, with the LED Certified designation allowing for immediate industrial development and fast-track construction.

The Company is also planning an additional investment to construct a metals and alloys plant on the property, to support the high-performance permanent magnet industry.

The separation technology being developed by Aclara is designed with scalability in mind, allowing potential capacity expansion to process material from other ionic clay deposits or compatible feedstocks in the future.

Hatch Ltd. (""Hatch"") has been retained to develop the engineering of the Project in addition to its work relating to the Company's Carina project located in the State of Goiás, Brazil (the ""Carina Project""), ensuring strong coordination across projects, driving cost efficiencies, and optimizing schedules, with an aim to reduce execution risk.

Virginia Tech Partnership for Technology Validation

Aclara is collaborating with Virginia Tech (""VT"") to validate its proprietary separation process through a pilot plant whose construction is currently underway and expected to be fully operational by Q1 2026.

By the time production is expected to start at the Louisiana plant, Aclara expects to have accumulated approximately 1.5 years of feed-specific operational data that will serve to accelerate the ramp-up, optimize efficiency and maintain steady-state operations.

Integration with Aclara's Ionic Clay Deposits

Once secured feed is achieved, the Project will become the only HREE separation facility in the United States that is integrated with ionic-clay deposits from friendly jurisdictions, ensuring the reliable production of significant quantities of HREEs.

Aclara's simultaneous optimization of mining and separation processes provides a competitive advantage among ionic clay developers and accelerates project execution.

Significant progress has been achieved at the Company's Goiania pilot plant to enhance the purity of the mixed rare earth carbonate that will supply the Louisiana separation facility upon successful production from the Carina Project.

The Carina Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS), prepared by Hatch, is scheduled for publication in early November 2025, with the Feasibility Study (FS) expected in Q2 2026.

Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry, commented:

""By choosing Louisiana for its first U.S. facility, Aclara is recognizing what we already know, our state is leading the next generation of energy and technology innovation. We're excited to welcome the Aclara team to Louisiana, and we look forward to the jobs, growth and opportunity this project will deliver for our people, our communities - and for a Louisiana economy that's ready to power and lead our nation's future.""

Panelists said they must move forward on their goals even if the federal government won't.

""At this moment in Boston, we don't have the luxury to ignore the science, to ignore the reality on the ground,"" Boston Chief Climate Officer Brian Swett said at The Westin Boston Seaport District hotel Tuesday morning.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration canceled more than $7.5B in Biden-era grants to support hundreds of clean energy projects, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Massachusetts had been slated for approximately $466M in grants for more than two dozen projects across the state.

The climate goals in Greater Boston are among the most ambitious across the country. Boston is requiring all buildings to hit net-zero emissions by 2050. Cambridge requires nonresidential buildings of 100K SF or more to reduce emissions by 2026 and be net-zero by 2035.

Swett said that climate action has been led, historically, at the city and state levels. That changed when the Biden administration began funding thousands of climate-related projects across the country, he said.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included many tax incentives for sustainable development of green buildings. In 2023, the Biden administration also awarded up to $7B to several communities in an attempt to jump-start hydrogen power usage.

""The Biden administration obviously flipped the switch,"" Swett said. ""It was almost overwhelming at times.""

Swett said the city’s climate agenda needs to move forward amid the political headwinds. Even as these federal grants are being pulled, Swett said he is determined to keep projects on track and prepare for when national priorities swing back in their favor.

""We will continue to operate locally with state partners,"" Swett said. ""When the pendulum flips back eventually, we'll be ready to take advantage of federal resources.""

Julie Wormser, chief climate officer for the city of Cambridge, said policy windows open and close all the time. It is on state and city officials to be proactive and work through an unfavorable administration's policies to get the work done, she said.

City governments have several avenues to pursue to streamline climate change projects. These include creating regulatory markets and government procurement for climate technologies and streamlining the siting process for energy projects, Wormser said.

""Whether we can fully move forward on them or not, we can be just as busy now,"" Wormser said. ""What will stop us more than the federal government is a loss of hope and momentum, because there's still plenty to do.""

As cities push forward, developers are hoping future planning and action can be more streamlined across the board.

Massachusetts cities have various goals for sustainability initiatives, making it confusing for owners that operate in multiple places, Davis Cos. Senior Vice President of Construction Gretchen McGill said.

The Davis Cos. operates in Cambridge, Boston and Watertown. Each city either has or has proposed different sustainability guidelines and goals.

Watertown city officials proposed their own set of regulations to reach net-zero emissions, but the town hit pause on the ordinance after objections from the business community.

""As we go forward, it would be really helpful if we could have a consolidated state consensus on how we're going to do this,"" McGill said. ""There are some big-picture things that we would really like some clarity on.”

The state only requires owners to report energy use data for buildings of 20K SF or more, starting this year. The requirement only covers roughly 30,000 buildings statewide.

Although the state doesn't yet have set guidelines for owners to reduce emissions, that could change. Mandates and potential emission limits could soon be implemented statewide, AHA Consulting Engineers Director of Energy and Sustainability Katie Raymond said.

""When we have our conversations with our owners, who are not necessarily just from Boston and Cambridge but also statewide, we're … thinking about what's coming in the very near future,"" Raymond said.",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=jpeg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2025%2F01%2F679a79da978cc-2023-0323-boston_university_center_of_computing_and_data_science.jpeg&width=1200&sign=F5MQBTwtcbWL6YCHViiaJPHJjnV7wQXNdj5ZJXjk0wQ,N,,2025-10-24 11:04:09.718756

The announcement does not confirm whether all of the locations mentioned are planned to have five Hyperchargers and thus ten charging points.
By the end of this year, there should be over 1,000 charging points – meaning there are still 100 charging points to go to reach this goal.","The foundation stone for the Ionna charging parks, known as ‘Rechargery’, has already been laid at eight Casey’s locations in six states. They are scheduled to open in 2025. ‘Starting this year, drivers will be able to charge their electric vehicles at fast, reliable 400 kW charging points while enjoying the comfort, convenience and community that make Casey’s a trusted destination,’ according to Ionna’s announcement. The partnership is then to be expanded further, but no specific number of locations or charging points has been mentioned.

The first eight locations are Little Rock in Arkansas, Vernon Hills and McHenry (both in Illinois), Terre Haute in Indiana, Parkville and Kearney in Missouri, Blackwell in Oklahoma and Waco in Texas. A rendering of one such location shows five covered charging stations, each with two charging points. At least in the rendering, these are Alpitronic’s Hyperchargers, probably the HYC400 with a charging capacity of up to 400 kW. The announcement does not confirm whether all of the locations mentioned are planned to have five Hyperchargers and thus ten charging points.

Instead, Ionna provides an assessment of the current pace of expansion. With the eight locations at Casey’s, the Ionna network comprises more than 900 charging stations in operation or under construction, “representing an increase of over 100 per cent in three months.” The number of locations under contract has also increased by 20 per cent since July – Ionna has entered into further location partnerships with Wawa and the restaurant and convenience store chain Sheetz, for example.

Ionna opened its first location in Apex, North Carolina, in February 2025. By the end of this year, there should be over 1,000 charging points – meaning there are still 100 charging points to go to reach this goal. According to earlier statements, the Ionna fast-charging network is expected to grow to over 30,000 fast-charging points by 2030 – a target that is reiterated in the current announcement. Despite the current changing situation in the US market, Ionna has not yet revised this target.

“This partnership with Casey’s is key to expanding our presence in America’s heartland — a region that embodies the spirit and tenor of IONNA’s brand,” said Ionna CEO Seth Cutler. “With a shared respect and commitment to delivering quality customer experience, we are pleased to add Casey’s to our growing network of partners.”",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/10/ionna-caseys-ladestationen-hpc-usa-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 08:17:43.006010

The Scottish Affairs Committee has demanded urgent action after warning that the creation of clean energy jobs is being outstripped by the pace of oil and gas job losses.
It highlighted that 5,000 jobs a year are currently being lost across the UK North Sea workforce, and said that without intervention, the decline of the industry will accelerate.
The report also calls for a more pragmatic approach to North Sea licensing, urging the UK Government to clarify how developers can undertake additional drilling activity under existing exploration licences.
It concludes: “Without reform, the current tax regime will accelerate the decline of the North Sea oil and gas industry and its supply chain.","A new approach to North Sea licensing and reforms of the windfall tax on oil and gas profits are needed to tackle mass job losses in the industry, according to a Labour-led Westminster committee.

The Scottish Affairs Committee has demanded urgent action after warning that the creation of clean energy jobs is being outstripped by the pace of oil and gas job losses.

It highlighted that 5,000 jobs a year are currently being lost across the UK North Sea workforce, and said that without intervention, the decline of the industry will accelerate.

MPs on the cross-party committee argued there are “compelling arguments” for maintaining higher levels of domestic production to reduce reliance on imports and keep skilled supply chain jobs in Scotland.

The report also calls for a more pragmatic approach to North Sea licensing, urging the UK Government to clarify how developers can undertake additional drilling activity under existing exploration licences.

Ahead of next month’s Budget, the committee warns that the downturn in the industry will deepen unless there is urgent reform of the Energy Profits Levy, which it says has created uncertainty and risked driving investment overseas.

It concludes: “Without reform, the current tax regime will accelerate the decline of the North Sea oil and gas industry and its supply chain. Reforms to the temporary tax, initially introduced in 2022, should be implemented as soon as possible to create certainty for the industry.”

Committee chair Patricia Ferguson MP said: “Today's report outlines our concerns that jobs from the clean energy industry are simply not being created fast enough, or on the scale needed, to match the mounting job losses from the oil and gas sector.

“It’s vital that the government moves quickly to plug this employment gap, replace jobs being lost and ensure a smooth energy transition for workers and communities. Until this is tackled, the government should avoid making decisions that would further accelerate oil and gas production’s decline.”

The report also cites the closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery as a failure of transition planning, concluding that both the UK and Scottish Governments “should have acted sooner to prepare for resulting job losses.”

Russell Borthwick, Chief Executive of AGCC, who gave evidence to the committee, said: “This report is a much-needed dose of reality and validates what industry and communities in the North-east have been saying for years.

“The UK Government now faces a clear choice - it can manage our substantial remaining North Sea reserves in a way that protects jobs, skills and energy security, or it can let this national asset collapse faster than the industries that are meant to replace it. One is a transition, the other is a cliff edge.

“Cutting domestic production only increases reliance on imported LNG with four times the carbon footprint. The government must therefore act now to remove the Energy Profits Levy and back a managed transition that keeps investment, tax revenue and talent here in the UK.”",https://agcc.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/shutterstock_2409620571-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 10:19:34.867959

The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.
In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.
Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness.
Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico.","According to the latest analysis from E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs) and the Clean Economy Tracker, the US clean energy sector saw another blow this September, with companies calling off or downsizing large-scale projects worth nearly $1.6 billion. The total cost of the projects cancelled in the private sector in 2025 amounted to $24 billion, as per the report.

The private-sector cancellations have impacted battery, storage, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These losses are in addition to the US Department of Energy's recent withdrawal of $8 billion in funding for over 200 public-sector projects nationwide.

In total, about 3,000 workers lost their jobs due to cancellations and scale-backs in September, bringing the total number of job losses tied to abandoned clean energy projects this year to 21,000.

Many of the cancellations came from automakers adjusting their EV production plans. For instance, General Motors scaled back 2 EV production lines in Tennessee and Kansas, impacting roughly 1,600 workers. Meanwhile, sodium-ion battery startup Natron Energy announced that it would cease operations altogether – closing a $40 million plant in Michigan that had 150 workers, and shelving plans for a $1.4 billion facility in North Carolina that would have employed around 1,000 people.

Speaking about the scenario, E2 Communications Director Michael Timberlake said, “The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy - it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness. For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for US workers to lead in the industries of the future. While other nations are racing ahead to capture the clean energy economy, these cancellations leave American communities falling further behind.”

However, amid the pullback, new investments worth $542 million were announced in September. These include EV and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and grid infrastructure projects designed to support the energy demands of expanding AI data centers. Collectively, these ventures are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs.

Overall, E2 has tracked 415 major clean energy projects launched since the tax credits took effect, spanning 42 states and Puerto Rico.

Amazon’s initiative to power its data centers with small modular nuclear reactors marks a significant milestone in the intersection of technology and energy.","In a move that underscores the growing importance of sustainable and reliable energy sources, Amazon is embarking on a groundbreaking project to power its data centers with small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). The initiative, situated near Richland, Washington, is a direct response to a recent service outage that disrupted operations for millions of users. By investing in nuclear technology, Amazon aims to ensure uninterrupted power for its Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cornerstone of its business contributing over $123 billion in annual revenue. This project reflects a broader trend among tech giants to secure bespoke power solutions that meet increasing energy demands while minimizing environmental impact.

Amazon’s Strategic Shift to Nuclear Energy

The decision to adopt nuclear power is not merely about averting outages. It represents a strategic pivot towards sustainable energy solutions. Amazon’s AWS has grown to become a critical infrastructure component for over 1,000 companies worldwide. Thus, the reliability of power supply is paramount. By opting for nuclear energy, Amazon is not only addressing immediate power stability needs but also contributing to long-term sustainability goals. Nuclear power, known for being a zero-emission energy source, aligns with the company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.

This initiative is part of a larger movement among tech companies to embrace nuclear energy. As data centers become increasingly vital, the demand for stable and clean energy sources is surging. Companies are investing in Generation IV reactor technology, which promises enhanced safety and efficiency. This trend is indicative of a shift in how corporations view their energy responsibilities, balancing operational needs with environmental stewardship.

“They Just Changed the Game”: China’s New Reactor Promises Endless Clean Power (and it could upend global energy dominance)

The Revolutionary Xe-100 SMR

At the heart of Amazon’s nuclear initiative is the Xe-100 Small Modular Reactor (SMR) developed by X-Energy. This High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR) employs TRISO-X fuel, consisting of uranium particles encased in durable carbon and ceramics. This innovative fuel design enhances safety and efficiency, offering a self-regulating nuclear reaction.

The Xe-100 generates 80 MWe of power, a modest output compared to traditional reactors. However, its compact design allows for scalability and ease of production. These reactors can be manufactured in factories and transported to sites, significantly reducing construction costs and time. Furthermore, their small land footprint and simplified engineering requirements make them an attractive option for companies seeking sustainable power solutions.

“They’re Burying a Reactor a Mile Deep”: This Startup’s Underground Nuclear Plan Could Redefine Clean Energy Forever (and It’s Funded by the U.S.)

Scaling Up: The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility

The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility, slated to begin construction by the decade’s end, exemplifies the scalability of SMRs. Initially, it will host four reactors with a combined output of 320 MWe, with plans to expand to twelve reactors producing 960 MWe. This flexibility allows Amazon to adjust power capacity in response to evolving demands.

The project represents a significant investment in the future of energy and technology. Amazon’s ambition to introduce 5 GW of nuclear power to the U.S. by 2039 highlights the potential of SMRs to transform the energy landscape. This capacity could power approximately 3.8 million homes, underscoring the impact of such initiatives on national energy infrastructure.

“This project isn’t just about new technology; it’s about creating a reliable source of carbon-free energy that will support our growing digital world,” said Kara Hurst, Amazon’s chief sustainability officer.

Implications for the Energy and Tech Sectors

Amazon’s nuclear venture carries profound implications for both the energy and technology sectors. As global energy demands rise, the need for innovative solutions becomes increasingly urgent. SMRs offer a promising avenue, combining low emissions with reliability and scalability.

Moreover, the integration of nuclear technology into corporate strategy signifies a paradigm shift in how companies approach energy consumption. By investing in nuclear power, Amazon and its peers are setting a precedent for others to follow. This could spur further advancements in reactor technology, driving down costs and facilitating wider adoption.

The success of such projects will likely influence policy and regulatory landscapes, as governments and industries collaborate to harness the benefits of nuclear energy. The potential for SMRs to supply vast amounts of clean energy positions them as a key player in future energy strategies.

Amazon’s initiative to power its data centers with small modular nuclear reactors marks a significant milestone in the intersection of technology and energy. As companies seek sustainable solutions to meet growing demands, the role of nuclear power in corporate strategies is set to expand.

The automaker reports better-than-expected quarterly earnings, dials down tariff impact

Part of the F-150's appeal is its versatility, which makes it attractive to both business and retail buyers.

Ford Motor Co. unveiled late Thursday a plan to catch up on production of its most iconic vehicle and cleared a high bar with investors, sending the carmaker's stock more than 4% higher in the after-hours session.

Ford (F) is adding extra workers and taking other measures to meet ""strong"" customer demand for its F-Series pickup trucks, while making up for production losses stemming from a fire at an aluminum supplier's plant.

The goal is to increase production of its F-Series vehicles, including gasoline and hybrid models, by more than 50,000 trucks next year, Ford said.

Assembly of the F-150's electric version, the Lightning, will remain paused, however. Ford executives declined to give a timeline for an eventual production restart for the electric vehicle, but said it would be relatively easy to resume assembly.

The carmaker said it was giving priority to gas and hybrid F-Series trucks because they are more profitable and use less aluminum. Hourly employees at Ford's EV plant in the Detroit area will join a third crew at its Dearborn truck plant next door, the company said.

Ford's stock rose 3% in premarket trading Friday, which puts it on track to open at a 15-month high.

The fire last month at a Novelis Inc. plant in Oswego, N.Y., destroyed a key part of the facility. The Atlanta-based aluminum supplier has said it was sourcing materials from other plants and ""industry peers"" to help mitigate the gap in supply, which Ford confirmed on Thursday. Production at the plant is expected to resume by the end of the year, faster than expected.

The F-150 has been America's best-selling vehicle for decades running, and Ford has sold more than 400,000 of them this year. The carmaker said Thursday that the vehicle remains on track for a 49th straight year at the top.

Part of its appeal is its versatility: Businesses buy it for their commercial fleets, and it also attracts retail buyers, even if they are just hauling loads from retailers like Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) or Home Depot Inc. (HD). The F-150 routinely outsells the next-most popular vehicles, the Chevy Silverado (GM) and the Toyota RAV (TM), by 100,000 vehicles every year.

Ford also tweaked its guidance for 2025 adjusted profit to between $6 billion and $6.5 billion, in part due to the supplier fire and the tariff headwinds the company has had to absorb. Ford said that if not for the fire, it would have raised its guidance.

The company in July guided for 2025 adjusted profit between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion. Ford said that the Novelis fire is expected to cause a headwind of $1 billion or less this year and next.

Ford called for a net tariff impact of $1 billion for the year, down from a July estimate of $2 billion.

The carmaker earned an adjusted 45 cents a share in the third quarter on revenue of $50.5 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted profit of 35 cents a share on revenue of $47.1 billion.

""We are heading into 2026 as a stronger and more agile company,"" Chief Executive Jim Farley said in a statement. ""We will continue to focus on execution and on quickly making the right strategic calls on propulsion, partnerships and technology that will create tremendous value for our customers.""

The company's EV business, which it calls Ford Model E, posted an adjusted loss of $1.4 billion, wider than the $1.2 billion loss in the year-ago quarter.

The core business of traditionally powered vehicles, Ford Blue, reported a $1.5 billion profit, slightly less than the year-ago results, while Ford Pro, the part of the company geared toward commercial ventures, posted a $2 billion adjusted profit, up from $1.8 billion a year ago.

Ford's stock has rallied 24.7% in 2025 through Thursday, while shares of rival General Motors Co. have gained 25.5% and the S&P 500 index SPX has advanced 14.6%.

Stevenson, Timothy Cama, Benjamin Storrow",,,,,https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-offshore-drilling-plan-faces-fierce-opposition-in-congress/,"Lawmakers are girding for a fight against President Donald Trump’s apparent plans to open up the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines to offshore drilling.
The Atlantic coast currently has no offshore oil and gas, while the Pacific has greatly scaled back its production in part due to state and federal laws to phase out or ban new offshore drilling.
“Congresswoman Mace continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina to protect our coastline, economy, and way of life.” Wind and drilling … together?
“I support offshore drilling, but I also support offshore wind, and I think we should have both of them off the shores of North Carolina,” Tillis said.
Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), was less committal when asked about the prospect of offshore drilling in North Carolina.","Lawmakers are girding for a fight against President Donald Trump’s apparent plans to open up the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines to offshore drilling.

In interviews Thursday, Democrats called the idea “not lawful,” a “huge mistake” and “absolutely ridiculous.” Coastal Republicans, for their part, said they would also oppose any offshore drilling, though at least one East Coast Republican was open to the idea — albeit with a caveat.

Trump faced bipartisan opposition when he attempted a similar move in 2020, during his first term. He eventually backed down following widespread outcry amid his reelection effort.

It’s unclear this time around whether lawmakers, especially coastal Republicans, will be able to stop him as intraparty opposition has largely evaporated in his second term. Moreover, any new drilling effort is likely to be met with multiple lawsuits.

Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said on Thursday he was opposed to new drilling off the coast of his state. Trump’s plan, which POLITICO reported is expected to offer acres off the southern coast of California and “at least a small sliver” of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, is likely to be wildly unpopular in Florida. The plans have not yet been finalized.

“I haven’t supported drilling in the eastern Gulf of America,” Scott said, using Trump’s preferred name. “It’s important to Florida.” The Houston Chronicle, which first reported on the plans, said that Florida would continue to enjoy a drilling ban.

Coastal Republicans in the past have mounted stiff opposition to drilling off their coastlines, especially in states like Florida and South Carolina, where tourism is a major draw. Opposition only grew after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, which spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf.

The Atlantic coast currently has no offshore oil and gas, while the Pacific has greatly scaled back its production in part due to state and federal laws to phase out or ban new offshore drilling.

Trump, in his last term, banned new drilling off the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida until 2032 following pressure from allies in those states and to shore up his own environmental standing as he faced off with future President Joe Biden. He could reverse those plans now.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), a Trump ally who is running for governor, said that the moratorium still stands and that she continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina.

“President Trump put protections in place to prevent offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast, and those remain in effect through 2032,” Mace’s communications director, Sydney Long, said in a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News. “Congresswoman Mace continues to oppose offshore drilling in South Carolina to protect our coastline, economy, and way of life.”

Wind and drilling … together?

At least one Republican senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has broken with the Trump administration on multiple issues and is retiring at the end of this term, said he supports drilling off of North Carolina’s coast.

“When I was speaker [of the North Carolina House], I wanted to explore the possibilities of extraction off the coast, off the sightlines of the coast, particularly for natural gas,” Tillis said. “Outside of the sightlines, you can’t see them from an 11-story building, which is the tallest building in Wilmington.”

Tillis’ support, however, came with a twist: He also wants to see offshore wind off the shore of North Carolina, which Trump hates.

“I support offshore drilling, but I also support offshore wind, and I think we should have both of them off the shores of North Carolina,” Tillis said.

Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), was less committal when asked about the prospect of offshore drilling in North Carolina. He did not support or disavow the plan outright.

“I want to see their plans before I comment, I know the broad strokes but I don’t see the details,” Budd said. “I support energy, I’ll tell you that.”

Every Democrat interviewed Thursday, however, eviscerated the proposal.

“It’s going to be unacceptable for not just Democratic-run states, but for everybody. We don’t need to be moving in that direction,” said Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J). “I can guarantee you there’ll be bipartisan pushback in New Jersey on that, as there was last time this came up a couple years ago.”

Kim pointed to the administration’s actions to halt or slow renewable energy projects up and down the Atlantic.

“The fact that they are literally trying to take offline other energy projects that we had moving, including ones along the Atlantic coast … this would be absolutely ridiculous to move in that direction,” he said.

Fellow Atlantic Sen. Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat, also said opposition is bound to mount for plans to drill off the coast. A major offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia supported by both parties is nearing completion.

“We kind of litigated this in Virginia, not technically in the courts, but there was such huge pushback from Virginia Beach and the communities, especially in terms of the challenge it would bring to the tourism industry,” Warner said. “In a regular world, I couldn’t believe they’d even be suggesting this, but let me see what comes to pass.”

Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he has never supported drilling off the coast. Maine is famed for its fisheries, especially lobsters. King has also been a major proponent of offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine.

“I’ve been against it from the very beginning,” King said of offshore oil drilling. “The risk is far greater than the benefit.”

‘We’ll do everything we can’

On the Pacific coast, too, where no elected Republicans serve, there was intense pushback.

Sen. Alex Padilla of California, a Democrat, suggested that the move to open up more drilling in the state could be a jab at Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become a top Democratic foil to Trump and is widely considered to be eyeing the White House in 2028.

“That may be the poke of the day,” Padilla said. “Not surprised, but not lawful.”

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), fresh off a nearly 24-hour speech on the Senate floor, also weighed in on potential drilling on the West Coast.

“We in Oregon are hugely opposed to any sort of drilling. We have the most productive fisheries, the most incredible coastline,” Merkley said. “This is nothing but a threat to our stakeholders in the fishing and crabbing world. And it would be a huge mistake to do any drilling off the Oregon coast.”

Merkley’s counterpart, former Environment and Natural Resources Chair and current Finance ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), was more terse: “We’ll do everything we can to block them,” he vowed.

“WTO law is still binding law.
“Various aspects of the NZIA Act are likely in tension with the EU obligations under WTO law,” he said.
He also argued that justifying protectionist green industrialization policies using the supply security argument may put at risk the energy transition.
“But with restrictive measures, there is a risk that the speed and scale of the energy transition may be negatively affected.","From pv magazine Global

Once a feared international entity regulating global commerce, the World Trade Organization (WTO) seems to be heading towards its sunset, in a geopolitical scenario that is contributing to the increase in various forms of protectionism in all world economies.

“The WTO is clearly in crisis,” energy and environmental law expert Anatole Boute told pv magazine. “The WTO Appellate Body, which is the organization’s main dispute settlement authority, is paralyzed and no longer functioning. First of all, this results from the blocking of appointment of judges since 2019 by the United States during the Trump and Biden administrations.”

The impasse has effectively crippled the system because the remaining judges’ terms were expiring and no new judges could be appointed to replace them.

This implies that, technically speaking, no appeals can be heard, which effectively undermines the WTO dispute settlement system. “Decisions by the panel can be appealed, but they are appealed into the void,” Boute explained. “But this paralyzes the entire dispute resolution process because an appeal means that the dispute cannot be solved and the decision cannot be enforced.”

The law professor also pointed to deficiencies in the regulation of cleantech disputes before the WTO due to the multi-year timeframe of its proceedings. “The WTO is not a perfect system,” he went on to say. “However, it is still being used. New disputes are being initiated. Contracting parties are still making use of its dispute settlement body, although they know that its decisions are likely not going to be enforced.”

Although these processes today do not lead to an enforceable decision, they still have great value, according to Boute. “WTO law is still binding law. The enforcement of international law in general is always a delicate issue, but that doesn’t mean that states don’t have legal obligations. And I think it’s useful to understand what these obligations are because they’re there for a reason. WTO decisions help understand the parties’ obligations under the WTO agreements, including in relation to trade in cleantech equipment and products.”

Europe has always been one of the most strenuous supporters of the WTO in an effort to ensure fair competition and strong trade ties with China, where most of the renewable energy technologies are manufactured, but this seems to have changed recently, as several European countries introduced incentives for domestic or EU-based manufacturing, not to mention the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA), which is intended to help Europe produce at least 40% of its annual deployment needs for strategic technologies, including PV modules, batteries, and heat pumps.

“Despite these protectionist efforts, the European Union still cares about the WTO. It still tries to frame the policies as being WTO-compliant,” Boute said. “For instance, when the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) was defined, the EU emphasized the fact that it’s WTO-compliant.”

In the paper “Clean energy supply security and the international trade regime: A WTO law analysis of the EU Net-Zero Industry Act,” which was recently published in Energy Strategy Reviews, Boute argues that, although the WTO is in a deep crisis, its fundamental principles could still provide European nations with effective ways to implement the energy transition at the lowest possible costs and with the best technologies.

“Various aspects of the NZIA Act are likely in tension with the EU obligations under WTO law,” he said. In particular, the use of resilience criteria and diversification requirements in renewable energy auctions is likely to be incompatible with the WTO non-discrimination standards and difficult to justify under the existing exceptions.

“Of course, a potential claim would likely not result in an enforceable decision given the paralysis of the system. But in this paper, I was not investigating whether the WTO is still functioning. What I’m arguing is that designing clean energy security strategies in a WTO-compatible way would help minimize cost increases and delays of the energy transition. I think it doesn’t help the EU and certainly not the EU energy transition to ignore these obligations,” Boute stated.

He also argued that justifying protectionist green industrialization policies using the supply security argument may put at risk the energy transition. “If we look at the energy transition scenarios outlined by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the low-international cooperation case is the most pessimistic, with net zero achieved 40 years later than in a high cooperation case,” he stressed.

“The problem with the NZIA Act is that it’s trying to do many things at the same time, including achieving supply security, competitiveness, decarbonization, and geopolitical objectives that are difficult to reconcile with each other and with the non-discrimination principles governing the international trade regime,” he went on to say. “But with restrictive measures, there is a risk that the speed and scale of the energy transition may be negatively affected. What’s missing in my view in the NZIA Act is a detailed analysis of supply security risks for specific technologies.”

The creation of jobs is, according to Boute, another crucial factor in shaping the future of the European clean energy transition. “And from a jobs perspective, it makes sense not only to focus on cleantech manufacturing, but also on the opportunities created in the deployment of these technologies,” he emphasized. The latter jobs can be put at risk if trade restrictive measures delay the transition.

What steps will other nations take to follow suit, and how might these developments shape the future of data centers worldwide?","China has made a groundbreaking stride in sustainable technology with the completion of the world’s first wind-powered underwater data center. Located off the coast of the Lin-gang Special Area near Shanghai, this innovative project represents a $226 million investment in high-performance computing infrastructure. This facility is set to change how data centers operate by leveraging offshore wind power and natural seabed cooling. By doing so, it aims to significantly cut energy consumption and eliminate the need for fresh water, which is a critical resource in traditional data centers.

The Environmental Impact of Cooling

Data centers are notorious for their high energy consumption, particularly due to the cooling processes required to maintain optimal temperatures for servers. Traditional centers can use up to five million gallons of water daily for cooling purposes. This is equivalent to the daily water use of a small town. However, the Lin-gang Special Area facility is expected to challenge this paradigm by employing seawater for cooling.

By using the ocean as a natural cooling system, the facility aims to reduce its cooling energy consumption to less than 10% of total power use. This is a significant reduction compared to the 40-50% typically seen in other centers. The project is designed to achieve a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) rating of no higher than 1.15. This is well below China’s national guideline, which mandates a PUE of no higher than 1.25 by 2025 for new or retrofitted centers.

Beyond Data Storage: A Multifunctional Hub

The Lin-gang Special Area data center is designed to be more than just a data storage facility. It is poised to support a diverse range of digital-economy applications. From powering artificial intelligence workloads to providing computing infrastructure for 5G networks and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), the center is a versatile addition to the region’s technological landscape.

Moreover, the center’s role extends to e-commerce and international data flows, making it a crucial part of the region’s digital backbone. This multifunctional capability underscores the facility’s potential to serve as a high-performance underwater computing cluster, marrying technological advancement with environmental sustainability.

Scaling Up: Future Prospects

The current phase of the underwater data center is a 2.3-MW demonstration facility. Plans for Phase 2 aim to scale this up to a 24 MW capacity, although no timeline for this expansion has been set. The facility’s successful integration of renewable energy and subsea cooling on a commercial scale marks a significant milestone in the evolution of data centers.

However, the transition from this demonstration phase to full-scale operations involves challenges. Engineers are closely monitoring potential maintenance costs, corrosion issues, and the impact on the marine environment. These factors will be critical in determining the long-term viability and scalability of such projects.

Challenges and Considerations

While the Lin-gang Special Area facility is a pioneering project, it is not without its challenges. As stated by Wang Shifeng, chairman of China Communications Construction Company’s Third Harbor Engineering, “Construction of UDCs is still in its initial stage.” The transition to large-scale applications will require advancements in technology and cost optimization.

The Shanghai municipal government has ambitious plans to scale up its intelligent computing cloud industry, aiming for a computing capacity of 200 EFLOPS by 2027. This underscores the need for continued innovation and improvement in underwater data center technology. The road ahead involves addressing technological maturity and refining cost structures to make these centers more feasible on a larger scale.

As China forges ahead with this innovative approach to data management, the world watches closely. The Lin-gang Special Area facility stands as a testament to the potential of combining renewable energy with cutting-edge technology. What steps will other nations take to follow suit, and how might these developments shape the future of data centers worldwide?

It is the first of a series of plans expected to set out how the government and employers will invest in training for “British workers” to bring down immigration and grow priority sectors.

Civil service “experts” have been tasked with producing jobs plans for each of the government’s priority sectors, setting out what “actions” will be taken to meet forecast demand for jobs.

A range of new and existing actions on skills are in the 81-page ‘clean energy jobs plan: creating a new generation of good jobs to deliver energy security’, published by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) earlier this week.

The plan forecasts that across the UK, jobs in the ‘clean energy’ sector will grow from around 440,000 in 2023 to 860,000 by 2030. This includes 31 priority occupations such as those in skilled construction, metal and electronic trades, as well as higher qualified engineers and machine operatives.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

“Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.”

But any business investment?

While the clean energy jobs plan refers to large industrial investments that are expected to generate tens of thousands of new jobs, it contains limited details of new skills investments by businesses.

This is despite citing evidence of “significant underinvestment” in skills by employers in recent years and pledges in the new post-16 education and skills white paper to help businesses “invest further” in skills pipelines.

Addressing this, the plan says it aims to set “clear expectations” and create the “certainty” that industry needs to invest in skills.

Millions for more engineers

Announced in the industrial strategy this summer, the government has earmarked £182 million across the next four years to address engineering skills needs.

This includes £47 million to fund “engineering skills for adults”, £2 million to increase the number of engineering T Levels offered and £8 million in capital funding for clean energy engineering courses at levels 4 and 5.

Some of this funding will also go towards five new clean energy technical excellence colleges (TECs), with delivery expected to begin from April next year.

However, details of exactly how much funding is available for the new TECs are yet to be confirmed.

Build on what we’ve got

The UK and Scottish governments have also announced up to £20 million in funding to help North Sea oil and gas workers transition to “new roles”. This will extend a £1 million scheme, launched this year, until 2028-29.

Regional skills pilots in Cheshire West and Chester and North and North-East Lincolnshire will receive up to £2.5 million for “innovative” schemes to support workers “moving into clean energy”.

An existing energy skills passport scheme run by industry bodies RenewableUK and Offshore Energies UK will also be expanded to help workers in more roles move from “carbon-intensive industries” to clean energy sectors.

Veterans and prison leavers

A 12-month pilot led by Mission Renewable will connect veterans and service leavers with clean energy careers in the east of England, which the government hopes to learn from to “strengthen veteran pathways” across the UK.

The government also plans to prototype “innovative training and job-matching approaches” for non-violent offenders in regions with “critical energy sector vacancies”.

Keep coordinating

DESNZ has established a minister-led “steering group” to support joined-up implementation across the UK, “regular discussions” with trade union general secretaries, and “wider stakeholder engagement” on “specific themes”.

Both industry and government bodies such as the Careers and Enterprise Company have also committed to promoting clean energy careers, including through a UK-wide “awareness and attraction campaign” and engagement with young people.

Between DOGE, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and a federal shutdown, state and local budgets are in upheaval.
The average person walking down the street knows that their government in Washington, D.C., is a locus of dysfunction and corruption.
If you think that’s simply common sense, you’d be surprised at how many states fail to do it.","In 1998, Louisiana’s legislature added a sovereignty clause to the state’s constitution that promises its citizens “the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free and sovereign state.” The constitutions of New Hampshire and Montana, among others, have long contained the same phrasing. Mississippi’s constitution similarly asserts that “the people of this state have the inherent, sole, and exclusive right to regulate the internal government and police thereof.” Rhode Island’s constitution boasts a localist variant, confirming “to the people of every city and town in this state the right of self-government in all local matters.”

Such claims of autonomy notwithstanding, each of these states depends on federal agencies for over 40 percent of its annual revenue. Louisiana, so freshly drawn to the sovereignty clause, leads the pack at a whopping 52 percent dependency on federal funds. According to the latest Census Bureau data, Louisiana, along with 22 other states, is more reliant on federal dollars now than during the height of COVID-19 lockdowns.

There’s little space in other state capitols for gloating: The federal share of the average state’s revenue has doubled since 1990 and stands now at 37 percent. Given that those dollars come with strings and strictures, many of which have less to do with prudent program administration than with the ideological agendas of federal officials, it’s hard to believe that any citizenry substantially dependent on federal money maintains the “exclusive right of governing themselves as a free and sovereign state.”

We need look no further than the administration of public schools to see the threat federal funding poses to democratic self-governance. The federal government provides less than 14 percent of total spending on primary and secondary public education, yet thousands of school districts complied with Biden-era federal guidance on everything from transgender bathrooms to race-based school discipline practices. Some did so because they are run by administrators who share the ideology of Biden’s policymakers. But many complied — as they will with the directives of current and future administrations — for fear of losing funds, altering the school environments for hundreds of thousands of children. All this without a single vote by Congress or state legislatures, and with neither the consent nor even awareness of most parents.

They say he who pays the piper calls the tune, but federal agencies call the tune even when they barely cover the gratuity. “Self-government in all local matters”? It might be time for a revision, Rhode Island.

Between DOGE, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and a federal shutdown, state and local budgets are in upheaval. The looming expenses for state participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program alone will run into the hundreds of millions for many states — driven in part by rising error rates caused by federal policies that have made it harder to confirm participants' eligibility.

And the thing is, the lawmakers and governors who allowed their states to drift into this peril knew exactly what kind of beast they were dealing with. The average person walking down the street knows that their government in Washington, D.C., is a locus of dysfunction and corruption. Our state leaders know federal funds are subject to interruption and reversal, that they entail fiat directives that run counter to the interests of average citizens, that they drive up long-term state costs by stoking state payrolls and shackling state programs with strictures that discourage measurement, efficiency and innovation.

Our elected state leaders know all these things, and yet they’ve made our communities more vulnerable than ever to D.C.’s pathologies. In many states they did so even as they cut taxes, fashioning themselves as small-government conservatives. Thankfully there are some bright lights: Tennessee had begun to practice legislative scrutiny of federal grant proposals, and Utah, Nebraska and Ohio now require state agencies to prepare contingency plans in the event of federal funding interruption. If you think that’s simply common sense, you’d be surprised at how many states fail to do it.

Some lawmakers and governors are working to safeguard their communities from federal chaos, but too many have looked the other way while services that should be fully under the authority of communities, from firefighter training to domestic violence shelters, became vulnerable to the D.C. whipsaw. They looked the other way, and now the people who elected them face the consequences. I wonder, will our state leaders face some political consequences as well? Perhaps it’s time they did.

A state subsidy of $22 million will spur nearly $353 million in overall investment, Shapiro’s office says.
The expansion will involve leasing a 432,000-square-foot facility in Marshall Township, where future production lines will augment its existing operations in Turtle Creek.
“We continue now to write the next chapter in Pennsylvania’s story of energy leadership,” said Shapiro at an afternoon press conference announcing the deal.
The state’s investment includes $3 million already pledged to EOS, and the company may be eligible for other tax credits in the future.","Eos Energy Enterprises, a maker of energy storage systems with production facilities in Turtle Creek, will expand operations and relocate its headquarters from New Jersey to Nova Place on Pittsburgh’s North Side, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Tuesday.

The move, which is set to take place in the latter part of 2026, is expected to create 735 jobs and retain 265 others. A state subsidy of $22 million will spur nearly $353 million in overall investment, Shapiro’s office says. The expansion will involve leasing a 432,000-square-foot facility in Marshall Township, where future production lines will augment its existing operations in Turtle Creek.

“We continue now to write the next chapter in Pennsylvania’s story of energy leadership,” said Shapiro at an afternoon press conference announcing the deal. “Eos … is massively expanding their manufacturing footprint here in Allegheny County and relocating their official headquarters from Jersey right here to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.”

Shapiro said that he’d learned about Eos shortly after taking office, and that and his team had been working for more than two years on the deal. “We knew immediately that this technology would be a game-changer,” he said.

“If you look at energy and innovation landscape in our commonwealth, you’ll see that there is a ton of excitement and a whole lot of forward momentum, especially right here in southwestern Pennsylvania.”

Eos makes zinc-based batteries for industrial and other large-scale uses, and at a time when American energy policy is hotly contested, its Turtle Creek operations have been a success story everyone wants to be part of. Eos was among a number of area manufacturers to benefit from President Joe Biden’s clean-energy investments, and politicians ranging from progressive Democratic Rep. Summer Lee to Republican U.S. Senator Dave McCormick have championed its presence. It boasts a unionized work force — employees are members of the United Steelworkers — and relies almost entirely on American-made components and materials.

Zinc-based batteries also are less reliant on lithium, access to which has become a flashpoint in tensions between the United States and China.

Shapiro’s office said the move would allow the company to work with Carnegie Mellon University and other local schools to train workers proficient in robotics and other advancing technologies. Joe Mastrangelo, Eos’ chief executive officer, said that along with the skilled local workforce, “the ecosystem of universities” was a key resource to draw on for skilled workers and technological expertise.

”When you put those things together, it became almost a no-brainer [about] where we should be,” he said.

Mastrangelo said the new facility in Warrendale would be more efficiently configured than the company’s current, which as it has grown has taken up space in two different buildings and on multiple floors.

“The new building allows raw materials in one side and finished product out the other side,” he said. Asked whether the company would remain in the Turtle Creek location, he said, “for the time being.”

Mastrangelo said the relocation of its headquarters from Edison, NJ, would take place within the next few months, and that production in the new facility would get underway in the latter part of next year.

“With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing,” said Rick Siger, who heads the state Department of Community and Economic Development, in a statement.

The state’s investment includes $3 million already pledged to EOS, and the company may be eligible for other tax credits in the future. Allegheny County also contributed $2 million to the incentive packages.

Innamorato, who was also on hand for Tuesday’s announcement, hailed the news as “a major milestone in the region’s clean energy future and “a symbol of what’s possible when we align innovation and sustainability”

“Every single day, our water treatment plant behind me works around the clock to deliver safe, reliable water.
Caprella estimated the savings from the solar array to total $10 million over its lifetime, with around $200,000 in savings coming in its first year of operation.","LIMA — On a chilly Thursday morning, a flock of Canada geese landed on Twin Lakes Reservoir off Reservoir Road in Lima, conserving their energy during their southward migration.

By this time next year, a 3,444-panel solar array will be floating on the southern half of the reservoir with the goal of producing enough energy to power the nearby water treatment plant.

The array, designed by Florida-based D3Energy LLC, is expected to generate up to 2 megawatts of energy, enough to power the water treatment plant, according to Lima Utilities Director Mike Caprella. The array will cover roughly half the surface area of the reservoir, held in place by 100 anchors.

“The floating solar project is a major step forward in our ongoing commitment to provide affordable, high-quality water, not just for the residents of the city but for businesses in Lima and outside of Lima, as well,” he said during a construction kickoff ceremony Thursday at the reservoir. “Every single day, our water treatment plant behind me works around the clock to deliver safe, reliable water. Throughout this project, we are going to turn our of our city’s largest energy consumers into a green-powered facility.”

The floating solar project is expected to be completed and come online in the first half of 2026.

Caprella estimated the savings from the solar array to total $10 million over its lifetime, with around $200,000 in savings coming in its first year of operation.

“That’s real money staying right here in our community that will protect both our taxpayers and our rate payers,” Lima Mayor Sharetta Smith said at the ceremony. “This project is the result of years of collaboration, partnership and shared vision.”

The city also received aid in construction costs thanks to $2.4 million in grant funds from the U.S. Department of Energy along with almost $900,000 in tax credits through the Inflation Reduction Act’s direct pay program, altogether covering about half the cost of the array.

D3Engergy managing director Stetson Tchividjian was also at the ceremony to celebrate the new project, touting its environmental and land use benefits, including reducing evaporation and algae growth in the reservoir and offsetting more than 2,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide every year. He said it’s the same impact as taking 500 vehicles off the road or planting 40,000 trees.

“If you were to put this on the ground, you would have needed close to 10 acres,” he said. “So when you start considering that you’re deploying large-scale solar across the state, you start using up a lot of agricultural land value and real estate.”",https://www.limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/135550415_web1_FloatingSolar.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 07:58:11.429250

The Ohio Power Siting Board, for its part, is expected to finalize its rules within the next couple of months.
Ultimately, said Cherry of MAREC Action, the law ​“clears the path for developers to bring energy projects online quickly and affordably, something Ohio’s consumers and businesses desperately need.”","This story was originally published by Canary Media.

A new law in Ohio will fast-track energy projects in places that are hard to argue with: former coal mines and brownfields.

But how much the legislation benefits clean energy will depend on the final rules for its implementation, which the state is working out now.

Ohio has more than 567,000 acres of mine lands and about 50,000 acres of brownfields that are potentially suitable for renewable-energy development, according to a 2024 report from The Nature Conservancy. Federal funding to clean up abandoned mine lands has continued so far under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, so yet more sites may become available. Overall, remediating documented hazards at Ohio’s abandoned mine lands is estimated to cost nearly $586 million, said spokesperson Karina Cheung at the state Department of Natural Resources.

The debate over HB 15 rules

Advocates and industry groups generally applaud the new law but want tweaks to the Power Siting Board’s proposed rules.

A big concern is making sure the board will allow wind and solar developments on mine lands and brownfields throughout Ohio, regardless of which county they’re in. Roughly one-third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both in all or a significant part of their jurisdiction. This authority was granted to them by a 2021 law, Senate Bill 52.

However, the language and legislative history of HB 15 make clear that it ​“was meant to be technology-neutral,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy.

HB 15 even states that its terms for permitting energy projects in priority investment areas apply ​“notwithstanding” some other parts of Ohio law.

“That clause is meant to bypass some of the typical Ohio Power Siting Board procedures — including the procedures for siting in restricted areas” under SB 52, wrote Bill Stanley, Ohio director for The Nature Conservancy, in comments filed with the board.

But the exemption provided by the ​“notwithstanding” clause is narrow, Mellino added, because local government authorities must ask for a priority investment area designation. That means, for example, that in a county with a solar and wind ban in place, officials would need to choose to request that a former coal mine or brownfield become a priority investment area.

The Nature Conservancy has asked the Power Siting Board to add language making it crystal-clear that renewable-energy projects can be built on any land marked a priority investment area — even if a solar and wind ban otherwise exists in a county.

Industry groups are pushing for additional clarifications to make sure the Power Siting Board meets the permitting deadlines set by the new law, both for expedited and standard projects.

For example, Open Road Renewables, which builds large-scale solar and battery storage, said in comments that, in order to align with HB 15, the board’s rules should require energy developers to notify the public of an application when it is filed, rather than after it is deemed complete.

Separate comments from the American Clean Power Association, MAREC Action, and the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio ask for tweaks to provisions regarding notices on public hearings and for clarifications on application fees. The board should also promptly issue certificates for projects that are automatically approved, say comments by Robert Brundrett, president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.

The Department of Development hopes to finish draft standards and invite public comments on them soon, Waldvogel said. Meanwhile, the department has received its first request to designate a priority investment area. The ask comes from Jefferson County’s board of commissioners, which did not specify the type of energy that may be built in the area.

That request deals with land where FirstEnergy’s former Sammis coal plant is undergoing demolition, as well as the Hollow Rock Landfill, which received waste from the site. HB 15 gives the department 90 days to act on designation requests.

The Ohio Power Siting Board, for its part, is expected to finalize its rules within the next couple of months.

When we measure electricity prices relative to how much people earn, we find that the recent rise in prices is pretty modest.
What’s more, this is the exact opposite of the direction that electricity costs ought to be going in.
Energy prices should be going down, not up.
The locations and prices were tracked and aggregated monthly by Grid Status, an energy data analytics platform.","You may have heard that the cost of electricity is increasing in America. It’s true! Even as inflation has moderated in general, electricity prices have surged:

It’s important to put this increase in context. When we measure electricity prices relative to how much people earn, we find that the recent rise in prices is pretty modest. In fact, so far it hasn’t even canceled out the big drop in electricity prices in the late 2010s:

But rising costs are rising costs, and it would be a bad idea to wait until things get really bad before we address the problem.

What’s more, this is the exact opposite of the direction that electricity costs ought to be going in. We’re in the middle of a miraculous revolution in energy technology. The cost of solar power and battery storage has absolutely plunged in recent years, to the point where developing countries like India are choosing renewables over coal simply because it’s cheaper to do so. Energy prices should be going down, not up. And in China prices are going down, in fact, despite an explosion in demand. Why is America different?

Everyone agrees that there are a bunch of factors at work. For example, here’s Wired:

There are several dynamics driving the current power price spike. Rising electricity demand, volatile fuel prices, inflation, tariffs, a slowdown in transmission line construction, and long delays in adding new generators to the power grid are all conspiring to create more expensive utility bills.

The Wall Street Journal also cites the increasing cost of rebuilding power infrastructure after natural disasters.

But one factor that lots of people cite is the AI boom. AI runs on computing power (or “compute”, as they say). You need compute to train models, and you also need compute to make AI “think” about the answers it’s giving. Scaling up this latter type — which is called “inference compute” — is now the most important way that AI companies are improving their models over time. And compute requires energy, because you’re running electricity through a bunch of chips in some data center somewhere. Every time you ask AI a question, it’s using some noticeable amount of electricity.

People go back and forth about how much the increased electricity demand from AI is already affecting electricity prices. A recent report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory argues that AI hasn’t affected electricity prices yet, pointing out that states that saw greater electricity demand growth actually had falling prices over the past few years:

But Bloomberg Technology disagrees. Their analysis looks at smaller geographic areas, and considers wholesale rather than retail prices, and argues that data centers are already having big local effects:

A Bloomberg News analysis of wholesale electricity prices for tens of thousands of locations across the country reveals the effects of the AI boom on the power market with unprecedented granularity. The locations and prices were tracked and aggregated monthly by Grid Status, an energy data analytics platform. Bloomberg analyzed this data in relation to data center locations, from DC Byte, and found that electricity now costs as much as 267% more for a single month than it did five years ago in areas located near significant data center activity.

As the country builds a lot more data centers, we can expect this effect to filter through to retail prices, and start squeezing American consumers.

And remember that AI scaling tends to be exponential, meaning that AI is forecast to use a lot more compute in the near future. Here’s the EIA’s projection:

So right now, the rise in electricity costs has actually been modest, as has the effect of AI on those costs. But if AI keeps scaling up, things are going to get very hairy in the next decade. And that’s not even counting the increased electricity usage from switching from internal combustion cars to EVs.

It therefore seems like scaling up electricity generation in the U.S. is an incredibly important and pressing task. We don’t want a future in which AI outcompetes humans for scarce electric power and forces them to live in the dark and cold. Nor do we want a future in which America sacrifices the most crucial high-tech industry simply because we’re unwilling to build power lines, solar panels, and batteries. What we need, now more than ever before, is energy abundance.

And yet despite a few promising initiatives, the policies of the Trump administration are not geared toward providing America with energy abundance. In many cases they’re actually going to prevent us from getting the energy we need. Trump’s whole approach to energy seems like a mess of conflicting values, ideas, and policy initiatives.

What is the HON rule?

Last year, environmental advocates hailed the new rule as a major step in improving air quality for minority and poor communities that often bear the brunt of industrial pollution.

The rule required over 200 chemical manufacturers around the country to update operational practices, implement fenceline monitoring and repair their facilities, among other mandates. It put a special focus on reducing emissions of ethylene oxide and chloroprene, two chemicals linked to cancer.

Well, the truth about Louisiana’s shrimping industry and its recent challenges can now be explained as a result of President Donald Trump’s tariffs taking effect.

Environmental activists have been eager to blame liquefied natural gas companies for a sharp drop in shrimp prices. But, despite the claims of activists, the drop in prices is not a result of declining quality or supply of Louisiana’s product, or even a lack of skilled workers — far from it. Rather, it was the direct result of foreign producers, including Asia, flooding the market with cheaply farmed shrimp, often raised under conditions that would not meet American environmental or health standards.

In 1980, the U.S. imported 250 million pounds of shrimp at an average price of $10 per pound. In 2022, the U.S. imported two billion pounds of shrimp and prices plummeted to just $4.30 per pound and kept dropping.

The false narrative promoted by out-of-state climate activists that the drop is due to the oil and gas industry in the Gulf is now being busted with the implementation of Trump’s robust tariffs on imported shrimp. Tariffs help level the playing field by ensuring that imported shrimp does not have an unfair advantage over domestically harvested seafood.

Shrimpers say so themselves, and have welcomed Trump's tariffs, including the recent 25% tariff on India — one of the main countries sending cheap, low-quality shrimp our way and driving down prices.

One shrimper told a local news outlet recently: “If they keep importing and importing, you’re steadily putting workers out of work here. And getting food from overseas, sooner or later, everything is going to be from overseas. And where does that leave the country?”

He’s right. Maintaining a viable domestic industry brings benefits that far outweigh pennies added at the checkout counter. Supporting local shrimpers means supporting local economies, preserving jobs and ensuring that the seafood on our tables is healthy, sustainable and traceable to responsible sources. Most importantly, it keeps alive the intricate web of culture, tradition and community that defines Louisiana.

The energy industry’s presence along the Gulf Coast has also been a source of partnership, mutual prosperity and stability for many of our fishing families. LNG facilities, for example, have become economic engines in Plaquemines, Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, creating thousands of jobs and supporting the consumer base for shrimpers and local businesses alike.

And with President Trump’s tariffs in place, while it will take time for the impact of the tariffs to be felt fully, we are already beginning to see signs of prices moving back in the right direction toward where they were before the market was flooded with imports.

I urge every reader to consider the true cost of what’s on their plate. Behind each pound of Louisiana shrimp is a story — of hard work, of family, of endurance through hurricanes and hardship. By supporting tariffs on imported shrimp and the growth and development of America’s energy industry, we ensure that these stories continue, that our coastal communities remain strong and that Louisiana’s legacy as America’s seafood heartland endures for generations to come.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/3a/93aa2776-8ce9-5eff-b1af-b153952815af/68d2fe98c12b2.image.jpg?crop=1793%2C941%2C0%2C106&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-24 06:58:18.915921

The agreement, announced Thursday, marks the first corporate pact of its kind in the U.S., aimed at powering Google’s expanding data centers in the Midwest. The plant, developed by Broadwing Energy on a site operated by Archer Daniels Midland Co. in Decatur, Illinois, is designed to generate over 400 megawatts while capturing and storing 90% of its carbon dioxide emissions underground.

This initiative comes as tech giants grapple with the surging power needs of AI training and operations, which have strained grids and complicated net-zero commitments. Google plans for the facility to begin commercial operations by early 2030, with the captured CO2 permanently stored in a deep saline formation. The deal underscores a shift toward hybrid energy solutions, blending fossil fuels with emissions-mitigating tech to meet immediate demands without fully abandoning renewables.

The Promise and Perils of Carbon Capture in Tech’s Energy Strategy

Skeptics, however, point to carbon capture’s checkered track record. Projects like Chevron Corp.’s Gorgon facility in Australia have underperformed, capturing far less CO2 than promised due to technical glitches and high costs. In the U.S., the Petra Nova plant in Texas, once hailed as a success, shut down in 2020 amid economic woes, raising doubts about scalability. Google acknowledges these hurdles but bets on advancements, partnering with ADM, which already operates carbon storage at the site from ethanol production.

According to reporting from The Verge, the technology’s history is fraught with overpromises, yet Google views it as a bridge to a cleaner future. The company has committed to 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, but AI’s exponential growth—projected to double data center energy use by 2026—has forced pragmatic compromises. This Illinois project could offset emissions equivalent to removing 100,000 cars from roads annually, per Google’s estimates.

Balancing AI Ambitions with Environmental Imperatives

Industry insiders see this as part of a broader trend among hyperscalers. Microsoft Corp. recently inked deals for nuclear power, while Amazon.com Inc. invests heavily in renewables, but all face criticism for leaning on offsets rather than direct cuts. Google’s approach integrates carbon capture directly into power generation, potentially setting a model for regions with limited clean energy access. The Midwest’s grid, reliant on coal and gas, makes this a strategic fit, allowing Google to inject low-carbon power without overwhelming existing infrastructure.

Financially, the deal involves Google providing upfront funding to de-risk the project, estimated at hundreds of millions, though exact terms remain undisclosed. Sources like Reuters note this could catalyze more corporate investments in carbon capture, bolstered by federal incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax credits up to $85 per ton of stored CO2.

Implications for Regulation and Innovation in Sustainable Power

Critics, including environmental groups, argue that backing gas plants, even with capture, prolongs fossil fuel dependence and diverts funds from true renewables like wind and solar. The Sierra Club has voiced concerns that such projects might greenwash emissions without addressing methane leaks from gas extraction. Google counters that the plant will reduce grid-wide emissions by displacing dirtier sources, aligning with its goal of net-zero by 2030.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-783a48f3-c732-4751-be5c-6f882d48ed26.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 07:58:15.825917

When the Senate passed CRA resolutions disapproving the EPA waivers, Democrats in Congress, environmental leaders, and others cried foul.
The current Congress has enacted 15 CRA resolutions into law during 2025, the most ever.
But 16 CRA resolutions were enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017, three during Biden’s term, and so far, 15 in Trump’s second.
CRA resolutions have overturned vastly unpopular Energy Department rules banning gas water heaters and restricting refrigerators and other appliances.","The Congressional Review Act (CRA) was part of a small business package signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996. It provided a tool Congress sometimes uses to overturn federal regulatory agency actions. It requires agencies to report any new rules to Congress and provides special procedures under which Congress can disapprove them. It applies to “major rules, non-major rules, and interim final rules” very broadly, even including agency actions that have not been subject to traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking, such as “guidance documents and policy memoranda.”

When agencies report to Congress that they have adopted any new rules, Congress has 60 days to disapprove the rules before they go into effect. To disapprove a rule, the House and the Senate must pass a joint resolution, which the president must sign like any other law.

In passing the latest resolutions, the Senate used the CRA in an entirely new way. It had never been used to rescind land management plans, which some might have claimed are not “rules” under the CRA’s definition. Yet there was no major fight about it on the Senate floor, unlike the battle earlier this year when the CRA was used against California’s ban on gas-powered cars to cancel EPA “waivers” that had allowed California to ban gas-powered cars. Normally, states cannot impose environmental regulations that are stricter than federal standards, except if EPA grants “waivers,” which the Biden EPA had done for California.

When the Senate passed CRA resolutions disapproving the EPA waivers, Democrats in Congress, environmental leaders, and others cried foul. Both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Senate parliamentarian entered the debate, saying EPA’s waivers were not technically “rules.” But ultimately the Senate makes its own rules, and the parliamentarian doesn’t have a vote. The resolutions were passed anyway and became law, effectively killing California electric vehicle mandates. This time, when rescinding the BLM management plans, the parliamentarian cleared the CRA resolutions without hesitation and they sailed through, and President Trump has already signed them into law.

That sends BLM back to the drawing board on three major plans. One was adopted by the Miles City, Montana Field Office, locking up virtually all of Montana’s coal deposits in the Powder River Basin, which contains nearly 30% of the entire nation’s coal supply. Second was the North Dakota Resource Management Plan, which walled off over four million acres of public land in North Dakota, prohibiting coal leasing on virtually all that state’s coal deposits, and stopping leasing on almost half of the available oil and gas acreage. Finally, the Central Yukon plan barred an LNG pipeline and other economic activity on over 13 million acres in Alaska, which already has 58 million acres of designated wilderness (and many other off-limits areas), more than all the other states combined. All three have now been disapproved by Congress.

Heads are turned and feathers are ruffled throughout the federal regulatory agencies, but in truth they ought to be getting used to Congress weighing in on such bureaucratic overreach. The CRA has been on the books for 30 years and has now been used by Congress to overrule regulatory agencies 35 times. The current Congress has enacted 15 CRA resolutions into law during 2025, the most ever. One such resolution was adopted during George W. Bush’s first term in 2001, overruling a Clinton-era ergonomic workplace regulation. But 16 CRA resolutions were enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017, three during Biden’s term, and so far, 15 in Trump’s second. It has been used by majorities of both parties and has become a useful tool for Congress because CRA resolutions require only simple majorities and are not subject to filibuster in the Senate.

CRA resolutions have overturned vastly unpopular Energy Department rules banning gas water heaters and restricting refrigerators and other appliances. The EPA has been overturned five times this year, and Congress has used the CRA to rein in the National Park Service, Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as the BLM.

Opponents claim this process undermines ordinary governmental procedures. But what is more “ordinary” than Congress making the rules?",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32d0574-1b24-11ec-a31e-77e4d5ecaec6.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-10-24 05:58:36.966121

In the UK, energy production is split between renewable sources like wind and solar, and fossil fuels such as coal and gas. However, the power output of renewable energy sources fluctuates based on weather conditions, directly affecting the carbon intensity of the electricity grid; less favourable weather means greater reliance on fossil fuels which increases carbon emissions.

This variability makes it crucial to understand when the grid is running on more renewables making it ‘more sustainable’, versus when it’s ‘less sustainable’ due to greater reliance on fossil fuels, to make informed energy choices.

Recognising this, the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) has developed a system to strategically schedule energy-intensive manufacturing tasks for periods when the grid’s carbon footprint is lowest – directly addressing the challenge of reducing the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂E) of manufacturing processes.

Tace Morgan, sustainability theme lead at the University of Sheffield AMRC, said: “A key challenge in improving manufacturing sustainability is reducing its carbon footprint. While using renewable energy offers a lower carbon intensity, its availability varies, making it an inconsistent source.

“Our research directly addresses this by leveraging the predictable link between carbon intensity and weather patterns. This allows us to intelligently schedule energy-intensive tasks for greener times, significantly lowering environmental impact without hindering productivity.”

The AMRC has also developed a web interface tool that showcases how manufacturers can utilise the technology to inform their scheduling decisions, providing a clear understanding of the trade-offs between production timelines and environmental impact.

With these promising initial findings, further research is needed to seamlessly integrate such a system into complex, real-world manufacturing environments and incorporate data from entire production facilities, where multiple factors influence schedules.

This groundbreaking work builds upon the AMRC’s previous research under Project Butterfly, which established the link between weather patterns and predictable energy carbon intensity. Funded by the national High Value Manufacturing Catapult network, of which the AMRC is a member, the current research further refines this concept, directly supporting the UK’s journey towards its net zero goals.

As part of the project, the AMRC developed a machine learning model capable of forecasting energy carbon intensity over 48 hours. Trained on historical weather data and additional insights such as the observed increase in renewable energy capacity and the periodicity of carbon intensity over days, weeks and annually, the model analyses publicly available weather forecast data alongside energy production trends to identify optimal times for running machinery with the lowest associated CO₂E emissions.

The effectiveness of this innovative approach has been validated through discrete event simulations (DES) using real-world manufacturing process data from AMRC North West. These simulations, which were applied to use cases involving melding, cutting and machining processes, compared traditional production schedules optimised for speed with those prioritising minimal carbon emissions.

Notably, one simulation demonstrated that accepting a modest increase in production time could lead to a significant reduction in overall emissions, specifically, a reduction of 4.74 kilograms of CO₂E was achieved by extending production time by just 2.8 hours – highlighting a tangible pathway to greener operations.

Dr Jon Hall, technical lead for connected factories at the University of Sheffield AMRC, said: “The model’s ability to accurately predict the maxima and minima in carbon intensity as a function of time is particularly valuable, as it helps identify the most and least sustainable periods for machine operation, and can also calculate the potential CO₂E reduction if sustainable scheduling was prioritised.

Canada put tariffs of as much as 25% on US-made cars and light trucks in April in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s levies on foreign vehicles. But Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government also carved out an exemption — known as “remission” — for automakers that make vehicles in Canada.

That exemption allowed auto companies to continue importing vehicles into Canada without paying tariffs, as long as they kept producing and investing in Canadian factories. But Stellantis will now see its quota of tariff-free vehicles slashed by 50% and GM will face a 24% reduction, according to a government official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.

It’s an escalation of tension between Carney’s government and the automakers, which have been altering their manufacturing plans in response to Trump’s tariffs and changes in demand for electric vehicles.

GM announced this week it’s permanently ending electric van production in the town of Ingersoll, Ontario, casting doubt over the future of that plant, which doesn’t make any other model. Last week, Stellantis halted plans to make the Jeep Compass SUV at a factory near Toronto, putting 3,000 direct jobs at risk. The fate of that facility is also unclear.

The moves angered Canadian officials in part because Canada helped fund the bailout and restructuring of GM and Chrysler — now part of Stellantis — when they were in financial distress during the global financial crisis. Governments in Canada have continued to provide financial aid to both GM and Stellantis as an incentive to retool factories and keep making cars in the nation.

The government’s move to shrink the tariff break for Stellantis and GM was reported earlier Thursday by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Both companies still have one operating assembly plant in southern Ontario, but most models they sell in Canada are imported — usually from the the US or Mexico. General Motors had 15.8% of the Canadian auto market in the first half of the year, making it the industry leader, the company said in July.

Canada is by far the largest export market for US-made new vehicles, buying about 629,000 last year, according to Commerce Department data.

General Motors didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Stellantis said the company was working on a response.

The numbers tell a powerful story: 32 million people have already gained access through World Bank supported programs, with another 157 million expected from approved and planned projects. Together, that gives line of sight to roughly 189 million of its 250 million-connection commitment under Mission 300 — a remarkable signal of progress and proof that large-scale delivery is possible when governments, development partners, and the private sector move in sync.

The Clock Is Ticking

But even with this acceleration, the challenge ahead remains steep. Many of us have been working in this space for a very long time, and we know what needs to be done, including crowding in more partners, more resources, more action, and even greater accountability among ourselves and our partner countries.

This new data shows us that despite significant progress, the WBG still needs to identify projects to bring electricity to an additional 61 million people to meet its 250-million-person pledge- a goal within reach.

We also need to track the African Development Bank’s progress against its commitment to bring electricity to 50 million people, which will bring us closer to 300 million.

Unleashing Energy for Development

Understanding what types of connections Mission 300 is delivering is also essential. Some will be basic solar home systems that light homes and charge phones, which is important. Others will be mini grid or grid connections that can also power appliances and tools that will help generate new jobs, boost productivity, and increase incomes.

Ultimately, Mission 300 is about unleashing the power of energy to change lives and grow economies. It’s no coincidence that the five African countries with the largest job gaps — Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda — are the same countries with the largest unelectrified populations. Mission 300 has transformational potential, and our design and metrics must drive towards this.

Every connection matters: power for jobs, health, schools, farmers, small businesses, and even data centers — everything needed to power a modern economy. This is what the fight against energy poverty is really about — economic growth and human dignity.

To meet our goal, electricity must reach an average of more than 4 million people each month between now and December 2030, which will not happen right away. We expect a sharp uptick in electrical connections by 2028, as projects approved in 2025 and 2026 come online. All told, the next five years will determine whether Africa closes the world’s largest energy-access gap — or risks leaving millions behind.

A Call to Accelerate

Mission 300’s first-year results show what’s possible. Now we must go faster. That means:

Expanding partnerships — especially with the private sector — to close the financing gap;

Scaling innovation in technology, finance, and delivery models; and

Increasing our partnerships — we need even more collaboration than what we have.

We are at an inflection point. New technologies, digital tools, and business models are making universal access both achievable and investable. We also need to keep working people up the energy ladder so that they have not only light in their homes but also productive levels of electricity to power jobs. The foundation is strong. The plan is working. The pathway is clear. But time is short — and complacency is the enemy of progress.

Mission 300’s success will depend on how quickly we move. The data is now clearer, along with the opportunity. The time to act is now, and The Rockefeller Foundation remains fully committed to ensuring Mission 300 delivers on its vision of energy as the foundation for inclusive, sustainable development — powering progress in health, education, gender equity, enterprise growth, and climate resilience.",https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Solar-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 10:19:49.367522

Energy Department offers $1.6 billion loan guarantee to upgrade transmission lines across Midwest

MATTHEW DALY

Associated Press

Published: October 24, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said recently it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

The announcement deepens the Trump administration's commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California's hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The finalized loan guarantee is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

""The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.""

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was ""not critical for the federal government to have a role"" in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated.

""Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,"" Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments ""rushed out the door"" in the waning days of former President Joe Biden's administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

""Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,"" he said, adding that he was ""happy to move forward"" with the transmission upgrade.

The terminal will be connected by the proposed CP Express natural gas pipeline, which will originate in Jasper County, Texas, traverse Newton County, Texas, and Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, before reaching the CP2 LNG terminal.
The DoE stated that President Trump had lifted the Biden administration’s restrictions on LNG exports and resumed pending applications for LNG export to non-FTA countries.
Under President Trump’s administration, the DoE has authorised more than 13.8bcf/d of LNG exports.
Currently, US LNG exports stand at approximately 15bcf/d, a 25% increase from 2024 levels, said the statement.","The US Department of Energy (DoE) has granted non-Free Trade Agreement (non-FTA) export authorisation for Venture Global’s CP2 LNG project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

This approval permits the export of up to 3.96 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US to non-FTA countries.

The decision follows the DoE’s conditional authorisation issued in March 2025. It aligns with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) approval in May 2025 for the facility’s siting, construction and operation.

The approval is also supported by the DoE’s recent response to comments on the 2024 LNG Export Study, which stated that LNG exports enhance the country’s energy leadership, create local job opportunities and ensure reliable energy access.

Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel said: “Venture Global is grateful for the Trump Administration’s final approval of CP2, a critical project that will supply American allies with low-cost LNG for decades, support thousands of jobs and greatly benefit the US balance of trade.

“The CP2 project construction is well under way, and we look forward to continue advancing the project safely and quickly to bring new LNG to the global market at a record pace, beginning in 2027.”

The CP2 LNG terminal is due to be built on an approximately 1,150-acre site adjacent to Venture Global’s existing Calcasieu Pass LNG plant.

This facility will be positioned on Monkey Island, between the Calcasieu Ship Channel and Calcasieu Pass.

The terminal will be connected by the proposed CP Express natural gas pipeline, which will originate in Jasper County, Texas, traverse Newton County, Texas, and Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, before reaching the CP2 LNG terminal.

The initiative is part of the UK’s mission to become a clean energy superpower, backed by record investment in renewables, nuclear, and carbon capture technologies.

The announcement includes the publication of the first national plan to train the next wave of clean energy workers, with employment in the sector expected to double to 860,000 across the UK by the end of the decade.

Wales will see a 15,000-job increase from 2023, with high demand for skilled trades such as electricians, plumbers, bricklayers, engineers, and metal workers. The largest clean energy employer in the region is expected to be in carbon capture and offshore wind.

Pembrokeshire will benefit directly from a £2.5 million skills pilot scheme, alongside Cheshire and Lincolnshire, to fund training centres, courses, and career advisers.

Clean energy jobs offer 23% higher entry-level pay compared to similar roles in other sectors. Average salaries in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks exceed £50,000, well above the UK average of £37,000.

The plan also includes:

Five new Technical Excellence Colleges

Tailored schemes for veterans, ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed

£20 million training support for oil and gas workers transitioning to clean energy

Expansion of the energy skills passport to nuclear and electricity grid sectors

Ed Miliband, Energy Secretary, commented:

“Wales is essential to the clean energy revolution that this government is delivering. Communities across Wales have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

The government is also reaffirming its support for trade unions as essential partners in securing high pay and good working conditions. Union coverage in the energy sector has dropped from 70% in the 1990s to 30% today, and the plan aims to reverse that trend.

With over £50 billion in private investment already secured since last July, the UK’s clean energy mission is driving a jobs boom across coastal and post-industrial communities.

Projects like the Hynet CCUS in North Wales and the Mona Offshore Wind Farm are expected to create thousands of jobs, offering long-term, well-paid careers for young people across Wales.

October 23, 2025 – The Environmental Finance Center Network (EFCN), led by the Southwest Environmental Finance Center (SWEFC) at the University of New Mexico, is proud to announce two new cooperative agreements awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These awards, totaling $17.74 million, will usher in a new wave of support for small, rural, and tribal communities working to improve their drinking water and wastewater systems across all 50 U.S. states and territories.

With this funding, the SWEFC, alongside the Environmental Finance Centers at Syracuse University (SU-EFC) and Wichita State University (EFC WSU), will lead a national partnership of university and non-profit organizations to deliver technical assistance, training, and capacity building. Together, the EFCN will work alongside hundreds of communities to secure funding, address regulatory requirements, and strengthen critical water infrastructure that protects public health and drives local economies.

Across the country, many small and rural communities continue to face serious challenges – from a rapidly retiring water workforce and chronic staffing shortages to a growing crisis of aging infrastructure, where pipe breaks and system failures are becoming more frequent and costly. These new awards will allow the EFCN to continue breaking down barriers by offering practical, tailored support that helps communities tackle these obstacles, build capacity, and move forward.

As part of this effort, Syracuse University will lead the launch of a new Rural and Tribal Outreach Bench. This initiative will make it easier to bring valuable resources and expertise directly to communities that are often hardest to reach. By building on-the-ground partnerships to provide targeted outreach, promote training opportunities, and connect local leaders with EFCN services, this approach will ensure that technical support reaches the places that need it most.

“Small drinking water and wastewater systems are the foundation of many rural communities across the U.S. They often rely on volunteers and lack the technical, managerial, and financial capabilities and resources needed to serve their customers reliably and sustainably.” said Heather Himmelberger, Director of the Southwest EFC. “We – the entire Environmental Finance Center Network team – are grateful for EPA’s continued trust in us and are excited to partner with small communities to build stronger, more viable, and compliant systems nationwide.”

“Rural communities across the United States urgently need to upgrade their wastewater and drinking water infrastructure, with the EPA estimating $625 billion in drinking water system needs and $630 billion in wastewater infrastructure needs over the next 20 years,” said Tess Clark, Assistant Director of the Syracuse University EFC. “Nearly half of public water systems serve communities of fewer than 500 people, and over 20% of U.S. households rely on septic systems – many of which are aging, undersized, or failing – posing serious risks to water quality and public health.”

“One-on-one work with small water and wastewater utilities is some of the most meaningful work we do. Our team regularly sees communities take long-awaited steps toward their planning, financial, compliance, or infrastructure goals after we spend dedicated time working with them on their unique challenges,” said Tonya Bronleewe, Director of the EFC at Wichita State University.

These awards build on more than 30 years of Environmental Finance Centers supporting communities nationwide, and over a decade of partnership through the Environmental Finance Center Network to help local governments and water systems across all 50 states and territories deliver clean, safe, and reliable water.

In addition to project leadership, this national partnership draws on the expertise of universities and nonprofit organizations across the country, including:

Environmental Finance Center at the University of Maryland

The Capacity Collaborative

Great Lakes Environmental Infrastructure Center at Michigan Technological University

Moonshot Missions

Mississippi State University Water Resource Research Institute

Environmental Finance Center at the University of North Carolina

Tennessee Water Resources Research Center at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville

Colorado State University

Morgan State University

As the nation continues to invest in infrastructure and rural economies, the EFCN remains committed to making sure that no community is left behind – no matter how small. For more information about the EFCN and its services, visit efcnetwork.org.

It also had 140,000 hosts who were renting out 340,000 vehicles across 1,600 vehicle makes and models.

Traditional rental giants like Hertz and Budget still offer monthly rentals, though it’s unclear how popular those programs actually are.
Instead of managing four $250 trips a month, a host can opt for one $1,000 monthly rental.","Owning a car in the U.S. can be a serious squeeze on your wallet—and that's only getting worse.

Monthly payments have been climbing, high interest rates have become the norm, and the average transaction price for new vehicles has continued to soar, with buyers taking longer-term loans to pay for them. With the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles now gone, battery-powered cars aren’t easing the pressure on the broader market either.

Car-sharing platform Turo thinks it has a solution for this growing affordability problem. It has introduced long-term rentals lasting up to a year.

The idea is simple: Customers can rent a car for a month, three months, or any period up to a year without any long-term commitments, down payments, depreciation worries, or maintenance costs. Since they’re renting, not owning, none of those hassles really apply.

“The traditional models of accessing a vehicle through financing or leasing are long-term commitments; it means that you are beholden to loan repayments, and maybe a credit check,” Tim Rossanis, Turo’s Senior Vice President, U.S., told InsideEVs in an interview. “What we're putting into the market is really focused on providing Americans with flexible access to vehicles.""

According to car research firm Edmunds, the number of buyers taking on monthly payments over $1,000 is hovering near record highs, making up nearly one-fifth of all new vehicle purchases. More than one in five car loans now stretch seven years or longer, with the average loan amount climbing to nearly $43,000 in the third quarter of 2025.

Turo said its long-term rentals will make driving more flexible for customers and provide steady revenue streams for owners renting their vehicles out. If customers rent for a month, the pricing is similar to your regular daily or weekend car rentals on platforms such as Hertz and Enterprise. They pay a sum up front, which includes the cost of renting the vehicle, plus Turo’s Standard insurance and taxes.

If customers rent for longer than one month, they pay in monthly installments. But they still retain the ability to make changes to their booking, like shortening or extending the rental. If owners have vehicles lying idle for long durations, renting them out makes sure the vehicle is running and they’re earning revenue from that.

Turo claims that at the end of last year, it had about 3.5 million active guests on its platform globally. It also had 140,000 hosts who were renting out 340,000 vehicles across 1,600 vehicle makes and models. Rossanis said internal research was already showing trends of longer-term rentals, with a growing share of younger customers, especially in the Gen Z and Millennials categories, looking for flexible options to rent vehicles.

The downside to Turo’s long-term rental program is ironically also the cost. Monthly payments can range from $600 to over $1,000, depending on the car and the region. That’s slightly higher than the average new-vehicle finance payment of $754 in the third quarter, according to Edmunds. And unlike a car loan, those payments don’t lead to ownership. The vehicle eventually has to go back.

In an extremely car-dependent America, that’s possibly a dealbreaker for many, unless you live in a big city like New York or Chicago, where public transit actually works. It can also be tricky to find a vehicle with unlimited mileage for the rental period, and costs can rise quickly if you go over the limit. In other words, you’ll need to predict your driving needs and plan accordingly.

But Turo isn’t the first to experiment with longer-term car rentals. Several automakers and rental companies have tried similar programs, often ending up with mixed results.

Cadillac launched a $1,800-per-month subscription service called Book by Cadillac, but shut it down in 2018, just two years after its introduction, due to back-end technology issues and high operating costs, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.

Similarly, the Access by BMW program, which started at around $2,000 a month, offered flexible access to luxury models but ended in 2021. The Care by Volvo program, which was also a low-commitment alternative to leasing, also ended in 2024.

Traditional rental giants like Hertz and Budget still offer monthly rentals, though it’s unclear how popular those programs actually are. The monthly rental costs swing wildly for these, from anywhere in the low $1,000 range to over $3,000 in some cases, depending on the vehicle and region.

Still, Rossanis believes Turo has an advantage. The company doesn’t need to raise massive amounts of capital or chase profitability from scratch. It already has a vast network of hosts, people who now have an incentive to rent out their cars with less hassle. Instead of managing four $250 trips a month, a host can opt for one $1,000 monthly rental. That also means fewer pickups and drop-offs (if customers choose delivery) and only one cleaning instead of four.

And unlike the failed subscription programs of the past, Turo’s pricing looks more competitive, if not exactly cheap. In the Jersey City ZIP code, for instance, a 2016 Hyundai Tucson rents for about $700 a month, including taxes and insurance. A 2024 Tesla Model Y or BMW X3 run closer to $1,000. Not exactly a steal, but still cheaper than the Cadillac and BMW subscription programs ever were.

“We encourage our hosts to list the car that they already have, the cars that are sitting idle 95% of the time,” Rossanis said. Putting those vehicles back onto the road benefits both sides, he said. Customers get access when they need a car for a longer duration, and owners earn extra income.

The goal isn’t to add more cars on the road, but to make the most of the ones already out there. “Our mission is to put the world's one and a half billion cars to better use,” he added.

Announced with fanfare in 2023, the project was expected to create 2,350 jobs. It was beset with controversy from the start and became an issue in the 2024 campaign for president because Gotion is a US subsidiary of the Chinese company Gotion High-Tech Inc.

The release of the letter comes after Gotion replied to the state on Oct. 15, saying it was “shocked” by the default and sought a six-month delay.

“It is even more surprising that the state of Michigan suggests that Gotion has ‘abandoned’ the project considering the immense challenges that Gotion has experienced in Michigan,” wrote the company’s attorney, Mark Heusel of Dickinson Wright, in the letter.

It is the second major project to die in the past few months in Michigan, following Sandisk’s decision in July not to build a $63 billion semiconductor plant in Genesee County.

The Gotion project was also one of the higher-profile beneficiaries of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature economic development program, the $2 billion Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve.

The Legislature defunded the program earlier this month.

Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said in a statement sent to Bridge she is disappointed Gotion “did not live up to its commitments” but Michigan must “double down to create better, more effective tools to attract and retain high-wage jobs.”

“The overall goal is and always has been to create good jobs that people want to come to and stay in Michigan for – jobs that anchor good neighborhoods and schools and communities – and that remains my objective,” she said.

Activists near Big Rapids opposed the project because of its size, potential impact on the environment and worries about its viability. They cheered the news of the project’s demise on Thursday.

“Thank you,” said Marjorie Steele, who founded the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance .

“It’s about damned time.”

Steele said residents felt railroaded by local officials who “colluded” with the state to finalize the project. Opposition was ignored, she said, as local officials and the state officials rubber-stamped the project.

“What the MEDC tried to pull here in Big Rapids was just so egregious,” Steele said.

Voters in Green Charter Township recalled township officials who supported the project in 2023, electing members who rescinded support for the project and prompting a lawsuit with Gotion.

The company’s attorney blamed the litigation for slowing the project. In the letter to the state, Heusel wrote that the opposition was “politically motivated” and “due solely to racist and ethnically charged stereotypes.”

Rep. Tom Kunse, R-Clare, said the project was ill-conceived and lacked transparency, despite the tax subsidies.

“This is yet another example of why corporate welfare doesn’t work. Taxpayer funded incentive deals often fail to deliver on promises, leaving our communities with broken commitments and wasted public dollars,” said Kunse, whose district includes the Gotion site.

The next step is unclear. Rich Studley, the former president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber, said he has “zero confidence” Michigan will recover the millions spent on the land or “or that they won’t do it again.”

“I’m not happy that we missed an opportunity to encourage job creation and economic growth in the Big Rapids area,” he added. “But, it is encouraging to see the (state) and Gotion held accountable.”

The Gotion announcement comes amid ongoing questions about the future of Michigan’s economic development programs, particularly SOAR.

The largest SOAR projects have received about $1 billion of $1.5 billion in promised state funding, but so far have yielded zero of the more than 13,000 jobs promised.

State officials have said hiring was a long-term goal, in many cases giving the companies awarded SOAR funds several years to reach their goals.

However, the projects also have experienced delays and other issues.

Ford Motor Co. shrunk its Marshall plans. Our Next Energy — which received approval of its $200 million SOAR award on the same day as Gotion — recently announced a downsizing in Van Buren Township. General Motors sold its new EV battery factory near Lansing to partner LG Energy Solution, which plans a different product there. Another Ford project was never finalized after it was announced.

Guest Columnist

Data centers are multiplying across the Midwest as fast as big tech companies are able to buy up land and convince local communities to let them build.

This proliferation has already led to a huge spike in energy costs that’s causing residential customers’ rates to skyrocket.

There are solutions, including battery storage and affordable, available clean energy, that could help mitigate the energy challenge if policymakers pave the way for self-generation and distributed generation.

Unfortunately, data centers are just as water-hungry as they are energy-hungry, but there’s no easy solution to that challenge, which should worry communities across the state.

These massive warehouses of servers depend on enormous amounts of water to stay cool, often hundreds of millions of gallons each year – as much water as a small city. Yet almost no one can tell you exactly how much water they use, how it is sourced, or what safeguards exist to protect communities.

Recent research found that 75 percent of city leaders and more than half of business executives in the United States expect water risks to outpace all other infrastructure threats, especially as the American manufacturing sector continues to see rapid growth.

Indiana sits above deep aquifers and is crisscrossed by rivers, but our seeming water abundance has bred a dangerous complacency that data centers are poised to exploit.

A new report from the Alliance for the Great Lakes underscores how precarious this really is. Groundwater makes up a significant portion of the region’s water budget, and approximately two thirds of all Hoosiers depend on groundwater for their drinking and household water.

That means families from South Bend to Evansville depend on clean, accessible groundwater for their homes, farms and businesses. More than half of the water used by data centers is what’s called “consumptive.” That means it evaporates and does not return to the watershed – once it’s gone, it’s gone.

What makes this even more concerning is the lack of transparency.

The Great Lakes report found that while nearly all data centers purchase water from municipal systems connected to groundwater, less than one-third track or publicly report their use. In Indiana, that means local leaders are offering tax breaks and incentives for data centers whose true water footprint is invisible to the public. Without oversight, it’s impossible to know whether a facility will strain the same aquifer that supplies drinking water to nearby residents or irrigation water to farmers.

The industry points to technological fixes, like cooling with recycled wastewater or reducing evaporation rates, but these are imperfect and unguaranteed solutions that have other associated costs like increased energy requirements or potential pollutants. The truth is simpler and starker: we can’t manufacture more water.

Aquifers don’t refill on command. Remove too much water too fast, and the consequences are irreversible. Communities will see dry wells, higher costs for ratepayers and residents left scrambling to secure what once seemed plentiful.

This is why Indiana needs to step back and demand transparency and accountability. Water impacts must be part of every incentive package and siting decision, and data centers should be required to disclose their consumption and demonstrate sustainable practices before a shovel hits the ground.

State regulators must have the authority to curb withdrawals when water levels are at risk, not just after damage is already done. And economic development should never prioritize speculative digital infrastructure over the basic human right to safe, affordable drinking water.

Our water is our life. It fuels our farms, sustains our families, and anchors many parts of our economy. But once it’s over-promised to industries that take without returning, it’s gone for good. Indiana can and should embrace growth and innovation, but not at the expense of a finite resource none of us can live without.",,N,,2025-10-24 03:57:28.530248
,Louisiana Environment,2025-10-24 07:10:01+00:00,Unfiltered with Kiran,Livingston: Resolution opposing Class VI carbon capture wells unanimously approved,Shannon Thornton,,,,,https://unfilteredwithkiran.com/livingston-resolution-opposing-class-vi-carbon-capture-wells-unanimously-approved/,"LIVINGSTON — With a packed house Thursday evening, the Livingston Parish Council unanimously approved a resolution to oppose the permitting and establishment of “Class VI” injection wells and pipelines in the parish.

The resolution will be brought to the governor, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, the EPA administrator, and all relevant state and federal legislatures.

Class VI injection wells are a specific type of well used for storing carbon dioxide long-term.

By passing the resolution, the council affirmed its overall opposition to the wells being used in the parish.

Parish District 8 Councilman Dean Coates, with Councilwoman Erin Sandefur and others, shaped the resolution that went before the parish council. The approved resolution, which Coates read to the council, states that the carbon capture and storage technology along with its infrastructure present many possible risks to the people and environment of Livingston Parish, “including seismicity and geological instability and long-term storage uncertainty of financial and liability risk.” In addition, the projects could have a negative impact on property values and future economic development.

At the meeting, more than 75 parish residents signed up to speak on the subject, but due to timing issues and a common opinion, most decided to defer their speaking time to others. Their concerns addressed these same risks and impacts from the resolution.

Bill Whittington, a Springfield resident and president of the Lake Maurepas Preservation Society, kept his comments short but firm: “We all know the hazards. We’ve been doing this for about three or four years. Y’all have all been to the meetings. Y’all know what it is. Y’all are representatives of the people. I’m going to go out and say there’s not one person in this room that wants this.”

Another resident, Chris Gaunthier spoke on the matter, saying he was missing his granddaughter’s volleyball game because of the lasting importance of the issue: “I served on city council when I was living in Oklahoma. Resolutions are good, quick fixes. We need an ordinance. We need a law after this…this is a good first step, but it’s weak. We need to stand strong and say, No, absolutely not.”

After the council voted to approve the resolution, Parish President Randy Delatte spoke on the issue, saying he has fought against carbon capture projects in the area and spoken to Gov. Jeff Landry on the concern, as well.

“If we let the governor do his job, I believe he will give us the tools where we can do these things. But preaching to us is like preaching to the choir,” Delatte said.

He added: “Work with the Governor as hard as we can to get the tools to where it takes a vote of the people, or the vote of local politicians to let (those projects) here. Our first primary concern, as one of the speakers got up here said, is the safety and welfare of our people. That’s the first primary concern.”

Concerns over a proposed carbon capture project

The resolution comes after Livingston Parish landowners received letters in September about a proposed carbon capture project, sparking concern among the community.

On Sept. 10, 1PointFive and Enbridge Inc. announced the formation of a joint venture to develop the Pelican Sequestration Hub and transportation infrastructure in Louisiana. 1PointFive is responsible for developing the facilities that will store carbon dioxide underground, and Enbridge will build and operate pipelines from customer facilities to this hub, according to a press release.

Coates met with an Enbridge company representative on Sept. 24, before holding a public meeting the same day. He invited company representatives to speak at the public meeting, but they declined, he told UWK.

Earlier in October, Coates said he’s talked with people all across Livingston Parish about the carbon capture sequestration projects and their potential effects.

“There’s a big contingency of people against this, and we just have to bond together to make a difference,” Coates said.

COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION The development of renewable energy projects is undergoing a period of profound reflection.
The debate concluded with a joint call to improve social acceptance of renewable energy, a task still pending.
Eduardo Medina (CEO, RES), Juan Otazu (Production Director, Acciona Energía), and Javier Amelivia (CEO Wind, Spie) will participate.","The 4th International Congress of the Industry for the Energy Transition, CITE25, organized by Enercluster with the special collaboration of the Government of Navarre, made Pamplona the European capital of renewable energy this Thursday. Players linked to this industry, totaling more than 400 guests, gathered at the Baluarte Congress Center and Auditorium of Navarre, where they shared the solutions and proposals they believe are necessary to increase their level of autonomy and competitiveness.

CITE25 was sponsored, on this occasion, by Acciona Energía, Nordex Group, and Inge team, as TERApartners; Grupo Enhol, Laulagun Bearings, Nabrawind, Repsol, and Sakana Group, as GIGApartners; along with ARENA, ARPA Abogados Consultores, Array, Industrial Barranquesa, Beeplanet, EDP Renewables, Elektra, EnergyLoop, EOSOL, IED, Grupo Inerzia, Leadernet, Renercycle, Ríos Renovables, Rose Holm, SIG, Sta tkraft, and Urgon as MEGApartners.

From then on, the long shadow of China loomed over Baluarte at all times, and discussions focused on what levers the European renewable energy industry should use to counter the growing influence of Asian players. Therefore, political unity was called for around the entire European value chain, from suppliers to developers. Also emphasized was the need to invest in local networks and infrastructure, facilitating and streamlining bureaucratic procedures as much as possible.

Thirdly, a call was made to boost reindustrialization through measures that go beyond subsidies and without falling into protectionism. All of this without forgetting the development of a communication exercise that helps the population share the benefits of the energy transition and decarbonization process.

GO ON THE OFFENSIVE

The Minister of Industry and Tourism, Jordi Hereu, opened his speech at CITE25 by congratulating the organizers for bringing together the protagonists of one of the most decisive processes for the economic and energy future of Europe: the industrial transition towards a sustainable model.

Sustainable. He emphasized that both Spain and the European Union must reaffirm their commitment to reindustrialization and the fight against climate change, two strategies he considered “inseparable” and which, he stated, are championed “here in Navarre, in Spain, and within the European Council.” For the minister, Navarre represents an example of a region that has managed to turn industry into its main source of progress, with increased exports, innovation, and social quality. In this regard, he praised its pioneering role in the development of wind energy, “one of the great competitive advantages of the Spanish economy,” and asserted that investing in renewables “not only saves the planet, but also opens the door to new industrial sectors and a virtuous cycle of growth.”

Hereu also championed strategic autonomy as an essential principle of European industrial and energy policy. He recalled that the sun, soil, and wind are European resources and, therefore, the foundation of a development model that is less dependent on external sources. “The defense of our freedoms and democracy requires a foundation of economic power,” he stated, linking industrial strength with Europe’s ability to maintain its influence and well-being. In this regard, he insisted that the renewable energy value chain must have greater European influence, but without falling into protectionism, instead supporting international cooperation and an energy policy that guarantees fair conditions for all.

In his final message, he conveyed to the companies in the sector the support of the Spanish government and its willingness to maintain a constructive dialogue to jointly address the challenges of the ecological transition and industrial competitiveness: “Our present and future are at stake. It’s time to go on the offensive in reindustrialization and the green transition.”

For her part, the President of Navarre, María Chivite, highlighted the role of the Autonomous Community as a European leader in renewable energy generation and in its commitment to a sustainable economic model. “Navarra is the land of the renewable energy industry,” she stated.

He recalled the “almost self-taught” origins of this industry and that his government will continue to promote public-private cooperation to consolidate this leadership. Chivite emphasized that this sector is part of Navarre’s “DNA” and that, along with the automotive industry, agri-food, and renewable energy, they are pillars of its competitiveness and well-being.

In her speech, the president also warned of the need to protect European industry from unfair competition and international trade tensions, calling for a “boost to localization” as a guarantee of the future of the value chain. Therefore, Chivi urged the European Union to act decisively to avoid losing its productive capacity and argued that the energy transition is not only viable but also a driver of competitiveness, as demonstrated by the growth of the Spanish economy. “Europe cannot be the museum of the world,” she said, urging the companies present to turn the congress into a space for alliances and solutions that strengthen the continent’s green industry.

Previously, and in the same vein, the European Commission’s Executive Vice-President for a Clean, Fair and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera, stressed that “competitiveness is green.” In a video message, Ribera argued that the energy transition is not only a climate issue, but also an economic issue, one of prosperity and

security for Europe. He cited Spain as an example, where the growth of wind and solar energy has reduced the influence of fossil fuels on electricity prices by 75% since 2019, placing the cost of electricity 32% below the European average. “Clean energy is synonymous with competitive prices and well-being,” he stated, insisting that the Clean Industrial Deal seeks to make clean technologies the pillar of European industrial strength.

Ribera warned, however, that Europe cannot be left behind in a global context where powers like China have invested more than €210 billion in clean technologies since 2022. In this regard, he called for accelerating energy integration and providing security to investors and innovators. He also announced new large-scale financial tools, such as a €409 billion Competitiveness Fund, a decarbonization bank with the capacity to mobilize €100 billion, and a European electricity interconnection package that will be launched by the end of the year. “The world is changing rapidly, but Europe has what it takes: innovation, unity, and vision,” Ribera concluded, calling for the clean transition to become the continent’s main competitive advantage.

CEOs of renewable energy companies defend “Made in the EU”

China, which by 2024 had more than half of the world’s installed wind power capacity, dominated the first panel of the day, making it clear that it is the greatest rival of European wind energy companies. “They are already taking away market share from us in regions like South America, Africa, and even Spain,” warned José Luis Blanco, CEO of Nordex Group.

Blanco admitted that the Asian giant is an “imminent threat,” warned of the “potential risk” that the majority of the energy generated is “controlled” by Chinese companies, and explained that this country’s superiority is due to four reasons: the “total support” of its government, which has developed a “national strategy to globally dominate” renewable energy; its technology; its demographics, which in unpopulated areas allow for the installation of larger facilities than those in Europe; and its innovative infrastructure network, which allows for the efficient transport of wind turbines.

To reverse this situation, the Nordex CEO advocated accelerating project licensing, investing in networks and infrastructure, focusing on European suppliers, and being independent throughout the entire value chain. “It’s pointless to have wind turbines on our land if we don’t develop the technology ourselves,” he emphasized.

Michael Larsen, CEO of SM Industries, argued that components should be manufactured in Europe and, along the same lines, urged companies to purchase from the old continent, even if they would save less and offer slightly more expensive energy. “Citizens must pay a few euros more for energy in exchange for preserving jobs and local industry. Only then will we grow again,” he added.

Torsten Tiefel, CEO of SIlbitz Group GmbH, pointed out that Europe’s strategy should not be to imitate the new Chinese wind turbines, which, due to their enormous size, are capable of generating up to 20 gigawatts. “We don’t have the appropriate infrastructure, and it would require a large investment. Furthermore, I believe these wind turbines will not significantly reduce energy prices,” argued Tiefel. According to the CEO of SIlbitz Group GmbH, European companies must “improve the reliability” of their wind turbines,

Better recycle the materials that make up these devices, reduce bureaucracy, and work with global regulations to compete on a level playing field.

Adolfo Rebollo, CEO of Ingeteam, also rejected increasing the capacity of European wind turbines to the level of those of Chinese companies because their transportation and the adaptation of infrastructure (tunnels, bridges, roads) would significantly increase energy prices and, consequently, lead to a loss of competitiveness. Like his fellow panelists, Rebollo advocated strengthening European industry, technology, and the supply chain. “We can’t buy from abroad; we have to protect ourselves. If there is local industry, value is created, wealth is generated, and it reverts to society,” he explained. Furthermore, to protect European companies from those from other continents, he requested that only local companies be able to benefit from public aid granted by public and national institutions.

REINFORCED AND COLLABORATIVE VALUE CHAIN

The subsequent roundtable discussion, moderated by Enercluster’s manager, Iker Chasco, focused on various international experiences in building a renewable energy value chain. The United States, India, and Brazil are some of the countries that have developed specific regulations to support local production and strengthen this chain in the face of, for example, Chinese exports.

The first to speak was Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers of America (SEMA). He began his remarks by mentioning that the organization had already recognized, even before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed in 2022, that it would be impossible to compete with China if the supply chains for materials used to build photovoltaic panels were “too concentrated” in the Asian giant. “Currently, thanks to this law, there is a record rise in energy demand in many states. A large number of data centers and component factories for photovoltaic plants and wind farms are being built in Michigan and Georgia,” he explained.

At the same time, he noted that the messages President Trump is sending about renewable energy “are contradictory.” “Finally, it appears that the Senate and Congress are not going to eliminate the subsidies proposed by the IRA and that Trump had announced. Instead, many industrially depressed areas will experience a boost in the short and medium term.”

“long-term,” Carr said. In his final speaking session, he emphasized the need for greater manufacturing capacity for photovoltaic panel components. “We can’t ignore the fact that solar energy is the cheapest and fastest way to obtain electricity,” he concluded.

The next speaker was Silvia Gavorníková, head of the Export Credits and Competition Division of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who took over from Carr to refer to the report published a few months ago by the OECD on public subsidies in the business environment. “The global steel market is distorted by extra-market forces, in which producers who do not benefit from subsidies cannot compete on a level playing field,” Gavorníková stated. Along these lines, she noted that the Chinese government has not yet begun requiring foreign companies to obtain special permits to export critical raw materials for the construction of photovoltaic panels or wind turbines, such as silicon, aluminum, steel, semiconductors, and so on.

“The data shows there is no level playing field. Our report indicates that the steel subsidy rate in China is five times higher than the average of other economies,” she stated. However, she emphasized that each government should apply subsidies based on its needs, “but they must be used to create a level playing field.” In closing, Gavorníková recommended that those present contact export agencies if they want to penetrate the international market. “If Europe stands united as one nation, we will be stronger,” she emphasized.

The third member of the panel was Ruben Davis, Head of Policy at Cleantech for Europe, who began his presentation by explaining where the need for European countries to build renewable energy value chains comes from. “At the industrial and political level, Europe has focused too much on innovation, leaving manufacturing behind, while China has managed to combine both aspects. We Europeans have top-level universities, research centers, and incubators, but we have neglected everything else,” he lamented. In this regard, he described the Asian giant’s value chain. “China has adopted a more comprehensive approach. It has created a local supply chain around its companies to control market access by attracting talent, providing training, and exploiting raw materials,” he noted.

The solution? Davis recommends a change of mentality at the European level. “Subsidies are not the only solution. We have to build a suitable trade environment. If we don’t create mechanisms to defend local trade and industry, we Europeans will always lose against China,” and advocates adopting a position similar to that of the United States, although he clarified that “the American pendulum has swung too far toward protectionism and isolationism.” “Europe must remain open and commit to reindustrialization,” he concluded.

COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION

The development of renewable energy projects is undergoing a period of profound reflection. This was highlighted by Arantza Ezpeleta, CEO of Acciona Energía; João Costeira, Executive Managing Director of Repsol Low Carbon Generation; and Rocío Sicre, General Manager of EDP Renováveis ​​Spain, during the CEO Developers panel at the International Congress of the Industry for the Energy Transition (CITE25). They agreed that the energy transition cannot be limited to “a race to install megawatts” but must be approached as a comprehensive transformation of the energy and production system.

The three executives acknowledged that 2025 is proving to be a challenging year, with more than 600 hours of zero or negative electricity prices and stagnant demand. “We are facing unbalanced generation, without grids that can absorb production, and with demand that is not growing,” warned Ezpeleta. According to the Acciona Energía director, “Spain is doing very well at decarbonizing supply, but we are failing at decarbonizing demand.” In her opinion, meeting the PNIEC targets will require electricity consumption to grow by 6% annually, which requires active electrification policies, more robust grids, and greater storage capacity.

For her part, Rocío Sicre considered the current imbalances to be “temporary, not structural,” but emphasized the urgent need to implement capacity mechanisms that restore value to the megawatt hour and enable the viability of new projects. “The demand is there and wants to be established, but it needs competitive prices and regulatory certainty ,” she explained. She also called for reducing the administrative bottlenecks that hinder new investments and warned of the need to “sophisticate markets” and avoid unpredictable quality that erodes companies’ margins.

Repsol’s João Costeira was more cautious: “We’ve had more supply than demand for years, and solutions aren’t short-term.” He championed investment in storage, networks, and digitalization, and insisted that “not all megawatt hours are equal: only the most efficient projects with the capacity to add value to the system will survive.” Costeira also warned of the risk of overcapacity and the need to adapt business models to an increasingly demanding market: “In the coming years, only the truly good projects will be built.”

Regarding regulatory matters, the three agreed on a review of the auction model to ensure that awarded projects are executed and do not become speculative exercises. Sicre argued that auctions should take into account “price indexation and realistic development times,” while Ezpeleta recalled that “they were a useful tool in the past, but they only work if they are well designed and adapted to each market.” Costeira was more blunt: “In Spain, there is no need for new onshore auctions; the objective should be to consolidate existing ones and strengthen the supply chain.”

Another focus of the conversation was the defense of European content in the renewable value chain. “We cannot continue decarbonizing at the expense of deindustrializing Europe,” Costeira warned. “The rules must reflect real costs; manufacturing a turbine here cannot be more expensive than importing it from China, without taking into account the taxes and the jobs it creates.” Along these lines, Ezpeleta called for a European incentive framework that supports the purchase of products manufactured in Europe.

The debate concluded with a joint call to improve social acceptance of renewable energy, a task still pending. “Twenty-five years ago there was ignorance, today there is opposition,” lamented Ezpeleta, who called for greater education and transparency in explaining the local benefits of the projects. Sicre agreed: “We develop in rural areas that need investment, but the opposition has become politicized and is resorting to legal proceedings with thousands of megawatts at a standstill.”

EUROPE AND ITS INDUSTRIAL SOVEREIGNTY

At the PV & Storage CEO panel, Christoph Podewils, Secretary General of the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), noted that Europe has lagged behind due to its “complicated” bureaucratic legislation that requires “too many requirements and conditions,” the new IRA regulation implemented by the United States that has attracted many companies to the North American country, and the power of Chinese batteries, which have greater “overcapacity.” Podewils said the key lies in changing mentalities and making consumers see that it is worth paying more money for higher-quality batteries. Along the same lines, he asserted that only 60% of modules manufactured in China meet their own specifications and, for example, are not resistant to hailstorms.

Marc Rechter, CEO of MCPV, advocated for the European Union to have its own legislation to make manufacturing in Europe “simple, fast, and clear .” Specifically, he advocated for European regulations requiring solar panel components to be manufactured in the old country, increasing European manufacturing capacity, and creating a favorable regulatory framework for investment. “We have to prevent money from going to China or the United States,” he asserted. Furthermore, Rechter indicated that Europe must change its mindset, streamline regulations, and “adjust the rules to the speed of change in the modern world.”

Laurent Bodin, Chief Commercial Officer of Holosolis, argued that fewer Chinese modules should be purchased and, like the other speakers, considered it vital that European laws require the manufacturing of modules and batteries to be carried out on the continent. “Modules cannot come from China. We have to buy in Europe and have everything in order.”

Made in Europe. We’re talking about our own freedom, sovereignty, and resilience,” he warned. According to Bodin, this is “Europe’s last chance,” which must create an industrial base capable of absorbing “new innovation,” reduce regulatory oversight, and accelerate procurement.

Finally, Hervé Amossé, EVP of Saft Energy Storage Solutions, explained that the company has been manufacturing its own lithium battery modules and cells for over a decade, but has been entering the Chinese market for the past five years. “During the pandemic, they took the lead because their batteries have much greater capacity,” he acknowledged. Amossé noted that Europe must “become stronger” in other areas, such as the development of software that regulates energy injection or absorption, grid connection, and battery maintenance.

AFTERNOON PROGRAMMING

In the afternoon, the program will transition to parallel sessions in two Baluarte rooms. The O&M Panel will be held in the Sala Cámara, where participants will discuss how new technologies—such as artificial intelligence, drones, and robots—can revolutionize operation and maintenance services, one of the fastest-growing and most profitable businesses. Eduardo Medina (CEO, RES), Juan Otazu (Production Director, Acciona Energía), and Javier Amelivia (CEO Wind, Spie) will participate. Elisa Manero, president of AEMER, will moderate the panel.

Simultaneously, in the Luneta Room, the Energy Storage Panel will take place. It will address questions about the viability of the Spanish market, lessons learned from other more mature markets, and the future beyond lithium batteries. Speakers will include Rodrigo Harstein (Head of Portfolio Management – ​​Battery Energy Storage Systems at Siemens Energy), Peer Piske (Managing Partner at Alantra), Susana Gómez (Head of Renewable Energy at Nexus), and Will Broad (Global Director of Policy and Market of Long Duration Storage at LDES Council), moderated by Eugenio Domínguez, Vice President of AEPIBAL.

Subsequently, the Green Hydrogen Panel will open again in the Chamber of Deputies, addressing the realistic expectations of this technology and its competitive applications.

Redwood's growing grid energy storage business aims to solve that.
Back in June, the startup unveiled Redwood Energy to help power the AI revolution by repurposing used batteries into energy storage systems.
""This energy business is a really exciting opportunity for them to go attack,"" Fath told Business Insider in an interview.
National priorities Redwood's two-pronged approach, critical materials and energy storage, positions it as both a new-age miner and power provider for the AI age.","Redwood Materials, the battery recycling startup run by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, just raised $350 million in a funding round that pushes its valuation past $6 billion.

The deal, led by Eclipse with participation from Nvidia's venture capital arm NVentures, supports Redwood's surprising new role powering the generative AI boom.

At first glance, a company known for reclaiming metals such as cobalt, nickel, and lithium might seem far removed from the realm of large language models and GPU clusters. But as AI data centers multiply across the US, power has become a defining bottleneck. Redwood's growing grid energy storage business aims to solve that.

Back in June, the startup unveiled Redwood Energy to help power the AI revolution by repurposing used batteries into energy storage systems. Its massive new battery installations store electricity at low cost, releasing it during high-demand periods to stabilize the grid and feed energy-hungry data centers.

Eclipse's Joe Fath, a former T. Rowe Price fund manager who backed Tesla early on, helped drive the latest funding round. Nvidia's involvement as a strategic investor is also notable as the chip giant seeks ways to keep the AI boom energized.

""This energy business is a really exciting opportunity for them to go attack,"" Fath told Business Insider in an interview. ""They have a unique opportunity to build out battery energy storage solutions and leverage all kinds of power generation, whether it be solar, wind, industrial gas turbines and ultimately nuclear, to power data centers that are off grid.""

Keeping the Fath

Straubel and other Redwood leaders initially pitched the energy business to Fath in August 2024 and the company went live with AI data center provider Crusoe this June, less than a year later.

""Time to market is extremely quick,"" Fath added. ""They have a very strong and proven ability to scale.""

Fath also likes how Redwood has evolved over time, with each new business getting better in terms of financial returns.

The startup's original business of recycling EV batteries, which started back in 2017, was a ""wedge,"" Fath said. A more recent move to manufacture Cathode Active Material is promising but takes big upfront investment that will take time to recoup. In contrast, Redwood's energy installations start generating revenue quicker, Fath said.

He expects Redwood to add solutions in the future that help customers manage energy production and storage together more efficiently.

National priorities

Redwood's two-pronged approach, critical materials and energy storage, positions it as both a new-age miner and power provider for the AI age. By recycling key minerals domestically and integrating them into advanced battery systems, Straubel's company is tackling two national challenges at once: energy security and technological competitiveness.

""We need to have energy independence and protect sovereignty in the US,"" Fath said. ""So it plays into their strengths.""

The timing is critical. With foreign supply chains tightening and renewable generation still intermittent, Redwood's US-made storage systems could help unlock stranded grid capacity and enable faster AI deployment. The company's systems, designed with sophisticated power electronics and software, aim to complement natural gas and future nuclear plants, boosting efficiency and reliability.

Armed with fresh capital, Redwood said it plans to expand its refining, materials production, and storage deployments while recruiting engineers to ""shape the next era of American energy leadership and critical minerals independence.""",https://i.insider.com/68f9305f0be9845f2dc4e8a8?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 05:58:27.872466

YCC: Are farm animals necessary to regenerative agriculture?
YCC: What are the advantages, in terms of biodiversity and climate adaptation and mitigation, in letting nature into a farm?","Kelsey Timmerman grew up in farm country. He has witnessed firsthand the damage that modern industrial agriculture can inflict. In the process of writing his bestselling “Where Am I” trilogy –“Where Am I Wearing,” “Where Am I Eating,” “Where Am I Giving” – Timmerman traveled the world and, in the process, began to see how agricultural practices affect natural ecosystems, human communities, and the climate.

In his new book, “Regenerating Earth,” Timmerman explores this topic with equal breadth – he travels the world again, but in greater depth. Yale Climate Connections interviewed Timmerman via Zoom at the homestead he farms with his family outside Muncie, Indiana, where he teaches at Ball State University.

This interview is the second in a series on new and recent books about climate change and agriculture. Our interview with Michael Grunwald, author of “We Are Eating the Earth,” is here. We’ll publish an interview with Mark Easter, author of “The Blue Plate: A Food Lover’s Guide to Climate Chaos,” later this month.

This interview has been edited and condensed.

Yale Climate Connections: You begin and end your book in Indiana, where you live. Why did you feel that you needed to speak as a Midwesterner in telling these stories?

Kelsey Timmerman: Although it looks like a jungle behind me, [he gestures to the window] my land is surrounded by corn and soybeans, so I’m surrounded by industrial agriculture. I’ve seen the decimation that is happening in and around me. I have family and friends who feel like they are being exploited by this system. Then, when I heard about regenerative agriculture, I wondered what that could mean for my community, for me.

Writing the book was a personal journey. I wanted to show how it changed my life and the place where I live. I wanted to tell the story as a rural citizen living on Earth today.

YCC: Early in your introduction, you give a gloss for industrial agriculture. You say “corporations farm farmers.” What do you mean by that?

Timmerman: That came from a guy who lives just down the road from me. He’s a conventional soybean and corn farmer. What he means is that the folks making money are the giant agrochemical conglomerates who are supplying the seed and who are writing the prescriptions for how much of their [fertilizers and pesticides] to spray on the fields. The costs for these things keep going up, but what farmers are being paid per bushel is not. So many farmers wonder if their farm will even be there for their kids.

YCC: You make a contrast between monocropping and multicropping or diversity. And you repeat the key point of that contrast in almost every chapter of your book: If you’re raising a whole lot of something like corn or soybeans or cows or pigs – and only that thing – then you need a whole lot of chemical support. And that chemical support is dangerous not just to farmers, but to the people who live around them.

Timmerman: I’ve been to too many funerals of farmers in their 50s and early 60s who have died of cancer, and the family wonders if it was the time that dad got doused in this or that chemical that caused it.

One of the things I wanted to get at with this book was how much industrial agriculture is being exported around the world.

To be in the Amazon and see a farm that looks like my neighbor’s farm – John Deere tractor, grain bins, and corn – you think it’s Indiana. One of the most ecologically diverse places on our planet, and we’ve turned it into a monocrop of corn or soybeans. Same goes for Hawaii. Same goes for Kenya. I saw that again and again and again.

But in the face of this degeneration, I meet people who believe in regeneration, who believe that they can do something different in their communities to make a difference. And that, for me, makes this a hopeful book, because if a woman restoring a small farm in Kenya can have hope, how can the rest of us not?

YCC: Let me just give a quick rundown of the places you include in your book. In the United States, you talk about Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, North Carolina, Indiana, and Hawaii. Outside the U.S., you visit Brazil, Colombia, and Kenya.

So at the end of your book, to follow this point to its conclusion, you list seven practices that unite the farmers that you profiled over its course. At the top is promoting diversity. So why is it so important to multi-crop as opposed to monocrop?

Timmerman: My neighbor does relay cropping. He plants wheat in the winter, which grows up in the spring; then he plants soybeans down into that. With just this diversity of two, he’s using less fertilizer and fewer chemicals.

But also really critical is biodiversity. A pest is only a pest if the predator is not nearby. If you have diversity, chances are that in a natural system, the predator of that pest is also attracted to that area.

Cultural diversity is really important as well. I know that in certain circles, we’re not even supposed to say “diversity” anymore. But we have big challenges ahead of us. And who’s to say what culture or what plant or what practice will really help us in a changing climate.

YCC: When you describe farms that are growing five, six, seven different kinds of crops that are all laced together into an ecosystem, those were, I thought, really fascinating chapters. One was in the Amazon, which was an agroforestry model. But you describe something similar in Wisconsin.

Timmerman: Yeah, Mark Shepard in Wisconsin had a big perennial food forest.

YCC: Right, to the point that you often couldn’t tell that you were looking at a farm.

Timmerman: Mark Shepard’s 100-acre farm is a great example of a highly productive system. From the overstory to the understory, the underbrush, and then the rows of vegetables, you are getting calories every step of the way.

Mark’s done the math, and he’s more productive per acre than a field of corn, which is saying a lot because corn produces a lot of dense, very dense calories. His farm is successful economically. He makes a living. But every farm is different. Mark’s is very close to Organic Valley, one of the largest buyers of organic produce in the nation. He also does consulting to build systems like that.

But there’s another factor that doesn’t get talked about enough: It can be very efficient to grow a monocrop, but not very resilient when it comes to a pest or when the system breaks down.

YCC: Are farm animals necessary to regenerative agriculture?

Timmerman: I think it depends on the context. For our family to live regeneratively, it sure is nice having chickens that eat scraps. And they have bedding that is great in our compost pile, which later goes to the garden, which then feeds us. In the springtime, we can put the chickens out and let them turn over the soil. There’s so many good things about having chickens where we live.

There are also benefits to having animals in certain places in the arid regions. In Kenya, some lands have been turned around by reintroducing cattle and bunching and herding them.

So, yes, animals can have a positive impact. In my Environmental 101 class in college, we talked about animals being the cause of desertification. But now there are places and people that show that animals can actually help bring that land back, too.

YCC: What are the advantages, in terms of biodiversity and climate adaptation and mitigation, in letting nature into a farm?

Timmerman: When you let nature in, the land is able to hold more water and to hang on to its soil. And then other life is attracted to the environment you’ve created.

We’ve let some of our land go wild. We rotated the sheep around and saw the trees pop up. There were no squirrels when we first got here; now there are. And the fields are now humming with insect life out here. We’ve got a ton of milkweed growing. We’re now this little oasis for the monarchs. Other people in the area are doing the same, and we’re seeing a greater diversity of birds.

I met people who have been on their land for 40, 50 years; they’ve seen things change and turn around. We live at a time when many humans lack meaning and purpose, and we face a future where we might even be more alone. Getting outside and getting your hands in the soil is good.

YCC: Another point that several of your farmers make is that you have to listen to what the land needs, and you have to figure out the very specific formula for turning the land around. And that seems to make this model more exportable than the industrial model when we’re talking about Africa, Asia, Latin America.

Timmerman: Other than that, the industrial model has a lot more money behind it. There’s a lot of money to be made by selling seeds and fertilizers and pesticides into other countries. But in Kenya, the farmers discovered that the seeds they were sold wouldn’t grow; then they couldn’t buy additional seeds, and they couldn’t afford to buy the fertilizers. Whereas working with cattle, they were able to regenerate the land.

Growing a single monocrop like corn on degraded land is really tough for subsistence farmers in Kenya. And it’s not all that effective in helping people eat more calories or get out of poverty.

YCC: So would you say, then, that regenerative agriculture is the solution to living on a climate-changing planet with 10 billion people, or that it’s a necessary part of the solution?

Timmerman: I would not say it’s the whole solution. I know some reports suggest that we can completely sequester all the carbon that humans produce in the soil. That’s not going to happen. But the holistic practices of being part of a place, noticing change, and getting to know what works, those could be really critical for our future, whether it’s farming on a small scale on your own homestead, or it’s on a larger level where you’re a regenerative farmer who’s feeding other people.

YCC: Are you familiar with “We Are Eating the Earth” by Michael Grunwald and his skepticism about regenerative agriculture?

Timmerman: Yes.

YCC: What do you think Grunwald gets right about regenerative agriculture? What do you think he gets wrong?

Timmerman: There are probably three ethanol plants less than a 30-minute drive from my house. So I appreciate Searchinger [Grunwald’s number-crunching adviser] showing that biofuels aren’t the magic bullet people thought they would be, that they’re a waste of land that could actually produce food for humans.

I also agree with him that this idea of sequestering so much carbon constitutes a sort of tunnel vision. I myself suffered from carbon tunnel vision for a while. That’s not a magic bullet either.

YCC: What does he get wrong?

Timmerman: Well, I never really understood what his definition of regenerative agriculture was, and that’s a challenge because there are many different definitions of regenerative agriculture out there. His book, I think, is very focused on yields and overlooks other benefits of regenerative agriculture, like biodiversity and keeping soil on the land. He says land is not infinite; well, neither is soil. And it is washing down our rivers at an alarming rate. He talks about land use a lot; I think land used up is a problem, too.

YCC: I loved the opening title to the first chapter of yours, “Plant the World You Want to Live In.” What message would you like readers to take away from your book? From this interview?

Timmerman: The culture practitioners in Hawaii ask the younger kids, “What river do you belong to?” I would love if my neighbors, other farmers, and anyone who reads my book asked themselves, “How can we be part of the places that we live and be protectors of those places?” Even though we’ve done so much wrong, we should believe that humans can be a force for good, working with and within the cycles of nature to heal the planet and to heal ourselves a little bit as well. If people on the front lines of this fight against degeneration can still look towards the future with hope, how can we not?",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251022-regenerative-agriculture-climate-change.jpg?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-24 04:58:47.622970
